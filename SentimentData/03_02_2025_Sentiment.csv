The move targets improving scalability, reducing latency, enhancing security, and ensuring cost efficiency. This development will ultimately advance Theta’s AI processing capabilities. A Strategic Fusion between AI and Blockchain With this integration, Theta has better infrastructure to grow its AI training and computational demands. According to experts’ opinions, integration is vital for the broader AI and blockchain space. AI developers can rely on EdgeCloud’s decentralized platform to train their AI models. This is crucial given the volume of data required to train AI and guarantee the optimum performance of the project. Additionally, EdgeCloud integration helps provide a bridge between AI and decentralized infrastructure. Another critical advantage is that blockchain technology provides enhanced security for AI processes while ensuring data integrity. This suggests that Theta is investing in the future growth of AI via decentralized computing. This development places Theta in a key role as the AI blockchain revolution gains momentum. Analysts maintain that if properly harnessed, Theta might emerge as a leader in the convergence of AI and blockchain. DeepSeek-R1’s Market Disruption For context, DeepSeek-R1 is an AI model designed to provide cost-efficient scalable AI processing. The groundbreaking technology China’s AI lab DeepSeek developed disrupted the broader financial market. DeepSeek massively impacted the crypto market as total capitalization dipped by a significant 6.4% . This disruption came from the now controversial claim that the DeepSeek R1 was built on a lean budget of $6 million. Experts maintain that DeepSeek has opened a new chapter in AI modeling history despite the controversial claim. They believe developers would evolve more cost-effective ways of training models and building AI technology. Fraudulent DeepSeek Tokens Emerge In the crypto space, fraudsters took advantage of the hype around DeepSeek to launch scam tokens. BlockAid, a cyber-security firm, identified at least 75 scam tokens that claimed association with DeepSeek . These malicious actors even faked the company’s official website with plans to dispossess users of their funds. This development prompted DeepSeek to issue a critical warning to alert users. With the recent development of Theta, many are keenly observing how this will impact the broader ecosystem.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. IntelMarkets, a new altcoin at $0.08, could overtake DOGE with its massive growth potential. Table of Contents Dogecoin’s price forecast IntelMarkets: Why this AI giant is set for growth Conclusion While Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been a favorite among crypto traders due to its strong community and social media hype, its growth potential appears to be slowing. As the market shifts focus, projects with real-world utility are taking the lead. One such altcoin at $0.08 is dominating charts with projections of a massive price increase. Dogecoin’s price forecast Since its launch, Dogecoin has come a long way and positioned itself as a top crypto, currently ranking at number 8. Dogecoin was propelled into the mainstream during the 2021 crypto boom, partly thanks to endorsements from Elon Musk and a surge in retail interest. In this span, Dogecoin’s price reached its all-time high of $0.7376 in May 2021. However, up until November, the Dogecoin price had lacked momentum. In the days following the election results, Dogecoin’s price saw a 200% increase thanks to Elon Musk’s announcement of heading the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). After this news, DOGE seemed to have entered a stagnant period. Some experts suggest that DOGE could see incremental gains, reaching $0.80–$1 by 2026, driven by potential mainstream adoption and continued influencer endorsements. However, the coin’s lack of significant technological upgrades or utility-driven catalysts could limit its upside potential.

Launched in August 2024, IntelMarkets aims to revolutionize the crypto trading market by integrating artificial intelligence into every aspect of trading. INTL’s unique self-learning trading bots will analyze vast amounts of data, identify profitable opportunities, and execute trades with remarkable speed and efficiency, offering retail traders an edge previously reserved for institutional investors. Unlike DOGE, which is already widely adopted, IntelMarkets is still in its early stages. Furthermore, IntelMarkets’ dual-chain architecture, which operates on both the Solana and Ethereum blockchains, ensures scalability and interoperability, positioning INTL as a strong contender. Currently, the presale has raised more than $7.9 million, which is a sign of the amount of confidence and momentum it has created. In its ninth stage, INTL’s tokens are priced at $0.082, making them appealing to early backers. With some analysts predicting a 10x increase by 2026, INTL comes out as a must-watch altcoin this year. Conclusion Dogecoin’s growth potential appears to be slowing. In contrast, IntelMarkets is an emerging force with real-world applications, AI-driven innovation, and a clear vision for the future of trading.

This lending platform offers features like secure borrowing and supplying of crypto assets, aiming to make DeFi more accessible and efficient. With its presale underway and a clear plan for future growth, many are wondering if Mutuum Finance could become a top player in the DeFi market. Mutuum Finance: A New DeFi Lending Protocol Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending protocol that allows users to supply or borrow crypto assets securely. Built with a focus on flexibility and transparency, the platform provides efficient tools for managing crypto assets while ensuring a user-friendly experience. The protocol features two main markets: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C market, automated smart contracts securely handle transactions, providing an efficient way to supply or borrow assets. The P2P market, in contrast, facilitates direct user-to-user interactions, allowing personalized agreements while maintaining security through the platform’s audited smart contracts. Additionally, the P2P market ensures the protocol remains as safe as possible by preventing interactions or the inclusion of coins that fail to meet high-security standards, such as centralized tokens, exploit-prone tokens, or tokens without minting limits. The Mutuum Finance team plans to implement a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), enabling community-driven governance. With the DAO in place, token holders will have a say in key decisions, such as platform updates and future developments. This approach promotes transparency and ensures that the project evolves in line with the community’s interests. To enhance the platform’s ecosystem, the team is also developing a fully collateralized stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. This stablecoin will provide users with a stable and reliable medium for transactions, further strengthening the platform’s utility and trustworthiness. For suppliers, investing in liquidity pools can generate passive income. For example, a $10,000 USDT contribution at a 7% APY could yield $700 annually, depending on demand. Borrowers can use assets like ETH as collateral to access funds without selling their holdings, providing financial flexibility. Mutuum Finance is currently in its first presale stage, offering tokens at their lowest price of $0.01. This initial stage provides investors with a unique chance to secure tokens before the price increases in subsequent stages. With a launch price set at $0.06, early investors stand to see a 1700% return on their investments by the token’s release. This attractive entry point is generating significant demand, creating a sense of urgency among investors eager to capitalize on this promising opportunity. Crypto experts anticipate that the first presale stage will sell out quickly due to the low entry price, creating strong demand among investors. Adding to the momentum, the team plans to launch a beta version of the platform at the same time as the token’s release. This strategic move is expected to increase demand for MUTM and drive up its price post-launch, making now an opportune time to invest. Mutuum Finance has announced an exciting $100,000 giveaway aimed at rewarding its early supporters and fostering community engagement. The total prize pool will be divided among 10 winners, with each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. To participate, users need to follow simple steps outlined on the official Mutuum Finance website, such as engaging with the project’s social media channels and completing specific tasks. Mutuum Finance is quickly gaining recognition as a promising new player in the DeFi market. With its focus on secure and flexible lending through P2C and P2P markets, along with plans for a DAO and a fully collateralized stablecoin, the platform is well-positioned for sustainable growth. The ongoing presale offers early investors an opportunity to secure substantial returns, with a projected 2700% increase by launch. With features and strategic plans, Mutuum Finance could be a significant contender in the DeFi space by 2025.

Ripple’s XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE), two established names in the cryptocurrency arena, are currently experiencing downturns, prompting investors to rethink their future viability. On the other hand, Web3Bay (3BAY) , a burgeoning crypto project, is maintaining a strong upward trajectory and capturing attention as a potential market leader. Could this be the next big crypto to explode? Let’s delve into why Web3Bay is capturing investor interest. XRP Faces Market Slowdown Ripple’s XRP, traditionally seen as a frontrunner in the cryptocurrency sphere for its role in facilitating international payments, is currently hampered by ongoing litigation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This legal contention has cast a shadow over its growth prospects, placing investors in a state of uncertainty. Despite some legal victories, the continuing dispute has cast doubts on XRP’s regulatory standing. New competing blockchain solutions for global transactions have also surfaced, vying for XRP’s market position. Consequently, XRP has found it challenging to overcome key resistance levels in its pricing, presenting it as a precarious option for investors seeking notable returns in the short term. Dogecoin’s Decline: From Excitement to Uncertainty Dogecoin, the pioneering meme coin, gained massive attention during its explosive growth in 2021, driven by social media fervor and endorsements from celebrities like Elon Musk. Yet, as the market shifts towards projects with practical applications, Dogecoin’s absence of functionality has become more evident. In contrast to other advanced cryptocurrencies that provide real-world uses, Dogecoin remains largely driven by speculative interest. The diminishing enthusiasm for meme coins and the absence of substantial tech advancements have caused DOGE to struggle in reclaiming its peak levels. Although it retains a dedicated user base, Dogecoin’s prospects for sustained growth seem constrained, especially when compared to rising projects like Web3Bay. Web3Bay’s Rise: Transforming Decentralized E-Commerce Unlike XRP and DOGE, which have been facing challenges, Web3Bay is consistently building momentum. As a decentralized e-commerce platform, Web3Bay utilizes blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and user-focused marketplace, challenging established giants like Amazon and eBay. Web3Bay removes middlemen, allowing buyers and sellers to connect directly. Transactions use the platform’s own 3BAY token and are secured by blockchain-enabled smart contracts. Web3Bay also offers dual payment options, accommodating both cryptocurrency and conventional methods like PayPal, broadening its appeal to both crypto enthusiasts and the general market. The success of Web3Bay’s presale, having raised $1 million so far, underscores the platform’s potential to revolutionize the trillion-dollar e-commerce sector. The attractive presale price of the token has further boosted its popularity. Currently priced at $0.004562 during the presale, the 3BAY token presents an incredible chance for early investors. Projected to launch at $0.1959, investors could see a 4,193% return on investment at launch. If the token hits $0.50 in the future, a $1,000 investment now could potentially surge to $10,960, showcasing its potential as the next crypto to explode. Wrapping Up: The Next Crypto to Explode The cryptocurrency landscape is ever-changing, with new entrants frequently challenging established cryptocurrencies. As XRP and DOGE struggle, Web3Bay is emerging as a formidable candidate for the title of the next crypto to explode. Web3Bay’s novel take on decentralized e-commerce, coupled with its successful crypto presale and significant growth potential, positions it as one of the most promising new projects. With $1 million already raised and a potential ROI exceeding 4,000%, this is a prime opportunity for early backers to invest in a project with high potential. The real question isn’t if Web3Bay will succeed, but rather how extensive its impact will be. As the platform progresses, now could be an optimal time to consider this potentially lucrative investment. Are you prepared to be part of the Web3Bay movement?

Simultaneously, excitement is mounting over a potential Shiba Inu partnership, with lead developer Shytoshi Kusama suggesting a significant collaboration that could transform Shibarium’s future. The standout opportunity now lies with BlockDAG’s enhanced Affiliate Program. Offering a quick 5% USDT cashback, this initiative immediately benefits both referrers and buyers, standing out as one of the most advantageous programs in the cryptocurrency market. With BDAG coin’s value skyrocketing by 2380%, ongoing presale batches continue to push prices upward, amplifying the value of early engagement. As demand grows, BlockDAG (BDAG) is reinforcing its reputation as a top crypto asset. Challenges for Toncoin as Burn Rates Decrease & Inflation Increases Toncoin price has fallen to $4.80, a notable 33% drop from its highest value last November. This decline coincides with an increase in exchange inflows, as over 240,000 TON tokens have been moved to exchanges this past week. Moreover, the burn rate has significantly decreased, with just 5,805 coins eliminated from circulation on January 28, down from 15,000 earlier in the month. Meanwhile, inflation has reached 0.37%, marking the highest level in almost six months. With technical indicators suggesting further downturns, there is a concern that Toncoin price might decrease to $3.78, a critical Fibonacci retracement level, indicating a possible 22% reduction. Potential Broad Impact from Shiba Inu Partnership Shytoshi Kusama has teased a Shiba Inu partnership that could substantially alter the Shibarium ecosystem. While specifics are still undisclosed, Kusama has confirmed that this arrangement would affect major projects including SHIB, LEASH, TREAT, and BONE. Following Shiba Inu’s recent collaboration with Astra Nova, focusing on Web3 gaming and AI integration, there has been a notable increase in SHIB’s value by 3.2% and heightened activity from large holders. As anticipation for the Shiba Inu partnership grows, the community eagerly awaits more information on how this strategic move will impact Shibarium and the broader cryptocurrency market. Earn 5% USDT Instantly with Every BlockDAG Referral BlockDAG’s refreshed Affiliate Program now offers an immediate 5% USDT cashback, benefiting both referrers and buyers right away. Take this scenario: if an individual purchases $50,000 in BDAG coins, both the person who referred them and the buyer themselves receive $2,500 USDT immediately. This swift reward system is designed to attract those seeking simple earnings while participating in a burgeoning ecosystem. The process to start earning USDT instantly is straightforward, opening it up to everyone, everywhere. Users simply need to sign into the BlockDAG Dashboard, create a referral link, and share it within their networks and the broader crypto community. Every purchase made through these links triggers an automatic 5% cashback in USDT (BEP-20) for both parties involved, with no paperwork, no delays, and no complex processes. The program is crafted to be simple and inclusive, allowing participation without needing deep technical skills or previous experience in cryptocurrencies. Referrers enjoy an immediate 5% in USDT, while buyers gain not only the same cashback but also the potential for significant future returns by acquiring one of the top crypto assets. BlockDAG has seen its value soar by 2380%, from $0.001 to $0.0248 across 27 presale stages, selling over 18.3 billion BDAG coins and raising $191.5 million—and the total is still rising. As each presale stage progresses, the price of BDAG climbs, rewarding early participants more significantly. With increasing demand, BDAG’s rise in the market is a clear indicator of strong interest, securing its place as a top crypto asset. The Bottom Line Toncoin price is currently under stress due to decreased burn rates and increasing inflation, which may lead to further declines. While the Shiba Inu partnership is causing a buzz, the full extent of its impact is yet to be revealed. In the meantime, BlockDAG offers substantial opportunities for all. The program’s instant 5% USDT cashback for referrals and purchases simplifies the process of earning USDT, highlighting BDAG’s remarkable growth of 2380%. As prices increase with each crypto presale phase, hesitating could mean missing out on higher potential earnings. The Affiliate Program is a limited-time opportunity, making now an ideal moment to earn additional USDT while securing a stake in one of the top crypto assets available.

Will XRP price stage an early rebound as US Canada trade war flares. XRP Price Stabilizes Above $2.60 as Trump Tariff War Triggers Risk-Off Sentiment Ripple (XRP) has been on a downtrend for the past three days, with multiple bearish catalysts, including escalating trade tensions between the US and Canada. On February 2, XRP fell as low as $2.60, marking a 17% decline from its opening price of $3.10 on January 29. The recent market turmoil was triggered by the announcement of new tariffs, as former President Donald Trump accused Canada of unfair trade practices and imposed new restrictions on key exports. In response, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced retaliatory measures, igniting fears of a prolonged economic standoff. The geopolitical uncertainty has sent shockwaves through global markets. Key US Stock indices tumbled, while the crypto market followed suit, with Bitcoin (BTC) plunging to $96,000 . Meanwhile, gold gained traction as investors fled to safe-haven assets, highlighting the classic risk-off sentiment seen during times of geopolitical instability. Ripple (XRP) Price Action, Feb 2, 2025 | Source: Coingecko Despite the losses, Ripple price action showed relative resilience compared to other mega-cap altcoins. While XRP posted a 10% daily drop, some of last week’s top gainers like SUI and Polkadot suffered even steeper declines, exceeding 15% in the same period. This performance suggests that XRP might attract strategic buyers looking to enter the market at a discount amid the uncertainty. 490 Million XRP Transferred from Binance, Hinting at Resilient Long-Term Outlook on ETFs While XRP’s price has been under pressure, on-chain data points to a potentially bullish underlying trend. A significant metric to assess investor sentiment is the total XRP reserves on Binance. CryptoQuant’s data reveals that XRP deposits on Binance have dropped to a 40-day low, decreasing from 3.04 billion XRP on January 16 to 2.55 billion XRP as of February 2. This means 490 million XRP coins have exited Binance in just over two weeks. This decline in exchange reserves suggests that long-term investors and whales are accumulating XRP and moving their holdings into cold storage. Binance processes over 40% of the global retail crypto market, making this metric particularly relevant in gauging investor sentiment. Ripple (XRP) Price vs. Exchange Reserves (Binance) | Source: CryptoQuant Another interpretation of this trend is that institutional players may be proactively accumulating XRP in anticipation of regulatory clarity surrounding exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Bloomberg analysts recently hinted that a Litecoin ETF may be approved first, raising expectations that other altcoins, such as XRP, could follow. Institutional investors often acquire assets in advance of major regulatory developments, suggesting that the recent outflows could be linked to potential ETF-related holdings. Valued at the current price, the 490 million XRP removed from Binance translates to approximately $1.3 billion. This supply reduction could act as a buffer against further downward price action, potentially stabilizing XRP at $2.60 while other cryptocurrencies experience more extreme losses. In conclusion, despite XRP’s recent decline, the asset appears to be holding up better than some of its peers. Whale accumulation, declining exchange reserves, and the ETF narrative could provide strong tailwinds for XRP’s price action once broader market conditions stabilize. XRP Price Forecast: $3 rebound hopes hinges on $2.60 support XRP price forecast charts shows the Ripple-backed coin stabilized above the critical $2.60 support level, and despite the recent sell-off, the broader technical structure suggests a potential rebound toward $3.00 if key indicators align. The Elliott Wave structure on the daily chart signals that XRP recently completed its fifth wave up, followed by a sharp corrective move, a typical market cycle behavior. The Fibonacci retracement levels highlight a key support zone around $2.5990, coinciding with the 0.618 retracement level, which historically acts as a strong reversal point for bullish recoveries. If XRP maintains this level, buyers could regain confidence, fueling a potential move toward the 0.382 ($2.8439) or even $3.0562 resistance. XRP price forecast | Feb 2, 2025 The MACD indicator, however, presents a more cautious outlook, with the signal line crossing below the MACD line, confirming weakening bullish momentum. If selling pressure persists and XRP loses the $2.60 support, a deeper retracement toward $2.50 remains likely. However, if buyers absorb the current supply and the MACD histogram begins to show diminishing red bars, it could confirm bottoming out, positioning XRP for a relief rally The post Ripple (XRP) Price Forecast: XRP Deposits on Binance Drops $1.3B to Hit 40-Day Low – Is It Bullish? appeared first on CoinGape .",Ripple|XRP|XRP price|XRP price analysis,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|EXCHANGE|BNB|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-02-02 23:04:22

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. The smart money in crypto is going to Jupiter, VeChain, and XYZVerse, a new altcoin making waves. Table of Contents The XYZverse takeover Jupiter Vechain Conclusion Investors are shifting their focus as new opportunities arise in the cryptocurrency landscape. Established projects like Jupiter (JUP) and VeChain (VET) are under close scrutiny, but a new altcoin is also capturing significant attention. The XYZverse takeover In the arena of sports, only the strongest thrive — athletes push limits, break records, and chase greatness with relentless determination. That same champion mindset fuels the crypto space, where fearless investors seek the next big win. Enter XYZverse, the first-ever meme coin ecosystem that fuses the competitive fire of sports with the electrifying energy of memes — a digital battlefield where sports lovers, gamers, and crypto warriors unite for legendary gains. Launched at $0.0001, XYZ has already bulldozed through ten presale stages, now priced at $0.002. The momentum isn’t slowing down. With a final presale target of $0.1, early buyers secured 99% discounts, putting them in prime position for massive returns. XYZverse isn’t just another hype-driven pump — it’s designed to last and dominate. The project’s tokenomics ensure a stable, sustainable trajectory, with: 15% allocated to liquidity, strengthening its foundation. 10% dedicated to community rewards, fueling engagement through bonuses and airdrops. A deflationary burn of 17.13%, steadily reducing supply and amplifying long-term value. XYZverse isn’t playing small — it’s building bridges between sports fandom and crypto mass adoption. With plans to collaborate with high-profile athletes, XYZ will soon dominate both the meme coin and sports entertainment landscapes. These game-changing partnerships will boost visibility, credibility, and demand, ensuring that XYZ becomes the gold standard of sports-driven meme coins. XYZverse is a movement and its community is ready to storm the charts. With a winning formula of hype, utility, and long-term vision, XYZ is set to redefine what a meme coin can achieve. Interested investors can be part of XYZVerse via presale. Jupiter Jupiter has established itself as a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator within the Solana ecosystem, ensuring users access the best token swap rates by pulling liquidity from multiple pools. This not only enhances trading efficiency but also reduces costs for users. Beyond swaps, Jupiter has expanded its services, introducing perpetual futures, decentralized stablecoin solutions, and the innovative LFG launchpad — an accelerator designed to support emerging Solana projects. One of Jupiter’s biggest contributions to DeFi is addressing price discrepancies across various platforms. Since liquidity pools on different exchanges can create pricing variations, Jupiter’s aggregation model guarantees users the most competitive rates. As the DeFi sector evolves, platforms like Jupiter — offering tangible utility and solving real market inefficiencies — stand out as compelling opportunities compared to projects with less concrete use cases.

The trader established a 50x leveraged short position when ETH was valued at $3,388, with a liquidation threshold set at $4,645, according to data from Hypurrscan. In addition to the unrealized profit, the trader accrued approximately $2.3 million in funding fees from the leveraged position. While leveraged trading can amplify potential gains, it also significantly increases the risk of substantial losses. A case in point is a pseudonymous trader who, in January 2024, lost over $161,000 in a single trade due to liquidation on a leveraged position, underscoring the inherent risks associated with such strategies. As of February 2, Ether’s price had declined by more than 4% over a 24-hour period, trading at $3,107. The cryptocurrency reached a daily low of $3,068 but managed to stay above the critical $3,000 psychological threshold, as reported by Cointelegraph Markets Pro. To reverse its six-week downward trend, Ethereum may need to bolster fundamental blockchain activity. Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at Nansen, noted, “Other layer-1s are catching up with Ethereum regarding apps, use cases, fees and amount staked.” Barthere suggested that increased collaboration with both private and public sector entities, especially in the United States amid recent regulatory developments favoring blockchain and cryptocurrency, could be beneficial for Ethereum. For a potential reversal toward the $4,000 mark, Ether would need to reclaim the $3,400 level, according to crypto trader Cas Abbé. However, significant resistance is anticipated at $3,240. Surpassing this level could trigger over $1 billion in cumulative leveraged short liquidations, as indicated by data from CoinGlass. These developments highlight the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets and the substantial risks and rewards associated with leveraged trading strategies.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-02 23:15:00

Among the myriad of options, Qubetics , Astra, and Ethereum have emerged as prominent players, each bringing unique innovations to the table. Qubetics has been making waves with its impressive presale performance and the introduction of its QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Astra is gaining attention for its focus on quantum-resistant security protocols, positioning itself as a forward-thinking project in the blockchain space. Ethereum, the pioneer of smart contracts, continues to dominate the decentralized application (dApp) landscape with its robust platform. This article delves into the key milestones and market positions of these cryptocurrencies, exploring how they have established themselves as alternative investment instruments to traditional assets. Qubetics: Pioneering with QubeQode IDE Qubetics is in its 20th presale stage, with each $TICS token priced at $0.0606. The project has successfully raised over $11.5 million, selling more than 453 million tokens to over 17,600 holders. Analysts predict that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, translating to a 274.70% return on investment. Looking ahead, forecasts suggest potential prices of $1 (1,398.82% ROI), $5 (7,394.11% ROI), or even $15 (22,382.34% ROI) after the mainnet launch. A standout feature of Qubetics is its QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE), designed to streamline the development of decentralized applications (dApps) across multiple blockchains. This user-friendly platform enables developers to write, test, and deploy smart contracts efficiently, fostering innovation in the crypto space. Consider a startup aiming to launch a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. With QubeQode IDE, the development team can seamlessly integrate various blockchain protocols, reducing development time and costs. This efficiency allows businesses to bring their products to market faster, staying ahead in the competitive crypto landscape. For individual developers, QubeQode IDE offers an accessible entry point into dApp development, providing tools and resources that simplify complex coding processes.

This innovation promises faster transaction speeds while maintaining high security and decentralization. The market response to Astra’s advancements has been overwhelmingly positive. Trading activity has surged, and its expanding ecosystem has attracted attention from developers seeking quantum-proof solutions. Analysts predict that as quantum computing advances, Astra’s relevance will only grow, making it a hot pick for investors focused on Layer 1 innovation. By focusing on future-proof security measures, Astra addresses potential vulnerabilities in current blockchain systems, positioning itself as a leader in secure and scalable blockchain solutions. Ethereum: The Smart Contract Pioneer Ethereum, introduced in 2015, revolutionized the blockchain space by enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Its platform has become the foundation for numerous projects, ranging from DeFi platforms to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Ethereum is trading at approximately $3,393.82, with a market capitalization exceeding $400 billion. Its transition to Ethereum 2.0, which involves shifting from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, aims to improve scalability, security, and energy efficiency. Over the years, Ethereum has cultivated a vast developer community, contributing to a rich ecosystem of dApps and protocols. Its ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards have become the industry norm for fungible and non-fungible tokens, respectively. For investors seeking exposure to a platform with a proven track record and continuous innovation, Ethereum remains a compelling choice. Its established infrastructure and ongoing upgrades suggest potential for sustained growth and adoption. Conclusion: Navigating the Future of Crypto Investments Qubetics , with its innovative QubeQode IDE and successful presale, offers a fresh perspective in the crypto space. Astra provides a forward-thinking approach to blockchain security, addressing future challenges with quantum-resistant protocols. Ethereum continues to lead with its robust platform, supporting a vast array of decentralized applications. Investors exploring the top crypto presale opportunities should consider these projects, each presenting unique innovations and potential for growth.

Per the House of Representatives’ official website and a report from the Japanese-language media outlet Iolite , Kato made the comments at a plenary session of the House of Representatives on the 31st. Japanese Finance Minister: Regulators Readying Crypto Tax Review Kato was responding to a question from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lawmaker Akihisa Shiozaki, the head of the party’s Web3 Digital Society Promotion office. LDP lawmaker Akihisa Shiozaki with a Thai diplomat in October 2023. (Source: MFA of Thailand/X) Kato explained that the Financial Service Agency (FSA) will issue a review “based on the ruling party [LDP]’s tax system proposals.” He added that the review would include recommendations on “necessary legislative amendments.” Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba also waded into the discussion by “expressing his belief that cryptoassets” would “contribute to solving Japan’s social problems and improving productivity.” “The healthy development of web3 – including cryptoassets – is extremely important.” Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba Ishiba added that it was “important” for the government to “ensure user protection” and “improve the environment” of the domestic crypto market. Japan intends to closely monitor the impact on its currency of US President Donald Trump’s new tariffs and is worried about the international fallout from the trade imposts, Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said. https://t.co/qxpf4okSOo — Bloomberg (@business) February 2, 2025 Regulator’s Report Key The minister said the FSA will also outline its proposed changes to the nation’s tax authorities. This, Kato said, will ensure any necessary changes are “put in place” before the new rules roll out. Kato also suggested that Tokyo is ready to change its legal definition of cryptoassets. Existing Japanese law defines crypto as a type of “payment instrument.” But the minister said that “in reality” coins like Bitcoin (BTC) are “mainly traded for investment purposes.” He added that the FSA has “indicated an intention” to “take in a wide range of opinions” before making an official recommendation “on the appropriateness of” crypto’s current “legal status.” Since the FSA began policing the Japanese crypto market in earnest in 2017, the agency has had the last word on all related regulations. The LDP, which has been in power on an almost uninterrupted basis since the 1950s, has formulated basic crypto policy. But it is the FSA that has formulated regulations and legal amendments. Thus far, all of the FSA’s proposals and requests made to parliament on the matter have been adopted without delay. Trading volumes on the Japanese crypto exchange platform Coincheck over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) PM’s Caution Ishiba’s predecessor Fumio Kishida took a relatively progressive stance on crypto regulation. Ishiba, however, has been more cautious on the matter of tax reform . But he has also made a number of more conciliatory comments about crypto and blockchain. Shiozaki’s department has called for faster action, claiming late last year that its proposal to reform crypto tax was of “urgent” importance. Japanese tax laws require crypto traders to report their profits on their yearly income tax returns. This runs in contrast to many other countries, which impose flat capital gains levies on traders (at rates of around 20%). Japanese traders must file their crypto trading profits on annual tax returns as “other income.” This means that the wealthiest crypto traders in Japan must hand over up to 55% of their trading profits to the Treasury. 日本政府、暗号資産の税制改正を含む規制整備について「6月末までに結論」と言及 ●石破首相は「暗号資産を含めたWeb3.0の健全な発展は極めて重要だ」と言及 ●暗号資産を金商法の対象とみなす可能性も焦点に ●今後も勉強会などを通じて幅広く意見を聞く方針 https://t.co/HzobxzTCS3 — Iolite（アイオライト）Web3.0 Front line (@Iolite_japan) January 31, 2025 ‘Unfair’ Tax Laws Many critics and Japanese crypto investors claim the Japanese crypto market is over-regulated. This, they claim, has stifled growth in the web3 and crypto sectors. The FSA, meanwhile, is also reportedly considering making an amendment to the Payment Services Act. This measure could see crypto included as an asset class under the terms of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. If true, this would appear to indicate that the FSA and the Japanese Finance Minster now share a common stance on reform.

The best opportunities will bring together strong technology, wide use, and real-world function to offer significant returns. BlockDAG (BDAG), Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), and Chainlink (LINK) each stand out for different reasons. BlockDAG’s advanced processing system improves transaction speed, Dogecoin thrives on its strong community, Solana offers an efficient network for developers, and Chainlink plays a major role in connecting blockchain with real-world data. Each of these best long-term cryptos is expected to play a key role in 2025. For those looking to stay ahead before the next big price jump, these four best long-term cryptos should be on every trader’s watchlist. Let’s explore what makes them stand out. 1. BlockDAG: Presale Gem with Massive Growth Potential BlockDAG (BDAG) is preparing for major advancements this year, including its mainnet release and listings on 10 major centralized exchanges. The project is focused on expanding its network and forming key connections that will support wider usage. What truly sets BlockDAG apart in the best long-term cryptos for 2025 is its powerful processing structure. Using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) setup, it allows multiple transactions at once without slowing down the system. This makes it highly suitable for areas like decentralized finance, gaming, and digital collectibles, where quick transactions and low costs are crucial. Speed plays a vital role in digital currency, and BlockDAG delivers in this aspect. Currently valued at $0.0248, BlockDAG’s presale has raised more than $191.5 million and sold over 18.1 billion coins since it began. Early supporters have already seen a 2,380% rise in value, with batch 27 receiving strong interest from buyers. BlockDAG’s processing capability and real-world application give BDAG both short-term potential and long-term stability. With anticipation growing around its mainnet launch, this project is on course to leave a lasting mark in the blockchain space. 2. Dogecoin: Community-Driven Meme Coin Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to be among the best long-term cryptos in 2025, backed by its active community and widespread recognition. Originally made for fun, DOGE has grown into a widely accepted digital currency, benefiting from its low fees, high liquidity, and frequent use for payments. Elon Musk’s connection to Dogecoin has kept it in the spotlight, with many believing it could be used for transactions on X (formerly Twitter). Although the coin remains highly speculative, its strong market presence makes it a key player. Dogecoin lacks major technical improvements, which raises concerns about its future strength. However, meme coins often thrive on popularity, and as digital currency markets shift, Dogecoin remains a relevant choice for those seeking speculative plays in 2025. 3. Solana: A Fast Network with Developer Appeal Solana (SOL) has proven itself as one of the quickest processing networks, handling transactions at high speed and low cost. Its easy-to-use system has made it a go-to platform for decentralized finance, NFTs, and gaming applications. Currently, Solana trades around $227.69 and faces strong resistance at $260, with many waiting to see if it will break through. The network’s ability to manage thousands of transactions per second makes it attractive for developers, but occasional outages have raised concerns about stability. Despite this, Solana continues to see growth, drawing attention from large firms and strengthening its place among the best long-term cryptos. 4. Chainlink: Bridging Data Between Blockchain & Reality Chainlink (LINK) plays a crucial role in connecting smart contracts with real-world data, serving as a key provider for multiple blockchains. As decentralized finance, gaming, and business applications expand, Chainlink’s data services and connection tools make it an essential part of the digital currency sector. At a price of $22.99, LINK has struggled to move past the $27.41 resistance mark, but its continued adoption by businesses and financial institutions supports its future value. One challenge is that Chainlink’s growth relies on how widely blockchain technology is used. If decentralized finance and smart contract usage slow down, it could affect LINK’s price. However, with large firms adopting Chainlink’s services, it remains a strong choice in the best long-term cryptos list. Best Long-Term Cryptos to Buy Now– Final Say! The digital currency market offers many choices, but selecting the right one can be difficult. This list highlights key options for those interested in fast transactions, community-driven assets, or essential blockchain services. Dogecoin holds its place due to strong user support, while Solana continues to show impressive speed and scalability. Chainlink remains a crucial service provider for blockchain-based applications. Among them, BlockDAG stands out as the most well-rounded choice, combining fast processing and real-world use cases. With major exchange listings and a mainnet launch happening this year, BDAG is set to see a rapid rise. Those keeping an eye on the best long-term cryptos for 2025 should take note—BlockDAG is positioned for major gains.

Unraveling ENS Inflows & Stacks Bearish Pattern",https://thecoinrise.com/web3bay-investors-eye-6430-roi-as-presale-hits-1m-unraveling-ens-inflows-stacks-bearish-pattern/,"The Stacks bearish pattern continues to impact the market. Recently, the $1.53 price level was broken, plunging STX by 62% from its peak value. Conversely, recent ENS whale influence shocked the market, with a substantial $9.15 million deposit leading to a 1041% increase in network inflows. For Web3Bay (3BAY) , early backers are poised for a 6,430% ROI at its debut, with the 3BAY token projected to jump from $0.003 to $0.1959. This leading web3 cryptocurrency aims to revolutionize the billion-dollar e-commerce industry by enhancing how buyers and sellers connect, and by providing token holders with governance and staking benefits. Stacks Bearish Pattern Indicates Potential Fall Stacks, the layer-2 solution for Bitcoin, has seen a 62% drop from its highest price of $3.86, now trading at $1.45. Although it had some recent price increases, the prevailing Stacks bearish pattern suggests more declines might follow. The token has developed a typical head and shoulders pattern—a bearish indicator suggesting a potential further decrease after breaking the critical $1.53 “neckline.” Currently, this neckline has been crossed, setting $1 as the next crucial support level. Despite the challenges, optimism about Stacks’ fundamental strengths remains, according to its founder, though the short-term forecast appears uncertain. ENS Whale Influence Triggers 1041% Jump In Inflows A significant move by a whale, depositing 282,365 Ethereum Name Service (ENS) tokens worth $9.15 million into Binance, caused a 1041% increase in ENS inflows within a day. This move, initiated by the ENS DAO: Community Reward Funds wallet, netted the investor a $4.36 million profit due to favorable market timing. Currently, ENS is priced at $34.41, recovering from a recent low of $28.00. The market’s balance between buying and selling has stabilized its price, with an RSI of 50.86 indicating a neutral trend. ENS now has a support level at $32.00 and a resistance potential at $38.00. Web3Bay Trending as Presale Hits $1M! Early investors in Web3Bay are on track for a staggering 6,430% ROI when the platform goes live, showcasing its potential to revolutionize e-commerce. Initially offered at $0.003 during the first presale, the 3BAY token has progressed to stage 4, now valued at $0.004562625, with an anticipated launch price of $0.1959. This web3 cryptocurrency is set to overhaul the conventional e-commerce framework, offering buyers a transparent, secure, and flexible shopping environment without hidden fees or data misuse. Sellers benefit from greater autonomy without intermediaries siphoning profits or enforcing stringent rules. The platform’s 3BAY token not only facilitates transactions but also provides purchase discounts and staking rewards, enhancing its utility and value. This fusion of practical use and community governance makes this web3 cryptocurrency a compelling proposition, combining financial incentives with substantial user benefits. Already, Web3Bay has garnered over $1 million in presale funds and distributed 270 million tokens worldwide, making significant inroads into the trillion-dollar e-commerce market. If you missed the first presale stage, there’s still a chance to get involved. The current stage 4 price offers a potential 4,200% ROI by the time of launch. However, with each passing stage, the price increases and the window for maximum returns narrows. Quick Overview As the Stacks bearish pattern holds and STX trades at $1.45, the outlook remains uncertain—will the fall continue, or is a recovery in sight? At the same time, the ENS whale influence underscores a stark reality: the market’s largest players significantly impact smaller investors. In contrast, Web3Bay introduces a decentralized approach to e-commerce, providing a fair chance for substantial gains. Early backers of this leading web3 cryptocurrency could see a 6,430% ROI at launch. For those now entering at stage 4 with a price of $0.004562625, a potential 4,200% ROI by launch is still achievable. But remember, as the presale advances, potential profits diminish, making timely participation crucial.

Analysts speculate if this titan might reclaim its all-time highs or if it’s time to focus on newer, high-potential assets. ETH, currently trading at $3,200, has drawn bullish attention following Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI ), accumulating millions of dollars in Ethereum and spot ETF momentum. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange—an ERC-20 token built on Ethereum’s blockchain—has captivated investors, raising $13+ million in its final presale stage. While ETH’s technical charts hint at a breakout toward $4,500, DTX’s hybrid trading platform promises 1000x leverage and institutional-grade scalability. Can Ethereum’s ecosystem sustain its dominance, or will disruptive projects like DTX redefine 2025’s profit landscape? This post explores ETH’s catalysts and DTX’s explosive innovation. Ethereum Price Analysis: Bulls Target $4,500 Amid Institutional Accumulation Ethereum’s bullish narrative centers on institutional demand, technical patterns, and regulatory tailwinds. WLFI’s aggressive ETH purchases—$47 million on inauguration day and $10 million daily thereafter—have injected stability, while ETH’s spot ETFs are projected to unlock billions in institutional inflows. Technically, ETH is consolidating within a falling wedge pattern, a historically bullish signal. Analysts note a breakout above $3,200 could trigger a reversal, targeting $3,600–$4,500. However, risks linger. Derivatives data reveals rising open interest paired with negative funding rates, indicating short-term bearish bets. A dip into the $2,900–$3,100 liquidity gap could trigger a short squeeze, accelerating upward momentum. Resistance at $3,344 remains critical; a daily close above this level may confirm ETH’s path to $4,000. Notably, Ethereum’s long-term scalability upgrades—including sharding and rollup integration— drive adoption for platforms like DTX Exchange. While ETH’s $4,500 target is plausible, competitors leveraging its infrastructure threaten to divert capital. DTX Exchange: ERC-20 Innovation Meets Hybrid Trading Mastery While Ethereum battles volatility, DTX Exchange (DTX) is redefining decentralized finance. Built on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard, DTX combines 1000x leverage, 120,000+ asset pairs, and a hybrid model merging stocks, forex, and crypto—all within a non-custodial framework. DTX Exchange’s $13+ million presale success underscores institutional confidence in Ethereum’s scalability for next-gen trading solutions. Here are a few reasons why DTX could rally faster than Ethereum this new market year. Unrivaled leverage & speed: DTX’s 1000x leverage dwarfs traditional platforms (100x average), while its VulcanX testnet processes 200,000 TPS, much faster than Ethereum. Tokenized ETFs & global access: This viral altcoin democratizes ETF trading in geo-restricted regions, bridging TradFi and DeFi. Governance & profit sharing: DTX token holders vote on platform upgrades and earn fee rebates, fostering community-driven growth. Security: The project’s integration of Phoenix Wallet ensures secure multi-asset custody, mitigating exchange hacks. Regarding its momentum, DTX tokens have surged by 700%, attracting ETH whales and diversifying amid the altcoin’s price swings. Analysts attribute this shift to DTX’s tangible utility: Its live testnet, CoinMarketCap listing, and Q1 2025 launch plans. Its fee-sharing model and cross-margin trading fueled post-listing targets of $0.20 (25% ROI from presale) and beyond. By leveraging Ethereum’s modular blockchain upgrades, DTX achieves seamless scalability. ETH’s reduced gas fees and sharding advancements empower DTX Exchange to tokenize equities and forex at unprecedented speeds, positioning it as a gateway for institutional capital. DTX Exchange Might Deliver Meteoric Gains Post-Presale Launch by Q2 2025 The Ethereum price trajectory hinges on ETF inflows and technical breakouts, yet DTX Exchange exemplifies how ERC-20 tokens are pushing boundaries. While ETH’s $4,500 target is achievable, DTX’s hybrid infrastructure, governance rewards, and 1000x leverage offer a unique risk-reward proposition. Ethereum remains foundational for decentralized innovation, but agile projects like DTX are reallocating market attention—and capital. Investors may benefit from dual exposure: ETH for stability amid regulatory clarity and DTX for exponential growth. As the crypto market gears up for a bullish pump, investors could benefit immensely from DTX’s post-presale launch, delivering groundbreaking utility and abundant gains. Its presale is wrapping up soon; investors can get involved as quickly as possible.

Cardano (ADA) Governance Upgrades and Whale Activity Signal Imminent Breakout Cardano (ADA) has weathered recent turbulence, trading at $0.95 with a $33 billion market cap, but seismic shifts are unfolding beneath the surface. The recent Plomin hard fork, a milestone in decentralized governance, allows Cardano (ADA) holders to vote directly on protocol upgrades, marking a critical step toward full community-led governance. This upgrade, powered by June 2024’s Chang upgrade, positions Cardano (ADA) as a pioneer in blockchain democracy. Whales have taken note, accumulating 140 million ADA ($137 million) since mid-December 2024. Analysts like Ali Martinez suggest a breakout to $1.50 is likely if Cardano (ADA) conquers the $1.10 resistance. Despite a 3% weekly dip, the surge in trading volume and open interest signals renewed institutional confidence. With layer-2 scalability solutions and Bitcoin interoperability on the horizon, Cardano’s current price might be a bargain for those betting on its governance-first ethos. SUI Blockchain Innovation Meets Accessibility Amid Token Unlock Jitters The SUI Blockchain network’s token, SUI is at $4.18 (-5.70% weekly), but its disruptive tech stack is turning heads. Its recent SMS-based transaction feature targets 3 billion unbanked users, enabling crypto transfers via essential mobile networks, a game-changer for regions with spotty internet. Partnerships like the SUI Blockchain PlayoX1 Handheld gaming device further showcase SUI Blockchain’s real-world utility, blending blockchain with consumer hardware for dynamic NFT integration. Yet, VanEck’s bullish $16 price target for 2025 underscores faith in SUI Blockchain’s long-term vision. Upgrades like Mysticeti V2 (boosting transaction throughput) and the SCION security protocol could solidify SUI Blockchain network’s position as a “Solana killer” in decentralized apps and AI integrations. This dip might be the last call for risk-tolerant investors before SUI Blockchain’s ecosystem goes parabolic. DTX Exchange the Hybrid Trading Behemoth Quietly Dominating Presales With $13.3 million raised in its presale and Stage 8 already 50% sold out, this hybrid platform blends centralized speed with decentralized security across 120,000+ assets-from crypto and stocks to ETFs. DTX Exchange is rewriting the rulebook for crypto trading. The VulcanX blockchain powers a staggering 200,000 TPS in testnet conditions, while the non-custodial Phoenix Wallet offers seamless multi-asset management. Priced at $0.16 (vs. a $0.20 listing target), DTX Exchange grants holders governance rights and profit-sharing via its VIP Rebate System. Over 575,000 users have flocked to its presale, lured by 1000x leverage and the imminent launch of tokenized ETF trading in Q1 2025. Analysts whisper of a $10 post-listing price of 6,150% ROI for early backers. DTX Exchange’s one-stop-shop model could become the industry standard as traditional finance merges with crypto. Final Thoughts Cardano (ADA)’s governance revolution, SUI Blockchain’s accessibility push, and DTX’s trading supremacy tell a story of untapped potential. While the ADA network and SUI Blockchain grapple with short-term volatility, their roadmaps reveal transformative upside. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange ’s presale frenzy hints at a “Binance-level” listing surge, making its $0.16 entry point a rare steal. In a market where hype often overshadows substance, these three altcoins offer something rare: fundamentals that justify the frenzy. The question isn’t if they’ll rally-it’s when.

With the meme coin market exploding, Dogwifhat (WIF) is riding the viral wave, and Book of Meme (BOME) is creating a digital archive of meme culture. But BTFD Coin (BTFD) is making headlines with its powerful Bulls Squad, high staking rewards, and a thriving presale that’s turning heads in the crypto space. The best new meme coins for exponential returns are those that go beyond the hype. Meme coins have already made massive waves in the past, with projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu minting millionaires. Now, BTFD Coin is rewriting the script with its Bulls Squad, 90% APY staking, and a record-breaking presale that’s raised over $5.9 million. Is this the next big meme coin moonshot? Let’s break it down. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Bulls Squad That’s Taking Over Meme coins are all about community power, and no coin does it better than BTFD Coin’s Bulls Squad . This isn’t just another token riding hype—it’s a movement backed by serious investors who know how to own the dip and profit big. The Bulls Squad represents the strongest holders in the market, those who stake their tokens for a whopping 90% APY while waiting for the price to skyrocket. With the BTFD Coin presale now in Stage 14, the current price is $0.00016 per token, but once the presale ends, BTFD will list at $0.0006, setting up a 275% gain right off the bat. But the real moonshot potential is at $0.006, a projected increase of 3,650%. Those who run with the Bulls Squad now could see life-changing gains. The best new meme coins for exponential returns need a strong entry point, and BTFD Coin delivers with a 100% BONUS CODE (LAUNCH100). Every investor who buys in during Stage 14 will have their tokens doubled instantly, making this one of the most lucrative presales in the market right now. Let’s talk numbers. A $8,000 investment at $0.00016 per BTFD coin gives you 50,000,000 BTFD tokens. When the price reaches $0.0006, that $8,000 turns into $30,000. And at $0.006, it becomes $300,000. That’s the power of running with the bulls—and the window to join is closing fast. How to Buy BTFD Coin? Investors need to set up MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB or ETH, and head to the presale page . After entering the LAUNCH100 bonus code, their tokens will be doubled immediately. Once the presale ends, tokens can be claimed and staked for massive passive rewards. Dogwifhat (WIF) – The Viral Meme Coin Taking Over Solana Some meme coins explode purely on community hype, and Dogwifhat (WIF) is one of the best examples of that. This Solana-based meme coin, featuring an adorable dog wearing a pink beanie, has become a cultural phenomenon, driven by strong investor enthusiasm and viral appeal. Dogwifhat’s strength is in community engagement. With a fixed supply, the demand for WIF tokens is soaring as more traders jump in to ride the hype wave. As one of the best new meme coins for exponential returns, WIF thrives on its ability to stay relevant in the meme space, with ongoing contests, influencer promotions, and organic community growth. Despite the highly speculative nature of meme coins, Dogwifhat continues to gain traction, maintaining its strong position in the market. Its Solana-backed speed and efficiency make it an attractive option for investors looking for fast and low-cost transactions, a major advantage in today’s trading environment. Dogwifhat remains a top choice for those betting on meme coin momentum. Book of Meme (BOME) – The Digital Archive of Meme Culture If meme coins are about history and culture, then Book of Meme (BOME) is the next-level play. Created by Darkfarms, this Solana-based meme coin aims to be a digital time capsule, preserving meme culture for the future. BOME is more than just a token—it’s a community-driven initiative to capture and immortalize memes in the blockchain world. The unique concept behind Book of Meme has led to rapid adoption, as investors see long-term potential in a project that isn’t just about price movements but also cultural impact. Unlike many other meme coins, BOME focuses on its artistic and archival value, bringing meme lovers and blockchain enthusiasts together. The potential for future partnerships and integrations in the NFT space also makes it a strong contender among the best new meme coins for exponential returns. As more investors recognize the value of meme preservation, BOME’s role in the evolving crypto landscape continues to expand. Its presence on Solana gives it strong transactional capabilities, making it an efficient and scalable meme coin with an engaged and growing fanbase. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, the best new meme coins for exponential returns are creating unique investment opportunities in 2025. Dogwifhat (WIF) thrives on meme culture and viral hype, while Book of Meme (BOME) is building a digital archive for meme enthusiasts. But BTFD Coin (BTFD) stands out as the most rewarding investment, thanks to its Bulls Squad, massive staking rewards, and high-growth presale. With a presale price of $0.00016 and a projected moonshot price of $0.006, BTFD Coin is positioned for exponential growth. The 100% bonus offer (LAUNCH100) is driving a buying frenzy, and the Bulls Squad is gaining momentum daily. The opportunity to buy at this price won’t last much longer.

Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the benchmark for cryptocurrency investments, delivering consistent value and stability over the years. However, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is quickly stealing the spotlight, with analysts projecting a potential 50,000% breakout. This groundbreaking token has already proven its worth, raising $1 million in just minutes during its presale. With momentum building and investor interest surging, OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM is positioning itself as the most promising crypto of 2025. What’s Driving THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s Momentum? Record-Breaking Presale Success The demand for THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has been unprecedented, with $1 million raised in minutes. This strong presale performance demonstrates overwhelming investor confidence, rivaling early excitement around XRP and SOL. Exclusive Availability Unlike XRP and SOLANA, which are widely available on major exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand and ensures that early adopters stand to gain the most from its projected breakout. Growing Investor Confidence With predictions of a 50,000% return, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has become a magnet for investors seeking exponential growth. Its strong performance and limited supply are fueling speculation that it could redefine the crypto market. How It Compares to Market Leaders Ripple (XRP): Known for its dominance in cross-border payments, XRP offers steady growth but doesn’t match the early-stage explosive potential of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Solana (SOL): A leader in blockchain scalability, SOL excels in speed but can’t rival the exclusivity and investor momentum driving this new token. Act Now Before It’s Too Late With analysts closely watching OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM , the token is proving to be a standout investment. Its record-breaking presale, exclusive availability, and massive growth potential make it a top choice for anyone looking to capitalize on crypto’s next breakout.

As a result, the demand has increased massively, propelling presale earnings to an impressive $13,331,176. Additionally, the $100,000 giveaway announcement has become an attraction for crypto investors. With solid fundamentals and unique positioning in the crypto market, DTX Exchange has become one of the most formidable rivals of Ripple (XRP). Meanwhile, the XRP price is facing high market volatility and trading in the sideways zone. It faces resistance near the $3.10 level and might initiate another rally if it can break past the local barriers. XRP Price Rally Stalls at Critical $3 Mark For the last two weeks, the XRP price has been continuously experiencing selling pressure from the $3 zone. It has tried several times to break past this zone but has faced rejection, forming an upper wick. However, the XRP price recovery after the DeepSeek crash has demonstrated resilience. Ripple is still trading inside the pennant pattern, with volatility contracting significantly. In the last 24 hours, the trading volume has decreased by 31%. The XRP price will reach the next supply zone at $3.30, which is also at an all-time high. The Fibonacci extension shows that the next resistances could be $3.70 (0.786 FIB) and $4 (1 FIB). These overhead resistances indicate potential short-term selling pressure, while rapid developments in Ripple suggest a bullish long-term outlook. Courtesy: TradingView The XRP price is now trading above $3 and the 20-period Moving Average. A bullish flag pattern is also forming, with resistance at $3.10 on the lower time frame. If Ripple struggles to break past $3.10, it may face another decline. The first support level is around $3, while the next major support lies near $2.80. In a groundbreaking move, Japan’s entire banking sector will adopt Ripple’s XRP cryptocurrency, reshaping the global financial system. SBI Holdings CEO Yoshitaka Kitao confirmed this shift, which is expected to transform cross-border transactions and currency conversions and position XRP as a major force in modern finance. DTX Exchange Remarkable Presale Success Attracts Institutions DTX Exchange is revolutionizing the crypto market by combining traditional and modern finance through blockchain technology. The DTX token was priced at $0.02 at the start of the presale and is currently trading at $0.16, a 700% gain for early investors. However, the token is preparing to be listed in major exchanges, which makes it a contender for 100x growth after the launch. It is powered by the first-ever hybrid blockchain, VulcanX, which supports over 100,000 financial instruments in a single platform. DTX Exchange will support stocks, crypto, forex, and ETFs on the platform, making trading much more manageable. Additionally, it will allow a leverage of 1,000x, so with $100 capital, one can access liquidity of up to $100,000. With an unmatched order execution speed of 0.04 seconds, DTX provides rare efficiency, reducing slippage and operational costs compared to other trading platforms. Its impressive speed is supported by a strong framework, making it scalable during its growth phase. DTX Exchange is gaining institutional investors’ attention through strategic listings on CoinMarketCap and an audit by SolidProof. The platform listing and KYC checks enhance visibility, credibility, and community engagement by introducing DTX to millions of crypto enthusiasts. Key Takeaways The crypto market has always appreciated projects with future vision and utility. While the XRP price has performed impressively, it is time for DTX to shine and capture a large user base. Investors who see stability and long-term profitability must keep track of this project. Expert investors find DTX Exchange to be the rising star of this crypto market, which is believed to take over after the listing.

Bitcoin (BTC) is currently priced at $96,636.4, down by 4.52%, while Ethereum (ETH) sits at $2,826.76, showing a 10.28% drop. Solana (SOL) is trading at $198.03, down 8.48%. Meanwhile, altcoins like XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE) are facing even steeper losses, with XRP at $2.32 (-20.62%) and DOGE at $0.2526 (-19.05%) in the last 24 hours. The overall market capitalization has dropped to $3.21 trillion, down by 6.50%. The Fear & Greed Index is at 47, signaling fear in the market, while the CMC100 index is down 8.07%, now sitting at $195.19. Bitcoin continues to dominate the market with a dominance of 59.89%, followed by Ethereum at 10.64%. The downturn in cryptocurrency prices coincides with increased geopolitical tensions, particularly the new tariffs imposed by the U.S. on several countries. These trade tensions, along with ongoing economic uncertainty, are causing investors to shift their portfolios away from risk-heavy assets like cryptocurrencies. Over the weekend, Trump announced new tariffs on Mexican, Canadian, and Chinese imports, adding to the already fragile global trade environment. Liquidation Heatmap Shows Significant Losses As of the latest 4-hour liquidation heatmap, the total liquidations across multiple exchanges have reached staggering amounts. Ethereum (ETH) leads the way with over $111 million in liquidations, followed by Bitcoin (BTC) at $62 million. Other cryptocurrencies such as XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), and Solana (SOL) have also seen considerable liquidation volumes. In the past 24 hours, the total liquidations have reached $1.19 billion. ‘",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|DOGE|ETH|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-03 00:55:26

Fortune reports that on Thursday, asset manager Grayscale submitted a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert its $16.1 million XRP trust into an ETF. A number of other companies are also applying for new crypto ETFs, including those for Litecoin, Solana ( SOL ) and Dogecoin ( DOGE ), as the US enters a pro-crypto era under the Trump administration. Last month, Ripple president Monica Long said that the next crypto ETF to receive a greenlight after Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) will likely be XRP, but Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart is not as optimistic. Seyffart says the SEC is still claiming that XRP is a security, a roadblock that might bar ETFs based on the third-largest crypto asset from getting the seal of approval. He also notes that XRP-issuer Ripple is still locked in a legal tussle with the SEC. “There’s some more work that needs to be done on that front that doesn’t need to happen with something like Litecoin. The SEC has never called Litecoin a security so, I wouldn’t be surprised if you see Litecoin come first.” While Seyffart does not see the imminent approval of XRP ETFs, he believes that it is within the realm of possibility for the third-largest crypto asset to get one this year.

OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM Is Booming—Can BITCOIN and XRP Keep Up?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/dont-miss-this-officialmagacoin-com-is-booming-can-bitcoin-and-xrp-keep-up/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the cornerstone of cryptocurrency success stories, turning early adopters into millionaires. Cardano (ADA), Near Protocol (NEAR), and Kaspa (KAS) have also built strong reputations, while Arbitrum (ARB) has shown potential as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. However, a new coin, OFFICIALMAGACOIN, is now commanding the attention of savvy investors. OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Deliver 60,000% Returns OFFICIALMAGACOIN has emerged as a unique player, with a record-breaking presale raising over $1 million in minutes. The token is only available at officialmagacoin.com , adding an element of exclusivity that appeals to both retail and institutional investors. Its potential for 60,000% returns has investors speculating that it could mirror or even surpass Bitcoin’s early growth trajectory. Early-Stage Growth Potential: With its presale success, OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors a chance to get in on the ground floor of a coin poised for exponential growth. Exclusivity and Scarcity: Available only at its official website, the token creates urgency and a sense of premium access. Affordable Entry Point: At less than $0.20 per token, OFFICIALMAGACOIN provides a low-risk, high-reward opportunity. Comparing OFFICIALMAGACOIN to Competitors Bitcoin (BTC): Established but lacks the explosive growth of a new coin. Cardano (ADA): Reliable but maturing, leaving little room for exponential returns. Near Protocol (NEAR): Focused on Web3 but cannot match OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s exclusivity. Kaspa (KAS): A promising blockchain but with a slower trajectory.

XRP has been hit the hardest, with its price dropping over 20% in the last 24 hours. The price has now dropped below its previous key support level of $2.52 and is now trading at $2.41. If the price continues to fall, a test of $2.32 becomes more likely. A break below $2.32 would confirm a more bearish outlook, suggesting an invalidation of the previous micro “one-two” setup. For now, the larger pattern remains intact, but the market is showing increasing pressure. The depth of this decline remains uncertain, and it will be crucial to watch how the market reacts to these new support levels in the coming days. Waiting for Confirmation To confirm a reversal, XRP would need to break above the recent high of $3.15. Additionally, a break above $2.89 (the golden ratio level) could signal the start of an upside breakout. For now, the market remains in a correction phase, but it is in an area where a potential low could form. Larger Range and Next Support Levels XRP remains within a larger sideways range, bounded between $1.96 (the previous breakout point from 2021) and the $3.40 level. If the market continues to decline, the next key support levels are at $2.23 (the 100% extension of the immediate down move) and lower levels around $1.96 and $1.23. Overall, the market pressure is currently bearish, but there remains a chance for the bulls to step in. With Bitcoin having reached its downside target, the market could see a reversal in the coming week. However, no confirmed low has yet been established, so it’s crucial to remain patient and monitor for further developments.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-03 01:12:14

The deal includes an upfront payment of $25 million due at closing in the first quarter of 2025, with the remaining $31 million to be paid in six equal monthly installments. The $56 Million Purchase According to an announcement HIVE made on January 28, the Yguazú facility will be developed in two stages. Phase 1, which is already 80% finished, is scheduled for completion by April 1, 2025. Once operational in the second quarter, it is expected to add approximately six exahashes per second (EH/s) to HIVE’s Bitcoin mining capacity. Phase 2, expected to be wrapped up by August 31, 2025, will introduce hydro-cooled Bitmain S21+ ASICs, adding 6.5 EH/s. The Texas-based crypto miner has estimated the cost of completing the facility at $400,000 per MW. It also revealed that it will be funded using existing cash reserves and BTC holdings. As part of the acquisition, HIVE will assume $19 million in pre-existing power purchase agreement (PPA) deposits that Bitfarms paid to Paraguayan utility ANDE. This aligns with its goal of expanding its Bitcoin mining capacity to 25 EH/s by September 2025. As of December 2024, the firm reported a realized hashrate of 5.46 EH/s and held 2,805 BTC in its reserves. It has also pre-ordered 15 EH/s of hydro-cooled ASICs from Bitmain and Canaan to support its growth plans. Bitfarms’ Strategic Shift The sale of the Yguazú facility marks a strategic shift for Bitfarms, which initially planned to develop the site as part of its 2024 expansion into Latin America. Construction delays led to the relocation of mining equipment originally intended for Paraguay to Stronghold Digital’s Pennsylvania facility as part of a 2024 merger. CEO Ben Gagnon stated that the proceeds from the sale would support the company’s 1-gigawatt growth pipeline in the U.S., which includes infrastructure for Bitcoin mining as well as high-performance computing and artificial intelligence. “We are pleased to announce the sale of our Yguazú site to HIVE as we continue to streamline our operations and rebalance towards North America,” Gagnon said. Bitfarms remains committed to its operations in Latin America, where it has three other facilities with a total capacity of 144 MW and long-term power agreements. The latest development comes after a proposed merger with Riot Platforms Inc. in 2024, which would have created 15 facilities in several areas, including Paraguay. However, Bitfarms’ board ultimately rejected the plan, with the two companies terminating the acquisition bid.

While Ripple investors are eagerly waiting for XRP ETF approval, insiders are accumulating the viral hybrid altcoin, DTX Exchange (DTX) . Through its hybrid approach, DTX addresses key challenges in global finance and eases accessibility to various markets. Meanwhile, the XRP price is still experiencing consolidation and is hovering above the $3 critical support. Analysts believe the XRP ETF approval will be a huge trigger and push Ripple to a new all-time high. However, savvy investors are leaning more towards DTX listing as it presents an opportunity to capitalize on innovation and growth. Grayscale Files for XRP ETF – Could This Spark a Ripple Price Surge? NYSE Arca, a New York Stock Exchange subsidiary, has taken a major step toward converting Grayscale’s XRP Trust into a spot XRP ETF. It submitted a 19b-4 filing, formally proposing the conversion. But Grayscale isn’t the only player in the race—Bitwise Asset Management and 21Shares have also filed their proposals for an XRP ETF, aiming for a share of this growing market. The SEC approved Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, followed by Ethereum ETFs later that year. NYSE Arca’s push to transform the XRP Trust into a Ripple XRP ETF could indicate a broader shift as the financial industry continues merging traditional markets with digital assets. Due to the recent regulatory and ecosystem developments in Ripple, it has performed exceptionally, becoming the top gainer in the crypto market. Just like the RLUSD stablecoin approval, an XRP ETF approval would be another massive win for Ripple. The asset’s price has increased over 500% since the November low, reaching a new all-time high of $3.40. After the parabolic momentum, Ripple has been trading sideways for the last two weeks. Source: CoinMarketCap Ripple (XRP) is currently trading at $3.04, down about 1.50% in the past 24 hours. Bulls are working very hard to stabilize the price above $3. However, price action has remained neutral so far. The next crucial region corresponding to the previous demand level is $2.80. If XRP drops below this level, a steep decline to $2.50 and $2 could result in a much deeper correction. DTX Exchange Becomes Fastest Growing Crypto Presale DTX Exchange is rapidly expanding its ecosystem driven by increased demand and the ability to bridge the financial gap between conventional and digital methods. Traditional trading exchange inefficiencies, such as high fees and slow sales, have long been a bottleneck for traders, and the DTX hybrid platform is a much-needed solution. DTX users can access over 120,000 financial assets, including cryptocurrency, stocks, forex, and ETFs, on a single platform. This is the first hybrid model introduced by the DTX Exchange, allowing traders to avoid switching from one platform to another. Platform’s multi-asset trading functionality would increase efficiency, speed, and accessibility. Additionally, traders can increase their profit potential and growth pace with the 1,000x leverage. So, with a capital of $100, you can purchase assets worth $100,000. This feature will be beneficial in bull markets, where a trader can capitalize on market opportunities with increased position size. The DTX Exchange presale has already seen remarkable success, with the DTX token experiencing an upward price trajectory since its launch. To date, it has raised $13,380,345.52 and has over 400,000 unique holders. In the final stage of the presale, Investors are flocking to this new crypto project and securing their tokens at just $0.16. Due to an overwhelming response from the community, DTX Exchange has launched a $100,000 giveaway plan. Twenty lucky token holders will each win $5,000 USDT. In the final stage of the sale, nearly 60% of the tokens have already been sold and the event will conclude in the coming weeks. Timing is crucial; those who join early have the potential to benefit significantly from the anticipated listing rally and giveaway program.

Morgan Stanley Analyst Analysis",https://nulltx.com/can-this-0-16-altcoin-top-21500-listing-gains-like-solana-ico-morgan-stanley-analyst-analysis/,"The crypto market is known for having altcoins that deliver massive returns. Such was the case of Solana (SOL), a top project that gave life-changing gains to its early backers. During the 2021 bull run, the Solana price surged by over 21,500% from its ICO price of $0.22. While such parabolic growth takes time, it shows how altcoins with robust tech and use cases tend to offer massive returns to their holders. The good news is that a new contender, DTX Exchange (DTX), is on the horizon to mirror the Solana price trajectory. DTX is currently priced at just $0.16 and has raised over $13.4 million in its presale. Backed by a high-performance blockchain and a hybrid trading ecosystem, analysts are drawing parallels to Solana’s early days. But can DTX mirror SOL’s historic ascent? A recent Morgan Stanley analysis weighs in, offering insights into Solana’s outlook and DTX’s explosive potential. Solana Price (SOL) Analysis: Momentum, Challenges, and Revised Forecasts Recent Solana price action reflects market volatility. After a three-day correction, SOL surged 6% on Wednesday, reclaiming $230 amid broader crypto optimism following the Federal Reserve’s decision to pause rate hikes. This rebound aligns with bullish technical indicators: Solana’s falling wedge breakout remains intact, and Bollinger Bands suggests stabilization near $220. Analysts anticipate a push toward $250 and potentially $281 if momentum holds. However, Morgan Stanley analysts temper enthusiasm. While SOL’s weekly trading volume spiked 80%, lifting its market cap to $113 billion, the firm revised its 2025 price target from $500 to $300. The downgrade stems from regulatory headwinds, notably the SEC’s ongoing lawsuit alleging SOL is an unregistered security. This could complicate the potential approval of a Solana ETF, a key catalyst for institutional inflows. Despite these challenges, derivatives data reveals institutional confidence. Furthermore, SOL whales believe that current political shifts, like the new Trump administration, could ease regulatory pressure. But the Solana price target above its all-time high doesn’t look promising for now. This situation has spurred many to redirect attention to emerging altcoins like DTX Exchange. DTX Exchange (DTX): The $0.16 Altcoin Poised for a Solana-Like Surge As Solana navigates regulatory hurdles, DTX Exchange emerges as a compelling alternative. Built on the VulcanX blockchain, DTX boasts a staggering 200,000 transactions per second (TPS) during testnet trials, surpassing Solana’s 65,000 TPS. This technical edge positions DTX as a scalable solution for traders demanding speed and cost efficiency. DTX’s ecosystem seeks to combine traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). As such, there’s unlimited access to equities, forex, cryptocurrencies, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). This hybrid approach caters to retail traders and institutional players. The platform’s Phoenix Wallet, downloaded more than 400,000 times, provides secure, non-custodial storage for diverse assets, enhancing its appeal as a unified trading hub. DTX’s ongoing presale success highlights robust demand. Early adopters are drawn to its low entry price and high-growth narrative, reminiscent of Solana’s ICO phase. Analysts speculate that DTX’s upcoming listing could ignite a rally akin to SOL’s 2021 breakout, driven by its scalability and community growth. Morgan Stanley’s analysis further fuels optimism. While the expert firm projects the Solana price to reach $300, analysts identify DTX as a coin capable of 21,500%+ gains, mirroring SOL’s historical trajectory. Final Thoughts The Solana price journey from being an ICO underdog to becoming a top-five cryptocurrency illustrates the transformative potential of high-speed blockchains. However, regulatory hurdles and revised forecasts underscore the volatility inherent in crypto investing. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange, a project combining Solana’s scalability with a broader vision for integrated finance, is poised to deliver top gains to savvy investors and traders. Priced at $0.16 in its final presale stage, DTX offers a rare opportunity for users to invest at ground level in a platform poised to disrupt TradFi and DeFi. While past performance never guarantees future results, the presale momentum, technical innovation, and analyst endorsement position DTX as a credible token for exponential growth. The DTX presale window is narrowing, and the bulls are circling. Don’t miss out!

Among them, Rollblock (RBLK) stands out as one of the most promising opportunities, thanks to its strong presale momentum and real-world utility. Alongside Rollblock, Meme Index (MEMEX), BlockDAG (BDAG), Qubetics (TICS) and Solaxy (SOLX) should be on your watchlist. Rollblock: A Revenue-Generating Crypto ICO With Real-World Utility Rollblock integrates decentralized gaming with a sustainable revenue model. The platform has already raised almost $10 million in its presale , which is about to head into stage 11 only, so it’s definitely one of the best crypto to buy today. It merges blockchain technology with the online casino industry and so Rollblock provides a robust use case that ensures long-term adoption. The platform offers a wide variety of popular games like poker, blackjack, roulette and different themed slots. Rollblock incentivizes participation with liquidity rewards. This way it ensures ongoing engagement and increasing demand for $RBLK. Additionally, Rollblock’s security-focused approach, with 12 months of locked liquidity, minimizes risks for early investors. Meme Index (MEMEX): A Diversified Approach to Meme Coins Meme Index (MEMEX) redefines the meme coin sector with the first-ever decentralized index fund for meme tokens. Instead of betting on a single meme coin, you can gain exposure to multiple meme assets through MEMEX’s structured investment model. The project allows investors to choose between different risk-reward baskets, including established tokens like Dogecoin and high-growth opportunities with smaller meme coins. With over $3 million raised in its crypto ICO, MEMEX has already garnered attention as one of the most anticipated launches. BlockDAG (BDAG): High-Speed Transactions and Scalability BlockDAG (BDAG) raised $190 million in one of the most successful crypto ICOs of this year. Its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology offers scalability, speed and efficiency. It addresses the limitations of traditional blockchain networks. Unlike many crypto ICOs, BlockDAG already outlined plans for listings on 10 major exchanges, ensuring ample liquidity upon launch. With its focus on high-speed transactions and decentralized applications (dApps), BDAG is positioned as a long-term contender in the crypto ecosystem. Qubetics (TICS): Simplifying Blockchain Development Qubetics (TICS) uses Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that simplifies blockchain development. By offering drag-and-drop functionality for decentralized applications (dApps), Qubetics lowers the barrier to entry for developers. The project already raised $11.3 million in its presale, and analysts predict post-launch values could reach $10-$15 per token.

Movements in Dogecoin price are capturing attention, driven by anticipation around Elon Musk’s next actions. Simultaneously, increased Cardano (ADA) whale activity is boosting confidence within its network. These trends not only emphasize the value of well-established tokens but also spotlight new ventures like Web3Bay. Web3Bay is making its mark in decentralized e-commerce, drawing eyes with its presale figures. With the 3BAY token priced at just $0.004562625, an expected ROI of 6,430% positions it as a prime investment for those looking to get in early. Web3Bay stands out for its commitment to transparency, security, and innovation, presenting a unique opportunity to engage with a pioneering Web3 initiative. Why Web3Bay Is a Must-Buy Crypto in 2025 Web3Bay’s ongoing presale is noteworthy. The 3BAY token’s current price at $0.004562625, set to rise to $0.1959 at launch, predicts an ROI of 6,430%. This isn’t merely a statistic; it’s a cue for potential investors to seize this exceptional chance. Having already amassed over $1 million and sold beyond 270 million tokens, Web3Bay is appealing to those spotting early-stage opportunities.

Currently trading near $0.354, Dogecoin is supported by a robust community and notable endorsements, especially from Elon Musk, which consistently keeps the cryptocurrency in the spotlight. Apart from its market value, Dogecoin’s charm also stems from its fun image and broad use in small online payments and tips.

Despite its unpredictable nature, Dogecoin continues to attract those looking for an easy way to start with cryptocurrencies. Its durability and community-focused nature make it an important cryptocurrency to consider. Cardano (ADA) Whale Activity Indicates Growing Confidence Cardano (ADA) whale activity is catching eyes as significant investors expand their holdings, showing a resurgence of faith in its future. Recent data shows a rise in transactions by large-volume wallets, which typically lead to important price shifts. This reflects well on Cardano’s ongoing upgrades, including the successful Plomin update. With its price around $0.9648, ADA is frequently mentioned in discussions parallel to Dogecoin price trends. Cardano continues to attract attention with its emphasis on scalability, sustainability, and practical uses, extending from aerospace to decentralized finance. This progress, along with increased interest from major investors, makes Cardano a promising venture for those looking at long-term investments in the crypto space. Critical Observations Recent Dogecoin price actions underline its persistent allure, supported by a solid community and significant endorsements. Similarly, the boost in Cardano (ADA) whale activity signals a growing trust in its ecosystem, with large investors positioning themselves for expected advancements. Both cryptocurrencies remain prominent figures, presenting prospects for those seeking well-established players in the cryptocurrency arena. Yet, for investors aiming at a transformative opportunity, Web3Bay stands out. Its current presale offers exceptional potential, with the 3BAY token available at just $0.004562625 and an anticipated ROI of 6,430%.

In the same vein, the XRP price is poised to hit a target of 6. Meanwhile, a new AI-powered and wallet-based altcoin called WallitIQ (WLTQ) is making waves as it prepares for a massive 1,000x to $20. Bitcoin (BTC) Attracts Positive Sentiment Despite Low Trading Volume The Bitcoin price hasn’t exactly been bullish in the past few weeks but rather is facing a consolidation that has kept it in a weekly range of $98,380.59–$106,462. Although the Bitcoin price recently climbed above the $100,000 crucial mark, raising its monthly gain above 9.50%, the trading volume on the Bitcoin (BTC) network is declining. Bitcoin (BTC) is facing a 44.90% decrease in trading volume, which shows that activity on its network is declining. However, according to TradingView’s analysis of Bitcoin (BTC), its moving averages are signaling a strong buy. This indicates that the Bitcoin price is set to skyrocket very soon. With Arthur Hayes already predicting that the Bitcoin price could reach $250,000 this year, it’s hard not to see $150,000 as an achievable target in Q1. The Bitcoin price is on the verge of breaking its ATH of $109,114 again. As positive sentiment keeps brewing, Bitcoin (BTC) may surpass $150,000 very soon. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Garners a Fresh Multitude of Investors, Following Potential for a 1000x Rally WallitIQ (WLTQ) is currently standing out exceptionally in the presale market, as it is already considered the altcoin set to challenge XRP and Bitcoin (BTC) in this year’s bull market. With a unique platform that relies heavily on the technology of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) , this new presale entrant is designed to redefine how crypto investors store and manage crypto assets on wallets. With its numerous advanced features, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is poised to gain massive traction, especially as the crypto market is beginning to experience more AI adoption. This traction is bound to be reflected in the price of its token, which is currently going for $0.0420 in its presale phase. However, on account of its high growth capacity, this token has a high probability of mirroring a 1,000x rally to hit $20. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) smart wallet-based ecosystem offers its investors and users AI tools that enhance its performance. For instance, users gain access to predictive analytics modeling , 24/7 personalized chatbots , an AI-based fraud detection system , AI-driven custom alerts, and smart contract analysis that has been thoroughly audited by SolidProof. While these features already sparked a lot of FOMO in investors, the MVP of its Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App is generating even more excitement. This Mobile App is set to introduce a sleek, intuitive, and user-friendly environment for its investors to simulate the transfer of ETH and USDT. Alongside this, users can track the real-time prices of crypto assets , access candlestick charts, and even pay for daily purchases like Starbucks coffee. The XRP Price Maintains Month-Long Bullish Flag Despite hitting lower levels around $2.7, the XRP price has quickly regained strength as it surged back up to $3.12, showing great resilience to bullish pressure. However, on a month-long time frame, XRP is actually portraying a high bullish sentiment as the XRP price is up by 50%. With nearly a 500% pump in the past 3 months, XRP has stormed the crypto market with its bullish breakout above $0.5. Now that the XRP price is staying strongly above $3, there are speculations that XRP could double its value and hit $6. Although the XRP price is already attracting bullish predictions, with WallStreetBulls citing the potential of XRP to surpass $100 this year. The crypto analyst, however, gave a short-term prediction of the XRP hitting $5-$10.

While Shiba Inu (SHIB) struggles to keep investor interest alive with its stagnating Shiba Inu price, Ripple (XRP) is enjoying institutional inflows that continue to drive the XRP price upward. However, amidst these headline-grabbing trends, a $0.0420 AI coin, WallitIQ (WLTQ), is quietly gaining traction among whales who are betting big on its potential for a staggering 35,000% growth. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Loses Its Spark Shiba Inu (SHIB) once took the crypto world by storm with its meme-driven hype, but its glory days seem far behind. The current Shiba Inu price reflects the struggles of a token that lacks substantial utility or innovation. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is an AI coin that rewrites the rules of crypto investing. Unlike Shiba Inu (SHIB), it isn’t reliant on viral moments or speculative pumps. It’s built on cutting-edge technology, such as Escrow Connect powered by AI Einstein, which provides unparalleled security for digital assets during transactions.

While the XRP price continues to rise, this AI coin is carving its path with innovative features and unmatched growth potential.

Ripple (XRP) Rises With Institutional Inflows Ripple (XRP) has long been a favorite among institutional investors, and the recent inflows only solidify its status as a reliable asset. With the XRP price steadily climbing following Ripple’s (XRP) legal victories, it’s clear that big players are backing this project for its potential to revolutionize cross-border payments. However, while Ripple (XRP) enjoys institutional inflows, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is carving its path to dominance. Unlike Shiba Inu (SHIB), which relies heavily on community hype, this platform’s AI-powered investment recommendations , tailored to user-specific parameters, help traders stay ahead of market trends. This feature not only levels the playing field for retail investors but also outshines tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB), making it a magnet for whales who value innovation and security. Why settle for modest returns with the XRP price when this platform and its low WallitIQ (WLTQ) price offer the possibility of 35,000% growth? The Shiba Inu price once captured attention, but WallitIQ (WLTQ) is emerging as the new powerhouse for exponential gains. Institutional inflows may validate Ripple (XRP), yet as the Shiba Inu price struggles to impress, the smart money is increasingly flowing toward this AI coin. WallitIQ (WLTQ): Whales Are Betting Big On This AI Coin In the fast-evolving world of crypto, whales have a knack for identifying projects with the most potential. It’s no surprise that WallitIQ (WLTQ) , an AI coin with unparalleled features, is becoming a favorite among these big players. With its features like biometric authentication and custom alert , WallitIQ (WLTQ) is redefining what it means to invest with confidence. While the Shiba Inu price and Ripple’s (XRP) institutional inflows grab headlines, the real action is happening in the AI coin space. This AI coin is designed for long-term success. With its $0.0420 presale price, it’s a ground-floor opportunity to join a project built to dominate the DeFi landscape and potentially rival the XRP price in future growth. Whales are moving their capital into this AI coin because it offers a unique combination of growth, innovation, and security. If the big players are confident enough to back this AI coin, why wouldn’t you? The Path To 35,000% Growth WallitIQ (WLTQ) is more than just a token; it’s an ecosystem that empowers investors with tools to navigate market volatility. Its MVP Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App integrates real-time crypto pricing, interactive candlestick charts, and multi-wallet functionality, making it a one-stop solution for portfolio management. With features like these, it’s no wonder this SolidProof-audited platform is expected to deliver 35,000% growth by 2025. The Shiba Inu price has already peaked, and even Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ripple’s (XRP) institutional inflows can only take the XRP price so far. This AI coin represents the next wave of innovation in the crypto space, and early adopters stand to reap life-changing rewards. Conclusion The crypto market waits for no one.

For many, the Shiba Inu rally was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. However, an analyst believes there are new altcoins on the horizon that could follow a similar path to success. In this article, we’ll explore the best three altcoins the analyst thinks will deliver life-changing ROI like Shiba Inu did in 2021: BONK, PEPE, and WallitIQ (WLTQ) . BONK: A Meme Coin Poised For Explosive Growth Bonk (BONK) tops the analyst list of top altcoins that can deliver life-changing ROI like Shiba Inu in 2021. BONK is trading at a modest value of $0.00002557 but has demonstrated strong potential for significant growth. Analysts predict BONK will gain renewed momentum in 2025, fueled by increased adoption and a thriving meme coin market. In conservative projections, analysts forecast BONK’s price could rise to around $0.00006510 by the end of 2025. In more optimistic scenarios, BONK could soar to as high as $0.00009368, potentially mirroring the explosive rise of Shiba Inu in 2021 to give investors a life-changing ROI. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Give More Profits Shiba Inu Did In 2021 WallitIQ (WLTQ), a new altcoin in the market, has quickly earned a reputation as one of the best altcoins that can deliver life-changing ROI as Shiba Inu did in 2021. This optimism from analysts stems from the platform’s strong position in the $45 billion AI-crypto market and impressive growth. Since the beginning of its presale journey, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has achieved remarkable momentum unmatched by other presale tokens. The project has already raised nearly $7 million across its progressive presale stages and proudly holds a long-standing listing on CoinMarketCap , further solidifying its credibility. Unlike many altcoins driven by speculative hype, WallitIQ (WLTQ) delivers real-wild utilities, and tangible value through its cutting-edge portfolio management features. The platform utilizes an advanced AI system, allowing users to seamlessly trade, track, and store their crypto assets—all within a single platform. But that’s not all. It also offers real-time market insights , empowering investors to make well-informed, data-driven decisions. Beyond trading crypto assets, the platform enables users to trade physical assets as well. Through its innovative Physical-to-Digital feature , users can tokenize their physical assets, converting them into their equivalent value in cryptocurrency. This groundbreaking functionality opens up new opportunities for asset management and expands the platform’s utility. Analysts predict these innovative functionalities will increase the platform’s traction, potentially sending its price soaring to mirror Shiba Inu’s legendary 2021 surge. Currently, the WLTQ token is available at an affordable price of $0.0420 , making this the perfect time to invest. Don’t miss out on what could be your only opportunity for life-changing ROI. Analysts Set Ambitious Price Target For PEPE Most altcoins thrive on hype, as demonstrated by Shiba Inu’s meteoric rise when retail traders and whales seized the opportunity at the right moment. Analysts believe that if PEPE follows a similar trajectory, it could experience significant gains, though timing and market sentiment will be key. Whales have already begun to show interest, with massive buys, driving PEPE’s price higher. Furthermore, analysts like Alchemist have set ambitious price targets for PEPE, ranging from $0.75 to over $10,000, indicating strong bullish sentiment from investors. If these predictions hold true, PEPE could deliver life-changing ROI, just like Shiba Inu did in 2021. Buy The WLTQ For Faster, Life-Changing Profit All of the above altcoins will generate substantial profits for holders next year. However, analysts agree that WallitIQ (WLTQ) is the most promising candidate to replicate Shiba Inu’s parabolic rally in 2021. Unlike these altcoins, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has undergone a rigorous audit by Solidproof, reinforcing its commitment to security and reliability. Additionally, the platform plans to launch a cutting-edge crypto management app , designed to streamline trading and asset management for users. As its use cases expand and investor interest grows, analysts predict that WLTQ will experience significant price surges, offering investors life-changing ROI, much like Shiba Inu did during its iconic rise in 2021.

However, their dependence on market trends has prompted cautious investors to seek alternative opportunities like RCO Finance (RCOF) . This AI-powered altcoin is rapidly gaining attention for its advanced AI technology and strong utility. With projections of a remarkable 30,000x surge post-listing, RCO Finance presents an enticing investment prospect for XRP and Ethereum whales, offering substantial returns and a strategic way to diversify portfolios amid the ongoing bullish market momentum. XRP and Ethereum Whales Find Solace in RCO Finance XRP, renowned for its cross-border payments utility, has surged 2.41% in the past day , reaching $3.13 amid the broader market rebound. This momentum is fueled by a recent partnership with Ondo Finance , with analysts anticipating new all-time highs for the altcoin. Similarly, Ethereum, a leading force in smart contracts and decentralized applications, has seen an uptrend of 4.91% in the past 24 hours . The rally follows reports that the Trump family’s crypto project, World Liberty Financial, has purchased an additional $10 million in Ethereum . Since Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20, the project has amassed over $189 million worth of ETH. Despite these gains, XRP and Ethereum whales remain cautious due to the assets’ sensitivity to market volatility. As a result, many are turning to utility-driven alternatives like RCO Finance (RCOF) to hedge against uncertainty and enhance portfolio stability in a fluctuating market. RCO Finance (RCOF): AI-Driven Financial Innovation for Smarter Investing RCO Finance (RCOF) is rapidly gaining traction among XRP and Ethereum whales, thanks to its mission of democratizing access to advanced investment strategies. Despite its recent launch, the platform has already onboarded over 10,000 users, reflecting its growing popularity. A standout feature of RCO Finance is its AI-powered Robo Advisor, which tailors investment strategies to individual users based on their financial goals and risk tolerance. Leveraging machine learning and AI algorithms, the Robo Advisor analyzes market data and news from sources like Reuters to provide credible insights. For instance, it can detect whether the recent adoption and accumulation of XRP and Ethereum are significantly impacting their prices. Based on its findings, the Robo Advisor would inform users whether buying XRP or Ethereum now is a good investment decision. Basically, this tool aims to democratize sophisticated trading strategies, making them accessible to all investors. The upcoming Alpha platform launch promises to enhance these capabilities further. In addition to AI insights, RCO Finance provides access to over 120,000 assets across 12,500 asset classes, including traditional stocks, bonds, and tokenized real-world assets like real estate and commodities. This broad asset selection allows investors to build diversified portfolios, reducing risk while maximizing potential returns. With low transaction fees and leverage options, RCOF ensures a flexible and profitable trading environment. Another key advantage is RCO Finance’s commitment to user privacy through its no-KYC policy. This allows users to engage with the platform without identity verification barriers, enabling seamless access to DeFi features such as borrowing & lending, staking, and crypto debit cards while maintaining full anonymity. Additionally, RCO Finance has launched its beta platform , giving users a firsthand look at its capabilities, an uncommon move for DeFi projects still in their presale phase. Continuous improvements are planned to further optimize functionality and user experience. RCOF Token: Blending Utilities with Massive Growth Potential XRP and Ethereum whales have shifted their focus to the RCOF token, drawn by its robust offerings and strong growth potential. Early investors in RCOF stand to benefit from multiple features, including liquidity provisions, governance rights, staking rewards with a 10% APY, and up to 1000x leverage. This makes the token a highly attractive investment option. However, RCOF Token offers beyond its extensive utility, with security and reliability as key factors driving investor confidence. RCOF’s smart contract has been certified secure after successfully passing a rigorous audit by SolidProof, a leading security firm. This trust is evident in the project’s strong presale performance, with over $12.69 million raised and more than 50 million tokens sold so far. Currently priced at $0.10 per token in its fifth presale stage, RCOF’s value is set to rise to $0.13 in the next stage, with further momentum expected upon its official listing. Hence, analysts predict a potential 30,000% surge post-listing. This means that even a modest $100 investment could potentially yield $30,000 or more, offering investors massive ROI. Invest in RCO Finance for Generational Wealth Building Despite the crypto market recovery, XRP and Ethereum whales are increasingly turning to RCO Finance (RCOF) as a high-potential investment choice. Offering a clear path to significant returns, RCOF stands out with its AI-powered platform, real-world asset integration, user-friendly ecosystem, and unmatched leverage opportunities. Investors can also claim a 40% bonus on token purchases using the code “WELCOME40”. For those who missed earlier presale stages, presale stage five presents a prime low-entry opportunity to join the expanding ecosystem. RCO Finance has over 10,000 users already onboard, signifying rapid growing adoption signals strong market confidence. Additionally, continuous enhancements to its beta version and the upcoming AI-powered Robo Advisor’s advanced monitoring capabilities further solidify the asset potential to deliver long-term wealth-building opportunities.

By mid-morning Hong Kong time, BTC was down 8%, trading above $93,100, according to CoinDesk Indices data . Meanwhile, ether (ETH) is down nearly 20% , trading at $2,500, while SOL is down 13% at $184 . XRP is down 28% and trading at $2 . The CoinDesk 20 (CD20) , an index of the largest digital assets, is down nearly 17%. Trump's memecoin (TRUMP) is down 12%. Data from CoinGlass shows that over the last 12 hours nearly $1.3 billion in long positions have been liquidated, with around $400 million in long ether positions and $300 million in long BTC positions. The market correction stems from a trade war that has seemingly been ignited by U.S. President Donald Trump with 25% tariffs being placed on Canada and Mexico. Many market observers are skeptical about the benefits of tariffs, with a Wall Street Journal editorial board op-ed calling it the ""Dumbest Trade War in History"" over the weekend. Brussels said that the European Union would respond firmly to any tariffs imposed on its member states. “Tariffs create unnecessary economic disruption and drive inflation. They are hurtful to all sides,” Politico quoted a spokesperson as saying . The U.K. seems to be the only nation that's able to get a reprieve from tariffs, with Trump saying a deal can be ""worked out"" according to the BBC .

With its presale still in its early stages, this excitement goes beyond mere speculation; it reflects the emergence of a vibrant and engaged community rooted in the principles of unity, growth and enjoyment, all inspired by the legendary Panshibi Pandas. Shiba Inu Trading Volume Explodes: 18 Trillion SHIB Tokens Change Hands Shiba Inu has seen a huge increase in trading activity, with over 18 trillion tokens involved, amounting to about $334.44 million. This rise in trading interest shows that more investors are getting involved, even though the price has dropped. Currently, the SHIB price is trading at $0.0000189, reflecting a 7.06% decline over the past week, yet it continues to attract positive sentiment among investors. Some analysts believe a significant SHIB price jump might happen soon, as traders prepare to take advantage of potential gains. A lot of this trading is happening on Gate.io, which accounts for 81.03% of the total trading volume—around 14.77 trillion tokens worth $271.03 million whilst other platforms like Bitget and OKX have smaller shares. A recent hint from Shytoshi Kusama about an upcoming important partnership has also sparked interest. Although details are scarce, this suggestion has led some investors to feel optimistic about future SHIB price increases. Moreover, after a week of losses, Shiba Inu’s price recently showed a small increase, further boosting trader confidence. Panshibi: Invest in a Community, Not Just a Coin When you invest in Panshibi , you’re not merely making a financial transaction; you’re stepping into an opportunity where everyone collaborates for success, creating a sense of belonging and shared purpose. Panshibi’s ecosystem is packed with exciting features designed to keep holders engaged and rewarded. With governance options, high-yield staking that can reach up to 1,200% APY, and innovative AI-driven “social-fi” elements, there’s something for everyone to enjoy. Safety is paramount, too—Panshibi has locked its liquidity pool for ten years, providing stability, while team tokens are secured for two years. The smart contract has undergone a thorough audit by Coinsult, reinforcing the project’s commitment to transparency and security. The vision for Panshibi extends beyond mere investment; it aims to build an online community where crypto enthusiasts from around the globe can connect and thrive. This platform will allow members to engage in various tasks and activities, offering opportunities to earn rewards while learning about the meme market. It’s a space where sharing knowledge and experiences can lead to both personal growth and collective success. Conclusion The fervor surrounding Panshibi reflects a broader trend within the cryptocurrency community, particularly among Shiba Inu holders eager to take advantage of the potential for substantial gains. With just 51 days left in the presale, which has already raised over $320,000, now is the perfect time to act. Currently priced at $0.003, the next price jump is set for $0.004, with the anticipated listing price at $0.026. Some analysts even speculate that $SHIBI could see an astonishing 145,000% surge by 2025, making it an attractive opportunity in the upcoming altcoin season.

While there’s no shortage of options in this rapidly evolving space, a few projects stand out with their innovative approaches and immense growth potential. Among them, Qubetics , Chainlink, and AAVE are setting themselves apart. Whether you’re looking for the next big blockchain technology, an altcoin that’s reshaping financial ecosystems, or a DeFi project that’s making waves, these three cryptos offer solid opportunities for anyone wanting to dip their toes into the crypto market. The surge in blockchain-based projects has been undeniable, and the shift towards decentralized finance (DeFi), cross-border transactions, and tokenization of assets is only growing. While traditional financial systems have struggled to meet the needs of modern businesses and individuals, these blockchain projects have the power to bridge that gap. From revolutionizing global transactions to empowering individuals with secure and transparent financial services, the best cryptos to buy now are those that have real-world applications and long-term scalability. Let’s talk about Qubetics and how it’s addressing real-world challenges, with a keen focus on cross-border transactions and its upcoming presale stages. Qubetics isn’t just another cryptocurrency; it’s a platform designed to enable decentralized applications (dApps) and bring true blockchain utility to various industries. In this article, we will break down the offerings of Qubetics , Chainlink, and AAVE to show how each one uniquely contributes to the digital finance space and why they deserve a place in your portfolio. Qubetics: The Future of Blockchain Technology and Cross-Border Transactions When it comes to finding the best cryptos to buy now , Qubetics ($TICS) should be at the top of your list. In its 20th presale stage, Qubetics has already sold more than 457 million tokens to over 18,000 holders, raising a whopping $11.7 million. Its growth trajectory speaks volumes about the trust investors have in its potential. At a presale price of $0.0667 per token, this blockchain platform promises massive returns as the project progresses. The market is buzzing about its unique features, and the analysts’ predictions are showing just how much upside Qubetics has. What sets Qubetics apart from the competition is its ability to facilitate seamless cross-border transactions , which is a game-changer for businesses, professionals, and individuals globally. With traditional financial systems lagging in terms of speed and accessibility, Qubetics uses blockchain to make international transfers faster, cheaper, and more secure. This is especially important for businesses that need to transfer funds across borders without the usual delays and high fees that come with conventional banking methods. In addition, Qubetics provides a unique platform for asset tokenization, allowing users to easily fractionalize and trade real-world assets. This level of accessibility is groundbreaking, particularly for small businesses and individuals who have never had the chance to invest in high-value assets like real estate or rare collectibles. Tokenization opens up the possibility for a truly decentralized, transparent, and secure economy. With its innovative approach, Qubetics is solving many of the problems that other projects and financial systems have failed to address. The Qubetics presale is in full swing, and with its stage 20 price of $0.0667 per token, now’s the time to jump in. By the end of its presale journey, $TICS is forecasted to touch $0.25, offering investors a 274.70% ROI right out of the gate. If the token rides the post-presale wave to $1, those early adopters could be looking at a 1,398.82% gain. And if it reaches the $5 mark, as analysts suggest, that’s a 7,394.11% return—a number that should make anyone sit up and pay attention. Things get even more intense once the Mainnet is live. A climb to $10 would mean early investors rake in a 14,888.23% return, and if $TICS skyrockets to $15, we’re talking about a mind-blowing 22,382.34% ROI—the kind of upside that’s impossible to ignore. Chainlink: Powering the Future of Decentralized Oracle Networks If you’re considering the best cryptos to buy now, Chainlink (LINK) is a well-established player with a strong reputation in the blockchain space. Founded in 2017, Chainlink is the leading decentralized oracle network that enables smart contracts to securely interact with external data sources, APIs, and payment systems. In a world where smart contracts are increasingly being used in everything from insurance to supply chain management, Chainlink’s role in providing secure and reliable data to these contracts is crucial. What makes Chainlink stand out is its ability to bring real-world data to the blockchain. While blockchains are known for their security and immutability, they are generally closed ecosystems that can’t access information from outside sources. Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network solves this problem by linking smart contracts to external data feeds, allowing for a wide range of use cases. This capability is particularly important for decentralized finance (DeFi), where the accuracy and timeliness of data can make or break a transaction. For businesses and developers, Chainlink is a go-to solution for building decentralized applications that require reliable data. With major partnerships in place, including with Google Cloud, SWIFT, and many others, Chainlink has solidified itself as one of the best cryptos to buy now for anyone looking to be part of the future of decentralized finance and blockchain technology. AAVE: Leading the Charge in DeFi Lending and Borrowing When talking about the best cryptos to buy now, AAVE has quickly become one of the top contenders for anyone interested in decentralized finance. AAVE is a decentralized lending protocol that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies without relying on centralized banks or financial institutions. This innovative platform is revolutionizing how people access liquidity and offers a more open and transparent alternative to traditional lending. AAVE’s unique features include its ability to offer users the ability to lend assets and earn interest or borrow assets with collateral. It also provides users with the ability to access liquidity pools, where they can trade assets and earn fees. With its focus on creating a fully decentralized lending and borrowing platform, AAVE is changing the way people think about finance. It’s part of the broader DeFi movement, which aims to provide financial services to individuals who may not have access to traditional banking systems. AAVE’s token (AAVE) plays a central role in the protocol, allowing holders to participate in governance decisions and earn rewards. With its innovative approach and growing popularity, AAVE has proven to be one of the best cryptos to buy now for anyone looking to take part in the DeFi revolution. Cross-Border Transactions and the Future of Qubetics Now that you’ve seen how Qubetics , Chainlink, and AAVE are making their mark, it’s time to dive deeper into Qubetics’ unique offering—cross-border transactions. As the world becomes more interconnected, the need for secure, fast, and inexpensive ways to send money across borders is more crucial than ever. Traditional systems often involve high fees, long wait times, and limited access to certain countries or regions. Qubetics is changing that by leveraging blockchain technology to make cross-border transactions faster, cheaper, and more secure. This innovation will have a major impact on businesses operating in different parts of the world. Whether you’re a small business looking to send payments to suppliers in another country or an individual needing to transfer money to a family member abroad, Qubetics makes it simple. By removing the need for intermediaries and using smart contracts, Qubetics ensures that transactions are transparent, efficient, and cost-effective. This could be a game-changer for global commerce and could significantly disrupt traditional financial systems. Conclusion: Why Qubetics, Chainlink, and AAVE Are Among the Best Cryptos to Buy Now In conclusion, if you’re on the hunt for the best cryptos to buy now, Qubetics, Chainlink, and AAVE all offer unique value propositions that cater to the future of finance and blockchain technology. Whether you’re interested in cross-border transactions, decentralized finance, or the integration of real-world data into smart contracts, these projects have what it takes to thrive in the digital economy. For anyone looking to make a smart investment and be part of the blockchain revolution, now is the time to get involved.

Despite that, meme coins achieved the highest growth rate in the crypto market, delivering over 1,300% average returns, before encountering major market difficulties. The explosive growth phase of meme coins carries significant market dangers, and financial experts forecast a forthcoming “disillusionment phase.” Shiba Inu and Dogwifhat face substantial market instability, which leads investors to shift their focus to Panshibi (SHIBI) , which promises rapid expansion and potential 50x returns. Can The Dogs Regain Community Traction? The meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB), which its community defines as the DOGE killer, achieved rapid success as a major digital asset after emerging as a dog-themed token. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been somewhat overwhelming over the past several months, crashing amid the broader bearish market wave. Also, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has not shown great recovery strength, and investors may be diversifying into promising new meme coin projects. As of this writing, the Shiba Inu price is at $0.00001796, having dropped over 15% in the past month. As experts make bullish Shiba Inu price predictions for the 2025 bull market, attention is turning to Panshibi (SHIBI) for its cheaper entry and high-profit margins. Like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-themed meme coin on the Solana network. Dogwifhat (WIF) quickly rose to prominence in 2023, building most of its community strength through 2024. Today, experts believe Dogwifhat (WIF) presents some potential for gains in the coming meme coin season, but recent market trends have not been so kind on the meme coin. As of this writing, Dogwifhat (WIF) is trading at $0.9907, with a tragic 40% loss over the past month. Despite the 204% gains on the yearly chart, recent market trends have forced investors to cut losses on the meme coin in pursuit of other market opportunities. Panshibi (SHIBI) Renews Investors In Meme Coins With Panda Memes Experts believe investors now face their best chance for life-changing gains yet with Panshibi (SHIBI). The new meme coin stands out as a transformative digital asset that looks to redefine the typical meme coin comic for 2025 Panshibi surpasses the meme coin trend to generate massive future possibilities. This pioneering token uses panda iconography based on Asian mythology to deliver a distinct offering to market participants. The token sale began at $0.002, and investors can expect 1,200% returns during a 60-day limited period until $10 million is reached. Through extensive tokenomics, the project establishes outstanding protection for investors. Coinsult performed the smart contract audit and locked the liquidity pool for ten years, with team tokens secured for two years. Following the presale period, the project team will relinquish control of smart contract ownership to achieve unparalleled transparency for investors. Crypto specialists remain positive, with forecasts pointing toward a possible 5,000% return by June. According to CoinGecko’s 2024 analysis, Panshibi stands ready to profit from the significant trend of meme coins, accounting for 31% of crypto investments. The token provides groundbreaking features such as 1,200% APY on staked tokens, AI community strategies in social finance, and governance participation with an exclusive VIP club for presale investors. As the crypto market prepares to surge in 2025, Panshibi stands as an entry-level opportunity for high returns this year. Early investors stand to gain enormous profits from potential exchange listings later this year alongside the expanding social media interest. The project secured over $75,000 from its launch in two days, which shows great interest in the market and potential growth. Conclusion The present market conditions offer investors a special chance to profit from new developments in the meme coin industry. Panshibi emerges as a ripe investment option amid the struggles of Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogwifhat (WIF). Panshibi’s fresh panda-themed idea, combined with strong tokenomics, positions it to take a large market share. The presale price of Panshibi is still in stage 2 at an affordable $0.003, and experts predict it will lead the memecoin to substantial future profits.

Solana enjoyed major success in 2024, surpassing Ethereum and other networks on various metrics, such as daily active users, monthly transfer volume, and more. Although it is mostly referred to as a memecoin chain, it has attracted interest from institutional adopters like Blackrock, Bitwise, and Grayscale. As a top defi token, many analysts have tipped Solana to continue its impressive dominance from last year and be among the top performers in 2025. They’ve also predicted that Remittix , a new crypto, could have a tremendous year due to the rising demand for PayFi products. Remittix is currently on presale and is on course to hit its $36 million target shortly. Remittix Presale Stuns Altcoin Fans The pace at which Remitixx’s presale is going has shocked fans of major altcoins throughout the industry. In only a few weeks since its presale began, Remittix has generated over $10.5 million and looks set to hit its $36 million target shortly. The Remittix team said they expect the presale to sell out due to the growing demand for PayFi solutions. Remittix combines centralized and decentralized payment methods and is a potential leader in the PayFi category. With Remittix, users can send money in crypto and have it delivered as FIAT to merchants or anyone else. This eradicates the offramping process, leading to a smoother, better experience. Currently available for $0.0521, Remittix is a low-risk, high-reward investment option heading into the bull market. Over 430 million tokens have been sold from the 750 million allocation for the presale, meaning interested investors don’t have much time before the presale ends. Solana Receives Institutional Backing The number of institutional investors interested in Solana is growing daily. In January, several venture firms applied for a Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF), including Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary Capital and VanEck. Alongside high-cap altcoins like XRP and Litecoin, Solana is most likely to receive an ETF allocation shortly. Investors will be hoping any ETF approvals happen sooner rather than later as it could trigger the next SOL price rally. The previous SOL price rally came after US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump launched memecoins on Solana on the inauguration weekend. Solana surged to a new all-time high shortly after, causing a flurry of Solana price predictions from analysts and investors alike. However, the joy was short-lived after Solana quickly rebounded. The token is now at peak bear market levels heading into the new month. But, with a scheduled network upgrade called Firedancer coming up, another SOL price rally seems likely. Conclusion Institutional support for Solana is growing amid the latest struggles, which is a good sign of investor confidence and overall positive sentiment. A major win like an ETF approval could very well be the catalyst for sending the SOL price surging once again. Meanwhile, Remittix performs impressively in its presale and has already surpassed $10.5 million. The next milestone for the presale is the $36 million mark which it could hit shortly. With over 400 million from the 750 million tokens allocated for the Remittix presale already sold, the Remittix presale could end soon. Join the presale and community now!

39849014,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=125930,1738549375,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Forex Funding Revolution: How Funded Forex Programs Are Changing the Game,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/forex-funding/,"Forex Funding: A Game-Changer for Aspiring Traders The forex funding industry has witnessed significant growth, offering traders access to substantial capital without risking their own money. Programs such as True Forex Funds , Infinity Forex Funds , and My Forex Funds are leading the charge, revolutionizing the way traders engage with the foreign exchange market. With proprietary trading firms providing funded accounts, traders now have the chance to scale their strategies and maximize profits while minimizing financial risk. The concept of funded forex accounts is no longer a luxury but a necessity for those who want to make a mark in the forex industry. What Is Forex Funding? Forex funding allows traders to access capital from proprietary trading firms, eliminating the need for significant personal investment. These firms evaluate traders through a qualification process, typically involving a demo trading challenge where traders must demonstrate their skills in a risk-controlled environment. Once traders pass the evaluation, they receive a funded forex account, enabling them to trade with the firm’s capital and earn a profit share. Programs like The Forex Funder and My Funded Forex have gained popularity due to their structured evaluations and fair trading conditions. How True Forex Funds and Infinity Forex Funds Are Leading the Market Among the many proprietary trading firms, True Forex Funds and Infinity Forex Funds stand out for their transparent evaluation processes and trader-friendly conditions. True Forex Funds Offers a structured evaluation with realistic profit targets. Provides traders with up to 90% profit splits. Allows diverse trading styles, including scalping, swing trading, and day trading. Infinity Forex Funds Focuses on giving traders a seamless funding experience. Offers competitive trading conditions with minimal restrictions. Enables traders to withdraw profits quickly and efficiently. Both firms empower traders by giving them the opportunity to grow their capital without financial constraints. The Rise of Forex Funder and My Forex Funds Programs such as Forex Funder and My Forex Funds have gained traction due to their trader-friendly funding models. Forex Funder provides traders with flexible trading options, allowing them to use expert advisors (EAs) and leverage different trading strategies. My Forex Funds offers various funding models, including rapid funding options where traders can skip the evaluation phase. These firms have democratized forex trading, ensuring that skilled traders can access capital regardless of their financial background. Why Funded Forex Accounts Are Changing the Industry The traditional forex trading landscape required traders to risk their own capital, often leading to significant financial losses. However, funded forex accounts have eliminated this barrier, offering several advantages: Risk-Free Trading: Traders use firm capital, protecting their personal funds. Higher Profit Potential: Large capital access allows traders to maximize gains. No Personal Losses: Any losses incurred are covered by the funding firm. Scalability: Successful traders can receive increased capital allocations over time. The emergence of fast forex funding options has further accelerated industry growth, enabling traders to receive funding within days instead of weeks. Forex Fundamental Analysis: A Key to Success Even with a funded forex account, traders must rely on forex fundamental analysis to make informed decisions. Understanding macroeconomic indicators, interest rates, and geopolitical events is crucial for sustained profitability. Key Aspects of Fundamental Analysis Forex Traders Should Know Interest Rates: Higher interest rates typically strengthen a currency, while lower rates weaken it. Inflation Reports: High inflation can erode currency value, impacting forex movements. Employment Data: Strong job reports can boost a currency, while weak reports can cause depreciation. Geopolitical Events: Political instability can lead to market volatility. By mastering fundamental analysis forex traders can enhance their decision-making and improve their performance with funded forex accounts. Is Fast Forex Funding the Future? The concept of fast forex funding is gaining momentum, as traders seek quicker access to capital. Firms are now offering instant funding models, reducing the wait time for traders to start trading live accounts. Advantages of Fast Forex Funding Immediate access to trading capital. No lengthy evaluation processes. Quick profit withdrawals. Flexible trading conditions. As technology advances, fast forex funding is expected to become the norm, further enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of proprietary trading firms. Conclusion The evolution of forex funding has created a new era of opportunities for traders. Programs such as True Forex Funds , Infinity Forex Funds , The Forex Funder , and My Forex Funds have redefined the forex landscape, providing traders with the capital they need to succeed. With a focus on risk-free trading, higher profit potential, and the integration of forex fundamental analysis , the funded forex industry is set to continue its rapid growth.

Bonk, a Solana-based meme coin, made headlines with its rapid ascent, rewarding early investors handsomely. A new contender, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) , is emerging, promising an adventurous journey and the potential for substantial returns. Let’s explore these two intriguing projects and why Arctic Pablo might be the best meme coin to join in 2025. Arctic Pablo Coin: Embarking on a Mythical Crypto Adventure Enter Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), a fresh and captivating entrant in the meme coin arena. Inspired by the adventurous spirit of its namesake, Arctic Pablo invites investors to join a mythical expedition through frostbitten terrains and enigmatic ice-covered islands. But this isn’t just about storytelling; Arctic Pablo combines narrative with innovative financial incentives, positioning itself as the best meme coin to join in 2025 . The presale structure is uniquely designed as a journey through various “locations,” with each phase representing a new destination and an increase in token price. Arctic Pablo has reached Shangri-La, the eighth phase of its expedition. Early investors have already witnessed impressive returns, with the presale raising over $800,000. One of the standout features of Arctic Pablo is its staking program, offering a dazzling 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY). Investors can stake their APC tokens and watch their investments grow, enjoying generous rewards while actively participating in the project’s journey. All staked coins are vested for two months from the launch date, ensuring stability and long-term commitment. The tokenomics of Arctic Pablo are meticulously crafted to promote scarcity and value appreciation. The total supply is capped at 221,200,000,000 APC, with 50% allocated for the public presale. A weekly token burn mechanism permanently eliminates unsold tokens during the presale, fostering a deflationary environment that enhances investor value and ensures long-term sustainability. Moreover, Arctic Pablo’s referral incentives program allows participants to earn rewards by spreading the word, creating a powerful growth cycle and reward for early supporters. This community-driven approach fuels hype and solidifies Arctic Pablo’s place as a promising investment opportunity. Bonk: The Meteoric Rise of a Solana-Based Meme Coin Bonk burst onto the scene as the first Solana dog coin, created “for the people, by the people.” With 50% of its total supply airdropped to the Solana community, it aimed to foster a fair distribution and community-driven growth. This strategy paid off, as early adopters saw significant gains. At its peak in November 2024, Bonk reached an all-time high of $0.00005825, marking a remarkable journey from its inception. However, like many meme coins, Bonk’s price experienced volatility. As of January 31, 2025, it was trading at approximately $0.00002481, reflecting a decline from its peak but still maintaining a substantial market capitalization. The community’s enthusiasm and strategic token burns—such as the “BURNmas” event where BonkDAO announced plans to burn 1.69 trillion BONK tokens—helped sustain interest and support the token’s value. Bonk’s journey underscores meme coin investments’ potential rewards and inherent risks. Early participants reaped significant benefits, but the volatility serves as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of such assets. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin emerges as a standout contender in the meme coin landscape. Its innovative approach, combining a captivating narrative with strategic financial incentives, sets it apart from predecessors like Bonk. The structured presale, high APY staking, and deflationary mechanisms offer a unique investment opportunity with the potential for substantial returns. Don’t miss out on this thrilling expedition. Join the Arctic Pablo presale now and embark on a journey where the cold meets the mystical, and every coin holds the promise of adventure.

However, recent network instability and centralization concerns have raised red flags for investors seeking long-term stability. As Solana grapples with technical vulnerabilities, many traders are looking for safer, high-growth alternatives—and Lightchain AI , which is building on Polygon’s robust infrastructure, is quickly emerging as the smart money move. Currently priced at $0.005625 in presale with $14 million raised, Lightchain AI combines the best of AI, blockchain efficiency, and Polygon’s proven scalability, making it a standout investment choice in 2025. Biggest Weakness of Solana – Network Failures & Centralization Solana’s biggest issue has always been its reliability. Despite its impressive speed, the network has experienced frequent outages, with over a dozen incidents causing disruptions that sometimes last hours or even days. These downtimes, especially during periods of high demand, have hurt user trust and raised questions about the network’s long-term stability. Another major concern is Solana’s over-reliance on centralized validators. A significant portion of staking power is concentrated among a few entities, leading to criticisms about its lack of true decentralization. This centralization undermines the core principles of blockchain technology and poses risks for network security. Finally, Solana faces congestion issues during peak usage. While designed for high throughput, its single-layer structure creates bottlenecks, limiting efficiency. For investors prioritizing scalability and reliability, Solana’s challenges make alternatives like Lightchain AI on Polygon a safer long-term option. Why Lightchain AI on Polygon Is the Better Investment As Solana grapples with instability, Lightchain AI is stepping ahead by leveraging Polygon’s reliable Layer-2 infrastructure to deliver a faster, more scalable, and AI-integrated blockchain experience. Unlike Solana, Polygon’s Layer-2 solutions process transactions off-chain while still benefiting from Ethereum’s robust security, ensuring no network outages. This scalability provides Lightchain AI with a solid foundation to support mass adoption without the risk of technical failures. Lightchain AI isn’t just another blockchain project—it’s pioneering the integration of artificial intelligence to enhance data processing, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (dApps). This unique combination of AI and blockchain gives it a technological edge over both Solana and Polygon, promising greater efficiency and innovation for the future. One of its standout features is the Memecoin Launchpad, a platform empowering creators and developers to monetize their ideas seamlessly. By providing AI-driven tools in a secure and flexible environment, Lightchain AI is fueling a thriving creative economy. This approach unlocks new opportunities, driving innovation and building an ecosystem where ideas can flourish. Future-Proof Investment As Solana struggles with ongoing technical issues, investors are setting their sights on an exciting new opportunity: Lightchain AI on Polygon. Offering long-term stability, unmatched scalability, and seamless AI integration, Lightchain AI is quickly becoming the go-to choice for forward-thinking investors aiming to stay ahead of the curve in 2025. Why is Lightchain AI the smart bet? It’s not just about reliability—this project combines real-world utility with AI-driven efficiency to create a future-proof investment. With zero downtime and a cutting-edge approach to blockchain, Lightchain AI is poised to revolutionize decentralized intelligence. The numbers speak for themselves – a 10 billion token supply strategically allocated to ensure sustainability. Here’s the breakdown – 40% for presale, 28.5% for staking rewards, 15% for liquidity, 5% for marketing, 6.5% for the treasury, and 5% for the team. Every detail is designed for long-term growth. Lightchain AI isn’t just solving blockchain issues like scalability and privacy—it’s setting the stage for real-world applications powered by AI. For anyone searching for an innovative, high-growth alternative to Solana, Lightchain AI is the future you don’t want to miss. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,SOL|MATIC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-03 03:00:00

BITCOIN, XRP, and OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM Could Be the Answer!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/500-to-seven-figures-bitcoin-xrp-and-officialmagacoin-com-could-be-the-answer/,"While Bitcoin (BTC) proved it’s possible by delivering exponential returns to early investors, the spotlight now shines on OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a newcomer that could replicate such success. With a presale price under $0.20 and a rapid rise in popularity, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is capturing the imagination of crypto enthusiasts who believe that $300 today could turn into $999,000 in the near future. Why OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Transform Your Investment 1. Early-Stage Opportunity OFFICIALMAGACOIN is still in its presale phase, offering a ground-floor opportunity for investors to buy in before the token gains mainstream attention. This is the stage where gains of 1,000x or more become achievable, as seen with Bitcoin in its early days. 2. Exclusive AvailabilityUnlike widely distributed coins, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand, ensuring that early adopters benefit as interest surges. 3. Record-Breaking Presale SuccessRaising over $1 million in presale funds in record time, OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven its appeal among investors. Such strong initial support is a hallmark of projects poised for explosive growth. 4. Massive Growth PotentialExperts are predicting OFFICIALMAGACOIN could follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps, transforming small investments into extraordinary returns. With its low entry price and strong market momentum, the potential for turning $300 into $999,000 feels more achievable than ever. How It Stacks Up Against SOL, MATIC, KAS, and BTC Bitcoin (BTC): A proven store of value, but its days of exponential growth are behind it. Solana (SOL): Fast and scalable, but its market is maturing, making massive gains less likely. Polygon (MATIC): A strong performer in Ethereum scaling, but it lacks the exclusivity and newness of OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An up-and-coming blockchain project with potential but without the momentum OFFICIALMAGACOIN is generating. Don’t Miss Out on OFFICIALMAGACOIN The chance to turn $300 into $999K doesn’t come often, but OFFICIALMAGACOIN might just be that opportunity. With its affordable price, exclusivity, and massive growth potential, it’s a must-watch for 2025. Secure your tokens now at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM and stay updated on their journey via Twitter/X.

Bitcoin (BTC) Plummets to $91K as Crypto Market Liquidations Hit $1.8 Billion Bitcoin (BTC) plunged below the $91,200 mark on February 3, its lowest level in 20 days. This decline follows mounting economic concerns sparked by former U.S. President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada, which have triggered widespread financial market turbulence. As fears of rising consumer prices escalate, social media reports suggest that American consumers are preparing for inflation by stockpiling essential goods. This has led to a shift in retail investor sentiment, with many liquidating riskier assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies in favor of more stable stores of value. Crypto Market Liquidations, Feb 3, 2025 | Source: Coinglass.com As depicted above, Crypto market liquidations have exceeded $1.8 billion as BTC price plunged 7% in the last 24 hours, signaling unusually heavy capitulation from large investors. This suggests that Bitcoin institutional investors are also responding to inflation risks, anticipating that the U.S. Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner than expected. This has led many to shift capital toward government bonds before interest rate hikes push prices higher. Combined, these factors have exacerbated selling pressure in the crypto market, driving Bitcoin’s price down by 11% over the past three days. Key Bitcoin (BTC) Price Levels to Watch Amid the ongoing crypto market downturn, some crucial BTC trading signals indicate key levels that could be pivotal to Bitcoin price action as the week progresses. Coinglass Liquidation Map Shows BTC’s Strongest Support Level Lies at $90,360 Bitcoin started the week under pressure due to the bearish sentiment surrounding the escalating trade war. Many U.S.-based traders likely set sell orders over the weekend, anticipating further downward movement as markets opened on Monday. This could result in heightened volatility in the early trading hours. Coinglass’ liquidation map provides insight into the critical price levels where traders have placed leveraged positions. The chart displays Bitcoin’s aggregated leverage positions over the last 30 days, revealing key areas where liquidation events are likely. Bitcoin (BTC) Liquidation Map | Source: Coinglass The data suggests that bearish sentiment dominates, with $11.9 billion in short positions far exceeding the $3.04 billion in long positions. This confirms expectations of further downside risk. However, bullish traders have concentrated $2.12 billion in leverage at the $90,358 level, accounting for 70% of total long leverage positions. This indicates strong potential support around $90,500, as traders seek to defend their positions from liquidation losses. Other key support zones include $93,000 and $94,330, where long positions total $1 billion and $330 million, respectively. If Bitcoin’s price approaches these levels, we could see increased buying activity aimed at stabilizing the market. Nevertheless, a prolonged bearish trend could persist unless global economic conditions improve or influential market participants intervene to stabilize sentiment. The Double-Bottom Pattern Signals a Potential Breakout Toward $108,000 While the prevailing market sentiment remains bearish due to macroeconomic pressures, certain technical indicators suggest the possibility of a Bitcoin price recovery. The double-bottom pattern observed in recent trading activity hints at a potential breakout target of $108,000, provided market sentiment shifts positively. Savvy investors might capitalize on the current price dip, increasing their Bitcoin holdings around the $90,300, $93,000, and $94,300 support levels. Some Bitcoin maximalists believe that prolonged trade tensions could drive sovereign entities to seek BTC as an inflation hedge. Notably, the Czech Republic and Bhutan have recently explored Bitcoin acquisitions, and U.S. states and corporations may increasingly turn to blockchain solutions to circumvent trade barriers. Bitcoin Price Forecast: Can BTC Rebound to $108K? From a technical analysis standpoint, Bitcoin price forecast shows BTC trading near recent significant lows highlighted double-bottom pattern, which often precedes a bullish breakout. In terms of key levels to watch, BTC must maintains support above $90,500 to keep alive rebound hopes of reclaiming the $96,150 territory. If the trade war sparks a BTC buying frenzy among nations and institutions, the ensuing BTC price recovery could gain enough momentum to test the $102,000-$105,000 range. A sustained rally above these levels could open the door to the $108,000 breakout target. Key Bitcoin (BTC) Price Levels to Watch: BTC/USD | TradingView The Bollinger Bands indicator also highlights key resistance levels that Bitcoin must overcome to reclaim bullish momentum. The upper band suggests significant resistance at $105,800, followed by a more substantial barrier near $108,000. If Bitcoin can consolidate above these levels, it may establish a new bullish trend, counteracting the recent downturn. In Summary: While Bitcoin’s 11% decline in 3 consecutive losing days has rattled investors with $1.8 billion market liquidations. However, key technical indicators point to potential support around $90,500 and possible recovery scenarios. The ongoing trade war and economic uncertainty continue to influence market sentiment, but long-term investors and institutional players could take advantage of lower prices. Should positive sentiment return, Bitcoin could break out toward $108,000, reinforcing its status as a politically-neutral asset.

As meme tokens continue to dominate the crypto market, BTFD Coin (BTFD), Dogwifhat (WIF), and Notcoin (NOT) are catching serious attention from investors. Dogwifhat is leveraging Solana’s fast blockchain for high-speed transactions, while Notcoin is reshaping play-to-earn gaming with its viral Telegram-based model. But the real spotlight is on BTFD Coin, which has already raised over $5.9 million in its presale, securing its place as the best meme to invest before 2025’s bull run. Meme coins are no longer just for fun—they’re big business. With strong community backing, innovative ecosystems, and high investor engagement, these tokens are creating massive profit opportunities. BTFD Coin is leading the charge with its presale momentum and analyst predictions, while Dogwifhat and Notcoin bring unique value propositions to the meme coin space. Let’s break down why these tokens are dominating the market right now. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Presale That’s Breaking Records Investors always hunt for meme coins with serious growth potential, and BTFD Coin is delivering exactly that. The project is in Stage 14 of its presale, where tokens are priced at $0.00016 each. Once the presale ends, BTFD Coin will be listed at $0.0006, giving early investors a guaranteed 275% gain. But the real moonshot target is $0.006, which would turn even a modest investment into a fortune. Why is BTFD Coin the best meme to invest in right now? Analysts predict that BTFD could be the next big meme coin breakout, especially with its play-to-earn game and staking rewards. The P2E game launched in January 2025 and is already seeing huge traction. Meanwhile, its staking rewards offer 90% APY, attracting serious investors who want to earn passive income while holding their tokens. The BTFD Coin presale is already a massive success. Over 68 billion tokens have been sold, with more than 10,200 holders already on board. And with the LAUNCH100 bonus code, investors can double their token holdings instantly. This is an unmatched opportunity to get in before the real bull run starts. To invest in BTFD Coin, buyers simply need to set up a MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB or ETH, and head to the presale page . Entering the LAUNCH100 bonus code doubles their tokens, and once the presale ends, tokens can be claimed and staked for rewards. A $3,000 investment at $0.00016 per token buys 18,750,000 BTFD coins. When the price reaches $0.0006, that investment jumps to $11,250. If it hits $0.006, the return skyrockets to $112,500. With staking and early presale benefits, this is one of the most explosive opportunities in crypto right now. Dogwifhat (WIF) – The Solana-Powered Meme Sensation Dogwifhat (WIF) is one of the hottest meme coins on Solana, quickly becoming a favorite among traders and meme lovers. With a simple yet powerful branding—a dog in a pink beanie—Dogwifhat has built a massive following, helping its price surge. Unlike older meme coins, Dogwifhat benefits from Solana’s high-speed, low-cost transactions, making it a favorite among traders who want quick, efficient meme coin swaps. This has helped WIF see a surge in trading volume, keeping it in the spotlight as one of the best meme to invest in 2025. The biggest driver of Dogwifhat’s growth is its community. With constant Twitter trends, viral memes, and influencer endorsements, WIF has cemented its place as one of the strongest Solana meme coins. Investors looking for a high-energy, community-driven token have been stacking WIF, fueling its momentum heading into 2025. Notcoin (NOT) – The Play-to-Earn Revolution on Telegram Notcoin (NOT) is shaking up the meme coin world with its Telegram-based play-to-earn game, allowing players to earn crypto by tapping a virtual coin and completing tasks. This innovative approach has attracted millions of users, making Notcoin one of the fastest-growing meme projects in recent months. With Telegram’s massive user base, Notcoin has a built-in advantage over other meme coins. Players don’t need complex crypto knowledge to start earning, making it one of the most accessible meme tokens on the market. As one of the best meme coins to invest in 2025, Notcoin’s P2E mechanics and large user adoption set it apart. If it continues to expand its in-game economy and partnerships, NOT could see further price surges as more players join the ecosystem. The Bottom Line Based on our research and market trends, the best meme to invest in right now depends on what kind of opportunity investors are looking for. Dogwifhat (WIF) is gaining momentum through Solana’s efficiency and viral meme power, while Notcoin (NOT) is pioneering a new play-to-earn model through Telegram’s massive user base. But BTFD Coin (BTFD) stands out as the most rewarding investment, with its record-breaking presale, analyst-backed growth predictions, and massive staking rewards. With BTFD Coin’s presale at $0.00016 and a projected moonshot price of $0.006, the opportunity is too big to ignore. Investors who act now can capitalize on the LAUNCH100 bonus, doubling their tokens instantly. The Bulls Squad is growing, and the window to buy at this price is closing fast. This is your chance to own the dip before the next bull run. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and lock in your gains before it takes off.

It hit $92,681 less than an hour ago before bouncing slightly to $93,831. That’s a 7% drop. Ether wasn’t spared either, crashing 20% to its lowest point since November. The market meltdown began after President Donald Trump threw his trade-war punch Saturday night. He slapped Canada and Mexico with a 25% tariff and hit China with a 10% duty. The tariffs are set to officially kick in on Tuesday, and the ‘crypto president’ has declared that the tariffs “could get a lot worse” than they are right now. The CoinDesk 20 index, which tracks the biggest 20 crypto by market value, has tumbled by 19% in the past 8 hours. Stocks didn’t sit this one out either. Dow futures fell 463 points. S&P 500 futures lost 1.6%, while Nasdaq-100 futures dropped 2.1%. Investors got hit everywhere, and crypto traders are now eyeing key support at $90,000 for Bitcoin, with fears of another pullback to $80,000 if it crashes below that level. Trump’s tariffs cause fear across markets Per data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US does $1.6 trillion in annual trade with Canada, Mexico, and China, so these tariffs hit a nerve. Stock traders are sweating. Over 120 major companies in the S&P 500, including Alphabet, Amazon, Walt Disney, and Palantir, are set to report their earnings this week. Nobody wants disappointing numbers, but the tariffs have raised that risk. AI stocks, already under scrutiny, are taking this the hardest. Nvidia’s NVDA has lost over 7% of its value. 1. Super Micro’s SMCI plunged by 8.8%, AMD tumbled by 5.1%, and Arm’s ARM lost 6.2%. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq ended last week in the red. But surprisingly, they still closed January with gains—2.7% for the S&P 500 and 4.7% for the Dow. Bitcoin is down 16% from its January high of $109,350. That’s a $16,000 haircut in a matter of days. Experienced crypto traders aren’t surprised though. Bitcoin has a history of corrections, often around 30%, even during bull runs. Arthur Hayes, founder of BitMEX who has been trading Bitcoin since 2011, thinks Bitcoin will benefit in the long term, because a trade war would weaken the US dollar. But the dollar isn’t having a tough time right now though, as it surges by over 1% today, continuing its climb to five-year highs. Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report will add more drama. Economists expect 175,000 new jobs for January, with unemployment sticking at 4.1%. If the numbers come in worse than expected, it could fuel more uncertainty. And guess what? Uncertainty is poison for Bitcoin right now. But according to Trump ? “Anybody that’s against Tariffs, including the Fake News Wall Street Journal, and Hedge Funds, is only against them because these people or entities are controlled by China, or other foreign or domestic companies. Anybody that loves and believes in the United States of America is in favor of Tariffs. They should have never ended, in favor of the Income Tax System, in 1913.

ETH is down over 25% and the bears seem to be in control below $2,770. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $3,000 support zone. The price is trading below $2,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,900 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a recovery wave if it stays above the $2,200 level. Ethereum Price Nosedives Ethereum price started a major decline below the $3,000 level, underperforming Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $2,800 and $2,650 levels to enter a bearish zone. There was a clear move below the $2,500 level. The price declined over 25% and tested the $2,120 zone. A low was formed at $2,127 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $2,300 level. The price surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,403 wing high to the $2,127 swing low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,650 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,770 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,403 wing high to the $2,127 swing low. The main resistance is now forming near $2,900. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,900 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. A clear move above the $2,900 resistance might send the price toward the $3,000 resistance. An upside break above the $3,000 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,150 resistance zone or even $3,250 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,600 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,320 level. The first major support sits near the $2,250. A clear move below the $2,250 support might push the price toward the $2,120 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,000 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,880. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

Bitcoin’s price fell by 5%, which has rippled its way into altcoins. Effective Feb. 1, the U.S. will impose tariffs of 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% on Chinese goods, adding further complexity to the current trade wars. As a result, over the past 24 hours ending on Feb. 3, Bitcoin ( BTC ) has experienced a notable decline amid a market-wide sell-off. The cryptocurrency fell by over 5%, reaching a low of approximately $91,200 before rebounding to around $94,000 as of this writing. Despite this recovery, BTC remains roughly 13% below its all-time high of $109,000, and trading volume has surged by more than 200%, suggesting considerable selling pressure or market panic. Additionally, the overall global crypto market cap has dropped nearly 12% during the same period, settling at about $3.15 trillion. It’s worth noting that following President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, Bitcoin and other altcoins saw a significant price increase. However, since that peak, recent developments—including new tariff policies—have contributed to a drastic decline in market sentiment and asset values. Given Bitcoin’s recent price crash, it has had a cascading effect on altcoins. In the last 24 hours, Ethereum ( ETH ) has fallen by nearly 20%, Ripple ( XRP ) by 22%, Solana ( SOL ) by 8%, and Binance Coin ( BNB ) by over 15%.

This pattern suggests that long-term investors are now selling their coins at lower profits than their purchase price—or even at a loss year-to-date—as illustrated by the Bitcoin: Long Term Holder SOPR chart. Such behavior often indicates capitulation among long-term holders, a phenomenon common during bearish market trends and corrections. Experts, including BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes, have even warned that a “financial crisis” may be on the horizon. 60% of American plebes don’t have $1k of emergency funds. The Fed is “worried” about inflation. So Trump decides to hike energy prices via tariffs? He ain’t a fool, maybe he is trying to trigger a mini financial crisis?

XRP remains strong in a bullish pattern, suggesting a possible surge to new peaks. At the same time, SUI’s expanding network and increased user adoption are driving its price forward, with $4 being a critical support level. However, Web3Bay is a game changer, not merely a blockchain base or a payment coin, but a revolution in e-commerce. Its decentralized marketplace approach is reshaping online shopping, giving power to the users and offering unparalleled ROI. With over $1 million gathered in its presale, Web3Bay’s innovative promise is clearly catching on. Web3Bay: Revolutionizing E-Commerce with Decentralization Web3Bay (3BAY) is transforming the e-commerce landscape. It uses blockchain to create a secure, transparent environment that returns control to users. Unlike the big e-commerce players who dominate the market, Web3Bay champions decentralization, ensuring buyers and sellers manage their data and transactions directly. In the initial weeks of its presale, Web3Bay has already secured over $1 million, demonstrating strong investor trust in its groundbreaking model. With the token priced at $0.004562625 in Stage 4, interest in using blockchain to improve e-commerce transparency, security, and efficiency is clearly on the rise. Web3Bay is addressing market inefficiencies head-on. It cuts out traditional financial middlemen, reducing transaction fees and speeding up operations. Its use of smart contracts guarantees that all deals are secure, fraud-proof, and completed only when all conditions are met, which greatly enhances trust among users. More than just a new platform, Web3Bay is at the forefront of creating a quicker, fairer, and more transparent online shopping experience for all. Its early presale achievements are just a glimpse of the vast potential this innovative platform holds. XRP Price Forecast: Can the Bullish Channel Propel XRP to New Peaks? XRP remains stable in a bullish pattern on the 4-hour chart, demonstrating resilience amid market downturns. This trend hints that XRP might prepare for a significant rise if it maintains important support and resistance levels. Now trading at $3.10, XRP has proven robust, with $2.68 acting as a vital support area. This level has historically triggered strong buying interest, marking it as essential to observe. On the higher side, the $3.70 resistance stands as a tough barrier. Breaking above this could ignite a vigorous surge, possibly pushing XRP to reach new heights. For investors looking for a point to get involved, XRP’s sturdiness and upside potential offer an attractive prospect. Waiting out this consolidation period could be rewarding, particularly as the market looks for a breakout signal. Predictions suggest XRP remains poised for growth, keeping its upward trend intact. The Significance of the $4 Price Level for SUI’s Next Leap Sui (SUI), a prominent Layer 1 blockchain, mirrors Bitcoin’s explosive 2017 bull run. Like Bitcoin’s sharp climbs and subsequent plateaus, SUI’s price action indicates rising lows within an ascending channel, showcasing strong accumulation and bullish outlook. The $4 mark is crucial, harboring a significant Fair Value Gap (FVG). If SUI maintains this support, its price could soar to notable heights, like $10 or even $20, echoing Bitcoin’s historic rise. However, if it fails to keep $4, it could trigger a downturn, undermining the bullish structure and possibly leading to wider sell-offs. This positions $4 as a critical juncture for SUI’s price stability and upward momentum. Sui’s milestone of reaching 50 million accounts solidifies its position as a leading blockchain. This expansion signifies growing adoption and a strong network that draws developers and users, enhancing demand for the SUI token. Moreover, the vibrant NFT marketplace within the SUI ecosystem, with high-value collections like “Egg” and “Rootlets,” reflects active participation and liquidity. If SUI maintains its scalability and key support zones, it is poised for substantial growth, aligned with the bullish patterns across the broader crypto landscape. A Quick Overview As XRP challenges the $3.70 resistance and SUI leverages its $4 support, Web3Bay steals the spotlight by solving real-world issues in a trillion-dollar market. Its blockchain-driven e-commerce platform cuts through inefficiencies, promotes transparency, and grants users control over their data and transactions. The ongoing presale, priced at $0.004562 per token, presents a chance to achieve an impressive 6,430% ROI. Web3Bay isn’t just following market trends; it’s transforming industries, positioning it as the top investment pick of the three. For those in search of a token with tangible utility and revolutionary potential, 3BAY stands out as the clear frontrunner in the competitive crypto field of 2025.

During his second day back in office, Trump flatout said he was gonna force chair Jerome Powell into cutting rates one way or another. Ignoring him as per usual, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) last week voted unanimously to hold the federal funds rate between 4.25% and 4.5%. The decision came amid fears that inflation could spike again, driven by Trump’s own economic policies, including the tariffs he just launched and of course the immigration crackdowns. Still, Mr. Trump continues to push his economic agenda. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, just days before the Fed’s decision, he told global leaders that the U.S. economy needed lower interest rates to stay competitive. “If I disagree [with the Fed’s decision], I will let it be known,” he told reporters from the Oval on Thursday, targeting Fed Chair Jerome Powell directly, who by the way said he had absolutely no comments about the president at his post-minutes press conference, as Cryptopolitan reported . Trump’s incoming trade wars keep pressure on inflation February 1st saw chaos as the S&P 500 hit an all-time high before investors began bracing for possible fallout from rising prices. The tariffs are creating bottlenecks and adding costs for companies that rely on foreign goods as well as innocent Americans, pushing inflation higher. Wall Street is so mad at Trump right now. Investors know that if inflation doesn’t cool soon, it will certainly block further growth. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, a key measure of inflation, jumped to 2.6% in December from 2.4% in November, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. Core PCE, which strips out food and energy costs, remained steady at 2.8%—still above the Fed’s 2% target. The Fed’s rate cut pause is meant to give policymakers time to see if inflation finally starts declining. Powell holds his ground anyway Powell, who has been a consistent target of Trump’s public outlash, made it clear that the central bank won’t base its decisions on political interference. The Fed cut rates three times in late 2024 when they saw it fit to, and are now holding because they see it fit to, according to chair Powell. But Trump believes that: “I think I know interest rates much better than they do.” Trump even said during his campaign in August that the president should have a direct say in monetary policy. While this idea has been dismissed by economists and even his own people as risky, Trump continues to hint at changes that could give him more influence over the Fed’s decisions. Asked whether he believed Powell would listen to him, Trump snickered before giving a condescending “Yeah.” The confidence is typical of Trump, but Powell’s past actions suggest otherwise. The Fed chief has resisted political pressure before, and he’s doing it again, with no fear at all. But despite their differences, Powell and Trump do agree on one thing: the need for a stable U.S. economy. But their approaches couldn’t be more different. Trump wants rapid rate cuts to keep borrowing cheap and markets booming. Powell, on the other hand, is focused on keeping inflation under control without triggering a recession. The January pause could be temporary. If inflation shows signs of cooling, the Fed might consider more rate cuts later this year. But for now, Powell is playing it safe, and Trump—in spite of himself—seems to be on board.

The price is down over 25% and there was a spike below the $2.00 support zone. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.80 and $2.50 levels. The price is now trading below $2.60 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.45 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it clears the $2.50 resistance zone. XRP Price Eyes Recovery XRP price started a fresh decline below the $3.00 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined heavily below the $2.80 and $2.50 support levels. The bears even pushed it below $2.00. There was a sharp drop of over 25% and the price tested the $1.75 zone. A low was formed at $1.75 and the price is now correcting some losses. There was a move above the $2.00 level. The price surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.155 swing high to the $1.750 low. The price is now trading below $2.750 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.30 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.40 level. The next resistance is $2.450. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.45 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.155 swing high to the $1.750 low. A clear move above the $2.450 resistance might send the price toward the $2.50 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance or even $2.720 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.00. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.40 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.10 level. The next major support is near the $2.00 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.00 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $1.850 support. The next major support sits near the $1.750 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

In fact, nearly 60% of this activity is driven by the popular Solana-based meme coin platform pump.fun transactions, according to OKX’s recent report shared with CryptoPotato . Solana vs. Ethereum While Solana leads in overall transaction volume, Ethereum and its Layer 2 networks maintain a stronghold on high-value trades, particularly those exceeding $50,000. In terms of liquidity pool quality, Ethereum continues to lead, holding 10 of the top 20 positions, followed by Base with five, Arbitrum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) with two each, and Solana securing just one spot. This data from the crypto exchange highlighted Solana’s strength in retail trading, even as Ethereum remains the preferred choice for large-value transactions and deep liquidity pools. Commenting on the report’s findings, OKX Chief Innovation Officer Jason Lau said, “Decentralized Exchanges are the lifeblood of the onchain economy, embodying the core ethos of crypto through their permissionless, self-custodial, and community-driven nature. Our findings reveal how the DEX landscape has grown – with activity recently hitting all-time highs.” Decentralized derivatives are gaining traction as platforms like Hyperliquid and dYdX introduce appchain innovations aimed at achieving centralized exchange-level performance. Although spot trading volumes on decentralized exchanges still surpass derivatives trading by a factor of 10, these advancements highlight a significant shift in the market. At the same time, traditional finance (TradFi) yield instruments are making their way into DeFi, with tokenized Treasury Bills (T-Bills) and basis trading assets like USDe and USR emerging as yield-bearing base currencies. This development, according to OKX, is “fundamentally changing” the derivatives landscape by offering new opportunities for traders and ramping up capital efficiency in DeFi markets. Asia Leads in Developer Wars From the demographic front, Asia is emerging as the leading hub for blockchain development and has even surpassed Europe and North America, with 32% of the industry’s developers based in the region. OKX found that builder preferences indicate Ethereum as the dominant platform, attracting 20.8% of developers. Next up was Solana, capturing 11.2%, and Base, with 10.7% of developers. Additionally, artificial intelligence (AI) integration has become a major focus and accounted for almost 34% of developer activity. As a result, it has outpaced other sectors, such as blockchain infrastructure and decentralized finance, which accounted for 20.1% and 14.2%, respectively.

This comes in response to growing concerns about Japan’s existing tax regulations for crypto traders. According to Iolite , Kato made the announcement during a plenary session of the House of Representatives on January 31, 2025. He explained that the Financial Services Agency (FSA) would lead the review, with proposals from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on potential changes to the tax system. The review is expected to include recommendations for necessary legislative amendments. “We are discussing the matter in line with the 2025 Tax Reform Outline, and are considering the necessary legal arrangements. The Financial Services Agency will verify the system regarding crypto assets by June of this year,” he said. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, also weighed in on the matter, stressing the importance of the healthy development of Web 3.0 technologies, including cryptocurrencies. Ishiba said that crypto assets have the potential to address some of Japan’s social issues and improve productivity. He also opened up about the need for the government to ensure user protection and improve the environment for domestic crypto markets. Challenges with Japan’s Current Crypto Tax Laws Currently, Japan’s tax system requires crypto traders to report their trading profits as part of their annual income tax returns, leading to some high tax rates. Critics of the tax system argue that these high tax burdens have stifled the growth of the crypto sector in Japan. The Finance Ministry and FSA are also considering amending the Payment Services Act to include crypto as an asset class under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. This could mark a shift in how cryptocurrencies are regulated and taxed in Japan, aligning with international standards.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ASIA|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-03 04:33:35

On Monday morning in Asia, the Korea Premium Index rose to 9.7%, marking its highest since April 14, 2024. According to CryptoQuant data , the premium is down to 8.2% at press time. The “kimchi premium” refers to a price gap between the South Korean exchanges and foreign markets. It may indicate a stronger buying pressure among Korean retail investors. While Bitcoin’s price is tanking below $92k and Ethereum is down 20%, the Korea Premium Index is up as the South Korean market is difficult for foreign investors to enter. Bitcoin: Korea Premium Index (Source: CryptoQuant) According to a report by The Block, an analyst at Presto Research, Min Jung, said, “The Kimchi Premium typically rises in bull markets when Korean investors bid higher, but it can also spike during periods of panic selling.” Jung predicted the kimchi premium would remain elevated so long as American investors maintained their selling activities. He added “However, historically, the Kimchi Premium has averaged around 5%.

On-chain data suggests whale investors are buying the dip. How could SHIB price react in the week ahead? Shiba Inu Price Plunges 30% amid Weekend Sell-off Shiba Inu (SHIB) price stabilized at $0.000014 on Monday, February 2, following a sharp 32% decline over the weekend. This marks SHIB’s lowest price in five months, dating back to September 2024. The sudden downturn comes amid broader market instability fueled by the latest trade war developments involving Trump-led tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada . Macroeconomic concerns have triggered a wave of risk-off sentiment, prompting investors to offload speculative assets, particularly low-liquidity altcoins like SHIB. Social media reports suggest that U.S. consumers are preparing for inflation-driven price hikes. In response, investors appear to be shifting capital away from volatile memecoins in favor of more stable assets. Shiba Inu price action, Feb 3, 2025 | Source: TradingView Interestingly, SHIB price has been hit harder than other major altcoins , with its 30% decline surpassing losses seen in Solana (SOL), Chainlink (LINK), and Avalanche (AVAX), which remained under 20%. This suggests that SHIB’s downturn is not solely tied to macroeconomic events but rather a result of multiple pre-existing bearish catalysts that were already weighing on the token before the latest market-wide sell-off. Whales Back in Action as Large Transactions Jump to 4.3 Trillion While the market sentiment remains overwhelmingly bearish, whale investors appear to be making strategic moves amid the dip. One key indicator pointing to this is the sharp increase in Large Transactions, a metric tracked by blockchain data analytics platform, IntoTheBlock , monitoring transfers from wallets holding at least 0.1% of SHIB’s total circulating supply. These transactions often serve as a proxy for spotting odd whale activity, as large holders react to significant market events. Shiba Inu Large Transactions vs. SHIB price | IntoTheBlock As shown in the chart, SHIB’s Large Transactions volume stood at just 1.5 trillion on January 31. However, as SHIB’s price plummeted 32% over the weekend, this figure surged to 4.3 trillion SHIB by the end of February 2. This nearly 200% increase in whale transaction volume suggests that institutional and large-scale investors may be capitalizing on the price dip to accumulate more SHIB at lower prices. Historically, spikes in whale accumulation during price crashes have acted as a stabilizing factor for SHIB, as these high-volume transactions absorb excess selling pressure. If this trend continues, we could see SHIB’s price finding support around the $0.000014 level, preventing further declines. Shiba Inu Price Forecast: $0.000010 breakdown signals emerge despite whale Support Shiba Inu has been one of the biggest losers in the current market correction, with a 32% weekend decline bringing its price to a five-month low. While macroeconomic fears and retail capitulation have contributed to the sell-off, whale investors have significantly increased their accumulation, signaling potential price stabilization. In this bullish Shiba Inu price forecast scenario, Elliott Wave analysis suggests SHIB could be completing a corrective ABC pattern, with the latest drop marking the end of Wave C. This phase often precedes a new impulsive wave to the upside, particularly if whale accumulation sustains. The recent low near $0.000013 aligns with a major support zone, historically serving as a reversal point. If SHIB manages to reclaim $0.000015, bullish momentum could build, potentially driving a breakout toward $0.000018 in the short term. The MACD histogram, while still negative, is showing early signs of bearish momentum exhaustion, with the signal line curving upward. This suggests that selling pressure might be fading, and a bullish crossover could occur if SHIB stabilizes above key moving averages. Shiba Inu Price Forecast | SHIBUSD Nonetheless, SHIB remains vulnerable to further downside risks, particularly if U.S. trade tensions escalate further or broader crypto market sentiment deteriorates. Traders should closely monitor whale transaction trends and key support levels, such as $0.000014 and $0.000013, for potential signs of recovery or further breakdown. If the bearish narrative plays out, SHIB’s price action could extend losses below $0.000013, confirming a deeper Wave C breakdown. The 30% drop over the past two days signals a severe bearish impulse, and failure to hold $0.000012 could open the door for further declines toward $0.000010. The MACD’s negative trajectory and widening histogram bars reinforce the risk of continued selling pressure, suggesting weak demand despite whale accumulation. Moreover, a breach below $0.000010 would invalidate the potential for an immediate bullish reversal, exposing SHIB to a prolonged downtrend. In this case, traders should watch the $0.0000095 level as the last line of defense before capitulation accelerates. Without a steady inflow of new demand, SHIB could enter an extended consolidation phase.

The sharp rise in probability follows a renewed import tariff war between the U.S. and its top trading partners, Canada, Mexico and China and concerns it will add to inflation in the global economy, making it difficult for central banks, including the Fed, to cut interest rates. “The recent tariffs imposed by Trump, including 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada and 10% on Chinese goods, are likely to lead to increased inflation, which could dampen investor sentiment in crypto markets,"" Derive said in an email. Andre Dragosch, head of Europe at Bitwise, said on X, that tariffs are sending shock waves via USD strngth & contraction in global money supply. Bitcoin has already dropped 11% to $93,700 in four days, CoinDesk data shows. ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, fell below $2,200 early Monday, the lowest since Aug. 5. BTC appears on track to complete a double top reversal pattern , which would open the doors for a drop to $75,000. Recently, Arthur Hayes, chief investment officer of Maelstrom and former BitMEX CEO, said that BTC will first drop to around $75,000 before chalking out a bigger bull run. The broader outlook, however, remains constructive, according to Derive. ""We’re seeing a number of active spot ETF filings for assets like DOGE, SOL, XRP, and LTC from major players like Bitwise and Grayscale. If the SEC approves these, it will signal greater legitimacy for the digital asset industry and trigger more capital inflows, potentially driving prices upward,"" Derive told CoinDesk, noting the momentum for creating strategic BTC reserves in several U.S. states. Dragosch expects the Fed to eventually step in, putting a floor under asset prices. ""At some point, Fed will need to reignite QE to curb the Dollar from rising further and to stop a continued tightening in financial conditions & deceleration in global growth,"" Bitwise's Dragosch noted.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Options|On-chain Data,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|TRADING|ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-03 04:50:24

The second-biggest crypto by market cap plunged 26.53% on Monday in Asia, falling to $2,135, according to Bloomberg data. It was Ether’s steepest fall in nearly four years, beating its May 2021 disaster. Bitcoin took a 8% dip to $92,000, dragging every major token down with it. Solana (SOL) lost 13% and is trading at $184, and XRP crashed by 28% in Asia, plunging to $1.82, way below its $3 high from just a month ago, according to data from CoinGecko. Trump’s infamous memecoin (TRUMP), which had seen some early hype post-election, crashed 12%, proving once again that meme coins are as fragile as they sound. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20), which tracks for top 20 crypto assets, slumped nearly 21%. Data from Coinglass confirmed just how bloody the day was. Within 12 hours, traders watched $1.3 billion in long positions get liquidated. Ether holders suffered the worst, with $400 million gone in an instant. Bitcoin wasn’t far behind, with $300 million in long BTC positions obliterated. Source: Coinglass This whole panic was triggered by self-proclaimed ‘crypto president’ Donald Trump’s announcement over the weekend that the US would impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. Traders (sensitive as ever) saw the decision as a sign of global economic instability, and so markets reacted fast. An op-ed from The Wall Street Journal didn’t hold back, calling the tariff escalation “the Dumbest Trade War in History.” But Trump fired back on Truth Social, doubling down on his stance. “Anybody that’s against tariffs, including the Fake News Wall Street Journal and Hedge Funds, is only against them because these people or entities are controlled by China,” he wrote. He claimed the tariffs were necessary and hinted that they should’ve never been replaced by the income tax system back in 1913. “The response to tariffs has been FANTASTIC!” he added . But interestingly enough, according to Spot on Chain, the Trump family crypto project World Liberty has lost $51.7 million or about 21%, from its $242.77 million crypto investment since the tariff announcement. Among them of course is Ether, which lost $36.7 million (-24.4%), WBTC which tumbled by 12.1% losing $8 million, and ENA which lost $2.05 million (-43.7%). Meanwhile, according to Parsec, in the past twenty-four hours, the lending liquidation volume on the DeFi chain exceeded $310 million, the highest point since early August 2024, of which ETH collateral liquidation volume reached $181 million, followed by wBTC at $49.2 million. Dogecoin, backed by Elon Musk, lost 14% on Monday, continuing its free fall to 45% below the high it hit after Trump’s election win in December. Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), and Chainlink (LINK) all posted double-digit losses, each dropping more than 10%.

Deaton said that the SEC’s case against Ripple went beyond just targeting the company—it also claimed that XRP itself was a security, ignoring 75 years of legal precedent. Deaton has represented over 75,000 XRP holders in the ongoing case between Ripple and SEC. Many in the crypto world hoped this was a one-time issue, but when similar lawsuits were filed against platforms like Coinbase and Kraken, it became clear the issue was bigger than just Ripple. Then came “Chokepoint 2.0,” a push by regulators to clamp down on crypto, along with battles from figures like Caitlin Long and Custodia Bank against the Federal Reserve. Although the recent departure of Gary Gensler from the SEC might suggest an end to some of these fights, Deaton warns that many battles are still ongoing. One of the biggest concerns now is a legal case against Roman Storm, the developer of Tornado Cash, and two developers of the Samourai Wallet. These cases involve Section 1960 of the U.S. Code, which deals with unlicensed money transmitting businesses. The crypto community had long believed that developers who don’t directly control users’ funds were not considered money transmitters, but the Department of Justice (DOJ) disagrees. “I hope to help raise awareness of just how significant these cases are. If Roman Storm is found guilty and loses a single day of his freedom, imagine the chilling effect it would have on the DeFi industry,” he wrote. While there’s still debate over issues like spot ETFs and whether some tokens are securities, the real danger to crypto comes from these legal cases targeting DeFi.

Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Dogecoin have all taken a hit, with some dropping by nearly 20%. But what’s causing this sudden crash? Let’s dive into the key reasons behind the turmoil. Trump’s Tariff War Sparks Fear One of the biggest reasons behind the market drop is the recent trade war sparked by former U.S. President Donald Trump. Declaring a national emergency under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), Trump imposed strict tariff rules, 25% on Mexico and Canada and 10% on Chinese imports. pic.twitter.com/SWZtSm6NMX — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 1, 2025 The market reacted instantly, fearing higher prices, rising inflation, and economic instability. As a result, U.S. stock indexes fell sharply, dragging the crypto market down with them. Bitcoin Network Activity Slows Down Aside from external economic factors, Bitcoin’s network activity has declined significantly. Data from CryptoQuant shows that the mempool is nearly empty. This means fewer transactions are taking place, which is unusual for Bitcoin. Additionally, Bitcoin transaction fees have fallen to just 1 sat/vB, signaling low demand for block space. This is the lowest level of activity recorded since March 2024. Crypto Sees $2.18 Billion in Liquidations The market has also seen a wave of liquidations, with over $2.18 billion worth of crypto positions being wiped out in a day, affecting more than 715,000 traders. Long traders suffered the most, losing $1.85 billion, while short traders lost around $334 million. The largest single liquidation happened on Binance, where one trader lost $25.64 million in a single trade. Stronger U.S. Dollar Adds Pressure Another factor weighing down Bitcoin is the strengthening U.S. dollar. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has surged to 108.50, while the 10-year Treasury yield has risen above 4.54%. Historically, Bitcoin moves in the opposite direction of the dollar and Treasury yields, meaning a stronger dollar often leads to lower BTC prices. Bitcoin’s Critical Support Level Currently, Bitcoin is struggling to hold above $93,000 . If it falls below the psychological support level of $90,000, analysts warn that further declines could be ahead. Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has fallen to 38, shifting from Neutral to Fear.

The next major resistance is near the $0.270 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3416 swing high to the $0.20 low. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.270 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. A close above the $0.270 resistance might send the price toward the $0.2880 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.30 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.320.

How Low Can ETH Price Drop? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market, led by Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), shed more than $500 billion in net valuation since Friday to hover about $3.16 trillion on Monday, February 3, during the early Asian session. Following the heavy deleveraging in the crypto market, more than $2.1 billion was liquidated in the past 24 hours, higher than the FTX and COVID-19-induced crypto crashes. Bitcoin price has dropped more than 10 percent in the past two weeks to retest a crucial support level above $91k. Ethereum price shed more than 30 percent in the past two weeks to retest the multi-month support level of around $2,136. Top Reasons Why Crypto Market Crashed Today The cryptocurrency market has been reacting to the onset of Donald Trump’s second term in the past few weeks. After receiving significant hype in the months leading to Trump’s second inauguration in mid-January, the crypto market has experienced a sell-the-event scenario in the past two weeks. Notably, US President Donald Trump launched trade wars with Canada, Mexico, and China, thus triggering retaliation from the affected nations. As a result, the crypto market followed major stock indexes led by the Dow Futures. Ethereum Whales Capitulate The notable capitulation in Ethereum price was heavily fueled by whales’ panic selling.

It is the lowest level markets have seen this year, wiping out more than $400 billion in less than a day as the sell-off accelerated during the Monday morning Asian trading session, sending them back to mid-November levels. Additionally, more than 700,000 traders were liquidated to the tune of $2.2 billion over the past 24 hours, according to Coinglass liquidation data. “Damn, I just realized that was the biggest liquidation event in the history of crypto,” commented Reflexivity Research co-founder Will Clemente. Altcoins Bleed Double Digits After months at green greed levels, the Bitcoin fear and greed index has fallen back to ‘fear’ at 44 as February hopium evaporates. BTC crashed around 7.5% from just over $100,000 to hit an intraday low of $91,300 on Monday morning. It recovered to reclaim $93,000 and remains within its range-bound channel at the time of writing. The same cannot be said for altcoins, which have all been obliterated. Ethereum has been smashed 25% in a plunge below $2,400, its lowest level since October. This pushed the ETH/BTC ratio to a multi-year low of 0.023, according to Tradingview. ETH settled at around $2,500 and is almost 50% down from its all-time high in 2021. This is insane: Ethereum just fell -37% in 60 hours since the trade war headlines mid-day on Friday. pic.twitter.com/6UoIIinJqP — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) February 3, 2025 Ripple’s XRP also got hammered hard, falling more than 26% in a matter of hours in a plummet to under $2 before a slight recovery. Solana (SOL) returned to the $180 level after losing 14%, Binance Coin (BNB) lost 16% in a decline to $550, while Dogecoin (DOGE) dumped 24%, crashing back to $0.22. The pain didn’t end there as there were larger losses for Cardano (ADA), which crashed almost 30% in a fall to $0.60; Chainlink (LINK) was crushed by 23%, falling to $17, while Avalanche (AVAX) bled 25% in a fall to $23. Some of the lower-cap altcoins had wiped out almost a year’s worth of gains in a few hours. Trump’s War on Trade Donald Trump’s imposition of trade tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China over the weekend has rattled markets across the globe, with US stock futures deep in the red on Monday morning and Asia bourses getting battered. “Bitcoin is mainly a risk asset. Tariffs this aggressive are very negative for risk assets. And the economy will take a hit,” commented economist Alex Krüger. “The hope for crypto is that it has already dropped a lot in anticipation, considerably reducing the downside. Particularly so for altcoins, which have been demolished.” “I’m torn between the entire market putting a major local bottom on Monday or BTC re-testing the bottom of the range ($90k),” he added. “Trump’s tariff war is impacting the whole market,” Caroline Bowler, chief executive officer of BTC Markets, told Bloomberg. “Concerns about trade wars and stagflation, triggering recessions, are cascading across altcoins and Bitcoin,” she added.

While some analysts suggest these policies could drive Bitcoin prices higher in the long run by weakening the US dollar, the immediate impact has been a sharp sell-off across crypto assets. Over the past weekend, the market saw over $1 billion in liquidations as investors reacted to growing concerns over inflation, interest rates, and macroeconomic uncertainty. As the situation unfolds, market participants are closely watching for further developments that could shape the future trajectory of digital assets. Trump’s Trade Tariffs Could Drive Bitcoin Prices Higher, Despite Immediate Market Shock US President Donald Trump’s latest round of trade tariffs has sparked intense debates regarding the future of the US dollar and its influence on global markets. According to Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at financial services firm BitWise, these tariffs may have a significant long-term effect on Bitcoin (BTC) prices, potentially driving them “violently higher.” Park argues that Trump’s trade policies are engineered to devalue the US dollar in international markets, aiming to correct trade imbalances and make US exports more competitive. This strategy, he asserts, echoes historical precedents, such as the Plaza Accord of 1985—a multilateral agreement between the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, and the UK to weaken the dollar. If a similar scenario unfolds, the resulting economic shifts could bolster Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against currency depreciation. One of the key reasons Park believes Bitcoin will benefit from Trump’s tariffs is the inflationary pressure they may exert on the global economy. As tariffs lead to higher costs for imported goods, inflation could accelerate both in the US and among its major trading partners. The impact will be particularly severe for countries heavily reliant on trade with the United States, as they may face weakened national currencies and a loss of purchasing power. As the value of fiat currencies erodes, people worldwide may increasingly turn to alternative store-of-value assets, such as Bitcoin, to preserve their wealth. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and fixed supply make it an attractive option in times of economic uncertainty and inflationary risk. Park’s theory suggests that a broader shift toward Bitcoin adoption could emerge as investors and citizens seek refuge from fiat currency instability. While gold has traditionally played this role, Bitcoin’s digital nature and ease of transfer make it a compelling modern alternative. Despite Park’s long-term bullish outlook for Bitcoin, the short-term market reaction to Trump’s tariffs has been anything but positive. Following the announcement of new tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico, cryptocurrency markets faced a sharp downturn, with Bitcoin shedding approximately 7.2% over the past week. Data from CoinMarketCap reveals that altcoins bore the brunt of the market selloff. Ethereum (ETH) plummeted by 11.6%, Solana (SOL) suffered a 19.3% decline, and XRP (XRP) dropped by 16.6%. The immediate fear among investors is that escalating trade tensions will lead to a risk-off environment, pushing capital away from speculative assets like cryptocurrencies and into traditional safe-haven assets such as US government securities and gold. The cryptocurrency downturn aligns with a strengthening US dollar. The US Dollar Currency Index (DXY), which measures the dollar’s performance against other major fiat currencies, has been on an upward trajectory since October 2024. Although the index experienced a slight pullback in January 2025, it has regained momentum in early February, suggesting continued confidence in the greenback despite inflationary risks. A stronger US dollar poses a challenge for Bitcoin and other risk assets in the short term. Rising US Treasury yields further compound this effect, as investors shift capital from riskier markets into government-backed securities, which offer safer returns in uncertain economic conditions. Will Bitcoin’s Long-Term Potential Outweigh Short-Term Uncertainty? While the immediate market reaction suggests bearish sentiment toward Bitcoin, long-term macroeconomic trends could support Park’s thesis. If Trump’s tariffs successfully weaken the US dollar over time, Bitcoin could emerge as a primary beneficiary, attracting investors looking to hedge against currency debasement and inflation. Historical data suggests that Bitcoin has performed well during periods of economic turmoil and currency devaluation. The asset’s finite supply and decentralized nature provide a level of protection against traditional monetary policies, making it a viable alternative in times of financial instability. However, traders and investors must navigate the complexities of short-term market volatility. While Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains promising under Park’s framework, the near-term risk-off environment and a stronger US dollar could lead to further price declines before any sustained upward movement materializes. Trump’s trade tariffs have introduced new uncertainties into global financial markets, leading to immediate volatility in Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency space. While analysts like Jeff Park foresee a scenario in which Bitcoin’s price could rise significantly due to long-term currency debasement, short-term market movements remain unpredictable. As the US dollar strengthens and investors flock to safer assets, Bitcoin faces headwinds in the immediate term. However, should the anticipated weakening of the dollar materialize in the coming months or years, Bitcoin could see renewed interest as a hedge against economic instability—potentially setting the stage for the next major price surge. Crypto Market Sees Over $1 Billion in Liquidations Following Trump’s Tariff Announcement The cryptocurrency market experienced a dramatic sell-off, with over $1 billion in long and short liquidations over the weekend. The market turbulence followed US President Donald Trump’s announcement of impending tariffs on imported goods, a move that triggered widespread risk-asset sell-offs. According to Coinglass data , more than 450,000 traders were liquidated in 24 hours, amounting to $1.79 billion in total. Long liquidations made up the majority at approximately $1.57 billion, while short liquidations accounted for $219 million. “The market sell-off was triggered by the White House’s announcement on Saturday that it will impose tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China,” said Min Jung, a research analyst at Presto Research, in a statement. Trump’s plan includes a 25% tariff on imported goods from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on Canadian energy and goods from China, set to take effect Tuesday. Canada has already announced a retaliatory 25% counter-tariff, while similar responses are expected from Mexico and China. The escalating trade tensions have led many analysts to describe the situation as an emerging ”trade war.” “This reignited concerns over inflation, as additional tariffs could further pressure prices, weighing on risk assets, including crypto,” Jung noted. Kronos Research CEO Hank Huang echoed these concerns, stating that investors fear the inflationary impact of these tariffs could force the Federal Reserve to maintain high interest rates for longer than anticipated. The sharp downturn in crypto prices was exacerbated by liquidations of overleveraged positions. Rachael Lucas, a crypto analyst at BTC Markets, pointed out that the lack of Federal Reserve stimulus and persistently high interest rates have disproportionately impacted altcoins, leading to deeper losses. Uncertainty Over Trump’s Crypto Stance The latest downturn also raises questions about the broader market sentiment regarding Trump’s policies. Optimism had initially surged among crypto investors following Trump’s reelection, but as macroeconomic fears mount, that optimism is starting to fade. Analysts note that since his inauguration, the US President has not made any significant statements regarding cryptocurrency policy. “So far, the major crypto-related headline has been about digital asset stockpiles, with no concrete policy details emerging,” Jung explained. With Trump’s trade policies still evolving, further volatility in the crypto market is anticipated. BTC Markets’ Lucas suggested that any additional escalation in tariffs or changes in Federal Reserve policy could significantly impact investor sentiment. As investors navigate these uncertain conditions, the crypto market remains highly sensitive to macroeconomic developments, with traders closely watching both trade policy and Federal Reserve decisions in the coming weeks.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-03 05:30:00

Investors who realized the potential of Ripple (XRP) earlier enjoyed phenomenal returns, transforming pennies into riches. Blockchain specialists and financial professionals now think that a new altcoin called Remittix can present a comparable fantastic potential. Learning from Ripple ’s Success Few people were aware of Ripple’s (XRP) full potential when it first began. Sceptics wrote it off as just another digital token when it was first priced below $0.01 . But at its height, its goal of using blockchain technology to transform international payments caused a price spike above $3 . Early investors had transformative benefits. The most important lesson? Cryptocurrencies that are widely used and have practical applications frequently see exponential growth. Ripple ‘s success was largely driven by its partnerships with banks and financial institutions, which streamlined international transactions with speed and efficiency. It proved that blockchain technology could go beyond speculation and solve real-world financial challenges, but its centralized nature and regulatory scrutiny have posed limitations. Why Remittix Is the New Altcoin to Watch Remittix is addressing a trillion-dollar issue rather than being just another new altcoin . Remittix goes beyond Ripple’s optimization of banking transactions by providing financial inclusion to millions of people globally. Its strong real-world use case positions it as the best cryptocurrency investment for forward-thinking investors. Remittix is attempting to address the fact that billions of people around the world are unable to access traditional banking by providing a decentralized financial network that enables simple transfers, affordable transactions and secure online banking choices. To address that, Remittix is providing a decentralized financial network that enables simple transfers, low-cost transactions and secure online banking choices. Remittix makes financial transactions easier for the average user, in contrast to traditional crypto assets that have trouble being adopted because of their volatility or complicated usage. Without requiring a conventional bank account, users can use Remittix to transform payments into local currency, receive them promptly with almost no fees and even use the money for necessary services. This type of tangible influence is what makes Remittix a cryptocurrency revolution. Many cryptocurrencies struggle to acquire popularity due to legal barriers, high transaction costs, and limited banking access. This coin addresses these issues directly, which makes it one of the best cryptocurrency investments for those who wish to do more than just speculate. This new altcoin also promotes financial inclusivity and the core tenets of cryptocurrencies: decentralization, anonymity and security. It guarantees that users are independent of other parties and have complete control over their finances by eliminating middlemen. The fees associated with traditional banking are infamously high, particularly when making payments abroad. Remittix uses blockchain efficiency to reduce fees to negligible amounts, making transfers affordable for anyone. This coin is a digital financial service that can be accessed on a mobile device, enabling individuals in remote locations to participate in the global economy. Currently, about 1.7 billion individuals globally lack access to banking services. This new coin offers users financial sovereignty in contrast to existing banking systems, which impose stringent rules and limitations. A business owner in Africa, a freelancer in Asia or a gig worker in Latin America, for example, can now receive payments worldwide without any problems or excessive costs. As the financial industry shifts to digital assets, investors are always searching for the next great thing. Remittix is the best cryptocurrency investment of our time because of its unmatched usefulness, potential for widespread adoption, and solution-driven methodology. Remittix has given those who missed out on Ripple’s initial success another opportunity. It fills important gaps in the global economy with its emphasis on financial inclusion and smooth banking integration. Now is the ideal time to get involved because early investors may see large returns as adoption increases. Conclusion Similar to the early days of Ripple , Remittix presents a special opportunity for investors by tackling financial inclusion and lowering remittance costs. It is well-positioned for substantial development because of its safe, decentralized platform and practical use cases. As Remittix becomes more widely used, early investors may experience significant returns. Don’t pass up this opportunity to revolutionize the cryptocurrency industry.

XRP, dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano’s ADA fell more than 25% to reverse all of the gains since December, reaching pre-U.S. election levels from early November. Most majors are down 40-50% in the past month, data shows, making it one of the steepest dives in recent years. Overall market capitalization fell 12%, the worst fall in over a year, while the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) lost 10%. Bitcoin (BTC) dropped 6%. Futures markets reflected these losses with traders of ether (ETH)-tracked products losing over $600 million in the past 24 hours, majorly in early Asian hours. XRP and DOGE bets lost a cumulative $150 million, altcoin-tracked products lost $138 million and ether-tracked futures lost $84 million. Total liquidations crossed $2.2 billion, the highest this year and among the biggest such levels in the past year. The largest single liquidation order happened on Binance, a tether-margined ETH trade valued at $25 million.Some traders cautioned of further losses as the week progressed.“While BTC has fallen over 8% over the weekend it was Ethereum that shocked the market with a straight 20% decline and it's behaving like an altcoin on the downside without the benefit of long-term institutional inflows and a lack of near-term catalysts,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Massive long futures liquidation was observed over the weekend with over 2 billion in futures stop outs over the past 24 hours, the sharpest liquidation event in crypto history. Markets are likely to be in a full risk off mode as we await the US equity market open,” Fan added. Liquidation happens when a trader has insufficient funds to keep a leveraged trade open. The crypto market's high volatility means liquidations are a common occurrence, although major events such as Monday’s can provide actionable cues for further market sentiment or positioning. The market correction stems from a trade war that U.S. President Donald Trump has seemingly ignited with 25% tariffs being placed on Canada and Mexico. The move has caused immediate disruptions in North American trade relations, with both countries threatening retaliatory tariffs. Financial markets are concerned about the potential for increased costs on goods, impacting industries from automotive to agriculture. The interconnected economies of these nations suggest that this tariff imposition could lead to a broader economic slowdown, threatening jobs and raising costs for consumers.",Markets|XRP|DOGE|Markets,EN,0,0,MARKET|DOGE|XRP|BTC|ADA,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-03 05:31:09

Although that was a painful crash of its own, it turned out to be just the beginning. BTC kept plunging on Sunday but remained at around $97,000-$98,000. However, the Monday morning Asian trading session has not been kind to the asset as it plunged further to $91,500, which became its lowest price point since the January 13 massacre. This means that the largest cryptocurrency had lost over ten grand within 24 hours or so. Moreover, it went down by $15,000 since Friday’s top of over $106,000. The violence, though, has spread a lot more among the altcoins. There’s almost no alt sitting with a single-digit price drop, aside from Solana (-8%). The rest, such as ETH (-20%), XRP (-23%), BNB (-15%), DOGE (-24%), ADA (-25%), LINK (-21%), AVAX (-24%), and XLM (-20%), have shed billions of their own market caps, while the total crypto market cap is down by over $400 billion .

A total of 500 million XRP was unlocked from escrow, with 100 million XRP, valued at approximately $283.89 million, being released first, and another 400 million XRP, worth about $1.13 billion, unlocked from escrow shortly after. A few hours before these transactions, Ripple locked substantial amounts back into escrow. A total of 700 million XRP was locked back, with 430 million XRP, valued at $1.27 billion locked first, and 270 million XRP, worth approximately $796.96 million secured shortly after. Ripple unlocked 500 million XRP instead of its usual 1 billion XRP unlock. This mirrors escrow unlock errors from early 2024, which plagued the company’s escrow transactions for four months. However, Ripple often unlocks an additional 500 million later in the month to complete its escrow commitment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Whale Movements in the XRP Market Beyond escrow transactions, Whale Alert detected multiple large XRP transfers involving unknown wallets and Ripple. One of the largest movements involved 430 million XRP, valued at approximately $1.27 billion, transferred from an unknown wallet to Ripple. This was preceded by another major transfer of 200 million XRP, valued at $588.76 million. Ripple also received a transfer of 299.99 million XRP, worth around $882.64 million, and a transfer of 70 million XRP, worth approximately $206.5 million, from unknown wallets. These large inflows to Ripple suggest potential liquidity management or preparations for operational use. They might also involve some of Ripple’s many On-demand Liquidity (ODL) partners worldwide or similar institutional partners that utilize XRP. What’s Next for XRP? Approximately 2.2 billion XRP tokens moved in under 24 hours, drawing attention from the broader market to the XRP ecosystem. However, this has not helped the digital asset’s price, as a wider market downturn sent it below $3, pushing it to $2.51, its lowest level since mid-January. The digital asset has recovered slightly and is now trading at $2.58. Despite the decline, whales have been preparing for a big move since late 2024, and many market participants are still confident that a swift recovery is coming.

Although it has bounced off to above $2 now, there’s a warning sign that suggests its run could have been halted, at least for now. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView The chart above paints a highly painful picture. XRP neared its all-time high on January 17 and peaked at $3.39, which was just 1% away from the 2018 record. Although it failed there, it mostly maintained its valuation above $3 for the next couple of weeks. That all changed on Sunday morning when it dumped from $3.07 to $2.7 at first before it took another beating to $2.5. Nevertheless, it jumped back 10% before the Monday morning massacre brought back the pain. Within hours, Ripple’s token plunged from $2.7 to under $1.8 (on Bitstamp), which became its lowest price level since late November when Gary Gensler announced his departure from the SEC. XRP has managed to recover some of the losses, at least for now, and sits above $2.2 as of press time. Yet, this is still a 24% daily drop, which has driven its market capitalization to well below $130 billion. Consequently, USDT, with a market cap of $140 billion, has once again surpassed XRP as the third-largest crypto asset. What’s even more worrying for XRP is the fact that whales have reversed their strategy. As reported yesterday, these large market participants had offloaded over 70 million XRP in 96 hours. However, further data from Ali Martinez shows that they have continued to sell off their tokens by dumping another 130 million in a day over the weekend. Whales play a significant role in the crypto market due to their ability to buy or sell substantial portions of an asset. They went on a massive buying spree ahead and during XRP’s rally but seem to have changed their tune, which could spell even more trouble for the asset.

Although Utah is the latest state to propose the Bitcoin reserve bill, Satoshi Action Fund CEO Dennis Porter believes it could still be the first to establish one, citing its short legislative calendar and strong political momentum. He said: “It’s either sink or swim in 45 days; no other state has a faster calendar, and no one else has the political momentum and willpower to get it done.” – Dennis Porter Utah House Economic Development Committee voted in favor of the digital asset reserve bill on January 28 In a recent interview with Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, Porter said that every bill passed by the Utah House Economic Development Committee has become law. He argued that the committee had already passed a recommendation for Utah’s H.B. 230 Blockchain and Digital Innovation Amendments to be approved, meaning it could soon pass into law. The Committee passed the bill by an 8-1 vote on Tuesday, January 28. If the bill is approved, state funds will be invested in digital assets. State treasurers can even allocate up to 5% of each account’s total funds into eligible digital assets with a market value exceeding $50 billion. Aside from Porter, State Representative Jordan Teuscher is optimistic that Utah’s digital asset bill will get approved quickly. In an X post on January 21, Teuscher stated that the state will continue leading the country in blockchain and digital innovation, claiming it would be the first to establish a digital reserve. Thrilled to join with @Dennis_Porter_ to announce HB230 which will allow the state to invest in digital assets. While Utah is the 11th state to introduce similar legislation, we will be the first to pass it. Utah continues to lead the nation in blockchain and digital innovation! https://t.co/mBTt12UaQw — Jordan Teuscher (@jordanteuscher) January 21, 2025 Spencer Cox, Utah’s governor, has already expressed his openness to cryptocurrency by signing the blockchain and digital innovation task force into law. If the reserve bill successfully passes the Senate, he will likely sign it into law. Wyoming has made progress in earning bipartisan support for the reserve bill Utah is the 11th state to introduce the Bitcoin reserve bill and the latest to do so. However, Porter believes the state count could rise to 15 in 2025 as lawmakers compete to have theirs approved first. Porter expects states to benefit from Bitcoin reserves, saying they could protect their purchasing power and continue paying for state programs without raising taxes. In her interview with Porter, Senator Cynthia Lummis, when asked about which reserves could get approved first, state-level reserves or the federal stockpile, stated that they are likely to have their proposals approved first and experience the benefits sooner since they are the “incubators of innovation” Like Porter, she believes Bitcoin reserves will greatly profit states, saying they could help right the wrongs of older generations and clear the debt burden they created. She added that Wyoming’s reserve bill has had “good success” in securing bipartisan support, though it is not quite there yet. Wyoming’s digital asset bill is past the committee approval stage and only has to get the House’s approval before it’s signed into law.

The crypto veterans and the proponents believed Bitcoin and the other cryptos would thrive under his rule, but with stricter impositions, the crypto markets are facing extreme repercussions, which may push the market participants into a deep sea of uncertainty and fear. Bitcoin, which was on its way to mark a new ATH, drained heavily to form the local button close to $91,000. Besides, the altcoins also plunged with a very huge margin, letting off huge bearish waves across the crypto markets. What Went Wrong? Why Crypto Markets Plunged Hard? Investors foresaw the strengthening of the crypto markets as soon as Donald Trump won the elections, which kept the markets elevated. During the past week, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imports of goods from Canada and Mexico and 10% on China. Moreover, he has announced additional tariffs on Chinese goods and imported cars. pic.twitter.com/SWZtSm6NMX — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 1, 2025 With this, the rates are expected to increase for Americans, leading to a rise in inflation and layoffs. This is the prime reason for a billion-long liquidation during the past weekend, wherein more than 700,000 traders were liquidated, with the total liquidations raised over $2 billion. Apart from this, the DXY index, which measures the strength of the U.S. dollar, surged above 109.7 while the Treasury yield rose to 4.54%, which is not good for the BTC price and the entire crypto space. What’s Next for the Crypto Markets? Will Bitcoin Price Rise Back to $100,000? With the institutions remaining uncertain about the next market trends, the fate of the spot ETF remains hung. Besides, some reports suggest hedge funds are betting on a stock market correction and the data from Goldman Sachs indicates a massive rise in the short positions of the U.S.-based stocks. More importantly, the latest pullback has helped the BTC price complete a massive bearish pattern, which is circulating bearish waves across the crypto markets. The weekly chart of Bitcoin suggests the price is testing the neckline of a massive double-top or ‘M-shape’ pattern. The bulls are trying hard to keep up the levels above the crucial support range between $91,408 and $92,285. Meanwhile, the weekly MACD underwent a bearish crossover while the Bull Market Support Band (BMSB) and Direct Movement Index (DMI) are heading for a similar price action. On the other hand, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) face a bearish reversal and are plunging towards the lower range. Hence, the overall sentiments for the Bitcoin price and the crypto markets have turned negative and hence the traders also seem to be staying away until the market conditions stabilize.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|BTC|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-03 05:58:44

Will Global Changes Force a Policy Shift?,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-tax-in-india-hits-70-will-global-changes-force-a-policy-shift/,"The post Crypto Tax in India Hits 70%? Will Global Changes Force a Policy Shift? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News India has had a rocky relationship with cryptocurrency. Since 2013, the country’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has warned people about the risks of digital assets. In 2018, things got worse when the RBI banned banks from working with crypto businesses, making it almost impossible for exchanges to operate. But in 2020, India’s Supreme Court removed the ban, giving crypto a second chance. Even after that, the government remained strict. It introduced a heavy 30% tax on crypto profits, making trading very expensive. Recently, a new 70% tax was announced on undisclosed crypto gains. In short, it means, if they lose money, they can’t use those losses to reduce their tax burden. Also, if someone makes crypto transactions worth more than ₹50,000 in a year, they must pay extra taxes. Many believe these harsh rules are meant to discourage people from using cryptocurrency. Some government officials even compare crypto to gambling, saying it is only used for illegal activities. Interestingly despite so many challenges data suggests, that India’s crypto market was worth $2.6 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow to $13.9 billion by 2033, growing at 18.48% per year. Trump’s Crypto Push Could Change Everything Following international pressure, reports suggest that India may rethink fast-tracking its crypto framework. The buzz came after, Donald Trump had signed an executive order to explore digital assets at a national level. His administration is even considering a government-owned stockpile of cryptocurrencies. This move could push other countries to act fast before they fall behind in the global crypto race. India May Be Forced to Rethink Its Crypto Rules According to the Reuters reports , India is now reviewing its crypto policy. Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth recently said that digital assets “don’t believe in borders,” hinting that India might have to change its stance. If other major countries start adopting crypto, India may have no choice but to follow. Right now, the Indian government is more focused on its own central bank digital currency (CBDC). Former RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das called CBDCs “the future of currency,” and India has already launched a digital rupee pilot program. The RBI is also working on a cross-border payment system where CBDCs could be used for transactions between countries. The Indian government is willing to adopt crypto, but they are also pushing for unified crypto regulations to make the digital assets streamlined, and it also reduces the risk factors. But for now, strict rules and high taxes make it difficult for the industry to grow.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-03 05:58:59

A Fresh Entrant With Massive Potential: As a newly launched coin, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors the chance to enter at the ground floor. Its early-stage momentum makes it one of the most promising opportunities to achieve life-changing gains. 2.

These accounts took in a staggering 560 million Dogecoins, just shy of $40 million. This buying frenzy came on the heels of a pretty intense sell-off in $DOGE, and it’s definitely something we want to keep our eyes on. The question is, of course, why are they doing this? And could we see a kind of “reclaimed interest” in $DOGE? Or is this just a set-up for a local top? Whales have accumulated 560 million #Dogecoin $DOGE in the past week following an intense sell-off, signaling renewed interest from large holders! pic.twitter.com/ObAVfqC9xi — Ali (@ali_charts) January 31, 2025 Potential Market Shift for Dogecoin Big investors, commonly known as whales, influence the price movements of cryptocurrencies. For Dogecoin, the recent accumulation of over half a billion DOGE coins into whale wallets might mean that these investors are bracing for a possible price rally. But this is not a certain outcome. We could also interpret it to mean that, having just sold off a significant portion of their holdings, Dogecoin’s whales are taking the opportunity to buy back into the market at lower prices, perhaps figuring that the price trend is stabilizing after having been in freefall. Even with this outcome being a positive one, there are still some warning signs for investors in Dogecoin. The price of Dogecoin, much like other cryptocurrencies, could really take a hit if the broader market takes a turn for the worse. Analysts have expressed worry over what could happen if DOGE breaks below its $0.31 support level; a move like that could very well trigger a correction that would push the price down toward $0.20 and would have all the markings of a “whales taking profits and re-positioning” kind of dip, which in Dogecoin’s case could set off a temporary bearish trend. Is #Dogecoin following $PEPE ? If so, a breakdown below $0.31 could trigger a correction toward $0.20 for $DOGE ! pic.twitter.com/fuKfgUwPNI — Ali (@ali_charts) February 1, 2025 Grayscale’s Move to Offer Dogecoin Exposure Besides the endeavors of large investors, another significant development could direct more institutional focus toward Dogecoin. Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest crypto asset manager, has just launched the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust. This move gives high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors a straightforward way to gain exposure to $DOGE, the native coin of the Dogecoin network. The trust is now open for daily subscription. This means eligible investors can now buy into the trust and indirectly hold Dogecoin. And do you know what they don’t have to do to hold it? That’s right. They don’t have to buy it directly on exchanges. @Grayscale Investments announces the launch of Grayscale @Dogecoin Trust Grayscale Dogecoin Trust goes live, offers investors the opportunity to gain exposure to $DOGE , the native coin of the Dogecoin network. The Trust is now open for daily subscription by eligible… pic.twitter.com/t3cJVa17Ol — CryptoDep #StandWithUkraine (@Crypto_Dep) January 31, 2025 For Dogecoin, this launch represents a major milestone. It potentially paves the way for far more institutional investment in the asset than we have seen thus far. Unlike Grayscale’s other trusted digital currency products, which hold only Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Zcash, the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust could help make the Dogecoin Dream come a little closer to reality. The Grayscale Dogecoin Trust’s inception substantiates Dogecoin’s legitimacy as a serious contender in the space. Yet it operates within an asset class more emblematic of the Wild West than Wall Street. Although the trust offers a more structured way for investors to gain direct exposure to DOGE, the trust’s underlying asset, the Dogecoin network, is still very much in play; and it too is characterized as a “serious asset” by Grayscale’s parent company, Digital Currency Group. Conclusion: A Critical Time for Dogecoin With Grayscale’s trust offering new ways to invest, the meme coin is at a make-or-break moment. But for those who own it, the news isn’t all bad. Accumulating a significantly large amount of the coins may, in fact, signal that the next big move for Dogecoin is to the upside. This may be enhanced, too, by the 8th anniversary of the coin, which will occur in December 2023. Investors should keep a close watch on both the price action and the critical support that Dogecoin is at right now. If it drops below that, it could be a key signal that more downside is coming. As interest from institutions rises and large investors take action, coming months should provide greater clarity on whether Dogecoin is carving out a place for itself in the overall cryptocurrency market or whether it could be poised for another stagnation or decline in price. Anyone considering an investment in this extremely volatile and not particularly well-understood asset would do well to proceed with caution and to keep a close watch over the Dogecoin situation.

39856496,https://nulltx.com/?p=143495,1738562964,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,MUSKIT Memecoin Surges 200% Amid Speculation of Musk Family Backing,https://nulltx.com/muskit-memecoin-surges-200-amid-speculation-of-musk-family-backing/,"Elon Musk’s father, Errol Musk, is working on something that’s got the cryptocurrency market really buzzing. It’s called Just Musk It (MUSKIT), and it’s a memecoin linked to none other than the Musk family. Reports suggest that Errol is in the process of raising $200 million through the digital currency, which will supposedly go toward the establishment of the Musk Institute, a for-profit think tank that will, in Errol’s words, “do what no one else is doing.” This disclosure has sent a jolt of enthusiasm among investors and caused speculation to bubble over. The result has been an eye-popping 200% increase in the price of MUSKIT. The memecoin’s market cap has doubled to $35.4 million, and its price has reached $0.03432. Trading volume, meanwhile, has surged by an unbelievable 7,000%. That means there is now a strong market interest and, it seems, a much stronger confidence in MUSKIT’s price appreciation potential. MUSKIT’s Meteoric Rise: Driven by Musk Family Ties The crypto realm has been affected for quite some time by the Musk family, with Elon Musk’s tweets and public utterances almost always resulting in major price fluctuations for digital assets such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Now, it seems, that influence might be extending into the realm of governance tokens, with Errol Musk reportedly backing a new digital currency called MUSKIT. It was recently reported by Cointelegraph that Errol Musk’s plan to raise $200 million through MUSKIT could partially fund the Musk Institute, which is expected to do advanced engineering and focus on technological breakthroughs of the sort that don’t happen every day. Many people who look at cryptocurrency connections for a living saw this and assumed we were just seeing a “funding the family business” story. The sharp increase in price and huge trading volume show that the market is reacting very positively to the idea of the Musk family being involved in this prospect. Even though Elon Musk hasn’t said anything about the project, we think it’s quite possible that rumors or indirect involvement from him could really light a fire under MUSKIT’s price. Memecoin Mania: How MUSKIT Is Defying Expectations Traditionally, memecoins are seen as speculative assets that experience wild price swings based on hype and trends on social media. But MUSKIT seems to be staking out a different, possibly more sustainable, position by aligning itself with a tech-driven initiative instead of relying just on internet virality. MUSKIT’s market cap has recently doubled in a very short time, and that shows how sentiment plays a big role in memecoin rallies. The token’s trading volume surged 7000% in that same short time, and both retail and institutional investors are starting to take notice. If this keeps up, MUSKIT could make its way into the holy grail of the best memecoins in the market. The possible success of MUSKIT will likely rely on the Musk Institute taking shape as intended and on the use of funds raised through the memecoin. If the think tank somehow manages to pull off what it claims will be a series of “world-changing projects,” MUSKIT might evolve beyond being a speculative token and become something with real application—application, in this case, associated with one of blockchain’s many oft-discussed “use cases.” Will MUSKIT Follow in Dogecoin’s Footsteps? What began as a joke turned into a major player in the crypto world. Dogecoin got to where it is largely because of Elon Musk’s high-profile, uh, support. Now that MUSKIT appears to be linked to Errol Musk, many are asking if it, too, will chart a course to the crypto stars. Musk might have clearly been involved in Dogecoin’s rise, but it’s not at all evident what’s going on with MUSKIT. If Errol Musk is a real cheerleader for the project and is updating us on the progress of the Musk Institute, then you could surmise that translating Earth invaders into another medium could mean further adoption of and appreciation in value for the token. Follow-through on this point isn’t guaranteed, though. If all of this translates into a real slog for the Musk Institute with no further updates coming, the hype we’ve been discussing becomes rather meaningless. Conclusion The MUSKIT memecoin is ascendant; it’s as if it has been shot out of a cannon. The immediate reason for this is the frenzied speculation that it has actual, if indirect, support from the Musk family. Adding to this price surge is the equally ambitious, if currently vague, plans for the Musk Institute to put the money to actual use. With a price up 200%, market cap of $35.4 million, and trading volume up an incredible 7,000%, this token has everyone’s attention, at least for the moment. The next phase of MUSKIT’s journey will depend closely on whether the Musk Institute comes into being and if the token’s recent burst of popularity can last. Will the next chapter of its story turn out to be a Dogecoin-like success? Or will it ruefully fizzle out and be into another short-lived memecoin? For now, though, the buzz around MUSKIT is nothing if not palpable. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The Sharp Drop Hits Altcoins Harder Major digital assets including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana, and XRP have faced significant sell-offs as traders assess global economic risks. Altcoins in general have seen a 20 percent collapse in the past 24 hours. BTC fell 8% in early trading hours in Asia to around $91,200 before making a slight recovery to $94,000 by afternoon in Hong Kong. ETH took a harder hit, falling to $2,100 levels. While SOL was dropping to $177, XRP fell by 27% to $1.70. The decline dwarfed even the sharp downturn during the Covid pandemic, and experts say it could be the biggest decline in history. Trump's Trade War Sparks Crypto Market Selloff The sharp correction came after Trump announced that he would impose 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, reigniting fears of a global trade war. The move triggered widespread anxiety among investors not only in traditional markets but also in the crypto sector. World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto project with ties to Trump’s family, saw its January crypto investments drop by 20%, according to SpotOnChain data. Massive Liquidations Increase Market Volatility Data from CoinGlass shows that over $2.2 billion worth of liquidations occurred in the last 24 hours. $400 million was wiped out in long ETH positions alone. Additionally, $300 million was liquidated in long BTC positions.

Nevertheless, XRP finished off the month of January at an all-time high of $3.0359, a definitive show of market confidence in the long-term potential of this asset. The large investor sell-off has put some short-term price pressure on the token. Still, with much-talked-about “fundamentals,” XRP is said to remain on the track for mass adoption and increased utility in the years to come.

This stunning close has revived retail and institutional interest in XRP, indicative of renewed vigor for the cryptocurrency not just in the XRP-verse but also in the broader cryptocurrency market. Concurrently, the chances of a Ripple XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) being sanctioned this year are increasing to new highs. Experts are now estimating an 82% probability of approval, a number that indicates a high level of optimism for the asset’s future. Were the ETF to be given the green light, it could unleash a wave of institutional investment that would almost assuredly send XRP’s price soaring. If an XRP ETF gains approval, it would constitute a significant advancement for Ripple and the users of its products, stamping XRP with the quality of being an asset that can be confidently held by institutions and regulated in a clear manner. More broadly, the approval of an XRP ETF would be a bullish sign for the acceptance of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology by the financial system.

Ripple’s vision of making XRP a global reserve currency and an intermediary to facilitate the seamless exchange of currencies is starting to materialize. One of the most meaningful events in the recent past is Japan’s decision to adopt XRP as part of its national financial framework. Every bank in Japan will start utilizing Ripple’s XRP cryptocurrency next week, reports say—that’s the monumental step Ripple just took on its way to becoming the financial system’s next big thing. And if this series of events carries as much significance and weight as it seems to, we might want to ask why XRP, and not Bitcoin, is headed to Japan’s banks. BOOOOOOOOOOOOM #RIPPLE is ranked #1 for CBDC’s #XRP to become a world reserve currency and a bridge to interoperate with other currencies. Mass adoption is absolutely happening through the #XRPL . pic.twitter.com/9CwlF2RN8H — XRP Avengers (@XRP_Avengers) February 1, 2025 Japan’s move also underscores Ripple’s burgeoning prominence in the worldwide financial arena. The decision of the banks in that country to use XRP for their operations could prompt other nations and financial entities to do likewise, especially with the rising clamor for swifter, less costly, and more efficient means of engaging in cross-border transactions. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM! Japan's financial landscape, indicating that every bank in the country will begin utilizing Ripple's $XRP cryptocurrency next week. pic.twitter.com/KIGkczC7et — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) February 1, 2025 Whale Sell-Off and the Challenges Ahead for XRP Even though there have been good reports about the growth of XRP, some investors have become uneasy about recent price swings. Over the past 96 hours, however, over 70 million XRP tokens were dumped by whale holders, and this is downward pressure on the price. Large holders tend to sell when prices are high, and these kinds of sales can make the market more volatile. XRP’s fundamentals, by contrast, are relatively unscathed. A strong close in January and an ETF approval probability that’s either increased or just became clearer point to a long-term bullish picture. The market’s natural ebb and flow makes it laughable to consider whale-induced shakedowns a viable short-selling thesis. In the coming weeks, XRP’s price may keep fluctuating, much like it has for the past several months, under the influence of certain large players in the market and those who would sell off their holdings. But the trend overall for XRP seems to be in a very good place, thanks to a number of partnerships, quite a bit of adoption, and a big uptick in interest from institutions. The Road Ahead for Ripple and XRP The next several months will be crucial for XRP as it moves through an increasingly fast-moving market. Two potential developments—the approval of an XRP ETF in the U.S. and Japan’s adoption of Ripple’s technology—are major milestones that could lead to something truly revolutionary: the global adoption of XRP as a bridge currency for payments that instantly cross any border. If that happens, “I think you’re going to see a pretty substantial increase in value,” said Tim Davis, an Ashtabula-based investment advisor who keeps an eye on Ripple and XRP. The present instability in the market may give investors the chance to buy XRP at lower prices before the first major step in the digital asset’s journey—to financial services—to the real world is taken. As the network grows and new use cases for XRP emerge, its Bone-Structure remains solid, giving no hint of the Break-Up Death Spiral, which HSBC’s Mason Bullard suggests is “the biggest risk to the long-term viability of any digital currency.” In the end, XRP’s odyssey has just commenced. Given an ETF’s imminent approval, the likely transformation of the supposed currency into something we can spend, and the burgeoning interest in XRP from institutions, the next wave of growth for XRP seems to be upon us. And this may well be the wave that captures the currency’s full potential. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

As DeFi activity and ETF adoption expand, analysts are eyeing a potential rally to $11,000. At the same time, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is attracting whale attention because it could address Bitcoin’s biggest limitations. With near-instant transactions, lower fees, and Ethereum compatibility, this Layer-2 solution could redefine Bitcoin’s efficiency and real-world use cases. Here’s the latest on both projects. Can Ethereum (ETH) Skyrocket to $11,000 as Market Momentum and DeFi Growth Accelerate? Ethereum (ETH) is currently priced at $3,212.18, which reflects a 2.4% gain over the past 24 hours. With a circulating supply of 120.52 million ETH, the asset continues to be one of the most actively traded and influential cryptocurrencies. Ethereum has been building strong momentum. It recently reached around $3,900 — a 66% surge in the past month. Several key factors are causing this growth. Institutional interest continues to rise, with BlackRock acquiring over $230 million worth of ETH. Ethereum remains the backbone of the DeFi ecosystem, with more than $70 billion in total value locked. IAmRich, a crypto analyst on X, predicts that Ethereum (ETH) could reach $11,000 in 2025. How PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Could Transform Bitcoin With Lightning-Fast Transactions, Lower Fees, and Seamless Ethereum Integration Bitcoin remains the most dominant cryptocurrency, but it still struggles with slow transactions, high fees, and network congestion. While other blockchains, like Ethereum and Solana, have introduced faster and more scalable solutions, Bitcoin has lagged behind in efficiency. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is looking to change that. As a Layer-2 solution built for Bitcoin, it could boost transaction speed, lower costs, and improve usability, which would make Bitcoin more practical for everyday use. PlutoChain operates alongside Bitcoin, which could help reduce congestion and streamline transaction processing. Instead of waiting 10 minutes for a single confirmation, PlutoChain offers block times of just two seconds by leveraging Layer-2 technology. This dramatic speed increase could make microtransactions and daily payments more feasible and open up new possibilities for Bitcoin beyond being just a store of value. Additionally, PlutoChain’s lower fees could remove financial barriers and make Bitcoin more accessible for users and businesses. Beyond just improving speed and cost-efficiency, PlutoChain could also enhance Bitcoin’s interoperability. It is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which means Ethereum-based applications — DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and AI-driven projects — could seamlessly integrate with Bitcoin. This cross-chain compatibility could unlock new use cases and significantly expand Bitcoin’s real-world applications. During its testing phase, PlutoChain efficiently handled 43,200 transactions in a single day without any interruptions, which demonstrates its ability to support high-volume activity. Security is a top priority for PlutoChain. The platform has undergone audits by SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi to ensure network resilience. It also performs routine code reviews and stress tests to maintain stability and prevent vulnerabilities. With its focus on instant transactions, reduced fees, and cross-chain compatibility, PlutoChain has the potential to revolutionize Bitcoin by making it faster, more scalable, and ready for broader adoption. The Takeaway Increasing institutional investment, DeFi expansion and technical upgrades all contribute to Ethereum’s outlook this year. At the same time, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could play a critical role in Bitcoin’s evolution. By offering lightning-fast transactions, lower fees, and Ethereum compatibility, it has the potential to make Bitcoin more efficient, scalable, and adaptable for real-world use. ————- This article is purely informational and should not be interpreted as financial advice.

Notably, SHIB price slumped to as low as the $0.000012 level intraday, whereas DOGE price plunged to the $0.2 level, sparking investor concerns. A stockpile of factors appears to be driving the current slumping action in the mentioned meme coins, including investor uncertainty and massive liquidations amid broader developments. Here’s Why Dogecoin & Shiba Inu Price Are Slumping Over 25% Intraday Mentioned below are some vital factors that appear to be fueling the leading meme coins ‘ crash of over 25% in a day. Trade War Speculations Trigger Crypto Market Crash Amid Trump’s New Tariffs The global crypto market witnessed a crash recently as U.S. President Donald Trump announced new import tariffs, triggering speculations of a trade war. CoinGape reported that the 47th president announced new increased import tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China, sending shockwaves across global markets. In turn, even the crypto sector took a hit, with experts speculating over a looming trade war that can affect global markets. Simultaneously, despite Trump’s pro-crypto standpoint, the new tariff mover has conversely brought about a market-wide crash. Bitcoin dipped to as low as $91K, with altcoins bearing further heat. Even the meme coin sector followed the bearish trend, with DOGE and SHIB prices in a slump. Dogecoin & Shiba Inu Price Take Hear Amid Heightened Liquidations Simultaneously, massive liquidations amid the broader market uncertainty have added pressure on the meme coins’ prices. Coinglass data indicated that Dogecoin saw $87.12 million worth of liquidations in the past 24 hours. Whereas, Shiba Inu saw nearly $7.5 million worth of liquidations intraday. These massive liquidations, bringing selling pressure to the asset, further align with the current price crash. Futures OI On Decline Signal Reduced Market Interest Further, Coinglass data has revealed that DOGE futures OI was down by 33% intraday, reaching $2.44 billion. Simultaneously, SHIB futures OI plummeted by a remarkable 46% intraday, reaching $155.01 million. Altogether, this data underscored diminishing market activity surrounding the meme coins, reflecting investor uncertainty amid broader market trends. This statistic is also one of the reasons for a price drop. How Are The Tokens Currently Performing? At the time of reporting, Shiba Inu price witnessed a 22% crash and is resting at $0.00001368. However, the coin’s intraday low and high were $0.0000123 and $0.00001764, underscoring a loss of more than 25% in a day. Notably, SHIB’s waning movement further falls in line with a nearly 100% decline in its intraday burn rate, as per the latest burn data. Similarly, DOGE price followed, plunging 21% to $0.2394 intraday. Its 24-hour bottom and peak were $0.2117 and $0.3061, respectively. Market watchers continue to stay cautious surrounding future movements, reflecting uncertainty amid recent trends.

The losses raise serious concerns about the security of the major US-based cryptocurrency exchange. On January 31, blockchain analyst ZachXBT exposed another large-scale theft , showing how scammers continue to exploit Coinbase customers. In this case, a user lost 110 cbBTC—Coinbase’s wrapped version of Bitcoin—after falling for a fraudulent scheme. The stolen crypto was quickly laundered through various instant exchanges, making recovery nearly impossible. The attackers swapped, bridged, and mixed the funds across multiple platforms before combining them with other stolen assets on Ethereum. ZachXBT explained that this case is part of a much larger pattern, estimating that at least $150 million has been stolen from Coinbase users in the past year. The actual figure could be significantly higher, as his estimate is based only on independently verified incidents. “Coinbase has a serious fraud problem,” he stated, adding that he continues to uncover more cases regularly. Coinbase has yet to respond publicly to the latest theft. However, scams where criminals impersonate Coinbase support have become widespread. These fraudsters use phishing emails, fake customer service calls, and other deceptive tactics to steal login credentials and drain wallets. Once inside an account, they rapidly transfer and conceal stolen funds. Similar incidents have occurred before. In December, a Coinbase Commerce vendor lost $15.9 million, with no action taken by the exchange’s anti-money laundering system. In October 2024, an imposter stole $6.5 million through a phishing scam, pretending to be part of Coinbase’s support team. ZachXBT emphasized that Coinbase users frequently reach out to him after falling victim to these attacks. He criticized the company’s lack of response, claiming that no other major exchange faces such a widespread issue. He accused Coinbase’s leadership of being out of touch, hiding behind internal policies rather than addressing security threats and helping victims. As the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, Coinbase is under growing pressure to improve its fraud prevention measures. If scams continue unchecked, they could further damage trust in centralized exchanges, emphasizing the urgent need for stronger security protections.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-03 06:55:39

Stellar’s XLM has made some corrections in the past week but the price is still within a buying range as it remains neutral-bullish on the daily timeframe. Meanwhile, things are getting ugly on the hourly chart as the trend turned bearish. The price is now looking weak amid rising supply. The closest level for selling right now lies at $0.32 which was held as support last December. Whether this support will hold or not is yet unknown. But looking at the setup from a technical standpoint, the level is likely to break significantly as soon as the market tests it. If that happens, we can expect a huge drop to retest the $0.162 level that broke as resistance during the November 2024 surge. Such a fallout could lead to a major market reset before picking up again. Sustaining bullish momentum, it must stay above the December support to form a new bullish (double-bottom) pattern before bouncing back. A break above $0.64 should set the stage for another upward move daily. XLM’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Losing December’s $0.32 support could sink the price to a low of $0.27, followed by the $0.189 level. The lower level to consider for a broader correction is $0.115. It may even test the $0.1 level before resuming buying. The current drop was initiated from $0.51. If the bulls pushed back to reclaim this resistance level, the next line of interest would be $0.63. A cross above this level should set the market up for a new rally to $0.7.

She argues that Bitcoin’s value growth could significantly reduce the debt over the next two decades. Lummis believes this reserve would correct financial mistakes made by past generations and relieve the economic strain on younger Americans. She sees Bitcoin as a tool that can offset debt while reinforcing the US dollar as the world’s dominant currency. In a recent interview, Lummis explained that a Bitcoin reserve could potentially cut the debt in half. She pointed out that Bitcoin has historically grown at an annual rate of about 55%, though she expects this to slow over time, dropping to 45%, 35%, 25%, and so on. Even with this decline, she believes that holding Bitcoin now could help pay off a significant portion of the US debt in 20 years. Lummis referenced Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has promoted a similar strategy. If a large enough reserve is established, she suggests it could eliminate the national debt entirely. She views Bitcoin as the only asset with the potential to grow at such a scale and reverse decades of financial mismanagement. Last July, Lummis introduced the BITCOIN Act, proposing that the US government acquire 1 million Bitcoin as part of its financial strategy. She recently became the first chair of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets , further cementing her leadership in crypto policy. Momentum for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is growing at the state level. According to Dennis Porter, founder of the Satoshi Action Fund, 15 states have expressed public support for the idea. At least 11 states have introduced bills to establish such a reserve, and Arizona and Utah have already advanced their proposals through legislative committees. Public advocacy for Bitcoin as part of a national reserve is also increasing. Porter noted that over 3,300 letters have been sent to Members of Congress urging them to recognize Bitcoin as a key strategic asset. This push gained further attention after former President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a national digital asset stockpile, though it did not specifically name Bitcoin. Lummis remains confident that a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could be the key to restoring financial stability in the US. She views it as a critical step toward reducing debt while ensuring the dollar remains the world’s leading currency.",,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-03 06:58:31

While major tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) , and Ethereum (ETH) have strong use cases, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN sets itself apart as the most exciting opportunity for exponential value creation. Here’s why this token is dominating the conversation. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Stands Out 1. Limited Supply Creates Scarcity With a total supply capped at 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN ensures scarcity that fuels long-term value. Unlike BTC and LTC, which have slower growth due to high circulation, this token’s deflationary model guarantees increasing demand. 2. Exclusive Availability Unlike UNI and DOT, which are available on multiple exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity gives early adopters an edge and keeps the token’s growth stable and controlled. 3. Unparalleled Growth Potential Analysts project that THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN could deliver returns of up to 2,000%, thanks to its early-stage momentum and community-driven development. While Bitcoin and Polkadot are well-established, they can’t match the rapid trajectory of this groundbreaking token. 4. Investor Demand at Record Levels Raising $1,000,000 within minutes of its presale launch, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven its appeal. Investors recognize its potential to redefine the market, driving interest far beyond what UNI, BTC, or LTC have recently seen. How THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Compares Uniswap (UNI): A strong DeFi platform but lacks the exclusivity and demand-driving scarcity of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Polkadot (DOT): Reliable for interoperability but cannot match the early-stage explosive growth seen here. Bitcoin (BTC): A store of value, yet its market maturity limits growth opportunities compared to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Litecoin (LTC): Known for efficiency, but it hasn’t captured the market excitement that this new token has.

Last week , Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said that policymakers didn’t need “to be in a hurry” to cut rates while maintaining them at 4.25% to 4.5%. He also said it would be helpful if there were a “greater regulatory apparatus” around crypto while advising banks not to debank crypto customers.

Bitcoin crashed to $91,500 during the Monday morning Asian trading session, its lowest level for three weeks. However, the altcoins were getting absolutely obliterated, with the entire top twenty seeing double-digit losses as the selloff accelerated. Ethereum had wiped out three months of gains, falling to pre-US election levels below $2,500, while XRP fell a massive 27% back to $2 in a matter of hours. Meanwhile, Dogecoin, Cardano, Chainlink, Stellar, Avalanche, Sui, Toncoin, and many others were bleeding out by more than 20% on the day.

Although some might consider an estimate of $70 unrealistic, it is not just based on wishful thinking. The potential for more institutions to adopt and clearer regulations, which experts see as broader market trends, are key factors driving this increase.

A stronghold there could bring a bounce back! Since the massive explosion in the first quarter of the year 2024, Ton’s price has remained well above $4.45. However, several attempts to slip below this price level have proven abortive as it holds as crucial support. But following the latest bearish setup, this support might get bridged any moment from now as the price trades around it for the fourth time. A breakdown from there should set the stage for a major loss in the mid-term capable of causing a 50% drop to refill the February 2024 gap. Such a drop will confirm the bearish (double-top) pattern forming on the weekly timeframe. This could bring a serious negative sentiment in the market, although a buyback is expected once the gap is refilled at $2.2. Considering the latest sell signal, there’s no room for the bulls. If by any chance they manage to defend the crucial support well, we can expect a short bounce before resuming bearish at full speed. Nonetheless, the bears are suggested to win the battle. TON’s Key Level to Watch Source: Tradingview The main key level to watch for a breakdown is $4. A further extension of the selling pressure could drive the price to the $3.32 level and lower. While there’s no room for buying at the moment, we may see a short bounce to $5 if the bulls react strongly to the latest drop. Meanwhile, the resistance above this price level is $5.66, followed by $6.5 and $7.2.

They believe Bitcoin’s past growth outperforms traditional investments like stocks, despite its volatility. Many parents view Bitcoin as a way to protect their savings from economic uncertainty. While some use it to replace traditional savings plans entirely, others see it as a diversification strategy. They believe their children will have time to handle market ups and downs before needing tuition funds. “If you’re saving for your kids, add Bitcoin to the portfolio. Buying $10-$100 of Bitcoin per month over 18 years will set your kids up for an excellent life. It will massively outperform the rest of the portfolio,” wrote Rajat Soni, a well-known financial expert, on X (formerly Twitter). Bitcoin’s price surge has boosted investor confidence. This year, it reached an all-time high of nearly $110,000—a massive 500% increase from its 2022 low of under $20,000. Supporters believe its growth is far from over, fueling more adoption from both individuals and institutions. However, Bitcoin-based savings have drawbacks. While Bitcoin may bring higher returns, parents choosing it over 529 plans lose access to tax advantages, including tax-free withdrawals for educational costs. Bitcoin adoption is expanding beyond individual investors . In the past year, institutional demand has skyrocketed, with more than 70 publicly traded companies now holding over 600,000 BTC. This trend signals rising confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a valuable financial asset. Political shifts have also influenced Bitcoin’s growth. Formerly skeptical, President Donald Trump has now become a strong supporter, pushing for a national Bitcoin reserve. His stance has fueled global interest, with countries like the Czech Republic and Hong Kong exploring their own Bitcoin holdings. Experts argue that Bitcoin’s decentralized structure, fixed supply, and worldwide accessibility make it a powerful alternative to traditional investments. Travis Kling, founder of Ikigai Asset Management, sees Bitcoin as a hedge against central bank policies, stating: “Eventually, you come to Bitcoin and you can squint a little bit and actually put together a cogent argument that Bitcoin would be a better collateral foundation than Treasuries.” Kling explained that Bitcoin is designed to absorb much of the world’s money supply growth. This could make it a stronger financial asset than fiat-based investments. While still volatile, Kling expects Bitcoin to become more stable and widely used over the next decade. By 2035, he predicts its market cap could reach $15 trillion, with an annual trading volume of $200 trillion. If this happens, Bitcoin could become a superior financial asset compared to US Treasury bonds.",,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-03 07:02:13

On Saturday, the country purchased another 5 BTC , bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to approximately 6,055 BTC, valued at over $606 million. These acquisitions align with El Salvador’s long-term commitment to Bitcoin, even as it modifies policies to comply with a $1.4 billion loan agreement with the IMF. Since adopting Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, the country has consistently increased its holdings. However, to meet the IMF’s requirements, the government has adjusted its Bitcoin policies, making acceptance optional for businesses, removing tax payments in BTC, and phasing out the state-backed Chivo wallet. The IMF has frequently raised concerns about El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption, citing potential financial stability risks. Despite these policy changes, the government remains committed to its broader Bitcoin strategy. Last December, Stacy Herbert, director of the National Bitcoin Office, hinted at an accelerated Bitcoin acquisition plan, alongside initiatives to expand Bitcoin education and training within the public sector. Herbert reaffirmed this position earlier this year, stating, “El Salvador will continue buying bitcoin (at possibly an accelerated pace AND at a discounted price) for its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” El Salvador’s strong support for Bitcoin has attracted significant interest from major crypto firms. Stablecoin issuer Tether recently moved its headquarters to the country, praising its crypto-friendly regulatory environment under President Nayib Bukele . Shortly after, Bukele encouraged Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski to consider relocating his company to El Salvador as well. Despite regulatory adjustments, El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption remains a key part of its economic strategy. The country continues to strengthen its position in the global crypto space while attracting major industry players seeking a favorable regulatory climate.",,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-03 07:05:20

The trial used ZKSync’s Validium mode, allowing fractional gold purchases with secure and private transactions. This move highlights the increasing adoption of blockchain by traditional financial institutions for asset tokenization. On January 31, ZKSync confirmed that UBS, which manages $5.7 trillion in assets, is exploring blockchain to simplify gold investments. The test enables Swiss customers to buy physical gold through a blockchain system that prioritizes security , efficiency, and privacy. UBS Key4 Gold offers retail investors the ability to purchase fractional gold shares, benefiting from real-time pricing, strong liquidity, and secure storage. The platform runs on the UBS Gold Network, a permissionless blockchain that connects vaults, liquidity providers, and distributors. To enhance efficiency, UBS used ZKSync’s Validium mode—a zero-knowledge rollup that boosts scalability by keeping data off-chain. As part of the trial, the bank deployed smart contracts on the Validium testnet to simulate the UBS Gold Network. These contracts allowed gold token issuance and transaction processing while maintaining security. “This proof-of-concept reflects UBS’ commitment to using blockchain to improve financial services and advance its digital asset strategy. I firmly believe the future of finance will happen on-chain,” stated Alex Gluchowski, the inventor of ZKSync. The testnet also improved privacy, ensuring that participants could only see their own transactions while keeping verification systems intact. Additionally, it enabled stablecoin integration with Ethereum, making gold token purchases more affordable and scalable. UBS’ blockchain test is part of a growing trend among financial institutions exploring blockchain technology. The bank has previously experimented with tokenization, launching an Ethereum-based money market investment fund. UBS Digital Assets Lead Christoph Puhr emphasized that tokenized securities have enormous potential, but scalability, privacy, and interoperability remain challenges. He noted that ZKSync’s proof-of-concept demonstrated how Layer-2 networks and zero-knowledge technology can help address these issues. “This is another example of how UBS works with tech providers to stay at the cutting edge of innovation. Our test with ZKSync showed that Layer 2 networks and zero-knowledge technology could solve these challenges,” Puhr explained. ZKSync co-inventor Alex Gluchowski reinforced this idea, stating that these initiatives prove that finance is moving on-chain. He believes zero-knowledge technology will drive innovation, creating a strong foundation for tokenized assets and accelerating Web3 adoption.",,EN,0,0,FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-03 07:08:33

This project is breaking new ground by combining the typical meme coin hype with an exciting Play-to-Earn (P2E) game element. Not only does BTFD Coin tap into the viral meme coin culture, but it’s also offering something more—a genuine, engaging experience for holders. The ongoing presale has raised over $5.9 million, with more than 68 billion coins sold, and the buzz around this coin continues to grow.

Its distinctive branding, centred around a rebellious mog (a slang term for a cool cat), strikes a chord with meme lovers looking for a fun yet potentially lucrative investment.

The coin plays off this theme to create an engaging community where pet lovers and meme enthusiasts alike can rally around a shared love for internet humour and cryptocurrency. What sets Cat In a Dog’s World apart from other meme coins is its focus on community-driven growth and the sense of belonging it offers.

A mix of fresh U.S. tariffs, weak liquidity, and panic selling wiped over $2 billion from the market in the last 24 hours, according to data from Coinglass.

The tariffs won’t lead to much productivity shock or inflation shock for the U.S. – market will recover soon. — Daniel Yan (@_D_Y_A_N) February 3, 2025 Matrixport co-founder Daniel Yan called it “another typical weak Monday,” blaming Asia markets for their knee-jerk reaction to bad news.

Santiment data shows traders are stepping back. One user analyzing aggregated sentiment noted, “Talks of buying the dip have calmed down. Big targets like $110K-120K for Bitcoin are getting less attention.” Despite the chaos, Bitwise’s head of alpha strategies Jeff Park believes tariffs are part of a much bigger game. He argues that the U.S. is looking for a way to weaken the dollar without crashing its ability to borrow cheaply — a kind of “Plaza Accord 2.0.” This is the only thing you need to read about tariffs to understand Bitcoin for 2025. This is undoubtedly my highest conviction macro trade for the year: Plaza Accord 2.0 is coming.

Although the market has yet to witness massive rallies since the swearing-in, forecasters think that top altcoins like Dogecoin and Cardano values will surge in the coming weeks. While Dogecoin and Cardano’s market activity is booming, Elluminex (ELX), a presale star, is breaking barriers in the DeFi space. The Elluminex project, which brings DeFi features to the vast TON network is seen as a key player in the growing DeFi industry with predictors anticipating exponential growth on launching. Blockchain Baller Bullish On Dogecoin, Forecasts $0.36-$0.40 Price Range While many expected the Dogecoin (DOGE) price to surge when President Donald Trump confirmed the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the price movement has not been as swift as anticipated. However, crypto analyst Blockchain Baller thinks that Dogecoin crypto is primed for a reversal after sweeping liquidity at the lows. The forecasters expects the Dogecoin crypto to move upward towards the $0.36-$0.40 range. Meanwhile, Ali Martinez observed that whales accumulated over 460M DOGE tokens in the recent market dip, suggesting that a massive rally might be on the way. CoinMarketCap data shows that Dogecoin price has increased by 7% in the past 24 hours, signaling a bullish move. Looking at Dogecoin key oscillators at Tradingview , the VWMA (10) and Hull Moving Average (9) are flashing sell signals, while the rest remain neutral. Coincodex , in their Dogecoin price prediction, forecast the meme coin price to rise to $1 in the next 90 days. Cardano Coin Receives Positive Outlook From Ali Charts Although Cardano (ADA) is one of the top players in the crypto industry, ranking among the top 10 cryptos in CoinMarketCap , the popular altcoin has yet to replicate the success witnessed in the 2021 bull season. Having gained 9% in the past 24 hours, Cardano’s price has yet to break into the $1 mark, as per the market stats . Reacting to the current Cardano market sentiment, crypto analyst AMCrypto thinks that as long as the ADA price stays above the $0.80 support level, there is no need to panic. Confirming that, another popular analyst with over 1.4M followers on X, Carl Moon claims that as long as the Cardano token holds the $0.90 support zone, it could hit $1.3 and potentially $1.90 soon. Ali Charts, in the latest Cardano price analysis, claimed that the altcoins TD sequential present a buy signal. Meanwhile, technical analysis from Tradingview shows that the Cardano crypto price is slightly below the 30-day SMA ($0.986). However, with the RSI at 46, a move above $1 could be a catalyst that will drive the price towards $2. Elluminex: A Revolutionary Crypto Project Offering DeFi Solutions On The TON Ecosystem Elluminex (ELX) is an innovative crypto project that seeks to transform the TON blockchain and extend its capabilities and vast reach to the next level. By introducing liquidity to the network, users and developers will be able to tap into and use it. The cross-chain bridging solution allows users to swap digital assets seamlessly across various blockchain networks at the lowest cost. Just like when Jupiter was launched on Solana, which saw the rise of billion-dollar meme coins like Dogwifhat, Elluminex wants to make TON a go-to DeFi hub. By leveraging the over 950 million active users and Telegrams’ close to 1 billion users, Elluminex seeks to offer users a platform that will allow them to trade, stake, farm, and track their portfolio with ease. In the Elluminex DEX, users trade digital assets directly from their wallets with little or no slippage and faster transaction processing. Traders can utilize the AI-powered portfolio track to gain insights about their assets’ market performance, ensuring that they stay updated about market events. The educational platform also allows users to learn more about DeFi. Outside that, the OTC platform gives users access to new TON projects before the official listing, ensuring that users capture new projects at the nascent stage. Powering the platform is the ELX token, which is sold for just $0.06. With over 5 million tokens sold and rising interest, traders anticipate 1000% rallies in presale. As such, it is one of the best altcoins to buy in Q1. Best Cryptos To Buy For Maximum Return In Q1 Dogecoin looks set to break the $1 barrier in the year, while Cardano could hit the $2 mark in the coming months. However, Elluminex is primed to outshine both altcoin titans in the year. The DeFi features it is bringing to the TON blockchain and the common DeFi problems it is solving make it a key player in the lucrative DeFi industry. As one of the fastest-growing blockchains, the integration of Elluminex in the TON network will increase the demand for ELX, making it the best crypto coin to buy.

Bitcoin (BTC) changed the game for early investors, delivering life-changing returns, and Solana (SOL) is recognized for its exceptional scalability. Now, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a new coin in the market, is grabbing headlines with predictions of 55,000% growth potential. Having raised $1 million during its presale in minutes, it’s being closely watched by experts who see it as the next breakout token alongside top contenders. Why THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is Creating a Buzz 1. Fresh Entry, Massive Upside Being new to the market, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers a rare opportunity to invest before its value skyrockets. Early investors stand to benefit from the kind of exponential returns only seen in the early days of tokens like SOL and XRP. 2. Exceptional Presale Success The presale success of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN , raising $1 million almost instantly, is a clear indicator of its high demand and market appeal. Its early momentum positions it as a leader among emerging cryptos. 3. Exclusivity Fuels Demand Unlike XRP, LINK, and DOT, which are widely available across exchanges, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively sold at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This controlled access ensures scarcity, increasing its value for early adopters. How It Stands Against Competitors XRP: Dominates payments but lacks the early-stage growth potential of this new coin. Solana (SOL): Scalable and fast, but its growth is already stabilizing compared to this fresh token. Chainlink (LINK): Strong in decentralized oracles but can’t match the excitement surrounding THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An emerging project, but its momentum falls short of this token’s presale success. Don’t Miss This Game-Changing Opportunity With experts predicting up to 55,000% gains, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is becoming the most talked-about crypto of 2025. Its record-breaking presale, exclusivity, and high-growth potential make it a must-watch token alongside Solana. Secure your tokens now at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM and join the revolution!

33767162,[object Object],1738567815,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Hoskinson Teases Cardano’s Plans: Bitcoin, ICP, Ripple And Global Adoption",https://bitcoinist.com/hoskinson-cardano-bitcoin-icp-stablecoins-adoption/,"Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano (ADA) and CEO of Input Output Global (IOG), delivered a wide‐ranging AMA on February 2, 2025, covering potential partnerships with the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), Cardano’s stablecoin strategies, Bitcoin interoperability, and ongoing initiatives with various countries. Over the course of nearly two and a half hours, Hoskinson shared details on governance, budgeting, and technical roadmaps for the Cardano ecosystem while also commenting on the future of multi‐chain applications. Partnership Prospects With ICP One of the recurring topics was cross‐chain collaboration. When asked about the possibility of working with Dominic Williams and ICP, Hoskinson indicated that discussions about interoperability and cooperation could be on the table. While he did not provide a definitive roadmap, he stated, “It’s potentially possible. ICP was very unhappy about being excluded. They were one of the best blockchain candidates for what Wyoming wanted to do and they were excluded for no reason. So it would be interesting to see if perhaps on the litigation side they’d want to come in [… ] overall there’s a lot of good people in that ecosystem got great scientists in that ecosystem too.Q Although this remark was made in the broader context of the Wyoming stablecoin project , it highlights Hoskinson’s openness to revisiting relationships with other networks. His stance on multi‐chain interoperability has been consistent over the years. Hoskinson often underscores the strategic importance of bridging ecosystems, remarking that the future of blockchain is “multi‐chain” and that platforms such as Cardano can gain significant value through cross‐pollination with projects like ICP. Ongoing Conversation With Ripple Stablecoins emerged as a focal point of the AMA, with Hoskinson referencing multiple proposals, including Real USD and RLUSD. He stressed that stablecoins on Cardano must be handled transparently and securely, emphasizing that they should be interoperable with both on‐chain governance and DeFi protocols. Revisiting the cooperation possibility with Ripple , Hoskinson noted ongoing conversations: We talk to David Schwartz and Brad Garlinghouse. Strong possibility we can negotiate something with RLUSD. Ripple told us to wait till March as they just finished NYDFS. […] We’ll see if there’s a roadmap and how they’ll get that done.” He also proposed a scenario in which the Cardano treasury could convert a percentage of its funds into a stablecoin, potentially using external managers to participate in Cardano‐native DeFi. Such an approach, Hoskinson argued, “would increase the amount of minted stablecoins in the Cardano ecosystem,” thereby boosting total value locked (TVL) and liquidity. However, he stressed that any such measure would require broad community debate and on‐chain governance to secure consensus. Bitcoin Interoperability Hoskinson maintained his longstanding position that Cardano should strive to interface directly with Bitcoin. He explained that it can serve as a US strategic Bitcoin reserve and a powerful asset to onboard and revealed ongoing work on Bitcoin‐based DeFi projects, underscoring plans to present a functional demonstration at the Bitcoin 2025 conference. Further, Hoskinson described an ambition to merge Hydra—Cardano’s layer‐2 scalability solution—with the Lightning Network, potentially resulting in a “lightning‐Hydra synergy” that fosters greater cross‐chain functionality. “Hydra continues to grow […]. We’re exploring how to merge Hydra with the Lightning Network and create lightning‐Hydra so that that Bitcoin relationship strengthens,” he said. Global Adoption From Africa to Mongolia, Hoskinson outlined several ongoing or potential country‐level projects. While discussing a pivot away from direct government contracting, he praised the emergence of private‐sector engagements, such as microfinance initiatives that leverage Cardano rails. First, Hoskinson talked about the failed project in Ethiopia: “When we entered Ethiopia, it was a promising nation […] five years later, all those promises evaporated and the government was getting allegations of genocide amongst other things […] we tried really hard to build something for the kids […] but the government just ghosted us.” Instead, he pointed to private sector projects like RealFi, a Kenyan‐based venture focused on microfinance lending with Cardano’s stablecoin infrastructure in mind, saying it would bring “real‐world assets” and “actual micro‐finance products” onto the blockchain. According to Hoskinson, this effort “will eventually wire in stablecoins, identity systems, and settle on Cardano rails.” Similarly, Hoskinson referenced interest in Mongolia for possible partnership opportunities. When asked directly, “Any news from Mongolia and Cardano?” he responded: “I’ve been wanting to do something substantive in Mongolia for a long time. […] There’s some discussion in Wyoming about a gold‐backed stablecoin. It would be really cool to do that, and Mongolia would be really cool to do as an international partner for it.” At press time, ADA traded at $0.6755.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|Cardano news|Cardano partnerships|Cardano Price|Charles Hoskinson,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-03 07:30:15
39859257,https://nulltx.com/?p=143528,1738567973,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Why Are Sui Investors Accumulating ELX and AVAX,https://nulltx.com/why-are-sui-investors-accumulating-elx-and-avax/,"Ali Charts Confirms 40% AVAX Rally, As Sui Holders Look Towards Elluminex Dubbed Top Crypto Of 2025 Sui (SUI) has seen an incredible performance after the August 2024 market correction. It was among the tokens that fully regained its previous losses and moved to new highs. Cracks began to show when SUI crypto created lower highs and fell below its critical level. This sparked speculation of whether this is the start of a deeper correction or a pause to commence its rally. Similarly, Avalanche (AVAX) entered a consolidation phase and has been trading within a descending triangle pattern. This technical setup is marked by lower highs with a downward-sloping trendline and horizontal support level at $34.18. This level has become a strong support base for buyers. Following their bearish trends, AVAX and SUI investors have turned to Elluminex (ELX), a revolutionary DeFi platform set to transform TON, which already has the fastest-growing network. With its comprehensive DeFi hub, seasoned traders believe ELX could hit $1 before the first half of 2025. Sui (SUI) Price Breakdown Since August, SUI’s price action has followed an ascending support trendline, which triggered multiple bounces every moment the price returned to it. Its most recent bounce is in December, culminating in a new high price of $5.35 on Jan 6. Afterward, the price of Sui declined from the trendline after two weeks. This trendline has existed for 161 days; therefore, a breakdown marks the end of upward movement. Meanwhile, the Sui Crypto has not yet validated this support line as a resistance. If the downward movement persists, the closest Fibonacci at $4.48 could become support, while the closest horizontal support is at $1.80. Sui’s technical setup validates the conclusion of upward movements. For example, its RSI has generated a bearish divergence , falling below the neutral position of 50. Additionally, its MACD has made a bearish cross, while the histogram indicates a bearish divergence. Therefore, Sui’s upward movement appears to have ended, signaling the start of a bearish trend. Alongside a breakdown from its long-term ascending support trendline, SUI has also broken down from its short-term wedge pattern. As such, Sui has reached the top of its upward movement, and if this is confirmed, the price of Sui could begin a lengthy correction that could take it below $3. Ali Charts Confirms 40% Rally For Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche has been on a downtrend in the past week but has not deterred optimism among investors. Netflow data highlight an outflow of 2.18 million AVAX tokens, suggesting investors are moving away from the exchanges. This trend typically reflects increased whale accumulation or reduction in selling pressure. This consistent outflow of AVAX tokens indicates that many investors are still holding onto their tokens rather than preparing to sell. Meanwhile, large inflows exceeded $20 million between mid-November and early December, which aligns with selling activity during its price peaks. Notably, Ali Charts predicts that the price of Avalanche is primed for a 40% rally once it breaks above its descending channel pattern at $37 and $38. Its technical setup aligns with this bullish sentiment, though the direction of the breakout could determine the next significant move. The crypto’s daily price chart has been trading with a descending triangle pattern , demonstrated by a downsloping trendline and horizontal support level at $34.18. this level has acted as a defense for AVAX buyers, but repeated tests could weaken this zone. A breach below the $34.18 level could set the stage for downside support levels at $29.17, $24.69, and $22.18, aligning with the Fibonacci extension levels. To regain bullish momentum, AVAX price must break the descending trendline near $37-$38. Any additional resistance could be around $37.53 and $40.17, which have previously rejected price recovery attempts. Elluminex (ELX): Top Crypto Of 2025 Despite TON being among the fastest blockchains, bolstering over 950 million users, its network’s DeFi market remains largely underdeveloped. This might soon change, thanks to Elluminex (ELX), a revolutionary DeFi platform on TON. Just like how Uniswap turned Ethereum into the heart of DeFi, Elluminex is about to drive a new wave of success to the Toncoin network, elevating it to new heights. This single DeFi platform will be the missing bridge for the TON ecosystem, enabling easy transfer of assets between chains, which could change the entire trajectory of Toncoin. Most traditional DEX suffer from high gas fees, fragmented liquidity, and slow transaction times. Elluminex has tackled these issues head-on, aggregating liquidity across multiple blockchains, minimizing slippage, and enabling a seamless trading experience with a wide array of crypto assets. Even by holding the ELX token, investors can earn passive income by staking their tokens at dynamic rates that reward early adopters and loyal stakers. This has contributed to the platform’s liquidity. Moreover, it has reduced sell-offs and built a loyal community, stabilizing the ELX token. Besides trading, Elluminex offers an AI portfolio tracker, learning academy, and pre-market access, positioning the platform as a premier DeFi hub. So far, Elluminex is available at presale and selling for only $0.06. Thanks to these features, market participants are optimistic that this new DeFi coin could rally exponentially in this bull cycle. Why Elluminex Could Outpace SUI And AVAX While Avalanche looks forward to new highs and Sui navigates price breakdown, Elluminex has signaled itself as a promising contender in DeFi. For those who missed Sui’s rise or are looking for the next high-return altcoin, Elluminex is the next ticket for unlocking a huge growth potential.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. With strong tokenomics and real-world utility, Rollblock is emerging as a top GambleFi contender, challenging assets like PEPE and XRP. Table of Contents Rollblock: The next big altcoin? PEPE’s market volatility and whale influence XRP’s regulatory challenges and market uncertainty Conclusion The crypto market is heating up, and Rollblock (RBLK) is making waves as a top contender. While PEPE and XRP have seen significant hype, Rollblock is emerging as a competitor with real-world utility. Its GambleFi model, revenue-sharing rewards, and strong tokenomics set it apart from speculative assets. Rollblock: The next big altcoin? Rollblock is taking GambleFi to the next level, offering over 7,000 games, live casino platforms, and sports betting. Its blockchain-backed gaming ecosystem generates passive income for investors. The project has already secured $9.9 million in its crypto presale, with a $0.052 token price. Analysts see strong return potential, making it a top 2025 bull run pick. RBLK holders earn weekly dividends from casino profits, adding long-term value and extra earning opportunities. Tokenomics make Rollblock even more attractive. Regular buybacks and burns reduce supply, with 60% of repurchased tokens burned and 40% distributed to stakers. Investors can stake RBLK tokens to earn up to 30% APY, creating strong incentives for long-term holding. As the top GambleFi platform on Ethereum, Rollblock is quickly gaining traction. Analysts suggest it could outperform major altcoins thanks to its focus on real-world applications. With strong investor backing and a transparent, blockchain-powered ecosystem, Rollblock stands out as a true utility-driven altcoin. You might also like: Cardano ETF looms but whales shift focus to Rollblock amid market uncertainty PEPE’s market volatility and whale influence As of January 31, 2025, the PEPE price is trading at $0.000014. Despite its explosive rise in 2024, recent trends indicate increased market instability. Benzinga reports that Changelly predicts PEPE could trade at an average price of $0.0027 by 2025, while CoinPedia forecasts an average of $0.000055. Massive whale movements continue to shake PEPE’s market. Recently, a single investor turned $3,000 into $51 million, selling 500 billion PEPE tokens. This kind of price manipulation raises concerns about long-term sustainability. While PEPE remains popular due to social media hype and the meme coin trend, it relies purely on speculation. If whale activity continues, PEPE’s future could be highly unpredictable. XRP’s regulatory challenges and market uncertainty Ripple’s coin is trading at $3.08. The coin’s market performance has been heavily influenced by ongoing legal battles with the SEC. Recent closed-door SEC meetings have sparked speculation about a shift in regulatory enforcement, but uncertainty remains. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin is expected to improve its cross-border payment functionality. Regardless, price predictions differ, with 2025 targets between $1.81 and $4.44 and some bullish forecasts placing XRP above $9 by 2030. Despite its legal and technological advancements, XRP still faces hurdles. The regulatory landscape remains unstable, and investors remain cautious. While some analysts see XRP as a long-term play, others argue that other projects with clearer growth paths offer better returns. With ongoing legal concerns still in play, many traders are hesitant to go all-in on XRP’s future. Conclusion While PEPE, XRP, and Rollblock all have market potential, Rollblock’s utility-driven model and strong tokenomics make it the most promising investment. With crypto presale momentum and real passive income opportunities, RBLK could outperform speculative assets. Investors looking for stability and growth should keep Rollblock on their radar.

Another Region Is Being Taxed!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/donald-trump-makes-statement-after-taxes-imposed-on-mexico-canada-and-china-another-region-is-being-taxed/,"President Donald Trump defended his administration's sweeping tariff strategy, acknowledging that duties on Mexico, Canada and China could cause “short-term” economic pain for Americans. Trump Acknowledges 'Short-Term' Pain of Tariffs as Global Markets React Trump's comments come amid growing concerns that these trade measures could undermine global growth and reignite inflation. Speaking to reporters, Trump defended the tariffs as a necessary tool to correct what he described as unfair trade practices, even as global markets showed signs of strain in response to escalating trade tensions. “There may be some short-term pain, but it is a small price to pay for the long-term strength of the American economy,” Trump said. Tariffs on European Union 'Will Definitely Be Implemented' Trump also signaled that tariffs on the European Union (EU) were imminent, saying it “absolutely will happen,” although he declined to give a timeline. The statement added to growing unease in financial markets that fear a wider global trade war is looming on the horizon. Global stock markets and commodities have been volatile in recent days as investors digest the potential impact of Trump's trade policies: US and Asian stock markets have fallen sharply on fears that economic growth will slow. Bond yields fell, signaling investor concerns about a potential recession. Commodity prices, including oil and metals, have fluctuated due to uncertainties surrounding global supply chains. Economic and Political Reflections Economists warn that tariffs could fuel higher prices for consumers, squeeze corporate profits and disrupt global supply chains. Meanwhile, international leaders including officials from the EU, Mexico and Canada have voiced strong opposition, hinting at possible retaliatory measures. Despite the mounting criticism, Trump remains firm, framing the tariffs as part of his broader agenda to “put America first” in global trade negotiations. As markets brace for the possible outcomes, all eyes will be on the White House for more details on the timeline and scope of the upcoming EU tariffs. *This is not investment advice.

A staggering $2 billion worth of liquidations have happened within 24 hours. Ethereum Price Analysis: Ethereum’s price has dropped below key support zones, including the $2500-$3,000 range. This has triggered concerns over a potential bearish trend as lower highs and lows continue to form. While a daily candle close beneath these levels is still needed to confirm a bearish trend, Ethereum’s outlook remains cautious with resistance at higher levels around $3,430 to $3,560. Solana Price Prediction: Solana has been following the same downward trend as Bitcoin and Ethereum. It recently broke below an important support level around $220–$225. Furthermore, breaking below $220 has led to a drop to $200–$190. The next support could be around $177–$180. Now, the old support zone between $220–$225 will likely act as resistance. Overall, the price is still in a bearish trend, and things aren’t looking great for Solana in the short term. XRP Price Prediction: XRP is also showing a bearish trend, similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum. It has broken below the support around $2.60–$2.70, where the price bounced before. If it closes below this level, it could see XRP fall to around $2.33–$2.26 next. The RSI on the 4-hour chart is getting close to oversold territory, which could signal that the price might be ready for a short-term bounce. But, it’s not guaranteed. This just means XRP could see some relief soon before it potentially continues to fall later on. ADA Price Prediction: Cardano’s price is facing strong resistance above the $1 level. It has been struggling to break through this level for months. The price has now dropped below key support around $0.72 to $0.73. If the price falls further, it might drop to $0.60, with a potential 25% decrease.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|ETH|XRP|ADA|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-03 07:41:26

At the time of writing, ZACH has gained a market cap of around $49,300 since its launch on Feb. 1. The token is described as “a support fund” dedicated to renowned crypto sphere investigator, ZachXBT, for his work in uncovering crypto-related scams and rug-pulls in the community. Flaunch.gg is a new meme coin launch platform on the Base ( BASE ) network and is powered by Uniswap ( UNI ) V4. Unlike other launchpads, Flaunch.gg allows users to buy, sell, and launch tokens with 100% of the trading fees going to developers rather than centralized entities. In the case of the ZACH token, it claims that 96% of the trading fees will be paid to ZachXBT in Ethereum, while the other 4% goes to the community in the form of buybacks. “Zach doesn’t have to hold or sell a single coin. This is an entirely new way to fundraise for others,” wrote X user @0xCaps, one of the main supporters of Flaunch.gg. According to data on Flaunch.gg, ZACH has yielded more than $2,000 in total revenue. This means that ZachXBT will receive at least $1,920 from the 96% of revenue. In the past 24 hours, the token’s price has gone down by nearly 11% and is owned by 222 holders.

Rohit Chauhan from Polygon Labs asked Caps if he was the one who launched the token, while Account Director of Hype Partners, Jayrabs.eth also chimed in with “let me guess, launched on flaunch.gg.” “Flaunch is a better mechanism,” wrote Bankless Venture’s David Hoffman on X, responding to the ZachXBT token. Ex-Polygon and current Base developer @Sir_Damilare said the token’s launch was “interesting,” highlighting that Zach has earned around $2,400 revenue so far, based on a screen-capture taken on launch day. Other traders have also tagged Zach’s account and called the token a “new method of donation.” At the time of writing, ZachXBT has not posted anything on his socials acknowledging the Flaunch token’s existence or whether he has received the funds. ZachXBT meme coin controversy This is not the first time developers have launched a token dedicated to the crypto sleuth with the purpose of raising funds for his investigative efforts. In mid-January this year, a Solana ( SOL )-based meme coin was created called Justice for ZachXBT or ZACHXBT. According to data on CoinGecko, ZACHXBT has gone down by 11.2% and is currently trading hands at $0.0004276. The anonymous developers sent Zach 50% of the token supply. ZachXBT sold a portion of his holdings, bringing the meme coin’s value down. Many accused him of rug-pulling the token, even though the token was launched to support him. He denied being behind the token’s creation as he claimed to not know the developers and never promoted the token on his socials. The internet investigator has been candidly honest about not getting paid for his past efforts in maintaining safety and transparency in the crypto community. One such instance was when the crypto sleuth uncovered $12 million linked to the Caesar ransomware incident in September 2023. “Wasted my time on bs like this which never rewarded me at all and only warped my view of doing good,” wrote ZachXBT on his post . So far, ZachXBT’s X account bio has a link for people to send donations in Solana for his efforts and a link to his public Telegram channel.

Ethereum ( ETH ) fell 23.6% to an intraday low of $2,368 on Feb. 3 Asian morning after U.S. President Donald Trump announced trade tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico over the weekend. Higher import tariffs could drive up inflation, potentially leading to higher interest rates. This, in turn, triggered a risk-off sentiment, which pressured cryptocurrency prices. As of press time, the altcoin market fell 28% to nearly $1.07 trillion, with several major altcoins like XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), and Cardano ( ADA ), among others recording losses between 15-30% over the past day. Ethereum experienced its largest liquidation event in the past two years, with $475.72 million liquidated from long positions and $127.78 million from short positions over the past 24 hours. During the same period, open interest in its futures market fell 27% to $23.36 billion, while its funding rate dropped to levels last seen during the March 2020 COVID crash. The sharp drop in Ethereum’s open interest suggests traders are pulling back from leveraged positions, likely due to heightened market uncertainty.

ETH could rebound Despite the sharp sell-off, signs of dip buying are emerging, hinting that some investors see the pullback as a buying opportunity rather than a prolonged downturn. Investors have withdrawn $326.7 million worth of ETH from exchanges over the past three days, according to data from CoinGlass. Typically, such outflows suggest that investors are accumulating during the dip, anticipating a price recovery once bearish pressure eases. Whales have also begun buying the largest altcoin following its recent price plunge. According to a Feb. 3 X post from Onchain Lens, a whale purchased 35,494 ETH, worth nearly $88 million. In a subsequent post, the platform reported another whale buying $1 million worth of $ETH following the recent dip. Insane hold of $DAI . A whale has used $1M $DAI to buy 398 $ETH at a price of $2,515, after holding $DAI for almost 2.5 years. The whale received these $DAI from FixedFloat 2.5 years ago.

However, he noted that Ethereum has struggled in recent days and, without strong catalysts or fresh narratives, it is likely to remain weak against Bitcoin. “If global tariff concerns escalate or another wave of negative news hits the market, we could see one more leg down before ETH finds more stable ground,” he added. Meanwhile, analyst Ali Martinez identified an ascending parallel channel in Ethereum’s price action on the 3-day chart. He noted that ETH must hold the $2,750 support level to sustain its trajectory within the channel. If this level holds, Martinez projected a potential rebound to $6,760. At press time Ether was still own 18.4%, exchanging hands at $2,541 per coin.

The Bitcoin Kimchi Premium has spiked to a three-year high of 11.9%. The premium represents the price gap between Bitcoin ( BTC ) in South Korea and the rest of the world. The increase suggests that there is a solid domestic demand for the asset even as prices fall globally. Even as BTC’s price dropped to $93,900, South Korean traders are paying a significant markup. At the same time, a high U.S. Dollar Index has added downward pressure on BTC’s price globally amid a massive Trump-tariff sell-off in the Asian markets. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju believes the surge in BTC’s “Kimchi Premium” is not attributed to Korean traders entering to buy the dip; rather, BTC is being converted to USD instead of Korean Won. This suggests that relatively few Koreans are cashing out BTC for their fiat, and similar patterns may be playing out in other markets. #Bitcoin Kimchi Premium is 12% right now—a three-year high. The main reason for BTC drop seems to be the strong DXY. pic.twitter.com/fjFOyUH5Pr — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) February 3, 2025 Asian markets slump On Feb. 1, Donald Trump imposed tariffs as part of his protectionist measures to protect domestic industries through taxes and restrictions on foreign goods. Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada and 10% tariffs on Chinese products. Tariffs are set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. EST on Tuesday. As per The Tribune , Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dropped 2.07%, while all the other Asian indices—including Japan’s Nikkei 225 index—tumbled over 2.27%. The KOSPI index of South Korea fell 2.87%, and Taiwan’s weighted index dropped 3.74%. The Indian stock futures are also down with the tariff impact. To explain the current situation unfolding in the Asian stock market, Daniel Yan wrote on X on Feb. 3 that it was “another typical weak Monday.” The large sell-off reflects Asia’s vulnerability to protectionism policies by the U.S. and the growing concerns about global economic instability, believes Yan. Sell-off: another typical weak Monday driven by low liquidity and CTAs chasing – Asia market these days can’t take any negative news nor apply independent thinking. The tariffs won’t lead to much productivity shock or inflation shock for the U.S. – market will recover soon. — Daniel Yan (@_D_Y_A_N) February 3, 2025 Protectionism, in the form of tariffs and quotas, has a long pedigree from the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 that exacerbated the Great Depression. The wider market slump coincides with the crypto market crash, with over $2 billion in liquidations on exchanges, the greatest single-day event in history. However, analysts such as Ansem are positive that the stock and crypto market would revive if Trump’s diplomatic discussions with Canada and Mexico on tariff do not go “ horribly wrong “. Another analyst, Smart Money Asia, pointed out on Jan. 23 that the present executive order by Trump aims to regulate crypto but does not provide traders with plans for a U.S. reserve of BTC, which has been pending for a while. He also sheds light on how the Central Bank of Japan raised rates to 0.5% to combat inflation, its highest in 17 years. According to him, BTC and tech stocks remain a potential powerful hedge against inflation in the Asia market, but he suggests investors practice caution as the BTC bull market matures.

USDe differs from stablecoins such Circle's USDC because it's a synthetic stablecoin and not backed by fiat assets at a 1:1 ratio. The stablecoin maintains its $1 peg by collateralizing stablecoins and leveraging a hedged cash-and-carry trade, which involves taking futures positions with large open interest available to stabilize value. USDe spent most of the Monday trading day maintaining its $1 peg, with brief dips down to $0.999. Data from CoinGecko shows that the stablecoin's market cap inched above $6 billion, up from about $5.7 billion a week ago. Its funding rate also remained positive according to on-chain data. Funding rates are crucial for maintaining USDe's peg to the dollar and managing market equilibrium. A positive funding rate indicates that holders of long positions are paying a small fee to holders of short positions. This suggests a slightly bullish market sentiment. Another reason why USDe may have maintained its peg is because of the interest bearing nature of the token, which currently pays out an APY of 10%, which has been stable over the last 30 days according to a dashboard from Dune Analytics. Last year some concern was raised about the size of Ethena's reserve fund for USDe, with research house CryptoQuant highlighting that the fund might not be sustainable over $4 billion. However, this reserve fund has grown proportionately to USDe's market cap, and stands at $46.6 million at the end of Q4 2024. Crypto market safe haven? USDe's stability plus yield-bearing appeal means investors could take refuge in the token. Arthur Hayes, chief investment officer at digital asset investment fund Maelstrom and co-founder of BitMEX, who expects BTC to slide to $75,000 in coming weeks, has record exposure to USDe. ""Maelstrom has raised the amount of staked Ethena $USDe it holds to record levels and continues to take profits on several shitcoin position,"" Hayes said in a blog post last week. ""We are still bigly net long, but if my feeling is correct, then we will be positioned with copious amounts of dry powder ready to buy the dip on Bitcoin and a mega dip on many quality shitcoins,"" Hayes added.

Traders keep a close watch on bearish divergences, especially on the higher time frame as it suggests that an asset is losing momentum even though its price is rising or going sideways. Says Bluntz, “SOL losing $220 is really bad in my opinion. Invalidates the ABC from the highs and makes it look more impulsive and looks like there’s a two-week bearish divergence printing in 24 hours, and it will need an absolute miracle to save that. It’s over in my opinion.” Source: Bluntz/X In his latest SOL analysis, Bluntz notes that Solana printed the same bearish divergence signal on the two-week chart in late 2021, just before SOL collapsed from a high of about $260 to a bear market low of $8. “It printed.

The new tariffs of 25% on Canadian & Mexican goods and 10% on Chinese goods and a retaliatory 25% tariff from Canada on American goods have changed the market dynamics in the traditional as well as the crypto markets. Bitcoin price slipped down to $91,000 while Ethereum plunged to reach close to $2000, testing the multi-year support range. What’s Next for the Ethereum (ETH) Price Rally? In the past 24 hours, Ethereum has faced a massive long liquidation of over $610 million compared to $411 million of Bitcoin. Moreover, the single largest liquidation order was with ETH/BTC of around $25.64 million. Meanwhile, this opportunity was utilized well by a whale ‘7 Siblings’ who spent $111.72M and bought 45,047 ETH at an average price of $2,480. After the market dropped, whale ""7 Siblings"" spent $111.72M to buy 45,047 $ETH at an average price of $2,480! https://t.co/ygfREDmCQA pic.twitter.com/xkOAvsB2jp — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) February 3, 2025 This accumulation seems to have offered some momentum for the ETH price rally, which has recovered above $2500 in the times when the bottom below $2000 was on the horizon. Despite this, bearish clouds continue to hover over the second-largest token as the buying volume has not reached the expected range. Therefore, the price needs to hold above $2500 and secure levels above $2800 at the earliest, which may revive a decent upswing. With the Altcoins Losing over $700M, Has the AltSeason Differed in 2025? Throughout the year 2024, altcoins have maintained a significant strength by surging over 50% to 60% from the yearly lows. Regardless of this, the possibility of the start of an Altseason remains unclear as Bitcoin dominance is gaining traction while Ethereum dominance continues to drop. the latest correction not only caused a huge drop in BTC price but also helped the BTC dominance to spike above the crucial resistance and reach 61.83%. On the other hand, ETH dominance, which had stabilized at around 20%, has plunged to levels close to 10%. On the other hand, ETH/BTC has broken down from a descending parallel channel, flashing bearish waves across for the second-largest token, delaying the Altseason. After facing massive liquidation among the top 10, the macro-buy signal for Ethereum has just flashed on. Therefore, the ETH price is expected to bounce back strongly as it has been used as a rare opportunity to bid amid the larger sell-off than expected.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|BTC|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-03 08:11:23
