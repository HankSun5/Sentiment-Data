The move targets improving scalability, reducing latency, enhancing security, and ensuring cost efficiency. This development will ultimately advance Theta’s AI processing capabilities. A Strategic Fusion between AI and Blockchain With this integration, Theta has better infrastructure to grow its AI training and computational demands. According to experts’ opinions, integration is vital for the broader AI and blockchain space. AI developers can rely on EdgeCloud’s decentralized platform to train their AI models. This is crucial given the volume of data required to train AI and guarantee the optimum performance of the project. Additionally, EdgeCloud integration helps provide a bridge between AI and decentralized infrastructure. Another critical advantage is that blockchain technology provides enhanced security for AI processes while ensuring data integrity. This suggests that Theta is investing in the future growth of AI via decentralized computing. This development places Theta in a key role as the AI blockchain revolution gains momentum. Analysts maintain that if properly harnessed, Theta might emerge as a leader in the convergence of AI and blockchain. DeepSeek-R1’s Market Disruption For context, DeepSeek-R1 is an AI model designed to provide cost-efficient scalable AI processing. The groundbreaking technology China’s AI lab DeepSeek developed disrupted the broader financial market. DeepSeek massively impacted the crypto market as total capitalization dipped by a significant 6.4% . This disruption came from the now controversial claim that the DeepSeek R1 was built on a lean budget of $6 million. Experts maintain that DeepSeek has opened a new chapter in AI modeling history despite the controversial claim. They believe developers would evolve more cost-effective ways of training models and building AI technology. Fraudulent DeepSeek Tokens Emerge In the crypto space, fraudsters took advantage of the hype around DeepSeek to launch scam tokens. BlockAid, a cyber-security firm, identified at least 75 scam tokens that claimed association with DeepSeek . These malicious actors even faked the company’s official website with plans to dispossess users of their funds. This development prompted DeepSeek to issue a critical warning to alert users. With the recent development of Theta, many are keenly observing how this will impact the broader ecosystem.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. IntelMarkets, a new altcoin at $0.08, could overtake DOGE with its massive growth potential. Table of Contents Dogecoin’s price forecast IntelMarkets: Why this AI giant is set for growth Conclusion While Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been a favorite among crypto traders due to its strong community and social media hype, its growth potential appears to be slowing. As the market shifts focus, projects with real-world utility are taking the lead. One such altcoin at $0.08 is dominating charts with projections of a massive price increase. Dogecoin’s price forecast Since its launch, Dogecoin has come a long way and positioned itself as a top crypto, currently ranking at number 8. Dogecoin was propelled into the mainstream during the 2021 crypto boom, partly thanks to endorsements from Elon Musk and a surge in retail interest. In this span, Dogecoin’s price reached its all-time high of $0.7376 in May 2021. However, up until November, the Dogecoin price had lacked momentum. In the days following the election results, Dogecoin’s price saw a 200% increase thanks to Elon Musk’s announcement of heading the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). After this news, DOGE seemed to have entered a stagnant period. Some experts suggest that DOGE could see incremental gains, reaching $0.80–$1 by 2026, driven by potential mainstream adoption and continued influencer endorsements. However, the coin’s lack of significant technological upgrades or utility-driven catalysts could limit its upside potential.

Launched in August 2024, IntelMarkets aims to revolutionize the crypto trading market by integrating artificial intelligence into every aspect of trading. INTL’s unique self-learning trading bots will analyze vast amounts of data, identify profitable opportunities, and execute trades with remarkable speed and efficiency, offering retail traders an edge previously reserved for institutional investors. Unlike DOGE, which is already widely adopted, IntelMarkets is still in its early stages. Furthermore, IntelMarkets’ dual-chain architecture, which operates on both the Solana and Ethereum blockchains, ensures scalability and interoperability, positioning INTL as a strong contender. Currently, the presale has raised more than $7.9 million, which is a sign of the amount of confidence and momentum it has created. In its ninth stage, INTL’s tokens are priced at $0.082, making them appealing to early backers. With some analysts predicting a 10x increase by 2026, INTL comes out as a must-watch altcoin this year. Conclusion Dogecoin’s growth potential appears to be slowing. In contrast, IntelMarkets is an emerging force with real-world applications, AI-driven innovation, and a clear vision for the future of trading.

This lending platform offers features like secure borrowing and supplying of crypto assets, aiming to make DeFi more accessible and efficient. With its presale underway and a clear plan for future growth, many are wondering if Mutuum Finance could become a top player in the DeFi market. Mutuum Finance: A New DeFi Lending Protocol Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending protocol that allows users to supply or borrow crypto assets securely. Built with a focus on flexibility and transparency, the platform provides efficient tools for managing crypto assets while ensuring a user-friendly experience. The protocol features two main markets: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C market, automated smart contracts securely handle transactions, providing an efficient way to supply or borrow assets. The P2P market, in contrast, facilitates direct user-to-user interactions, allowing personalized agreements while maintaining security through the platform’s audited smart contracts. Additionally, the P2P market ensures the protocol remains as safe as possible by preventing interactions or the inclusion of coins that fail to meet high-security standards, such as centralized tokens, exploit-prone tokens, or tokens without minting limits. The Mutuum Finance team plans to implement a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), enabling community-driven governance. With the DAO in place, token holders will have a say in key decisions, such as platform updates and future developments. This approach promotes transparency and ensures that the project evolves in line with the community’s interests. To enhance the platform’s ecosystem, the team is also developing a fully collateralized stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. This stablecoin will provide users with a stable and reliable medium for transactions, further strengthening the platform’s utility and trustworthiness. For suppliers, investing in liquidity pools can generate passive income. For example, a $10,000 USDT contribution at a 7% APY could yield $700 annually, depending on demand. Borrowers can use assets like ETH as collateral to access funds without selling their holdings, providing financial flexibility. Mutuum Finance is currently in its first presale stage, offering tokens at their lowest price of $0.01. This initial stage provides investors with a unique chance to secure tokens before the price increases in subsequent stages. With a launch price set at $0.06, early investors stand to see a 1700% return on their investments by the token’s release. This attractive entry point is generating significant demand, creating a sense of urgency among investors eager to capitalize on this promising opportunity. Crypto experts anticipate that the first presale stage will sell out quickly due to the low entry price, creating strong demand among investors. Adding to the momentum, the team plans to launch a beta version of the platform at the same time as the token’s release. This strategic move is expected to increase demand for MUTM and drive up its price post-launch, making now an opportune time to invest. Mutuum Finance has announced an exciting $100,000 giveaway aimed at rewarding its early supporters and fostering community engagement. The total prize pool will be divided among 10 winners, with each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. To participate, users need to follow simple steps outlined on the official Mutuum Finance website, such as engaging with the project’s social media channels and completing specific tasks. Mutuum Finance is quickly gaining recognition as a promising new player in the DeFi market. With its focus on secure and flexible lending through P2C and P2P markets, along with plans for a DAO and a fully collateralized stablecoin, the platform is well-positioned for sustainable growth. The ongoing presale offers early investors an opportunity to secure substantial returns, with a projected 2700% increase by launch. With features and strategic plans, Mutuum Finance could be a significant contender in the DeFi space by 2025.

Ripple’s XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE), two established names in the cryptocurrency arena, are currently experiencing downturns, prompting investors to rethink their future viability. On the other hand, Web3Bay (3BAY) , a burgeoning crypto project, is maintaining a strong upward trajectory and capturing attention as a potential market leader. Could this be the next big crypto to explode? Let’s delve into why Web3Bay is capturing investor interest. XRP Faces Market Slowdown Ripple’s XRP, traditionally seen as a frontrunner in the cryptocurrency sphere for its role in facilitating international payments, is currently hampered by ongoing litigation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This legal contention has cast a shadow over its growth prospects, placing investors in a state of uncertainty. Despite some legal victories, the continuing dispute has cast doubts on XRP’s regulatory standing. New competing blockchain solutions for global transactions have also surfaced, vying for XRP’s market position. Consequently, XRP has found it challenging to overcome key resistance levels in its pricing, presenting it as a precarious option for investors seeking notable returns in the short term. Dogecoin’s Decline: From Excitement to Uncertainty Dogecoin, the pioneering meme coin, gained massive attention during its explosive growth in 2021, driven by social media fervor and endorsements from celebrities like Elon Musk. Yet, as the market shifts towards projects with practical applications, Dogecoin’s absence of functionality has become more evident. In contrast to other advanced cryptocurrencies that provide real-world uses, Dogecoin remains largely driven by speculative interest. The diminishing enthusiasm for meme coins and the absence of substantial tech advancements have caused DOGE to struggle in reclaiming its peak levels. Although it retains a dedicated user base, Dogecoin’s prospects for sustained growth seem constrained, especially when compared to rising projects like Web3Bay. Web3Bay’s Rise: Transforming Decentralized E-Commerce Unlike XRP and DOGE, which have been facing challenges, Web3Bay is consistently building momentum. As a decentralized e-commerce platform, Web3Bay utilizes blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and user-focused marketplace, challenging established giants like Amazon and eBay. Web3Bay removes middlemen, allowing buyers and sellers to connect directly. Transactions use the platform’s own 3BAY token and are secured by blockchain-enabled smart contracts. Web3Bay also offers dual payment options, accommodating both cryptocurrency and conventional methods like PayPal, broadening its appeal to both crypto enthusiasts and the general market. The success of Web3Bay’s presale, having raised $1 million so far, underscores the platform’s potential to revolutionize the trillion-dollar e-commerce sector. The attractive presale price of the token has further boosted its popularity. Currently priced at $0.004562 during the presale, the 3BAY token presents an incredible chance for early investors. Projected to launch at $0.1959, investors could see a 4,193% return on investment at launch. If the token hits $0.50 in the future, a $1,000 investment now could potentially surge to $10,960, showcasing its potential as the next crypto to explode. Wrapping Up: The Next Crypto to Explode The cryptocurrency landscape is ever-changing, with new entrants frequently challenging established cryptocurrencies. As XRP and DOGE struggle, Web3Bay is emerging as a formidable candidate for the title of the next crypto to explode. Web3Bay’s novel take on decentralized e-commerce, coupled with its successful crypto presale and significant growth potential, positions it as one of the most promising new projects. With $1 million already raised and a potential ROI exceeding 4,000%, this is a prime opportunity for early backers to invest in a project with high potential. The real question isn’t if Web3Bay will succeed, but rather how extensive its impact will be. As the platform progresses, now could be an optimal time to consider this potentially lucrative investment. Are you prepared to be part of the Web3Bay movement?

Simultaneously, excitement is mounting over a potential Shiba Inu partnership, with lead developer Shytoshi Kusama suggesting a significant collaboration that could transform Shibarium’s future. The standout opportunity now lies with BlockDAG’s enhanced Affiliate Program. Offering a quick 5% USDT cashback, this initiative immediately benefits both referrers and buyers, standing out as one of the most advantageous programs in the cryptocurrency market. With BDAG coin’s value skyrocketing by 2380%, ongoing presale batches continue to push prices upward, amplifying the value of early engagement. As demand grows, BlockDAG (BDAG) is reinforcing its reputation as a top crypto asset. Challenges for Toncoin as Burn Rates Decrease & Inflation Increases Toncoin price has fallen to $4.80, a notable 33% drop from its highest value last November. This decline coincides with an increase in exchange inflows, as over 240,000 TON tokens have been moved to exchanges this past week. Moreover, the burn rate has significantly decreased, with just 5,805 coins eliminated from circulation on January 28, down from 15,000 earlier in the month. Meanwhile, inflation has reached 0.37%, marking the highest level in almost six months. With technical indicators suggesting further downturns, there is a concern that Toncoin price might decrease to $3.78, a critical Fibonacci retracement level, indicating a possible 22% reduction. Potential Broad Impact from Shiba Inu Partnership Shytoshi Kusama has teased a Shiba Inu partnership that could substantially alter the Shibarium ecosystem. While specifics are still undisclosed, Kusama has confirmed that this arrangement would affect major projects including SHIB, LEASH, TREAT, and BONE. Following Shiba Inu’s recent collaboration with Astra Nova, focusing on Web3 gaming and AI integration, there has been a notable increase in SHIB’s value by 3.2% and heightened activity from large holders. As anticipation for the Shiba Inu partnership grows, the community eagerly awaits more information on how this strategic move will impact Shibarium and the broader cryptocurrency market. Earn 5% USDT Instantly with Every BlockDAG Referral BlockDAG’s refreshed Affiliate Program now offers an immediate 5% USDT cashback, benefiting both referrers and buyers right away. Take this scenario: if an individual purchases $50,000 in BDAG coins, both the person who referred them and the buyer themselves receive $2,500 USDT immediately. This swift reward system is designed to attract those seeking simple earnings while participating in a burgeoning ecosystem. The process to start earning USDT instantly is straightforward, opening it up to everyone, everywhere. Users simply need to sign into the BlockDAG Dashboard, create a referral link, and share it within their networks and the broader crypto community. Every purchase made through these links triggers an automatic 5% cashback in USDT (BEP-20) for both parties involved, with no paperwork, no delays, and no complex processes. The program is crafted to be simple and inclusive, allowing participation without needing deep technical skills or previous experience in cryptocurrencies. Referrers enjoy an immediate 5% in USDT, while buyers gain not only the same cashback but also the potential for significant future returns by acquiring one of the top crypto assets. BlockDAG has seen its value soar by 2380%, from $0.001 to $0.0248 across 27 presale stages, selling over 18.3 billion BDAG coins and raising $191.5 million—and the total is still rising. As each presale stage progresses, the price of BDAG climbs, rewarding early participants more significantly. With increasing demand, BDAG’s rise in the market is a clear indicator of strong interest, securing its place as a top crypto asset. The Bottom Line Toncoin price is currently under stress due to decreased burn rates and increasing inflation, which may lead to further declines. While the Shiba Inu partnership is causing a buzz, the full extent of its impact is yet to be revealed. In the meantime, BlockDAG offers substantial opportunities for all. The program’s instant 5% USDT cashback for referrals and purchases simplifies the process of earning USDT, highlighting BDAG’s remarkable growth of 2380%. As prices increase with each crypto presale phase, hesitating could mean missing out on higher potential earnings. The Affiliate Program is a limited-time opportunity, making now an ideal moment to earn additional USDT while securing a stake in one of the top crypto assets available.

Will XRP price stage an early rebound as US Canada trade war flares. XRP Price Stabilizes Above $2.60 as Trump Tariff War Triggers Risk-Off Sentiment Ripple (XRP) has been on a downtrend for the past three days, with multiple bearish catalysts, including escalating trade tensions between the US and Canada. On February 2, XRP fell as low as $2.60, marking a 17% decline from its opening price of $3.10 on January 29. The recent market turmoil was triggered by the announcement of new tariffs, as former President Donald Trump accused Canada of unfair trade practices and imposed new restrictions on key exports. In response, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced retaliatory measures, igniting fears of a prolonged economic standoff. The geopolitical uncertainty has sent shockwaves through global markets. Key US Stock indices tumbled, while the crypto market followed suit, with Bitcoin (BTC) plunging to $96,000 . Meanwhile, gold gained traction as investors fled to safe-haven assets, highlighting the classic risk-off sentiment seen during times of geopolitical instability. Ripple (XRP) Price Action, Feb 2, 2025 | Source: Coingecko Despite the losses, Ripple price action showed relative resilience compared to other mega-cap altcoins. While XRP posted a 10% daily drop, some of last week’s top gainers like SUI and Polkadot suffered even steeper declines, exceeding 15% in the same period. This performance suggests that XRP might attract strategic buyers looking to enter the market at a discount amid the uncertainty. 490 Million XRP Transferred from Binance, Hinting at Resilient Long-Term Outlook on ETFs While XRP’s price has been under pressure, on-chain data points to a potentially bullish underlying trend. A significant metric to assess investor sentiment is the total XRP reserves on Binance. CryptoQuant’s data reveals that XRP deposits on Binance have dropped to a 40-day low, decreasing from 3.04 billion XRP on January 16 to 2.55 billion XRP as of February 2. This means 490 million XRP coins have exited Binance in just over two weeks. This decline in exchange reserves suggests that long-term investors and whales are accumulating XRP and moving their holdings into cold storage. Binance processes over 40% of the global retail crypto market, making this metric particularly relevant in gauging investor sentiment. Ripple (XRP) Price vs. Exchange Reserves (Binance) | Source: CryptoQuant Another interpretation of this trend is that institutional players may be proactively accumulating XRP in anticipation of regulatory clarity surrounding exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Bloomberg analysts recently hinted that a Litecoin ETF may be approved first, raising expectations that other altcoins, such as XRP, could follow. Institutional investors often acquire assets in advance of major regulatory developments, suggesting that the recent outflows could be linked to potential ETF-related holdings. Valued at the current price, the 490 million XRP removed from Binance translates to approximately $1.3 billion. This supply reduction could act as a buffer against further downward price action, potentially stabilizing XRP at $2.60 while other cryptocurrencies experience more extreme losses. In conclusion, despite XRP’s recent decline, the asset appears to be holding up better than some of its peers. Whale accumulation, declining exchange reserves, and the ETF narrative could provide strong tailwinds for XRP’s price action once broader market conditions stabilize. XRP Price Forecast: $3 rebound hopes hinges on $2.60 support XRP price forecast charts shows the Ripple-backed coin stabilized above the critical $2.60 support level, and despite the recent sell-off, the broader technical structure suggests a potential rebound toward $3.00 if key indicators align. The Elliott Wave structure on the daily chart signals that XRP recently completed its fifth wave up, followed by a sharp corrective move, a typical market cycle behavior. The Fibonacci retracement levels highlight a key support zone around $2.5990, coinciding with the 0.618 retracement level, which historically acts as a strong reversal point for bullish recoveries. If XRP maintains this level, buyers could regain confidence, fueling a potential move toward the 0.382 ($2.8439) or even $3.0562 resistance. XRP price forecast | Feb 2, 2025 The MACD indicator, however, presents a more cautious outlook, with the signal line crossing below the MACD line, confirming weakening bullish momentum. If selling pressure persists and XRP loses the $2.60 support, a deeper retracement toward $2.50 remains likely. However, if buyers absorb the current supply and the MACD histogram begins to show diminishing red bars, it could confirm bottoming out, positioning XRP for a relief rally The post Ripple (XRP) Price Forecast: XRP Deposits on Binance Drops $1.3B to Hit 40-Day Low – Is It Bullish? appeared first on CoinGape .",Ripple|XRP|XRP price|XRP price analysis,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|EXCHANGE|BNB|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-02-02 23:04:22

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. The smart money in crypto is going to Jupiter, VeChain, and XYZVerse, a new altcoin making waves. Table of Contents The XYZverse takeover Jupiter Vechain Conclusion Investors are shifting their focus as new opportunities arise in the cryptocurrency landscape. Established projects like Jupiter (JUP) and VeChain (VET) are under close scrutiny, but a new altcoin is also capturing significant attention. The XYZverse takeover In the arena of sports, only the strongest thrive — athletes push limits, break records, and chase greatness with relentless determination. That same champion mindset fuels the crypto space, where fearless investors seek the next big win. Enter XYZverse, the first-ever meme coin ecosystem that fuses the competitive fire of sports with the electrifying energy of memes — a digital battlefield where sports lovers, gamers, and crypto warriors unite for legendary gains. Launched at $0.0001, XYZ has already bulldozed through ten presale stages, now priced at $0.002. The momentum isn’t slowing down. With a final presale target of $0.1, early buyers secured 99% discounts, putting them in prime position for massive returns. XYZverse isn’t just another hype-driven pump — it’s designed to last and dominate. The project’s tokenomics ensure a stable, sustainable trajectory, with: 15% allocated to liquidity, strengthening its foundation. 10% dedicated to community rewards, fueling engagement through bonuses and airdrops. A deflationary burn of 17.13%, steadily reducing supply and amplifying long-term value. XYZverse isn’t playing small — it’s building bridges between sports fandom and crypto mass adoption. With plans to collaborate with high-profile athletes, XYZ will soon dominate both the meme coin and sports entertainment landscapes. These game-changing partnerships will boost visibility, credibility, and demand, ensuring that XYZ becomes the gold standard of sports-driven meme coins. XYZverse is a movement and its community is ready to storm the charts. With a winning formula of hype, utility, and long-term vision, XYZ is set to redefine what a meme coin can achieve. Interested investors can be part of XYZVerse via presale. Jupiter Jupiter has established itself as a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator within the Solana ecosystem, ensuring users access the best token swap rates by pulling liquidity from multiple pools. This not only enhances trading efficiency but also reduces costs for users. Beyond swaps, Jupiter has expanded its services, introducing perpetual futures, decentralized stablecoin solutions, and the innovative LFG launchpad — an accelerator designed to support emerging Solana projects. One of Jupiter’s biggest contributions to DeFi is addressing price discrepancies across various platforms. Since liquidity pools on different exchanges can create pricing variations, Jupiter’s aggregation model guarantees users the most competitive rates. As the DeFi sector evolves, platforms like Jupiter — offering tangible utility and solving real market inefficiencies — stand out as compelling opportunities compared to projects with less concrete use cases.

The trader established a 50x leveraged short position when ETH was valued at $3,388, with a liquidation threshold set at $4,645, according to data from Hypurrscan. In addition to the unrealized profit, the trader accrued approximately $2.3 million in funding fees from the leveraged position. While leveraged trading can amplify potential gains, it also significantly increases the risk of substantial losses. A case in point is a pseudonymous trader who, in January 2024, lost over $161,000 in a single trade due to liquidation on a leveraged position, underscoring the inherent risks associated with such strategies. As of February 2, Ether’s price had declined by more than 4% over a 24-hour period, trading at $3,107. The cryptocurrency reached a daily low of $3,068 but managed to stay above the critical $3,000 psychological threshold, as reported by Cointelegraph Markets Pro. To reverse its six-week downward trend, Ethereum may need to bolster fundamental blockchain activity. Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at Nansen, noted, “Other layer-1s are catching up with Ethereum regarding apps, use cases, fees and amount staked.” Barthere suggested that increased collaboration with both private and public sector entities, especially in the United States amid recent regulatory developments favoring blockchain and cryptocurrency, could be beneficial for Ethereum. For a potential reversal toward the $4,000 mark, Ether would need to reclaim the $3,400 level, according to crypto trader Cas Abbé. However, significant resistance is anticipated at $3,240. Surpassing this level could trigger over $1 billion in cumulative leveraged short liquidations, as indicated by data from CoinGlass. These developments highlight the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets and the substantial risks and rewards associated with leveraged trading strategies.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-02 23:15:00

Among the myriad of options, Qubetics , Astra, and Ethereum have emerged as prominent players, each bringing unique innovations to the table. Qubetics has been making waves with its impressive presale performance and the introduction of its QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Astra is gaining attention for its focus on quantum-resistant security protocols, positioning itself as a forward-thinking project in the blockchain space. Ethereum, the pioneer of smart contracts, continues to dominate the decentralized application (dApp) landscape with its robust platform. This article delves into the key milestones and market positions of these cryptocurrencies, exploring how they have established themselves as alternative investment instruments to traditional assets. Qubetics: Pioneering with QubeQode IDE Qubetics is in its 20th presale stage, with each $TICS token priced at $0.0606. The project has successfully raised over $11.5 million, selling more than 453 million tokens to over 17,600 holders. Analysts predict that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, translating to a 274.70% return on investment. Looking ahead, forecasts suggest potential prices of $1 (1,398.82% ROI), $5 (7,394.11% ROI), or even $15 (22,382.34% ROI) after the mainnet launch. A standout feature of Qubetics is its QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE), designed to streamline the development of decentralized applications (dApps) across multiple blockchains. This user-friendly platform enables developers to write, test, and deploy smart contracts efficiently, fostering innovation in the crypto space. Consider a startup aiming to launch a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. With QubeQode IDE, the development team can seamlessly integrate various blockchain protocols, reducing development time and costs. This efficiency allows businesses to bring their products to market faster, staying ahead in the competitive crypto landscape. For individual developers, QubeQode IDE offers an accessible entry point into dApp development, providing tools and resources that simplify complex coding processes.

This innovation promises faster transaction speeds while maintaining high security and decentralization. The market response to Astra’s advancements has been overwhelmingly positive. Trading activity has surged, and its expanding ecosystem has attracted attention from developers seeking quantum-proof solutions. Analysts predict that as quantum computing advances, Astra’s relevance will only grow, making it a hot pick for investors focused on Layer 1 innovation. By focusing on future-proof security measures, Astra addresses potential vulnerabilities in current blockchain systems, positioning itself as a leader in secure and scalable blockchain solutions. Ethereum: The Smart Contract Pioneer Ethereum, introduced in 2015, revolutionized the blockchain space by enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Its platform has become the foundation for numerous projects, ranging from DeFi platforms to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Ethereum is trading at approximately $3,393.82, with a market capitalization exceeding $400 billion. Its transition to Ethereum 2.0, which involves shifting from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, aims to improve scalability, security, and energy efficiency. Over the years, Ethereum has cultivated a vast developer community, contributing to a rich ecosystem of dApps and protocols. Its ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards have become the industry norm for fungible and non-fungible tokens, respectively. For investors seeking exposure to a platform with a proven track record and continuous innovation, Ethereum remains a compelling choice. Its established infrastructure and ongoing upgrades suggest potential for sustained growth and adoption. Conclusion: Navigating the Future of Crypto Investments Qubetics , with its innovative QubeQode IDE and successful presale, offers a fresh perspective in the crypto space. Astra provides a forward-thinking approach to blockchain security, addressing future challenges with quantum-resistant protocols. Ethereum continues to lead with its robust platform, supporting a vast array of decentralized applications. Investors exploring the top crypto presale opportunities should consider these projects, each presenting unique innovations and potential for growth.

Per the House of Representatives’ official website and a report from the Japanese-language media outlet Iolite , Kato made the comments at a plenary session of the House of Representatives on the 31st. Japanese Finance Minister: Regulators Readying Crypto Tax Review Kato was responding to a question from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lawmaker Akihisa Shiozaki, the head of the party’s Web3 Digital Society Promotion office. LDP lawmaker Akihisa Shiozaki with a Thai diplomat in October 2023. (Source: MFA of Thailand/X) Kato explained that the Financial Service Agency (FSA) will issue a review “based on the ruling party [LDP]’s tax system proposals.” He added that the review would include recommendations on “necessary legislative amendments.” Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba also waded into the discussion by “expressing his belief that cryptoassets” would “contribute to solving Japan’s social problems and improving productivity.” “The healthy development of web3 – including cryptoassets – is extremely important.” Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba Ishiba added that it was “important” for the government to “ensure user protection” and “improve the environment” of the domestic crypto market. Japan intends to closely monitor the impact on its currency of US President Donald Trump’s new tariffs and is worried about the international fallout from the trade imposts, Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said. https://t.co/qxpf4okSOo — Bloomberg (@business) February 2, 2025 Regulator’s Report Key The minister said the FSA will also outline its proposed changes to the nation’s tax authorities. This, Kato said, will ensure any necessary changes are “put in place” before the new rules roll out. Kato also suggested that Tokyo is ready to change its legal definition of cryptoassets. Existing Japanese law defines crypto as a type of “payment instrument.” But the minister said that “in reality” coins like Bitcoin (BTC) are “mainly traded for investment purposes.” He added that the FSA has “indicated an intention” to “take in a wide range of opinions” before making an official recommendation “on the appropriateness of” crypto’s current “legal status.” Since the FSA began policing the Japanese crypto market in earnest in 2017, the agency has had the last word on all related regulations. The LDP, which has been in power on an almost uninterrupted basis since the 1950s, has formulated basic crypto policy. But it is the FSA that has formulated regulations and legal amendments. Thus far, all of the FSA’s proposals and requests made to parliament on the matter have been adopted without delay. Trading volumes on the Japanese crypto exchange platform Coincheck over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) PM’s Caution Ishiba’s predecessor Fumio Kishida took a relatively progressive stance on crypto regulation. Ishiba, however, has been more cautious on the matter of tax reform . But he has also made a number of more conciliatory comments about crypto and blockchain. Shiozaki’s department has called for faster action, claiming late last year that its proposal to reform crypto tax was of “urgent” importance. Japanese tax laws require crypto traders to report their profits on their yearly income tax returns. This runs in contrast to many other countries, which impose flat capital gains levies on traders (at rates of around 20%). Japanese traders must file their crypto trading profits on annual tax returns as “other income.” This means that the wealthiest crypto traders in Japan must hand over up to 55% of their trading profits to the Treasury. 日本政府、暗号資産の税制改正を含む規制整備について「6月末までに結論」と言及 ●石破首相は「暗号資産を含めたWeb3.0の健全な発展は極めて重要だ」と言及 ●暗号資産を金商法の対象とみなす可能性も焦点に ●今後も勉強会などを通じて幅広く意見を聞く方針 https://t.co/HzobxzTCS3 — Iolite（アイオライト）Web3.0 Front line (@Iolite_japan) January 31, 2025 ‘Unfair’ Tax Laws Many critics and Japanese crypto investors claim the Japanese crypto market is over-regulated. This, they claim, has stifled growth in the web3 and crypto sectors. The FSA, meanwhile, is also reportedly considering making an amendment to the Payment Services Act. This measure could see crypto included as an asset class under the terms of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. If true, this would appear to indicate that the FSA and the Japanese Finance Minster now share a common stance on reform.

The best opportunities will bring together strong technology, wide use, and real-world function to offer significant returns. BlockDAG (BDAG), Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), and Chainlink (LINK) each stand out for different reasons. BlockDAG’s advanced processing system improves transaction speed, Dogecoin thrives on its strong community, Solana offers an efficient network for developers, and Chainlink plays a major role in connecting blockchain with real-world data. Each of these best long-term cryptos is expected to play a key role in 2025. For those looking to stay ahead before the next big price jump, these four best long-term cryptos should be on every trader’s watchlist. Let’s explore what makes them stand out. 1. BlockDAG: Presale Gem with Massive Growth Potential BlockDAG (BDAG) is preparing for major advancements this year, including its mainnet release and listings on 10 major centralized exchanges. The project is focused on expanding its network and forming key connections that will support wider usage. What truly sets BlockDAG apart in the best long-term cryptos for 2025 is its powerful processing structure. Using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) setup, it allows multiple transactions at once without slowing down the system. This makes it highly suitable for areas like decentralized finance, gaming, and digital collectibles, where quick transactions and low costs are crucial. Speed plays a vital role in digital currency, and BlockDAG delivers in this aspect. Currently valued at $0.0248, BlockDAG’s presale has raised more than $191.5 million and sold over 18.1 billion coins since it began. Early supporters have already seen a 2,380% rise in value, with batch 27 receiving strong interest from buyers. BlockDAG’s processing capability and real-world application give BDAG both short-term potential and long-term stability. With anticipation growing around its mainnet launch, this project is on course to leave a lasting mark in the blockchain space. 2. Dogecoin: Community-Driven Meme Coin Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to be among the best long-term cryptos in 2025, backed by its active community and widespread recognition. Originally made for fun, DOGE has grown into a widely accepted digital currency, benefiting from its low fees, high liquidity, and frequent use for payments. Elon Musk’s connection to Dogecoin has kept it in the spotlight, with many believing it could be used for transactions on X (formerly Twitter). Although the coin remains highly speculative, its strong market presence makes it a key player. Dogecoin lacks major technical improvements, which raises concerns about its future strength. However, meme coins often thrive on popularity, and as digital currency markets shift, Dogecoin remains a relevant choice for those seeking speculative plays in 2025. 3. Solana: A Fast Network with Developer Appeal Solana (SOL) has proven itself as one of the quickest processing networks, handling transactions at high speed and low cost. Its easy-to-use system has made it a go-to platform for decentralized finance, NFTs, and gaming applications. Currently, Solana trades around $227.69 and faces strong resistance at $260, with many waiting to see if it will break through. The network’s ability to manage thousands of transactions per second makes it attractive for developers, but occasional outages have raised concerns about stability. Despite this, Solana continues to see growth, drawing attention from large firms and strengthening its place among the best long-term cryptos. 4. Chainlink: Bridging Data Between Blockchain & Reality Chainlink (LINK) plays a crucial role in connecting smart contracts with real-world data, serving as a key provider for multiple blockchains. As decentralized finance, gaming, and business applications expand, Chainlink’s data services and connection tools make it an essential part of the digital currency sector. At a price of $22.99, LINK has struggled to move past the $27.41 resistance mark, but its continued adoption by businesses and financial institutions supports its future value. One challenge is that Chainlink’s growth relies on how widely blockchain technology is used. If decentralized finance and smart contract usage slow down, it could affect LINK’s price. However, with large firms adopting Chainlink’s services, it remains a strong choice in the best long-term cryptos list. Best Long-Term Cryptos to Buy Now– Final Say! The digital currency market offers many choices, but selecting the right one can be difficult. This list highlights key options for those interested in fast transactions, community-driven assets, or essential blockchain services. Dogecoin holds its place due to strong user support, while Solana continues to show impressive speed and scalability. Chainlink remains a crucial service provider for blockchain-based applications. Among them, BlockDAG stands out as the most well-rounded choice, combining fast processing and real-world use cases. With major exchange listings and a mainnet launch happening this year, BDAG is set to see a rapid rise. Those keeping an eye on the best long-term cryptos for 2025 should take note—BlockDAG is positioned for major gains.

Unraveling ENS Inflows & Stacks Bearish Pattern",https://thecoinrise.com/web3bay-investors-eye-6430-roi-as-presale-hits-1m-unraveling-ens-inflows-stacks-bearish-pattern/,"The Stacks bearish pattern continues to impact the market. Recently, the $1.53 price level was broken, plunging STX by 62% from its peak value. Conversely, recent ENS whale influence shocked the market, with a substantial $9.15 million deposit leading to a 1041% increase in network inflows. For Web3Bay (3BAY) , early backers are poised for a 6,430% ROI at its debut, with the 3BAY token projected to jump from $0.003 to $0.1959. This leading web3 cryptocurrency aims to revolutionize the billion-dollar e-commerce industry by enhancing how buyers and sellers connect, and by providing token holders with governance and staking benefits. Stacks Bearish Pattern Indicates Potential Fall Stacks, the layer-2 solution for Bitcoin, has seen a 62% drop from its highest price of $3.86, now trading at $1.45. Although it had some recent price increases, the prevailing Stacks bearish pattern suggests more declines might follow. The token has developed a typical head and shoulders pattern—a bearish indicator suggesting a potential further decrease after breaking the critical $1.53 “neckline.” Currently, this neckline has been crossed, setting $1 as the next crucial support level. Despite the challenges, optimism about Stacks’ fundamental strengths remains, according to its founder, though the short-term forecast appears uncertain. ENS Whale Influence Triggers 1041% Jump In Inflows A significant move by a whale, depositing 282,365 Ethereum Name Service (ENS) tokens worth $9.15 million into Binance, caused a 1041% increase in ENS inflows within a day. This move, initiated by the ENS DAO: Community Reward Funds wallet, netted the investor a $4.36 million profit due to favorable market timing. Currently, ENS is priced at $34.41, recovering from a recent low of $28.00. The market’s balance between buying and selling has stabilized its price, with an RSI of 50.86 indicating a neutral trend. ENS now has a support level at $32.00 and a resistance potential at $38.00. Web3Bay Trending as Presale Hits $1M! Early investors in Web3Bay are on track for a staggering 6,430% ROI when the platform goes live, showcasing its potential to revolutionize e-commerce. Initially offered at $0.003 during the first presale, the 3BAY token has progressed to stage 4, now valued at $0.004562625, with an anticipated launch price of $0.1959. This web3 cryptocurrency is set to overhaul the conventional e-commerce framework, offering buyers a transparent, secure, and flexible shopping environment without hidden fees or data misuse. Sellers benefit from greater autonomy without intermediaries siphoning profits or enforcing stringent rules. The platform’s 3BAY token not only facilitates transactions but also provides purchase discounts and staking rewards, enhancing its utility and value. This fusion of practical use and community governance makes this web3 cryptocurrency a compelling proposition, combining financial incentives with substantial user benefits. Already, Web3Bay has garnered over $1 million in presale funds and distributed 270 million tokens worldwide, making significant inroads into the trillion-dollar e-commerce market. If you missed the first presale stage, there’s still a chance to get involved. The current stage 4 price offers a potential 4,200% ROI by the time of launch. However, with each passing stage, the price increases and the window for maximum returns narrows. Quick Overview As the Stacks bearish pattern holds and STX trades at $1.45, the outlook remains uncertain—will the fall continue, or is a recovery in sight? At the same time, the ENS whale influence underscores a stark reality: the market’s largest players significantly impact smaller investors. In contrast, Web3Bay introduces a decentralized approach to e-commerce, providing a fair chance for substantial gains. Early backers of this leading web3 cryptocurrency could see a 6,430% ROI at launch. For those now entering at stage 4 with a price of $0.004562625, a potential 4,200% ROI by launch is still achievable. But remember, as the presale advances, potential profits diminish, making timely participation crucial.

Analysts speculate if this titan might reclaim its all-time highs or if it’s time to focus on newer, high-potential assets. ETH, currently trading at $3,200, has drawn bullish attention following Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI ), accumulating millions of dollars in Ethereum and spot ETF momentum. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange—an ERC-20 token built on Ethereum’s blockchain—has captivated investors, raising $13+ million in its final presale stage. While ETH’s technical charts hint at a breakout toward $4,500, DTX’s hybrid trading platform promises 1000x leverage and institutional-grade scalability. Can Ethereum’s ecosystem sustain its dominance, or will disruptive projects like DTX redefine 2025’s profit landscape? This post explores ETH’s catalysts and DTX’s explosive innovation. Ethereum Price Analysis: Bulls Target $4,500 Amid Institutional Accumulation Ethereum’s bullish narrative centers on institutional demand, technical patterns, and regulatory tailwinds. WLFI’s aggressive ETH purchases—$47 million on inauguration day and $10 million daily thereafter—have injected stability, while ETH’s spot ETFs are projected to unlock billions in institutional inflows. Technically, ETH is consolidating within a falling wedge pattern, a historically bullish signal. Analysts note a breakout above $3,200 could trigger a reversal, targeting $3,600–$4,500. However, risks linger. Derivatives data reveals rising open interest paired with negative funding rates, indicating short-term bearish bets. A dip into the $2,900–$3,100 liquidity gap could trigger a short squeeze, accelerating upward momentum. Resistance at $3,344 remains critical; a daily close above this level may confirm ETH’s path to $4,000. Notably, Ethereum’s long-term scalability upgrades—including sharding and rollup integration— drive adoption for platforms like DTX Exchange. While ETH’s $4,500 target is plausible, competitors leveraging its infrastructure threaten to divert capital. DTX Exchange: ERC-20 Innovation Meets Hybrid Trading Mastery While Ethereum battles volatility, DTX Exchange (DTX) is redefining decentralized finance. Built on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard, DTX combines 1000x leverage, 120,000+ asset pairs, and a hybrid model merging stocks, forex, and crypto—all within a non-custodial framework. DTX Exchange’s $13+ million presale success underscores institutional confidence in Ethereum’s scalability for next-gen trading solutions. Here are a few reasons why DTX could rally faster than Ethereum this new market year. Unrivaled leverage & speed: DTX’s 1000x leverage dwarfs traditional platforms (100x average), while its VulcanX testnet processes 200,000 TPS, much faster than Ethereum. Tokenized ETFs & global access: This viral altcoin democratizes ETF trading in geo-restricted regions, bridging TradFi and DeFi. Governance & profit sharing: DTX token holders vote on platform upgrades and earn fee rebates, fostering community-driven growth. Security: The project’s integration of Phoenix Wallet ensures secure multi-asset custody, mitigating exchange hacks. Regarding its momentum, DTX tokens have surged by 700%, attracting ETH whales and diversifying amid the altcoin’s price swings. Analysts attribute this shift to DTX’s tangible utility: Its live testnet, CoinMarketCap listing, and Q1 2025 launch plans. Its fee-sharing model and cross-margin trading fueled post-listing targets of $0.20 (25% ROI from presale) and beyond. By leveraging Ethereum’s modular blockchain upgrades, DTX achieves seamless scalability. ETH’s reduced gas fees and sharding advancements empower DTX Exchange to tokenize equities and forex at unprecedented speeds, positioning it as a gateway for institutional capital. DTX Exchange Might Deliver Meteoric Gains Post-Presale Launch by Q2 2025 The Ethereum price trajectory hinges on ETF inflows and technical breakouts, yet DTX Exchange exemplifies how ERC-20 tokens are pushing boundaries. While ETH’s $4,500 target is achievable, DTX’s hybrid infrastructure, governance rewards, and 1000x leverage offer a unique risk-reward proposition. Ethereum remains foundational for decentralized innovation, but agile projects like DTX are reallocating market attention—and capital. Investors may benefit from dual exposure: ETH for stability amid regulatory clarity and DTX for exponential growth. As the crypto market gears up for a bullish pump, investors could benefit immensely from DTX’s post-presale launch, delivering groundbreaking utility and abundant gains. Its presale is wrapping up soon; investors can get involved as quickly as possible.

Cardano (ADA) Governance Upgrades and Whale Activity Signal Imminent Breakout Cardano (ADA) has weathered recent turbulence, trading at $0.95 with a $33 billion market cap, but seismic shifts are unfolding beneath the surface. The recent Plomin hard fork, a milestone in decentralized governance, allows Cardano (ADA) holders to vote directly on protocol upgrades, marking a critical step toward full community-led governance. This upgrade, powered by June 2024’s Chang upgrade, positions Cardano (ADA) as a pioneer in blockchain democracy. Whales have taken note, accumulating 140 million ADA ($137 million) since mid-December 2024. Analysts like Ali Martinez suggest a breakout to $1.50 is likely if Cardano (ADA) conquers the $1.10 resistance. Despite a 3% weekly dip, the surge in trading volume and open interest signals renewed institutional confidence. With layer-2 scalability solutions and Bitcoin interoperability on the horizon, Cardano’s current price might be a bargain for those betting on its governance-first ethos. SUI Blockchain Innovation Meets Accessibility Amid Token Unlock Jitters The SUI Blockchain network’s token, SUI is at $4.18 (-5.70% weekly), but its disruptive tech stack is turning heads. Its recent SMS-based transaction feature targets 3 billion unbanked users, enabling crypto transfers via essential mobile networks, a game-changer for regions with spotty internet. Partnerships like the SUI Blockchain PlayoX1 Handheld gaming device further showcase SUI Blockchain’s real-world utility, blending blockchain with consumer hardware for dynamic NFT integration. Yet, VanEck’s bullish $16 price target for 2025 underscores faith in SUI Blockchain’s long-term vision. Upgrades like Mysticeti V2 (boosting transaction throughput) and the SCION security protocol could solidify SUI Blockchain network’s position as a “Solana killer” in decentralized apps and AI integrations. This dip might be the last call for risk-tolerant investors before SUI Blockchain’s ecosystem goes parabolic. DTX Exchange the Hybrid Trading Behemoth Quietly Dominating Presales With $13.3 million raised in its presale and Stage 8 already 50% sold out, this hybrid platform blends centralized speed with decentralized security across 120,000+ assets-from crypto and stocks to ETFs. DTX Exchange is rewriting the rulebook for crypto trading. The VulcanX blockchain powers a staggering 200,000 TPS in testnet conditions, while the non-custodial Phoenix Wallet offers seamless multi-asset management. Priced at $0.16 (vs. a $0.20 listing target), DTX Exchange grants holders governance rights and profit-sharing via its VIP Rebate System. Over 575,000 users have flocked to its presale, lured by 1000x leverage and the imminent launch of tokenized ETF trading in Q1 2025. Analysts whisper of a $10 post-listing price of 6,150% ROI for early backers. DTX Exchange’s one-stop-shop model could become the industry standard as traditional finance merges with crypto. Final Thoughts Cardano (ADA)’s governance revolution, SUI Blockchain’s accessibility push, and DTX’s trading supremacy tell a story of untapped potential. While the ADA network and SUI Blockchain grapple with short-term volatility, their roadmaps reveal transformative upside. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange ’s presale frenzy hints at a “Binance-level” listing surge, making its $0.16 entry point a rare steal. In a market where hype often overshadows substance, these three altcoins offer something rare: fundamentals that justify the frenzy. The question isn’t if they’ll rally-it’s when.

With the meme coin market exploding, Dogwifhat (WIF) is riding the viral wave, and Book of Meme (BOME) is creating a digital archive of meme culture. But BTFD Coin (BTFD) is making headlines with its powerful Bulls Squad, high staking rewards, and a thriving presale that’s turning heads in the crypto space. The best new meme coins for exponential returns are those that go beyond the hype. Meme coins have already made massive waves in the past, with projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu minting millionaires. Now, BTFD Coin is rewriting the script with its Bulls Squad, 90% APY staking, and a record-breaking presale that’s raised over $5.9 million. Is this the next big meme coin moonshot? Let’s break it down. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Bulls Squad That’s Taking Over Meme coins are all about community power, and no coin does it better than BTFD Coin’s Bulls Squad . This isn’t just another token riding hype—it’s a movement backed by serious investors who know how to own the dip and profit big. The Bulls Squad represents the strongest holders in the market, those who stake their tokens for a whopping 90% APY while waiting for the price to skyrocket. With the BTFD Coin presale now in Stage 14, the current price is $0.00016 per token, but once the presale ends, BTFD will list at $0.0006, setting up a 275% gain right off the bat. But the real moonshot potential is at $0.006, a projected increase of 3,650%. Those who run with the Bulls Squad now could see life-changing gains. The best new meme coins for exponential returns need a strong entry point, and BTFD Coin delivers with a 100% BONUS CODE (LAUNCH100). Every investor who buys in during Stage 14 will have their tokens doubled instantly, making this one of the most lucrative presales in the market right now. Let’s talk numbers. A $8,000 investment at $0.00016 per BTFD coin gives you 50,000,000 BTFD tokens. When the price reaches $0.0006, that $8,000 turns into $30,000. And at $0.006, it becomes $300,000. That’s the power of running with the bulls—and the window to join is closing fast. How to Buy BTFD Coin? Investors need to set up MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB or ETH, and head to the presale page . After entering the LAUNCH100 bonus code, their tokens will be doubled immediately. Once the presale ends, tokens can be claimed and staked for massive passive rewards. Dogwifhat (WIF) – The Viral Meme Coin Taking Over Solana Some meme coins explode purely on community hype, and Dogwifhat (WIF) is one of the best examples of that. This Solana-based meme coin, featuring an adorable dog wearing a pink beanie, has become a cultural phenomenon, driven by strong investor enthusiasm and viral appeal. Dogwifhat’s strength is in community engagement. With a fixed supply, the demand for WIF tokens is soaring as more traders jump in to ride the hype wave. As one of the best new meme coins for exponential returns, WIF thrives on its ability to stay relevant in the meme space, with ongoing contests, influencer promotions, and organic community growth. Despite the highly speculative nature of meme coins, Dogwifhat continues to gain traction, maintaining its strong position in the market. Its Solana-backed speed and efficiency make it an attractive option for investors looking for fast and low-cost transactions, a major advantage in today’s trading environment. Dogwifhat remains a top choice for those betting on meme coin momentum. Book of Meme (BOME) – The Digital Archive of Meme Culture If meme coins are about history and culture, then Book of Meme (BOME) is the next-level play. Created by Darkfarms, this Solana-based meme coin aims to be a digital time capsule, preserving meme culture for the future. BOME is more than just a token—it’s a community-driven initiative to capture and immortalize memes in the blockchain world. The unique concept behind Book of Meme has led to rapid adoption, as investors see long-term potential in a project that isn’t just about price movements but also cultural impact. Unlike many other meme coins, BOME focuses on its artistic and archival value, bringing meme lovers and blockchain enthusiasts together. The potential for future partnerships and integrations in the NFT space also makes it a strong contender among the best new meme coins for exponential returns. As more investors recognize the value of meme preservation, BOME’s role in the evolving crypto landscape continues to expand. Its presence on Solana gives it strong transactional capabilities, making it an efficient and scalable meme coin with an engaged and growing fanbase. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, the best new meme coins for exponential returns are creating unique investment opportunities in 2025. Dogwifhat (WIF) thrives on meme culture and viral hype, while Book of Meme (BOME) is building a digital archive for meme enthusiasts. But BTFD Coin (BTFD) stands out as the most rewarding investment, thanks to its Bulls Squad, massive staking rewards, and high-growth presale. With a presale price of $0.00016 and a projected moonshot price of $0.006, BTFD Coin is positioned for exponential growth. The 100% bonus offer (LAUNCH100) is driving a buying frenzy, and the Bulls Squad is gaining momentum daily. The opportunity to buy at this price won’t last much longer.

Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the benchmark for cryptocurrency investments, delivering consistent value and stability over the years. However, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is quickly stealing the spotlight, with analysts projecting a potential 50,000% breakout. This groundbreaking token has already proven its worth, raising $1 million in just minutes during its presale. With momentum building and investor interest surging, OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM is positioning itself as the most promising crypto of 2025. What’s Driving THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s Momentum? Record-Breaking Presale Success The demand for THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has been unprecedented, with $1 million raised in minutes. This strong presale performance demonstrates overwhelming investor confidence, rivaling early excitement around XRP and SOL. Exclusive Availability Unlike XRP and SOLANA, which are widely available on major exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand and ensures that early adopters stand to gain the most from its projected breakout. Growing Investor Confidence With predictions of a 50,000% return, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has become a magnet for investors seeking exponential growth. Its strong performance and limited supply are fueling speculation that it could redefine the crypto market. How It Compares to Market Leaders Ripple (XRP): Known for its dominance in cross-border payments, XRP offers steady growth but doesn’t match the early-stage explosive potential of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Solana (SOL): A leader in blockchain scalability, SOL excels in speed but can’t rival the exclusivity and investor momentum driving this new token. Act Now Before It’s Too Late With analysts closely watching OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM , the token is proving to be a standout investment. Its record-breaking presale, exclusive availability, and massive growth potential make it a top choice for anyone looking to capitalize on crypto’s next breakout.

As a result, the demand has increased massively, propelling presale earnings to an impressive $13,331,176. Additionally, the $100,000 giveaway announcement has become an attraction for crypto investors. With solid fundamentals and unique positioning in the crypto market, DTX Exchange has become one of the most formidable rivals of Ripple (XRP). Meanwhile, the XRP price is facing high market volatility and trading in the sideways zone. It faces resistance near the $3.10 level and might initiate another rally if it can break past the local barriers. XRP Price Rally Stalls at Critical $3 Mark For the last two weeks, the XRP price has been continuously experiencing selling pressure from the $3 zone. It has tried several times to break past this zone but has faced rejection, forming an upper wick. However, the XRP price recovery after the DeepSeek crash has demonstrated resilience. Ripple is still trading inside the pennant pattern, with volatility contracting significantly. In the last 24 hours, the trading volume has decreased by 31%. The XRP price will reach the next supply zone at $3.30, which is also at an all-time high. The Fibonacci extension shows that the next resistances could be $3.70 (0.786 FIB) and $4 (1 FIB). These overhead resistances indicate potential short-term selling pressure, while rapid developments in Ripple suggest a bullish long-term outlook. Courtesy: TradingView The XRP price is now trading above $3 and the 20-period Moving Average. A bullish flag pattern is also forming, with resistance at $3.10 on the lower time frame. If Ripple struggles to break past $3.10, it may face another decline. The first support level is around $3, while the next major support lies near $2.80. In a groundbreaking move, Japan’s entire banking sector will adopt Ripple’s XRP cryptocurrency, reshaping the global financial system. SBI Holdings CEO Yoshitaka Kitao confirmed this shift, which is expected to transform cross-border transactions and currency conversions and position XRP as a major force in modern finance. DTX Exchange Remarkable Presale Success Attracts Institutions DTX Exchange is revolutionizing the crypto market by combining traditional and modern finance through blockchain technology. The DTX token was priced at $0.02 at the start of the presale and is currently trading at $0.16, a 700% gain for early investors. However, the token is preparing to be listed in major exchanges, which makes it a contender for 100x growth after the launch. It is powered by the first-ever hybrid blockchain, VulcanX, which supports over 100,000 financial instruments in a single platform. DTX Exchange will support stocks, crypto, forex, and ETFs on the platform, making trading much more manageable. Additionally, it will allow a leverage of 1,000x, so with $100 capital, one can access liquidity of up to $100,000. With an unmatched order execution speed of 0.04 seconds, DTX provides rare efficiency, reducing slippage and operational costs compared to other trading platforms. Its impressive speed is supported by a strong framework, making it scalable during its growth phase. DTX Exchange is gaining institutional investors’ attention through strategic listings on CoinMarketCap and an audit by SolidProof. The platform listing and KYC checks enhance visibility, credibility, and community engagement by introducing DTX to millions of crypto enthusiasts. Key Takeaways The crypto market has always appreciated projects with future vision and utility. While the XRP price has performed impressively, it is time for DTX to shine and capture a large user base. Investors who see stability and long-term profitability must keep track of this project. Expert investors find DTX Exchange to be the rising star of this crypto market, which is believed to take over after the listing.

Bitcoin (BTC) is currently priced at $96,636.4, down by 4.52%, while Ethereum (ETH) sits at $2,826.76, showing a 10.28% drop. Solana (SOL) is trading at $198.03, down 8.48%. Meanwhile, altcoins like XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE) are facing even steeper losses, with XRP at $2.32 (-20.62%) and DOGE at $0.2526 (-19.05%) in the last 24 hours. The overall market capitalization has dropped to $3.21 trillion, down by 6.50%. The Fear & Greed Index is at 47, signaling fear in the market, while the CMC100 index is down 8.07%, now sitting at $195.19. Bitcoin continues to dominate the market with a dominance of 59.89%, followed by Ethereum at 10.64%. The downturn in cryptocurrency prices coincides with increased geopolitical tensions, particularly the new tariffs imposed by the U.S. on several countries. These trade tensions, along with ongoing economic uncertainty, are causing investors to shift their portfolios away from risk-heavy assets like cryptocurrencies. Over the weekend, Trump announced new tariffs on Mexican, Canadian, and Chinese imports, adding to the already fragile global trade environment. Liquidation Heatmap Shows Significant Losses As of the latest 4-hour liquidation heatmap, the total liquidations across multiple exchanges have reached staggering amounts. Ethereum (ETH) leads the way with over $111 million in liquidations, followed by Bitcoin (BTC) at $62 million. Other cryptocurrencies such as XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), and Solana (SOL) have also seen considerable liquidation volumes. In the past 24 hours, the total liquidations have reached $1.19 billion. ‘",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|DOGE|ETH|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-03 00:55:26

Fortune reports that on Thursday, asset manager Grayscale submitted a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert its $16.1 million XRP trust into an ETF. A number of other companies are also applying for new crypto ETFs, including those for Litecoin, Solana ( SOL ) and Dogecoin ( DOGE ), as the US enters a pro-crypto era under the Trump administration. Last month, Ripple president Monica Long said that the next crypto ETF to receive a greenlight after Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) will likely be XRP, but Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart is not as optimistic. Seyffart says the SEC is still claiming that XRP is a security, a roadblock that might bar ETFs based on the third-largest crypto asset from getting the seal of approval. He also notes that XRP-issuer Ripple is still locked in a legal tussle with the SEC. “There’s some more work that needs to be done on that front that doesn’t need to happen with something like Litecoin. The SEC has never called Litecoin a security so, I wouldn’t be surprised if you see Litecoin come first.” While Seyffart does not see the imminent approval of XRP ETFs, he believes that it is within the realm of possibility for the third-largest crypto asset to get one this year.

OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM Is Booming—Can BITCOIN and XRP Keep Up?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/dont-miss-this-officialmagacoin-com-is-booming-can-bitcoin-and-xrp-keep-up/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the cornerstone of cryptocurrency success stories, turning early adopters into millionaires. Cardano (ADA), Near Protocol (NEAR), and Kaspa (KAS) have also built strong reputations, while Arbitrum (ARB) has shown potential as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. However, a new coin, OFFICIALMAGACOIN, is now commanding the attention of savvy investors. OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Deliver 60,000% Returns OFFICIALMAGACOIN has emerged as a unique player, with a record-breaking presale raising over $1 million in minutes. The token is only available at officialmagacoin.com , adding an element of exclusivity that appeals to both retail and institutional investors. Its potential for 60,000% returns has investors speculating that it could mirror or even surpass Bitcoin’s early growth trajectory. Early-Stage Growth Potential: With its presale success, OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors a chance to get in on the ground floor of a coin poised for exponential growth. Exclusivity and Scarcity: Available only at its official website, the token creates urgency and a sense of premium access. Affordable Entry Point: At less than $0.20 per token, OFFICIALMAGACOIN provides a low-risk, high-reward opportunity. Comparing OFFICIALMAGACOIN to Competitors Bitcoin (BTC): Established but lacks the explosive growth of a new coin. Cardano (ADA): Reliable but maturing, leaving little room for exponential returns. Near Protocol (NEAR): Focused on Web3 but cannot match OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s exclusivity. Kaspa (KAS): A promising blockchain but with a slower trajectory.

XRP has been hit the hardest, with its price dropping over 20% in the last 24 hours. The price has now dropped below its previous key support level of $2.52 and is now trading at $2.41. If the price continues to fall, a test of $2.32 becomes more likely. A break below $2.32 would confirm a more bearish outlook, suggesting an invalidation of the previous micro “one-two” setup. For now, the larger pattern remains intact, but the market is showing increasing pressure. The depth of this decline remains uncertain, and it will be crucial to watch how the market reacts to these new support levels in the coming days. Waiting for Confirmation To confirm a reversal, XRP would need to break above the recent high of $3.15. Additionally, a break above $2.89 (the golden ratio level) could signal the start of an upside breakout. For now, the market remains in a correction phase, but it is in an area where a potential low could form. Larger Range and Next Support Levels XRP remains within a larger sideways range, bounded between $1.96 (the previous breakout point from 2021) and the $3.40 level. If the market continues to decline, the next key support levels are at $2.23 (the 100% extension of the immediate down move) and lower levels around $1.96 and $1.23. Overall, the market pressure is currently bearish, but there remains a chance for the bulls to step in. With Bitcoin having reached its downside target, the market could see a reversal in the coming week. However, no confirmed low has yet been established, so it’s crucial to remain patient and monitor for further developments.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-03 01:12:14

The deal includes an upfront payment of $25 million due at closing in the first quarter of 2025, with the remaining $31 million to be paid in six equal monthly installments. The $56 Million Purchase According to an announcement HIVE made on January 28, the Yguazú facility will be developed in two stages. Phase 1, which is already 80% finished, is scheduled for completion by April 1, 2025. Once operational in the second quarter, it is expected to add approximately six exahashes per second (EH/s) to HIVE’s Bitcoin mining capacity. Phase 2, expected to be wrapped up by August 31, 2025, will introduce hydro-cooled Bitmain S21+ ASICs, adding 6.5 EH/s. The Texas-based crypto miner has estimated the cost of completing the facility at $400,000 per MW. It also revealed that it will be funded using existing cash reserves and BTC holdings. As part of the acquisition, HIVE will assume $19 million in pre-existing power purchase agreement (PPA) deposits that Bitfarms paid to Paraguayan utility ANDE. This aligns with its goal of expanding its Bitcoin mining capacity to 25 EH/s by September 2025. As of December 2024, the firm reported a realized hashrate of 5.46 EH/s and held 2,805 BTC in its reserves. It has also pre-ordered 15 EH/s of hydro-cooled ASICs from Bitmain and Canaan to support its growth plans. Bitfarms’ Strategic Shift The sale of the Yguazú facility marks a strategic shift for Bitfarms, which initially planned to develop the site as part of its 2024 expansion into Latin America. Construction delays led to the relocation of mining equipment originally intended for Paraguay to Stronghold Digital’s Pennsylvania facility as part of a 2024 merger. CEO Ben Gagnon stated that the proceeds from the sale would support the company’s 1-gigawatt growth pipeline in the U.S., which includes infrastructure for Bitcoin mining as well as high-performance computing and artificial intelligence. “We are pleased to announce the sale of our Yguazú site to HIVE as we continue to streamline our operations and rebalance towards North America,” Gagnon said. Bitfarms remains committed to its operations in Latin America, where it has three other facilities with a total capacity of 144 MW and long-term power agreements. The latest development comes after a proposed merger with Riot Platforms Inc. in 2024, which would have created 15 facilities in several areas, including Paraguay. However, Bitfarms’ board ultimately rejected the plan, with the two companies terminating the acquisition bid.

While Ripple investors are eagerly waiting for XRP ETF approval, insiders are accumulating the viral hybrid altcoin, DTX Exchange (DTX) . Through its hybrid approach, DTX addresses key challenges in global finance and eases accessibility to various markets. Meanwhile, the XRP price is still experiencing consolidation and is hovering above the $3 critical support. Analysts believe the XRP ETF approval will be a huge trigger and push Ripple to a new all-time high. However, savvy investors are leaning more towards DTX listing as it presents an opportunity to capitalize on innovation and growth. Grayscale Files for XRP ETF – Could This Spark a Ripple Price Surge? NYSE Arca, a New York Stock Exchange subsidiary, has taken a major step toward converting Grayscale’s XRP Trust into a spot XRP ETF. It submitted a 19b-4 filing, formally proposing the conversion. But Grayscale isn’t the only player in the race—Bitwise Asset Management and 21Shares have also filed their proposals for an XRP ETF, aiming for a share of this growing market. The SEC approved Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, followed by Ethereum ETFs later that year. NYSE Arca’s push to transform the XRP Trust into a Ripple XRP ETF could indicate a broader shift as the financial industry continues merging traditional markets with digital assets. Due to the recent regulatory and ecosystem developments in Ripple, it has performed exceptionally, becoming the top gainer in the crypto market. Just like the RLUSD stablecoin approval, an XRP ETF approval would be another massive win for Ripple. The asset’s price has increased over 500% since the November low, reaching a new all-time high of $3.40. After the parabolic momentum, Ripple has been trading sideways for the last two weeks. Source: CoinMarketCap Ripple (XRP) is currently trading at $3.04, down about 1.50% in the past 24 hours. Bulls are working very hard to stabilize the price above $3. However, price action has remained neutral so far. The next crucial region corresponding to the previous demand level is $2.80. If XRP drops below this level, a steep decline to $2.50 and $2 could result in a much deeper correction. DTX Exchange Becomes Fastest Growing Crypto Presale DTX Exchange is rapidly expanding its ecosystem driven by increased demand and the ability to bridge the financial gap between conventional and digital methods. Traditional trading exchange inefficiencies, such as high fees and slow sales, have long been a bottleneck for traders, and the DTX hybrid platform is a much-needed solution. DTX users can access over 120,000 financial assets, including cryptocurrency, stocks, forex, and ETFs, on a single platform. This is the first hybrid model introduced by the DTX Exchange, allowing traders to avoid switching from one platform to another. Platform’s multi-asset trading functionality would increase efficiency, speed, and accessibility. Additionally, traders can increase their profit potential and growth pace with the 1,000x leverage. So, with a capital of $100, you can purchase assets worth $100,000. This feature will be beneficial in bull markets, where a trader can capitalize on market opportunities with increased position size. The DTX Exchange presale has already seen remarkable success, with the DTX token experiencing an upward price trajectory since its launch. To date, it has raised $13,380,345.52 and has over 400,000 unique holders. In the final stage of the presale, Investors are flocking to this new crypto project and securing their tokens at just $0.16. Due to an overwhelming response from the community, DTX Exchange has launched a $100,000 giveaway plan. Twenty lucky token holders will each win $5,000 USDT. In the final stage of the sale, nearly 60% of the tokens have already been sold and the event will conclude in the coming weeks. Timing is crucial; those who join early have the potential to benefit significantly from the anticipated listing rally and giveaway program.

Morgan Stanley Analyst Analysis",https://nulltx.com/can-this-0-16-altcoin-top-21500-listing-gains-like-solana-ico-morgan-stanley-analyst-analysis/,"The crypto market is known for having altcoins that deliver massive returns. Such was the case of Solana (SOL), a top project that gave life-changing gains to its early backers. During the 2021 bull run, the Solana price surged by over 21,500% from its ICO price of $0.22. While such parabolic growth takes time, it shows how altcoins with robust tech and use cases tend to offer massive returns to their holders. The good news is that a new contender, DTX Exchange (DTX), is on the horizon to mirror the Solana price trajectory. DTX is currently priced at just $0.16 and has raised over $13.4 million in its presale. Backed by a high-performance blockchain and a hybrid trading ecosystem, analysts are drawing parallels to Solana’s early days. But can DTX mirror SOL’s historic ascent? A recent Morgan Stanley analysis weighs in, offering insights into Solana’s outlook and DTX’s explosive potential. Solana Price (SOL) Analysis: Momentum, Challenges, and Revised Forecasts Recent Solana price action reflects market volatility. After a three-day correction, SOL surged 6% on Wednesday, reclaiming $230 amid broader crypto optimism following the Federal Reserve’s decision to pause rate hikes. This rebound aligns with bullish technical indicators: Solana’s falling wedge breakout remains intact, and Bollinger Bands suggests stabilization near $220. Analysts anticipate a push toward $250 and potentially $281 if momentum holds. However, Morgan Stanley analysts temper enthusiasm. While SOL’s weekly trading volume spiked 80%, lifting its market cap to $113 billion, the firm revised its 2025 price target from $500 to $300. The downgrade stems from regulatory headwinds, notably the SEC’s ongoing lawsuit alleging SOL is an unregistered security. This could complicate the potential approval of a Solana ETF, a key catalyst for institutional inflows. Despite these challenges, derivatives data reveals institutional confidence. Furthermore, SOL whales believe that current political shifts, like the new Trump administration, could ease regulatory pressure. But the Solana price target above its all-time high doesn’t look promising for now. This situation has spurred many to redirect attention to emerging altcoins like DTX Exchange. DTX Exchange (DTX): The $0.16 Altcoin Poised for a Solana-Like Surge As Solana navigates regulatory hurdles, DTX Exchange emerges as a compelling alternative. Built on the VulcanX blockchain, DTX boasts a staggering 200,000 transactions per second (TPS) during testnet trials, surpassing Solana’s 65,000 TPS. This technical edge positions DTX as a scalable solution for traders demanding speed and cost efficiency. DTX’s ecosystem seeks to combine traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). As such, there’s unlimited access to equities, forex, cryptocurrencies, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). This hybrid approach caters to retail traders and institutional players. The platform’s Phoenix Wallet, downloaded more than 400,000 times, provides secure, non-custodial storage for diverse assets, enhancing its appeal as a unified trading hub. DTX’s ongoing presale success highlights robust demand. Early adopters are drawn to its low entry price and high-growth narrative, reminiscent of Solana’s ICO phase. Analysts speculate that DTX’s upcoming listing could ignite a rally akin to SOL’s 2021 breakout, driven by its scalability and community growth. Morgan Stanley’s analysis further fuels optimism. While the expert firm projects the Solana price to reach $300, analysts identify DTX as a coin capable of 21,500%+ gains, mirroring SOL’s historical trajectory. Final Thoughts The Solana price journey from being an ICO underdog to becoming a top-five cryptocurrency illustrates the transformative potential of high-speed blockchains. However, regulatory hurdles and revised forecasts underscore the volatility inherent in crypto investing. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange, a project combining Solana’s scalability with a broader vision for integrated finance, is poised to deliver top gains to savvy investors and traders. Priced at $0.16 in its final presale stage, DTX offers a rare opportunity for users to invest at ground level in a platform poised to disrupt TradFi and DeFi. While past performance never guarantees future results, the presale momentum, technical innovation, and analyst endorsement position DTX as a credible token for exponential growth. The DTX presale window is narrowing, and the bulls are circling. Don’t miss out!

Among them, Rollblock (RBLK) stands out as one of the most promising opportunities, thanks to its strong presale momentum and real-world utility. Alongside Rollblock, Meme Index (MEMEX), BlockDAG (BDAG), Qubetics (TICS) and Solaxy (SOLX) should be on your watchlist. Rollblock: A Revenue-Generating Crypto ICO With Real-World Utility Rollblock integrates decentralized gaming with a sustainable revenue model. The platform has already raised almost $10 million in its presale , which is about to head into stage 11 only, so it’s definitely one of the best crypto to buy today. It merges blockchain technology with the online casino industry and so Rollblock provides a robust use case that ensures long-term adoption. The platform offers a wide variety of popular games like poker, blackjack, roulette and different themed slots. Rollblock incentivizes participation with liquidity rewards. This way it ensures ongoing engagement and increasing demand for $RBLK. Additionally, Rollblock’s security-focused approach, with 12 months of locked liquidity, minimizes risks for early investors. Meme Index (MEMEX): A Diversified Approach to Meme Coins Meme Index (MEMEX) redefines the meme coin sector with the first-ever decentralized index fund for meme tokens. Instead of betting on a single meme coin, you can gain exposure to multiple meme assets through MEMEX’s structured investment model. The project allows investors to choose between different risk-reward baskets, including established tokens like Dogecoin and high-growth opportunities with smaller meme coins. With over $3 million raised in its crypto ICO, MEMEX has already garnered attention as one of the most anticipated launches. BlockDAG (BDAG): High-Speed Transactions and Scalability BlockDAG (BDAG) raised $190 million in one of the most successful crypto ICOs of this year. Its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology offers scalability, speed and efficiency. It addresses the limitations of traditional blockchain networks. Unlike many crypto ICOs, BlockDAG already outlined plans for listings on 10 major exchanges, ensuring ample liquidity upon launch. With its focus on high-speed transactions and decentralized applications (dApps), BDAG is positioned as a long-term contender in the crypto ecosystem. Qubetics (TICS): Simplifying Blockchain Development Qubetics (TICS) uses Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that simplifies blockchain development. By offering drag-and-drop functionality for decentralized applications (dApps), Qubetics lowers the barrier to entry for developers. The project already raised $11.3 million in its presale, and analysts predict post-launch values could reach $10-$15 per token.

Movements in Dogecoin price are capturing attention, driven by anticipation around Elon Musk’s next actions. Simultaneously, increased Cardano (ADA) whale activity is boosting confidence within its network. These trends not only emphasize the value of well-established tokens but also spotlight new ventures like Web3Bay. Web3Bay is making its mark in decentralized e-commerce, drawing eyes with its presale figures. With the 3BAY token priced at just $0.004562625, an expected ROI of 6,430% positions it as a prime investment for those looking to get in early. Web3Bay stands out for its commitment to transparency, security, and innovation, presenting a unique opportunity to engage with a pioneering Web3 initiative. Why Web3Bay Is a Must-Buy Crypto in 2025 Web3Bay’s ongoing presale is noteworthy. The 3BAY token’s current price at $0.004562625, set to rise to $0.1959 at launch, predicts an ROI of 6,430%. This isn’t merely a statistic; it’s a cue for potential investors to seize this exceptional chance. Having already amassed over $1 million and sold beyond 270 million tokens, Web3Bay is appealing to those spotting early-stage opportunities.

Currently trading near $0.354, Dogecoin is supported by a robust community and notable endorsements, especially from Elon Musk, which consistently keeps the cryptocurrency in the spotlight. Apart from its market value, Dogecoin’s charm also stems from its fun image and broad use in small online payments and tips.

Despite its unpredictable nature, Dogecoin continues to attract those looking for an easy way to start with cryptocurrencies. Its durability and community-focused nature make it an important cryptocurrency to consider. Cardano (ADA) Whale Activity Indicates Growing Confidence Cardano (ADA) whale activity is catching eyes as significant investors expand their holdings, showing a resurgence of faith in its future. Recent data shows a rise in transactions by large-volume wallets, which typically lead to important price shifts. This reflects well on Cardano’s ongoing upgrades, including the successful Plomin update. With its price around $0.9648, ADA is frequently mentioned in discussions parallel to Dogecoin price trends. Cardano continues to attract attention with its emphasis on scalability, sustainability, and practical uses, extending from aerospace to decentralized finance. This progress, along with increased interest from major investors, makes Cardano a promising venture for those looking at long-term investments in the crypto space. Critical Observations Recent Dogecoin price actions underline its persistent allure, supported by a solid community and significant endorsements. Similarly, the boost in Cardano (ADA) whale activity signals a growing trust in its ecosystem, with large investors positioning themselves for expected advancements. Both cryptocurrencies remain prominent figures, presenting prospects for those seeking well-established players in the cryptocurrency arena. Yet, for investors aiming at a transformative opportunity, Web3Bay stands out. Its current presale offers exceptional potential, with the 3BAY token available at just $0.004562625 and an anticipated ROI of 6,430%.

In the same vein, the XRP price is poised to hit a target of 6. Meanwhile, a new AI-powered and wallet-based altcoin called WallitIQ (WLTQ) is making waves as it prepares for a massive 1,000x to $20. Bitcoin (BTC) Attracts Positive Sentiment Despite Low Trading Volume The Bitcoin price hasn’t exactly been bullish in the past few weeks but rather is facing a consolidation that has kept it in a weekly range of $98,380.59–$106,462. Although the Bitcoin price recently climbed above the $100,000 crucial mark, raising its monthly gain above 9.50%, the trading volume on the Bitcoin (BTC) network is declining. Bitcoin (BTC) is facing a 44.90% decrease in trading volume, which shows that activity on its network is declining. However, according to TradingView’s analysis of Bitcoin (BTC), its moving averages are signaling a strong buy. This indicates that the Bitcoin price is set to skyrocket very soon. With Arthur Hayes already predicting that the Bitcoin price could reach $250,000 this year, it’s hard not to see $150,000 as an achievable target in Q1. The Bitcoin price is on the verge of breaking its ATH of $109,114 again. As positive sentiment keeps brewing, Bitcoin (BTC) may surpass $150,000 very soon. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Garners a Fresh Multitude of Investors, Following Potential for a 1000x Rally WallitIQ (WLTQ) is currently standing out exceptionally in the presale market, as it is already considered the altcoin set to challenge XRP and Bitcoin (BTC) in this year’s bull market. With a unique platform that relies heavily on the technology of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) , this new presale entrant is designed to redefine how crypto investors store and manage crypto assets on wallets. With its numerous advanced features, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is poised to gain massive traction, especially as the crypto market is beginning to experience more AI adoption. This traction is bound to be reflected in the price of its token, which is currently going for $0.0420 in its presale phase. However, on account of its high growth capacity, this token has a high probability of mirroring a 1,000x rally to hit $20. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) smart wallet-based ecosystem offers its investors and users AI tools that enhance its performance. For instance, users gain access to predictive analytics modeling , 24/7 personalized chatbots , an AI-based fraud detection system , AI-driven custom alerts, and smart contract analysis that has been thoroughly audited by SolidProof. While these features already sparked a lot of FOMO in investors, the MVP of its Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App is generating even more excitement. This Mobile App is set to introduce a sleek, intuitive, and user-friendly environment for its investors to simulate the transfer of ETH and USDT. Alongside this, users can track the real-time prices of crypto assets , access candlestick charts, and even pay for daily purchases like Starbucks coffee. The XRP Price Maintains Month-Long Bullish Flag Despite hitting lower levels around $2.7, the XRP price has quickly regained strength as it surged back up to $3.12, showing great resilience to bullish pressure. However, on a month-long time frame, XRP is actually portraying a high bullish sentiment as the XRP price is up by 50%. With nearly a 500% pump in the past 3 months, XRP has stormed the crypto market with its bullish breakout above $0.5. Now that the XRP price is staying strongly above $3, there are speculations that XRP could double its value and hit $6. Although the XRP price is already attracting bullish predictions, with WallStreetBulls citing the potential of XRP to surpass $100 this year. The crypto analyst, however, gave a short-term prediction of the XRP hitting $5-$10.

While Shiba Inu (SHIB) struggles to keep investor interest alive with its stagnating Shiba Inu price, Ripple (XRP) is enjoying institutional inflows that continue to drive the XRP price upward. However, amidst these headline-grabbing trends, a $0.0420 AI coin, WallitIQ (WLTQ), is quietly gaining traction among whales who are betting big on its potential for a staggering 35,000% growth. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Loses Its Spark Shiba Inu (SHIB) once took the crypto world by storm with its meme-driven hype, but its glory days seem far behind. The current Shiba Inu price reflects the struggles of a token that lacks substantial utility or innovation. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is an AI coin that rewrites the rules of crypto investing. Unlike Shiba Inu (SHIB), it isn’t reliant on viral moments or speculative pumps. It’s built on cutting-edge technology, such as Escrow Connect powered by AI Einstein, which provides unparalleled security for digital assets during transactions.

While the XRP price continues to rise, this AI coin is carving its path with innovative features and unmatched growth potential.

Ripple (XRP) Rises With Institutional Inflows Ripple (XRP) has long been a favorite among institutional investors, and the recent inflows only solidify its status as a reliable asset. With the XRP price steadily climbing following Ripple’s (XRP) legal victories, it’s clear that big players are backing this project for its potential to revolutionize cross-border payments. However, while Ripple (XRP) enjoys institutional inflows, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is carving its path to dominance. Unlike Shiba Inu (SHIB), which relies heavily on community hype, this platform’s AI-powered investment recommendations , tailored to user-specific parameters, help traders stay ahead of market trends. This feature not only levels the playing field for retail investors but also outshines tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB), making it a magnet for whales who value innovation and security. Why settle for modest returns with the XRP price when this platform and its low WallitIQ (WLTQ) price offer the possibility of 35,000% growth? The Shiba Inu price once captured attention, but WallitIQ (WLTQ) is emerging as the new powerhouse for exponential gains. Institutional inflows may validate Ripple (XRP), yet as the Shiba Inu price struggles to impress, the smart money is increasingly flowing toward this AI coin. WallitIQ (WLTQ): Whales Are Betting Big On This AI Coin In the fast-evolving world of crypto, whales have a knack for identifying projects with the most potential. It’s no surprise that WallitIQ (WLTQ) , an AI coin with unparalleled features, is becoming a favorite among these big players. With its features like biometric authentication and custom alert , WallitIQ (WLTQ) is redefining what it means to invest with confidence. While the Shiba Inu price and Ripple’s (XRP) institutional inflows grab headlines, the real action is happening in the AI coin space. This AI coin is designed for long-term success. With its $0.0420 presale price, it’s a ground-floor opportunity to join a project built to dominate the DeFi landscape and potentially rival the XRP price in future growth. Whales are moving their capital into this AI coin because it offers a unique combination of growth, innovation, and security. If the big players are confident enough to back this AI coin, why wouldn’t you? The Path To 35,000% Growth WallitIQ (WLTQ) is more than just a token; it’s an ecosystem that empowers investors with tools to navigate market volatility. Its MVP Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App integrates real-time crypto pricing, interactive candlestick charts, and multi-wallet functionality, making it a one-stop solution for portfolio management. With features like these, it’s no wonder this SolidProof-audited platform is expected to deliver 35,000% growth by 2025. The Shiba Inu price has already peaked, and even Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ripple’s (XRP) institutional inflows can only take the XRP price so far. This AI coin represents the next wave of innovation in the crypto space, and early adopters stand to reap life-changing rewards. Conclusion The crypto market waits for no one.

For many, the Shiba Inu rally was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. However, an analyst believes there are new altcoins on the horizon that could follow a similar path to success. In this article, we’ll explore the best three altcoins the analyst thinks will deliver life-changing ROI like Shiba Inu did in 2021: BONK, PEPE, and WallitIQ (WLTQ) . BONK: A Meme Coin Poised For Explosive Growth Bonk (BONK) tops the analyst list of top altcoins that can deliver life-changing ROI like Shiba Inu in 2021. BONK is trading at a modest value of $0.00002557 but has demonstrated strong potential for significant growth. Analysts predict BONK will gain renewed momentum in 2025, fueled by increased adoption and a thriving meme coin market. In conservative projections, analysts forecast BONK’s price could rise to around $0.00006510 by the end of 2025. In more optimistic scenarios, BONK could soar to as high as $0.00009368, potentially mirroring the explosive rise of Shiba Inu in 2021 to give investors a life-changing ROI. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Give More Profits Shiba Inu Did In 2021 WallitIQ (WLTQ), a new altcoin in the market, has quickly earned a reputation as one of the best altcoins that can deliver life-changing ROI as Shiba Inu did in 2021. This optimism from analysts stems from the platform’s strong position in the $45 billion AI-crypto market and impressive growth. Since the beginning of its presale journey, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has achieved remarkable momentum unmatched by other presale tokens. The project has already raised nearly $7 million across its progressive presale stages and proudly holds a long-standing listing on CoinMarketCap , further solidifying its credibility. Unlike many altcoins driven by speculative hype, WallitIQ (WLTQ) delivers real-wild utilities, and tangible value through its cutting-edge portfolio management features. The platform utilizes an advanced AI system, allowing users to seamlessly trade, track, and store their crypto assets—all within a single platform. But that’s not all. It also offers real-time market insights , empowering investors to make well-informed, data-driven decisions. Beyond trading crypto assets, the platform enables users to trade physical assets as well. Through its innovative Physical-to-Digital feature , users can tokenize their physical assets, converting them into their equivalent value in cryptocurrency. This groundbreaking functionality opens up new opportunities for asset management and expands the platform’s utility. Analysts predict these innovative functionalities will increase the platform’s traction, potentially sending its price soaring to mirror Shiba Inu’s legendary 2021 surge. Currently, the WLTQ token is available at an affordable price of $0.0420 , making this the perfect time to invest. Don’t miss out on what could be your only opportunity for life-changing ROI. Analysts Set Ambitious Price Target For PEPE Most altcoins thrive on hype, as demonstrated by Shiba Inu’s meteoric rise when retail traders and whales seized the opportunity at the right moment. Analysts believe that if PEPE follows a similar trajectory, it could experience significant gains, though timing and market sentiment will be key. Whales have already begun to show interest, with massive buys, driving PEPE’s price higher. Furthermore, analysts like Alchemist have set ambitious price targets for PEPE, ranging from $0.75 to over $10,000, indicating strong bullish sentiment from investors. If these predictions hold true, PEPE could deliver life-changing ROI, just like Shiba Inu did in 2021. Buy The WLTQ For Faster, Life-Changing Profit All of the above altcoins will generate substantial profits for holders next year. However, analysts agree that WallitIQ (WLTQ) is the most promising candidate to replicate Shiba Inu’s parabolic rally in 2021. Unlike these altcoins, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has undergone a rigorous audit by Solidproof, reinforcing its commitment to security and reliability. Additionally, the platform plans to launch a cutting-edge crypto management app , designed to streamline trading and asset management for users. As its use cases expand and investor interest grows, analysts predict that WLTQ will experience significant price surges, offering investors life-changing ROI, much like Shiba Inu did during its iconic rise in 2021.

However, their dependence on market trends has prompted cautious investors to seek alternative opportunities like RCO Finance (RCOF) . This AI-powered altcoin is rapidly gaining attention for its advanced AI technology and strong utility. With projections of a remarkable 30,000x surge post-listing, RCO Finance presents an enticing investment prospect for XRP and Ethereum whales, offering substantial returns and a strategic way to diversify portfolios amid the ongoing bullish market momentum. XRP and Ethereum Whales Find Solace in RCO Finance XRP, renowned for its cross-border payments utility, has surged 2.41% in the past day , reaching $3.13 amid the broader market rebound. This momentum is fueled by a recent partnership with Ondo Finance , with analysts anticipating new all-time highs for the altcoin. Similarly, Ethereum, a leading force in smart contracts and decentralized applications, has seen an uptrend of 4.91% in the past 24 hours . The rally follows reports that the Trump family’s crypto project, World Liberty Financial, has purchased an additional $10 million in Ethereum . Since Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20, the project has amassed over $189 million worth of ETH. Despite these gains, XRP and Ethereum whales remain cautious due to the assets’ sensitivity to market volatility. As a result, many are turning to utility-driven alternatives like RCO Finance (RCOF) to hedge against uncertainty and enhance portfolio stability in a fluctuating market. RCO Finance (RCOF): AI-Driven Financial Innovation for Smarter Investing RCO Finance (RCOF) is rapidly gaining traction among XRP and Ethereum whales, thanks to its mission of democratizing access to advanced investment strategies. Despite its recent launch, the platform has already onboarded over 10,000 users, reflecting its growing popularity. A standout feature of RCO Finance is its AI-powered Robo Advisor, which tailors investment strategies to individual users based on their financial goals and risk tolerance. Leveraging machine learning and AI algorithms, the Robo Advisor analyzes market data and news from sources like Reuters to provide credible insights. For instance, it can detect whether the recent adoption and accumulation of XRP and Ethereum are significantly impacting their prices. Based on its findings, the Robo Advisor would inform users whether buying XRP or Ethereum now is a good investment decision. Basically, this tool aims to democratize sophisticated trading strategies, making them accessible to all investors. The upcoming Alpha platform launch promises to enhance these capabilities further. In addition to AI insights, RCO Finance provides access to over 120,000 assets across 12,500 asset classes, including traditional stocks, bonds, and tokenized real-world assets like real estate and commodities. This broad asset selection allows investors to build diversified portfolios, reducing risk while maximizing potential returns. With low transaction fees and leverage options, RCOF ensures a flexible and profitable trading environment. Another key advantage is RCO Finance’s commitment to user privacy through its no-KYC policy. This allows users to engage with the platform without identity verification barriers, enabling seamless access to DeFi features such as borrowing & lending, staking, and crypto debit cards while maintaining full anonymity. Additionally, RCO Finance has launched its beta platform , giving users a firsthand look at its capabilities, an uncommon move for DeFi projects still in their presale phase. Continuous improvements are planned to further optimize functionality and user experience. RCOF Token: Blending Utilities with Massive Growth Potential XRP and Ethereum whales have shifted their focus to the RCOF token, drawn by its robust offerings and strong growth potential. Early investors in RCOF stand to benefit from multiple features, including liquidity provisions, governance rights, staking rewards with a 10% APY, and up to 1000x leverage. This makes the token a highly attractive investment option. However, RCOF Token offers beyond its extensive utility, with security and reliability as key factors driving investor confidence. RCOF’s smart contract has been certified secure after successfully passing a rigorous audit by SolidProof, a leading security firm. This trust is evident in the project’s strong presale performance, with over $12.69 million raised and more than 50 million tokens sold so far. Currently priced at $0.10 per token in its fifth presale stage, RCOF’s value is set to rise to $0.13 in the next stage, with further momentum expected upon its official listing. Hence, analysts predict a potential 30,000% surge post-listing. This means that even a modest $100 investment could potentially yield $30,000 or more, offering investors massive ROI. Invest in RCO Finance for Generational Wealth Building Despite the crypto market recovery, XRP and Ethereum whales are increasingly turning to RCO Finance (RCOF) as a high-potential investment choice. Offering a clear path to significant returns, RCOF stands out with its AI-powered platform, real-world asset integration, user-friendly ecosystem, and unmatched leverage opportunities. Investors can also claim a 40% bonus on token purchases using the code “WELCOME40”. For those who missed earlier presale stages, presale stage five presents a prime low-entry opportunity to join the expanding ecosystem. RCO Finance has over 10,000 users already onboard, signifying rapid growing adoption signals strong market confidence. Additionally, continuous enhancements to its beta version and the upcoming AI-powered Robo Advisor’s advanced monitoring capabilities further solidify the asset potential to deliver long-term wealth-building opportunities.

By mid-morning Hong Kong time, BTC was down 8%, trading above $93,100, according to CoinDesk Indices data . Meanwhile, ether (ETH) is down nearly 20% , trading at $2,500, while SOL is down 13% at $184 . XRP is down 28% and trading at $2 . The CoinDesk 20 (CD20) , an index of the largest digital assets, is down nearly 17%. Trump's memecoin (TRUMP) is down 12%. Data from CoinGlass shows that over the last 12 hours nearly $1.3 billion in long positions have been liquidated, with around $400 million in long ether positions and $300 million in long BTC positions. The market correction stems from a trade war that has seemingly been ignited by U.S. President Donald Trump with 25% tariffs being placed on Canada and Mexico. Many market observers are skeptical about the benefits of tariffs, with a Wall Street Journal editorial board op-ed calling it the ""Dumbest Trade War in History"" over the weekend. Brussels said that the European Union would respond firmly to any tariffs imposed on its member states. “Tariffs create unnecessary economic disruption and drive inflation. They are hurtful to all sides,” Politico quoted a spokesperson as saying . The U.K. seems to be the only nation that's able to get a reprieve from tariffs, with Trump saying a deal can be ""worked out"" according to the BBC .

With its presale still in its early stages, this excitement goes beyond mere speculation; it reflects the emergence of a vibrant and engaged community rooted in the principles of unity, growth and enjoyment, all inspired by the legendary Panshibi Pandas. Shiba Inu Trading Volume Explodes: 18 Trillion SHIB Tokens Change Hands Shiba Inu has seen a huge increase in trading activity, with over 18 trillion tokens involved, amounting to about $334.44 million. This rise in trading interest shows that more investors are getting involved, even though the price has dropped. Currently, the SHIB price is trading at $0.0000189, reflecting a 7.06% decline over the past week, yet it continues to attract positive sentiment among investors. Some analysts believe a significant SHIB price jump might happen soon, as traders prepare to take advantage of potential gains. A lot of this trading is happening on Gate.io, which accounts for 81.03% of the total trading volume—around 14.77 trillion tokens worth $271.03 million whilst other platforms like Bitget and OKX have smaller shares. A recent hint from Shytoshi Kusama about an upcoming important partnership has also sparked interest. Although details are scarce, this suggestion has led some investors to feel optimistic about future SHIB price increases. Moreover, after a week of losses, Shiba Inu’s price recently showed a small increase, further boosting trader confidence. Panshibi: Invest in a Community, Not Just a Coin When you invest in Panshibi , you’re not merely making a financial transaction; you’re stepping into an opportunity where everyone collaborates for success, creating a sense of belonging and shared purpose. Panshibi’s ecosystem is packed with exciting features designed to keep holders engaged and rewarded. With governance options, high-yield staking that can reach up to 1,200% APY, and innovative AI-driven “social-fi” elements, there’s something for everyone to enjoy. Safety is paramount, too—Panshibi has locked its liquidity pool for ten years, providing stability, while team tokens are secured for two years. The smart contract has undergone a thorough audit by Coinsult, reinforcing the project’s commitment to transparency and security. The vision for Panshibi extends beyond mere investment; it aims to build an online community where crypto enthusiasts from around the globe can connect and thrive. This platform will allow members to engage in various tasks and activities, offering opportunities to earn rewards while learning about the meme market. It’s a space where sharing knowledge and experiences can lead to both personal growth and collective success. Conclusion The fervor surrounding Panshibi reflects a broader trend within the cryptocurrency community, particularly among Shiba Inu holders eager to take advantage of the potential for substantial gains. With just 51 days left in the presale, which has already raised over $320,000, now is the perfect time to act. Currently priced at $0.003, the next price jump is set for $0.004, with the anticipated listing price at $0.026. Some analysts even speculate that $SHIBI could see an astonishing 145,000% surge by 2025, making it an attractive opportunity in the upcoming altcoin season.

While there’s no shortage of options in this rapidly evolving space, a few projects stand out with their innovative approaches and immense growth potential. Among them, Qubetics , Chainlink, and AAVE are setting themselves apart. Whether you’re looking for the next big blockchain technology, an altcoin that’s reshaping financial ecosystems, or a DeFi project that’s making waves, these three cryptos offer solid opportunities for anyone wanting to dip their toes into the crypto market. The surge in blockchain-based projects has been undeniable, and the shift towards decentralized finance (DeFi), cross-border transactions, and tokenization of assets is only growing. While traditional financial systems have struggled to meet the needs of modern businesses and individuals, these blockchain projects have the power to bridge that gap. From revolutionizing global transactions to empowering individuals with secure and transparent financial services, the best cryptos to buy now are those that have real-world applications and long-term scalability. Let’s talk about Qubetics and how it’s addressing real-world challenges, with a keen focus on cross-border transactions and its upcoming presale stages. Qubetics isn’t just another cryptocurrency; it’s a platform designed to enable decentralized applications (dApps) and bring true blockchain utility to various industries. In this article, we will break down the offerings of Qubetics , Chainlink, and AAVE to show how each one uniquely contributes to the digital finance space and why they deserve a place in your portfolio. Qubetics: The Future of Blockchain Technology and Cross-Border Transactions When it comes to finding the best cryptos to buy now , Qubetics ($TICS) should be at the top of your list. In its 20th presale stage, Qubetics has already sold more than 457 million tokens to over 18,000 holders, raising a whopping $11.7 million. Its growth trajectory speaks volumes about the trust investors have in its potential. At a presale price of $0.0667 per token, this blockchain platform promises massive returns as the project progresses. The market is buzzing about its unique features, and the analysts’ predictions are showing just how much upside Qubetics has. What sets Qubetics apart from the competition is its ability to facilitate seamless cross-border transactions , which is a game-changer for businesses, professionals, and individuals globally. With traditional financial systems lagging in terms of speed and accessibility, Qubetics uses blockchain to make international transfers faster, cheaper, and more secure. This is especially important for businesses that need to transfer funds across borders without the usual delays and high fees that come with conventional banking methods. In addition, Qubetics provides a unique platform for asset tokenization, allowing users to easily fractionalize and trade real-world assets. This level of accessibility is groundbreaking, particularly for small businesses and individuals who have never had the chance to invest in high-value assets like real estate or rare collectibles. Tokenization opens up the possibility for a truly decentralized, transparent, and secure economy. With its innovative approach, Qubetics is solving many of the problems that other projects and financial systems have failed to address. The Qubetics presale is in full swing, and with its stage 20 price of $0.0667 per token, now’s the time to jump in. By the end of its presale journey, $TICS is forecasted to touch $0.25, offering investors a 274.70% ROI right out of the gate. If the token rides the post-presale wave to $1, those early adopters could be looking at a 1,398.82% gain. And if it reaches the $5 mark, as analysts suggest, that’s a 7,394.11% return—a number that should make anyone sit up and pay attention. Things get even more intense once the Mainnet is live. A climb to $10 would mean early investors rake in a 14,888.23% return, and if $TICS skyrockets to $15, we’re talking about a mind-blowing 22,382.34% ROI—the kind of upside that’s impossible to ignore. Chainlink: Powering the Future of Decentralized Oracle Networks If you’re considering the best cryptos to buy now, Chainlink (LINK) is a well-established player with a strong reputation in the blockchain space. Founded in 2017, Chainlink is the leading decentralized oracle network that enables smart contracts to securely interact with external data sources, APIs, and payment systems. In a world where smart contracts are increasingly being used in everything from insurance to supply chain management, Chainlink’s role in providing secure and reliable data to these contracts is crucial. What makes Chainlink stand out is its ability to bring real-world data to the blockchain. While blockchains are known for their security and immutability, they are generally closed ecosystems that can’t access information from outside sources. Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network solves this problem by linking smart contracts to external data feeds, allowing for a wide range of use cases. This capability is particularly important for decentralized finance (DeFi), where the accuracy and timeliness of data can make or break a transaction. For businesses and developers, Chainlink is a go-to solution for building decentralized applications that require reliable data. With major partnerships in place, including with Google Cloud, SWIFT, and many others, Chainlink has solidified itself as one of the best cryptos to buy now for anyone looking to be part of the future of decentralized finance and blockchain technology. AAVE: Leading the Charge in DeFi Lending and Borrowing When talking about the best cryptos to buy now, AAVE has quickly become one of the top contenders for anyone interested in decentralized finance. AAVE is a decentralized lending protocol that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies without relying on centralized banks or financial institutions. This innovative platform is revolutionizing how people access liquidity and offers a more open and transparent alternative to traditional lending. AAVE’s unique features include its ability to offer users the ability to lend assets and earn interest or borrow assets with collateral. It also provides users with the ability to access liquidity pools, where they can trade assets and earn fees. With its focus on creating a fully decentralized lending and borrowing platform, AAVE is changing the way people think about finance. It’s part of the broader DeFi movement, which aims to provide financial services to individuals who may not have access to traditional banking systems. AAVE’s token (AAVE) plays a central role in the protocol, allowing holders to participate in governance decisions and earn rewards. With its innovative approach and growing popularity, AAVE has proven to be one of the best cryptos to buy now for anyone looking to take part in the DeFi revolution. Cross-Border Transactions and the Future of Qubetics Now that you’ve seen how Qubetics , Chainlink, and AAVE are making their mark, it’s time to dive deeper into Qubetics’ unique offering—cross-border transactions. As the world becomes more interconnected, the need for secure, fast, and inexpensive ways to send money across borders is more crucial than ever. Traditional systems often involve high fees, long wait times, and limited access to certain countries or regions. Qubetics is changing that by leveraging blockchain technology to make cross-border transactions faster, cheaper, and more secure. This innovation will have a major impact on businesses operating in different parts of the world. Whether you’re a small business looking to send payments to suppliers in another country or an individual needing to transfer money to a family member abroad, Qubetics makes it simple. By removing the need for intermediaries and using smart contracts, Qubetics ensures that transactions are transparent, efficient, and cost-effective. This could be a game-changer for global commerce and could significantly disrupt traditional financial systems. Conclusion: Why Qubetics, Chainlink, and AAVE Are Among the Best Cryptos to Buy Now In conclusion, if you’re on the hunt for the best cryptos to buy now, Qubetics, Chainlink, and AAVE all offer unique value propositions that cater to the future of finance and blockchain technology. Whether you’re interested in cross-border transactions, decentralized finance, or the integration of real-world data into smart contracts, these projects have what it takes to thrive in the digital economy. For anyone looking to make a smart investment and be part of the blockchain revolution, now is the time to get involved.

Despite that, meme coins achieved the highest growth rate in the crypto market, delivering over 1,300% average returns, before encountering major market difficulties. The explosive growth phase of meme coins carries significant market dangers, and financial experts forecast a forthcoming “disillusionment phase.” Shiba Inu and Dogwifhat face substantial market instability, which leads investors to shift their focus to Panshibi (SHIBI) , which promises rapid expansion and potential 50x returns. Can The Dogs Regain Community Traction? The meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB), which its community defines as the DOGE killer, achieved rapid success as a major digital asset after emerging as a dog-themed token. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been somewhat overwhelming over the past several months, crashing amid the broader bearish market wave. Also, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has not shown great recovery strength, and investors may be diversifying into promising new meme coin projects. As of this writing, the Shiba Inu price is at $0.00001796, having dropped over 15% in the past month. As experts make bullish Shiba Inu price predictions for the 2025 bull market, attention is turning to Panshibi (SHIBI) for its cheaper entry and high-profit margins. Like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-themed meme coin on the Solana network. Dogwifhat (WIF) quickly rose to prominence in 2023, building most of its community strength through 2024. Today, experts believe Dogwifhat (WIF) presents some potential for gains in the coming meme coin season, but recent market trends have not been so kind on the meme coin. As of this writing, Dogwifhat (WIF) is trading at $0.9907, with a tragic 40% loss over the past month. Despite the 204% gains on the yearly chart, recent market trends have forced investors to cut losses on the meme coin in pursuit of other market opportunities. Panshibi (SHIBI) Renews Investors In Meme Coins With Panda Memes Experts believe investors now face their best chance for life-changing gains yet with Panshibi (SHIBI). The new meme coin stands out as a transformative digital asset that looks to redefine the typical meme coin comic for 2025 Panshibi surpasses the meme coin trend to generate massive future possibilities. This pioneering token uses panda iconography based on Asian mythology to deliver a distinct offering to market participants. The token sale began at $0.002, and investors can expect 1,200% returns during a 60-day limited period until $10 million is reached. Through extensive tokenomics, the project establishes outstanding protection for investors. Coinsult performed the smart contract audit and locked the liquidity pool for ten years, with team tokens secured for two years. Following the presale period, the project team will relinquish control of smart contract ownership to achieve unparalleled transparency for investors. Crypto specialists remain positive, with forecasts pointing toward a possible 5,000% return by June. According to CoinGecko’s 2024 analysis, Panshibi stands ready to profit from the significant trend of meme coins, accounting for 31% of crypto investments. The token provides groundbreaking features such as 1,200% APY on staked tokens, AI community strategies in social finance, and governance participation with an exclusive VIP club for presale investors. As the crypto market prepares to surge in 2025, Panshibi stands as an entry-level opportunity for high returns this year. Early investors stand to gain enormous profits from potential exchange listings later this year alongside the expanding social media interest. The project secured over $75,000 from its launch in two days, which shows great interest in the market and potential growth. Conclusion The present market conditions offer investors a special chance to profit from new developments in the meme coin industry. Panshibi emerges as a ripe investment option amid the struggles of Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogwifhat (WIF). Panshibi’s fresh panda-themed idea, combined with strong tokenomics, positions it to take a large market share. The presale price of Panshibi is still in stage 2 at an affordable $0.003, and experts predict it will lead the memecoin to substantial future profits.

Solana enjoyed major success in 2024, surpassing Ethereum and other networks on various metrics, such as daily active users, monthly transfer volume, and more. Although it is mostly referred to as a memecoin chain, it has attracted interest from institutional adopters like Blackrock, Bitwise, and Grayscale. As a top defi token, many analysts have tipped Solana to continue its impressive dominance from last year and be among the top performers in 2025. They’ve also predicted that Remittix , a new crypto, could have a tremendous year due to the rising demand for PayFi products. Remittix is currently on presale and is on course to hit its $36 million target shortly. Remittix Presale Stuns Altcoin Fans The pace at which Remitixx’s presale is going has shocked fans of major altcoins throughout the industry. In only a few weeks since its presale began, Remittix has generated over $10.5 million and looks set to hit its $36 million target shortly. The Remittix team said they expect the presale to sell out due to the growing demand for PayFi solutions. Remittix combines centralized and decentralized payment methods and is a potential leader in the PayFi category. With Remittix, users can send money in crypto and have it delivered as FIAT to merchants or anyone else. This eradicates the offramping process, leading to a smoother, better experience. Currently available for $0.0521, Remittix is a low-risk, high-reward investment option heading into the bull market. Over 430 million tokens have been sold from the 750 million allocation for the presale, meaning interested investors don’t have much time before the presale ends. Solana Receives Institutional Backing The number of institutional investors interested in Solana is growing daily. In January, several venture firms applied for a Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF), including Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary Capital and VanEck. Alongside high-cap altcoins like XRP and Litecoin, Solana is most likely to receive an ETF allocation shortly. Investors will be hoping any ETF approvals happen sooner rather than later as it could trigger the next SOL price rally. The previous SOL price rally came after US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump launched memecoins on Solana on the inauguration weekend. Solana surged to a new all-time high shortly after, causing a flurry of Solana price predictions from analysts and investors alike. However, the joy was short-lived after Solana quickly rebounded. The token is now at peak bear market levels heading into the new month. But, with a scheduled network upgrade called Firedancer coming up, another SOL price rally seems likely. Conclusion Institutional support for Solana is growing amid the latest struggles, which is a good sign of investor confidence and overall positive sentiment. A major win like an ETF approval could very well be the catalyst for sending the SOL price surging once again. Meanwhile, Remittix performs impressively in its presale and has already surpassed $10.5 million. The next milestone for the presale is the $36 million mark which it could hit shortly. With over 400 million from the 750 million tokens allocated for the Remittix presale already sold, the Remittix presale could end soon. Join the presale and community now!

39849014,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=125930,1738549375,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Forex Funding Revolution: How Funded Forex Programs Are Changing the Game,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/forex-funding/,"Forex Funding: A Game-Changer for Aspiring Traders The forex funding industry has witnessed significant growth, offering traders access to substantial capital without risking their own money. Programs such as True Forex Funds , Infinity Forex Funds , and My Forex Funds are leading the charge, revolutionizing the way traders engage with the foreign exchange market. With proprietary trading firms providing funded accounts, traders now have the chance to scale their strategies and maximize profits while minimizing financial risk. The concept of funded forex accounts is no longer a luxury but a necessity for those who want to make a mark in the forex industry. What Is Forex Funding? Forex funding allows traders to access capital from proprietary trading firms, eliminating the need for significant personal investment. These firms evaluate traders through a qualification process, typically involving a demo trading challenge where traders must demonstrate their skills in a risk-controlled environment. Once traders pass the evaluation, they receive a funded forex account, enabling them to trade with the firm’s capital and earn a profit share. Programs like The Forex Funder and My Funded Forex have gained popularity due to their structured evaluations and fair trading conditions. How True Forex Funds and Infinity Forex Funds Are Leading the Market Among the many proprietary trading firms, True Forex Funds and Infinity Forex Funds stand out for their transparent evaluation processes and trader-friendly conditions. True Forex Funds Offers a structured evaluation with realistic profit targets. Provides traders with up to 90% profit splits. Allows diverse trading styles, including scalping, swing trading, and day trading. Infinity Forex Funds Focuses on giving traders a seamless funding experience. Offers competitive trading conditions with minimal restrictions. Enables traders to withdraw profits quickly and efficiently. Both firms empower traders by giving them the opportunity to grow their capital without financial constraints. The Rise of Forex Funder and My Forex Funds Programs such as Forex Funder and My Forex Funds have gained traction due to their trader-friendly funding models. Forex Funder provides traders with flexible trading options, allowing them to use expert advisors (EAs) and leverage different trading strategies. My Forex Funds offers various funding models, including rapid funding options where traders can skip the evaluation phase. These firms have democratized forex trading, ensuring that skilled traders can access capital regardless of their financial background. Why Funded Forex Accounts Are Changing the Industry The traditional forex trading landscape required traders to risk their own capital, often leading to significant financial losses. However, funded forex accounts have eliminated this barrier, offering several advantages: Risk-Free Trading: Traders use firm capital, protecting their personal funds. Higher Profit Potential: Large capital access allows traders to maximize gains. No Personal Losses: Any losses incurred are covered by the funding firm. Scalability: Successful traders can receive increased capital allocations over time. The emergence of fast forex funding options has further accelerated industry growth, enabling traders to receive funding within days instead of weeks. Forex Fundamental Analysis: A Key to Success Even with a funded forex account, traders must rely on forex fundamental analysis to make informed decisions. Understanding macroeconomic indicators, interest rates, and geopolitical events is crucial for sustained profitability. Key Aspects of Fundamental Analysis Forex Traders Should Know Interest Rates: Higher interest rates typically strengthen a currency, while lower rates weaken it. Inflation Reports: High inflation can erode currency value, impacting forex movements. Employment Data: Strong job reports can boost a currency, while weak reports can cause depreciation. Geopolitical Events: Political instability can lead to market volatility. By mastering fundamental analysis forex traders can enhance their decision-making and improve their performance with funded forex accounts. Is Fast Forex Funding the Future? The concept of fast forex funding is gaining momentum, as traders seek quicker access to capital. Firms are now offering instant funding models, reducing the wait time for traders to start trading live accounts. Advantages of Fast Forex Funding Immediate access to trading capital. No lengthy evaluation processes. Quick profit withdrawals. Flexible trading conditions. As technology advances, fast forex funding is expected to become the norm, further enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of proprietary trading firms. Conclusion The evolution of forex funding has created a new era of opportunities for traders. Programs such as True Forex Funds , Infinity Forex Funds , The Forex Funder , and My Forex Funds have redefined the forex landscape, providing traders with the capital they need to succeed. With a focus on risk-free trading, higher profit potential, and the integration of forex fundamental analysis , the funded forex industry is set to continue its rapid growth.

Bonk, a Solana-based meme coin, made headlines with its rapid ascent, rewarding early investors handsomely. A new contender, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) , is emerging, promising an adventurous journey and the potential for substantial returns. Let’s explore these two intriguing projects and why Arctic Pablo might be the best meme coin to join in 2025. Arctic Pablo Coin: Embarking on a Mythical Crypto Adventure Enter Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), a fresh and captivating entrant in the meme coin arena. Inspired by the adventurous spirit of its namesake, Arctic Pablo invites investors to join a mythical expedition through frostbitten terrains and enigmatic ice-covered islands. But this isn’t just about storytelling; Arctic Pablo combines narrative with innovative financial incentives, positioning itself as the best meme coin to join in 2025 . The presale structure is uniquely designed as a journey through various “locations,” with each phase representing a new destination and an increase in token price. Arctic Pablo has reached Shangri-La, the eighth phase of its expedition. Early investors have already witnessed impressive returns, with the presale raising over $800,000. One of the standout features of Arctic Pablo is its staking program, offering a dazzling 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY). Investors can stake their APC tokens and watch their investments grow, enjoying generous rewards while actively participating in the project’s journey. All staked coins are vested for two months from the launch date, ensuring stability and long-term commitment. The tokenomics of Arctic Pablo are meticulously crafted to promote scarcity and value appreciation. The total supply is capped at 221,200,000,000 APC, with 50% allocated for the public presale. A weekly token burn mechanism permanently eliminates unsold tokens during the presale, fostering a deflationary environment that enhances investor value and ensures long-term sustainability. Moreover, Arctic Pablo’s referral incentives program allows participants to earn rewards by spreading the word, creating a powerful growth cycle and reward for early supporters. This community-driven approach fuels hype and solidifies Arctic Pablo’s place as a promising investment opportunity. Bonk: The Meteoric Rise of a Solana-Based Meme Coin Bonk burst onto the scene as the first Solana dog coin, created “for the people, by the people.” With 50% of its total supply airdropped to the Solana community, it aimed to foster a fair distribution and community-driven growth. This strategy paid off, as early adopters saw significant gains. At its peak in November 2024, Bonk reached an all-time high of $0.00005825, marking a remarkable journey from its inception. However, like many meme coins, Bonk’s price experienced volatility. As of January 31, 2025, it was trading at approximately $0.00002481, reflecting a decline from its peak but still maintaining a substantial market capitalization. The community’s enthusiasm and strategic token burns—such as the “BURNmas” event where BonkDAO announced plans to burn 1.69 trillion BONK tokens—helped sustain interest and support the token’s value. Bonk’s journey underscores meme coin investments’ potential rewards and inherent risks. Early participants reaped significant benefits, but the volatility serves as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of such assets. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin emerges as a standout contender in the meme coin landscape. Its innovative approach, combining a captivating narrative with strategic financial incentives, sets it apart from predecessors like Bonk. The structured presale, high APY staking, and deflationary mechanisms offer a unique investment opportunity with the potential for substantial returns. Don’t miss out on this thrilling expedition. Join the Arctic Pablo presale now and embark on a journey where the cold meets the mystical, and every coin holds the promise of adventure.

However, recent network instability and centralization concerns have raised red flags for investors seeking long-term stability. As Solana grapples with technical vulnerabilities, many traders are looking for safer, high-growth alternatives—and Lightchain AI , which is building on Polygon’s robust infrastructure, is quickly emerging as the smart money move. Currently priced at $0.005625 in presale with $14 million raised, Lightchain AI combines the best of AI, blockchain efficiency, and Polygon’s proven scalability, making it a standout investment choice in 2025. Biggest Weakness of Solana – Network Failures & Centralization Solana’s biggest issue has always been its reliability. Despite its impressive speed, the network has experienced frequent outages, with over a dozen incidents causing disruptions that sometimes last hours or even days. These downtimes, especially during periods of high demand, have hurt user trust and raised questions about the network’s long-term stability. Another major concern is Solana’s over-reliance on centralized validators. A significant portion of staking power is concentrated among a few entities, leading to criticisms about its lack of true decentralization. This centralization undermines the core principles of blockchain technology and poses risks for network security. Finally, Solana faces congestion issues during peak usage. While designed for high throughput, its single-layer structure creates bottlenecks, limiting efficiency. For investors prioritizing scalability and reliability, Solana’s challenges make alternatives like Lightchain AI on Polygon a safer long-term option. Why Lightchain AI on Polygon Is the Better Investment As Solana grapples with instability, Lightchain AI is stepping ahead by leveraging Polygon’s reliable Layer-2 infrastructure to deliver a faster, more scalable, and AI-integrated blockchain experience. Unlike Solana, Polygon’s Layer-2 solutions process transactions off-chain while still benefiting from Ethereum’s robust security, ensuring no network outages. This scalability provides Lightchain AI with a solid foundation to support mass adoption without the risk of technical failures. Lightchain AI isn’t just another blockchain project—it’s pioneering the integration of artificial intelligence to enhance data processing, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (dApps). This unique combination of AI and blockchain gives it a technological edge over both Solana and Polygon, promising greater efficiency and innovation for the future. One of its standout features is the Memecoin Launchpad, a platform empowering creators and developers to monetize their ideas seamlessly. By providing AI-driven tools in a secure and flexible environment, Lightchain AI is fueling a thriving creative economy. This approach unlocks new opportunities, driving innovation and building an ecosystem where ideas can flourish. Future-Proof Investment As Solana struggles with ongoing technical issues, investors are setting their sights on an exciting new opportunity: Lightchain AI on Polygon. Offering long-term stability, unmatched scalability, and seamless AI integration, Lightchain AI is quickly becoming the go-to choice for forward-thinking investors aiming to stay ahead of the curve in 2025. Why is Lightchain AI the smart bet? It’s not just about reliability—this project combines real-world utility with AI-driven efficiency to create a future-proof investment. With zero downtime and a cutting-edge approach to blockchain, Lightchain AI is poised to revolutionize decentralized intelligence. The numbers speak for themselves – a 10 billion token supply strategically allocated to ensure sustainability. Here’s the breakdown – 40% for presale, 28.5% for staking rewards, 15% for liquidity, 5% for marketing, 6.5% for the treasury, and 5% for the team. Every detail is designed for long-term growth. Lightchain AI isn’t just solving blockchain issues like scalability and privacy—it’s setting the stage for real-world applications powered by AI. For anyone searching for an innovative, high-growth alternative to Solana, Lightchain AI is the future you don’t want to miss. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,SOL|MATIC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-03 03:00:00

BITCOIN, XRP, and OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM Could Be the Answer!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/500-to-seven-figures-bitcoin-xrp-and-officialmagacoin-com-could-be-the-answer/,"While Bitcoin (BTC) proved it’s possible by delivering exponential returns to early investors, the spotlight now shines on OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a newcomer that could replicate such success. With a presale price under $0.20 and a rapid rise in popularity, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is capturing the imagination of crypto enthusiasts who believe that $300 today could turn into $999,000 in the near future. Why OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Transform Your Investment 1. Early-Stage Opportunity OFFICIALMAGACOIN is still in its presale phase, offering a ground-floor opportunity for investors to buy in before the token gains mainstream attention. This is the stage where gains of 1,000x or more become achievable, as seen with Bitcoin in its early days. 2. Exclusive AvailabilityUnlike widely distributed coins, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand, ensuring that early adopters benefit as interest surges. 3. Record-Breaking Presale SuccessRaising over $1 million in presale funds in record time, OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven its appeal among investors. Such strong initial support is a hallmark of projects poised for explosive growth. 4. Massive Growth PotentialExperts are predicting OFFICIALMAGACOIN could follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps, transforming small investments into extraordinary returns. With its low entry price and strong market momentum, the potential for turning $300 into $999,000 feels more achievable than ever. How It Stacks Up Against SOL, MATIC, KAS, and BTC Bitcoin (BTC): A proven store of value, but its days of exponential growth are behind it. Solana (SOL): Fast and scalable, but its market is maturing, making massive gains less likely. Polygon (MATIC): A strong performer in Ethereum scaling, but it lacks the exclusivity and newness of OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An up-and-coming blockchain project with potential but without the momentum OFFICIALMAGACOIN is generating. Don’t Miss Out on OFFICIALMAGACOIN The chance to turn $300 into $999K doesn’t come often, but OFFICIALMAGACOIN might just be that opportunity. With its affordable price, exclusivity, and massive growth potential, it’s a must-watch for 2025. Secure your tokens now at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM and stay updated on their journey via Twitter/X.

Bitcoin (BTC) Plummets to $91K as Crypto Market Liquidations Hit $1.8 Billion Bitcoin (BTC) plunged below the $91,200 mark on February 3, its lowest level in 20 days. This decline follows mounting economic concerns sparked by former U.S. President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada, which have triggered widespread financial market turbulence. As fears of rising consumer prices escalate, social media reports suggest that American consumers are preparing for inflation by stockpiling essential goods. This has led to a shift in retail investor sentiment, with many liquidating riskier assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies in favor of more stable stores of value. Crypto Market Liquidations, Feb 3, 2025 | Source: Coinglass.com As depicted above, Crypto market liquidations have exceeded $1.8 billion as BTC price plunged 7% in the last 24 hours, signaling unusually heavy capitulation from large investors. This suggests that Bitcoin institutional investors are also responding to inflation risks, anticipating that the U.S. Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner than expected. This has led many to shift capital toward government bonds before interest rate hikes push prices higher. Combined, these factors have exacerbated selling pressure in the crypto market, driving Bitcoin’s price down by 11% over the past three days. Key Bitcoin (BTC) Price Levels to Watch Amid the ongoing crypto market downturn, some crucial BTC trading signals indicate key levels that could be pivotal to Bitcoin price action as the week progresses. Coinglass Liquidation Map Shows BTC’s Strongest Support Level Lies at $90,360 Bitcoin started the week under pressure due to the bearish sentiment surrounding the escalating trade war. Many U.S.-based traders likely set sell orders over the weekend, anticipating further downward movement as markets opened on Monday. This could result in heightened volatility in the early trading hours. Coinglass’ liquidation map provides insight into the critical price levels where traders have placed leveraged positions. The chart displays Bitcoin’s aggregated leverage positions over the last 30 days, revealing key areas where liquidation events are likely. Bitcoin (BTC) Liquidation Map | Source: Coinglass The data suggests that bearish sentiment dominates, with $11.9 billion in short positions far exceeding the $3.04 billion in long positions. This confirms expectations of further downside risk. However, bullish traders have concentrated $2.12 billion in leverage at the $90,358 level, accounting for 70% of total long leverage positions. This indicates strong potential support around $90,500, as traders seek to defend their positions from liquidation losses. Other key support zones include $93,000 and $94,330, where long positions total $1 billion and $330 million, respectively. If Bitcoin’s price approaches these levels, we could see increased buying activity aimed at stabilizing the market. Nevertheless, a prolonged bearish trend could persist unless global economic conditions improve or influential market participants intervene to stabilize sentiment. The Double-Bottom Pattern Signals a Potential Breakout Toward $108,000 While the prevailing market sentiment remains bearish due to macroeconomic pressures, certain technical indicators suggest the possibility of a Bitcoin price recovery. The double-bottom pattern observed in recent trading activity hints at a potential breakout target of $108,000, provided market sentiment shifts positively. Savvy investors might capitalize on the current price dip, increasing their Bitcoin holdings around the $90,300, $93,000, and $94,300 support levels. Some Bitcoin maximalists believe that prolonged trade tensions could drive sovereign entities to seek BTC as an inflation hedge. Notably, the Czech Republic and Bhutan have recently explored Bitcoin acquisitions, and U.S. states and corporations may increasingly turn to blockchain solutions to circumvent trade barriers. Bitcoin Price Forecast: Can BTC Rebound to $108K? From a technical analysis standpoint, Bitcoin price forecast shows BTC trading near recent significant lows highlighted double-bottom pattern, which often precedes a bullish breakout. In terms of key levels to watch, BTC must maintains support above $90,500 to keep alive rebound hopes of reclaiming the $96,150 territory. If the trade war sparks a BTC buying frenzy among nations and institutions, the ensuing BTC price recovery could gain enough momentum to test the $102,000-$105,000 range. A sustained rally above these levels could open the door to the $108,000 breakout target. Key Bitcoin (BTC) Price Levels to Watch: BTC/USD | TradingView The Bollinger Bands indicator also highlights key resistance levels that Bitcoin must overcome to reclaim bullish momentum. The upper band suggests significant resistance at $105,800, followed by a more substantial barrier near $108,000. If Bitcoin can consolidate above these levels, it may establish a new bullish trend, counteracting the recent downturn. In Summary: While Bitcoin’s 11% decline in 3 consecutive losing days has rattled investors with $1.8 billion market liquidations. However, key technical indicators point to potential support around $90,500 and possible recovery scenarios. The ongoing trade war and economic uncertainty continue to influence market sentiment, but long-term investors and institutional players could take advantage of lower prices. Should positive sentiment return, Bitcoin could break out toward $108,000, reinforcing its status as a politically-neutral asset.

As meme tokens continue to dominate the crypto market, BTFD Coin (BTFD), Dogwifhat (WIF), and Notcoin (NOT) are catching serious attention from investors. Dogwifhat is leveraging Solana’s fast blockchain for high-speed transactions, while Notcoin is reshaping play-to-earn gaming with its viral Telegram-based model. But the real spotlight is on BTFD Coin, which has already raised over $5.9 million in its presale, securing its place as the best meme to invest before 2025’s bull run. Meme coins are no longer just for fun—they’re big business. With strong community backing, innovative ecosystems, and high investor engagement, these tokens are creating massive profit opportunities. BTFD Coin is leading the charge with its presale momentum and analyst predictions, while Dogwifhat and Notcoin bring unique value propositions to the meme coin space. Let’s break down why these tokens are dominating the market right now. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Presale That’s Breaking Records Investors always hunt for meme coins with serious growth potential, and BTFD Coin is delivering exactly that. The project is in Stage 14 of its presale, where tokens are priced at $0.00016 each. Once the presale ends, BTFD Coin will be listed at $0.0006, giving early investors a guaranteed 275% gain. But the real moonshot target is $0.006, which would turn even a modest investment into a fortune. Why is BTFD Coin the best meme to invest in right now? Analysts predict that BTFD could be the next big meme coin breakout, especially with its play-to-earn game and staking rewards. The P2E game launched in January 2025 and is already seeing huge traction. Meanwhile, its staking rewards offer 90% APY, attracting serious investors who want to earn passive income while holding their tokens. The BTFD Coin presale is already a massive success. Over 68 billion tokens have been sold, with more than 10,200 holders already on board. And with the LAUNCH100 bonus code, investors can double their token holdings instantly. This is an unmatched opportunity to get in before the real bull run starts. To invest in BTFD Coin, buyers simply need to set up a MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB or ETH, and head to the presale page . Entering the LAUNCH100 bonus code doubles their tokens, and once the presale ends, tokens can be claimed and staked for rewards. A $3,000 investment at $0.00016 per token buys 18,750,000 BTFD coins. When the price reaches $0.0006, that investment jumps to $11,250. If it hits $0.006, the return skyrockets to $112,500. With staking and early presale benefits, this is one of the most explosive opportunities in crypto right now. Dogwifhat (WIF) – The Solana-Powered Meme Sensation Dogwifhat (WIF) is one of the hottest meme coins on Solana, quickly becoming a favorite among traders and meme lovers. With a simple yet powerful branding—a dog in a pink beanie—Dogwifhat has built a massive following, helping its price surge. Unlike older meme coins, Dogwifhat benefits from Solana’s high-speed, low-cost transactions, making it a favorite among traders who want quick, efficient meme coin swaps. This has helped WIF see a surge in trading volume, keeping it in the spotlight as one of the best meme to invest in 2025. The biggest driver of Dogwifhat’s growth is its community. With constant Twitter trends, viral memes, and influencer endorsements, WIF has cemented its place as one of the strongest Solana meme coins. Investors looking for a high-energy, community-driven token have been stacking WIF, fueling its momentum heading into 2025. Notcoin (NOT) – The Play-to-Earn Revolution on Telegram Notcoin (NOT) is shaking up the meme coin world with its Telegram-based play-to-earn game, allowing players to earn crypto by tapping a virtual coin and completing tasks. This innovative approach has attracted millions of users, making Notcoin one of the fastest-growing meme projects in recent months. With Telegram’s massive user base, Notcoin has a built-in advantage over other meme coins. Players don’t need complex crypto knowledge to start earning, making it one of the most accessible meme tokens on the market. As one of the best meme coins to invest in 2025, Notcoin’s P2E mechanics and large user adoption set it apart. If it continues to expand its in-game economy and partnerships, NOT could see further price surges as more players join the ecosystem. The Bottom Line Based on our research and market trends, the best meme to invest in right now depends on what kind of opportunity investors are looking for. Dogwifhat (WIF) is gaining momentum through Solana’s efficiency and viral meme power, while Notcoin (NOT) is pioneering a new play-to-earn model through Telegram’s massive user base. But BTFD Coin (BTFD) stands out as the most rewarding investment, with its record-breaking presale, analyst-backed growth predictions, and massive staking rewards. With BTFD Coin’s presale at $0.00016 and a projected moonshot price of $0.006, the opportunity is too big to ignore. Investors who act now can capitalize on the LAUNCH100 bonus, doubling their tokens instantly. The Bulls Squad is growing, and the window to buy at this price is closing fast. This is your chance to own the dip before the next bull run. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and lock in your gains before it takes off.

It hit $92,681 less than an hour ago before bouncing slightly to $93,831. That’s a 7% drop. Ether wasn’t spared either, crashing 20% to its lowest point since November. The market meltdown began after President Donald Trump threw his trade-war punch Saturday night. He slapped Canada and Mexico with a 25% tariff and hit China with a 10% duty. The tariffs are set to officially kick in on Tuesday, and the ‘crypto president’ has declared that the tariffs “could get a lot worse” than they are right now. The CoinDesk 20 index, which tracks the biggest 20 crypto by market value, has tumbled by 19% in the past 8 hours. Stocks didn’t sit this one out either. Dow futures fell 463 points. S&P 500 futures lost 1.6%, while Nasdaq-100 futures dropped 2.1%. Investors got hit everywhere, and crypto traders are now eyeing key support at $90,000 for Bitcoin, with fears of another pullback to $80,000 if it crashes below that level. Trump’s tariffs cause fear across markets Per data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US does $1.6 trillion in annual trade with Canada, Mexico, and China, so these tariffs hit a nerve. Stock traders are sweating. Over 120 major companies in the S&P 500, including Alphabet, Amazon, Walt Disney, and Palantir, are set to report their earnings this week. Nobody wants disappointing numbers, but the tariffs have raised that risk. AI stocks, already under scrutiny, are taking this the hardest. Nvidia’s NVDA has lost over 7% of its value. 1. Super Micro’s SMCI plunged by 8.8%, AMD tumbled by 5.1%, and Arm’s ARM lost 6.2%. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq ended last week in the red. But surprisingly, they still closed January with gains—2.7% for the S&P 500 and 4.7% for the Dow. Bitcoin is down 16% from its January high of $109,350. That’s a $16,000 haircut in a matter of days. Experienced crypto traders aren’t surprised though. Bitcoin has a history of corrections, often around 30%, even during bull runs. Arthur Hayes, founder of BitMEX who has been trading Bitcoin since 2011, thinks Bitcoin will benefit in the long term, because a trade war would weaken the US dollar. But the dollar isn’t having a tough time right now though, as it surges by over 1% today, continuing its climb to five-year highs. Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report will add more drama. Economists expect 175,000 new jobs for January, with unemployment sticking at 4.1%. If the numbers come in worse than expected, it could fuel more uncertainty. And guess what? Uncertainty is poison for Bitcoin right now. But according to Trump ? “Anybody that’s against Tariffs, including the Fake News Wall Street Journal, and Hedge Funds, is only against them because these people or entities are controlled by China, or other foreign or domestic companies. Anybody that loves and believes in the United States of America is in favor of Tariffs. They should have never ended, in favor of the Income Tax System, in 1913.

ETH is down over 25% and the bears seem to be in control below $2,770. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $3,000 support zone. The price is trading below $2,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,900 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a recovery wave if it stays above the $2,200 level. Ethereum Price Nosedives Ethereum price started a major decline below the $3,000 level, underperforming Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $2,800 and $2,650 levels to enter a bearish zone. There was a clear move below the $2,500 level. The price declined over 25% and tested the $2,120 zone. A low was formed at $2,127 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $2,300 level. The price surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,403 wing high to the $2,127 swing low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,650 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,770 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,403 wing high to the $2,127 swing low. The main resistance is now forming near $2,900. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,900 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. A clear move above the $2,900 resistance might send the price toward the $3,000 resistance. An upside break above the $3,000 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,150 resistance zone or even $3,250 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,600 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,320 level. The first major support sits near the $2,250. A clear move below the $2,250 support might push the price toward the $2,120 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,000 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,880. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

Bitcoin’s price fell by 5%, which has rippled its way into altcoins. Effective Feb. 1, the U.S. will impose tariffs of 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% on Chinese goods, adding further complexity to the current trade wars. As a result, over the past 24 hours ending on Feb. 3, Bitcoin ( BTC ) has experienced a notable decline amid a market-wide sell-off. The cryptocurrency fell by over 5%, reaching a low of approximately $91,200 before rebounding to around $94,000 as of this writing. Despite this recovery, BTC remains roughly 13% below its all-time high of $109,000, and trading volume has surged by more than 200%, suggesting considerable selling pressure or market panic. Additionally, the overall global crypto market cap has dropped nearly 12% during the same period, settling at about $3.15 trillion. It’s worth noting that following President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, Bitcoin and other altcoins saw a significant price increase. However, since that peak, recent developments—including new tariff policies—have contributed to a drastic decline in market sentiment and asset values. Given Bitcoin’s recent price crash, it has had a cascading effect on altcoins. In the last 24 hours, Ethereum ( ETH ) has fallen by nearly 20%, Ripple ( XRP ) by 22%, Solana ( SOL ) by 8%, and Binance Coin ( BNB ) by over 15%.

This pattern suggests that long-term investors are now selling their coins at lower profits than their purchase price—or even at a loss year-to-date—as illustrated by the Bitcoin: Long Term Holder SOPR chart. Such behavior often indicates capitulation among long-term holders, a phenomenon common during bearish market trends and corrections. Experts, including BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes, have even warned that a “financial crisis” may be on the horizon. 60% of American plebes don’t have $1k of emergency funds. The Fed is “worried” about inflation. So Trump decides to hike energy prices via tariffs? He ain’t a fool, maybe he is trying to trigger a mini financial crisis?

XRP remains strong in a bullish pattern, suggesting a possible surge to new peaks. At the same time, SUI’s expanding network and increased user adoption are driving its price forward, with $4 being a critical support level. However, Web3Bay is a game changer, not merely a blockchain base or a payment coin, but a revolution in e-commerce. Its decentralized marketplace approach is reshaping online shopping, giving power to the users and offering unparalleled ROI. With over $1 million gathered in its presale, Web3Bay’s innovative promise is clearly catching on. Web3Bay: Revolutionizing E-Commerce with Decentralization Web3Bay (3BAY) is transforming the e-commerce landscape. It uses blockchain to create a secure, transparent environment that returns control to users. Unlike the big e-commerce players who dominate the market, Web3Bay champions decentralization, ensuring buyers and sellers manage their data and transactions directly. In the initial weeks of its presale, Web3Bay has already secured over $1 million, demonstrating strong investor trust in its groundbreaking model. With the token priced at $0.004562625 in Stage 4, interest in using blockchain to improve e-commerce transparency, security, and efficiency is clearly on the rise. Web3Bay is addressing market inefficiencies head-on. It cuts out traditional financial middlemen, reducing transaction fees and speeding up operations. Its use of smart contracts guarantees that all deals are secure, fraud-proof, and completed only when all conditions are met, which greatly enhances trust among users. More than just a new platform, Web3Bay is at the forefront of creating a quicker, fairer, and more transparent online shopping experience for all. Its early presale achievements are just a glimpse of the vast potential this innovative platform holds. XRP Price Forecast: Can the Bullish Channel Propel XRP to New Peaks? XRP remains stable in a bullish pattern on the 4-hour chart, demonstrating resilience amid market downturns. This trend hints that XRP might prepare for a significant rise if it maintains important support and resistance levels. Now trading at $3.10, XRP has proven robust, with $2.68 acting as a vital support area. This level has historically triggered strong buying interest, marking it as essential to observe. On the higher side, the $3.70 resistance stands as a tough barrier. Breaking above this could ignite a vigorous surge, possibly pushing XRP to reach new heights. For investors looking for a point to get involved, XRP’s sturdiness and upside potential offer an attractive prospect. Waiting out this consolidation period could be rewarding, particularly as the market looks for a breakout signal. Predictions suggest XRP remains poised for growth, keeping its upward trend intact. The Significance of the $4 Price Level for SUI’s Next Leap Sui (SUI), a prominent Layer 1 blockchain, mirrors Bitcoin’s explosive 2017 bull run. Like Bitcoin’s sharp climbs and subsequent plateaus, SUI’s price action indicates rising lows within an ascending channel, showcasing strong accumulation and bullish outlook. The $4 mark is crucial, harboring a significant Fair Value Gap (FVG). If SUI maintains this support, its price could soar to notable heights, like $10 or even $20, echoing Bitcoin’s historic rise. However, if it fails to keep $4, it could trigger a downturn, undermining the bullish structure and possibly leading to wider sell-offs. This positions $4 as a critical juncture for SUI’s price stability and upward momentum. Sui’s milestone of reaching 50 million accounts solidifies its position as a leading blockchain. This expansion signifies growing adoption and a strong network that draws developers and users, enhancing demand for the SUI token. Moreover, the vibrant NFT marketplace within the SUI ecosystem, with high-value collections like “Egg” and “Rootlets,” reflects active participation and liquidity. If SUI maintains its scalability and key support zones, it is poised for substantial growth, aligned with the bullish patterns across the broader crypto landscape. A Quick Overview As XRP challenges the $3.70 resistance and SUI leverages its $4 support, Web3Bay steals the spotlight by solving real-world issues in a trillion-dollar market. Its blockchain-driven e-commerce platform cuts through inefficiencies, promotes transparency, and grants users control over their data and transactions. The ongoing presale, priced at $0.004562 per token, presents a chance to achieve an impressive 6,430% ROI. Web3Bay isn’t just following market trends; it’s transforming industries, positioning it as the top investment pick of the three. For those in search of a token with tangible utility and revolutionary potential, 3BAY stands out as the clear frontrunner in the competitive crypto field of 2025.

During his second day back in office, Trump flatout said he was gonna force chair Jerome Powell into cutting rates one way or another. Ignoring him as per usual, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) last week voted unanimously to hold the federal funds rate between 4.25% and 4.5%. The decision came amid fears that inflation could spike again, driven by Trump’s own economic policies, including the tariffs he just launched and of course the immigration crackdowns. Still, Mr. Trump continues to push his economic agenda. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, just days before the Fed’s decision, he told global leaders that the U.S. economy needed lower interest rates to stay competitive. “If I disagree [with the Fed’s decision], I will let it be known,” he told reporters from the Oval on Thursday, targeting Fed Chair Jerome Powell directly, who by the way said he had absolutely no comments about the president at his post-minutes press conference, as Cryptopolitan reported . Trump’s incoming trade wars keep pressure on inflation February 1st saw chaos as the S&P 500 hit an all-time high before investors began bracing for possible fallout from rising prices. The tariffs are creating bottlenecks and adding costs for companies that rely on foreign goods as well as innocent Americans, pushing inflation higher. Wall Street is so mad at Trump right now. Investors know that if inflation doesn’t cool soon, it will certainly block further growth. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, a key measure of inflation, jumped to 2.6% in December from 2.4% in November, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. Core PCE, which strips out food and energy costs, remained steady at 2.8%—still above the Fed’s 2% target. The Fed’s rate cut pause is meant to give policymakers time to see if inflation finally starts declining. Powell holds his ground anyway Powell, who has been a consistent target of Trump’s public outlash, made it clear that the central bank won’t base its decisions on political interference. The Fed cut rates three times in late 2024 when they saw it fit to, and are now holding because they see it fit to, according to chair Powell. But Trump believes that: “I think I know interest rates much better than they do.” Trump even said during his campaign in August that the president should have a direct say in monetary policy. While this idea has been dismissed by economists and even his own people as risky, Trump continues to hint at changes that could give him more influence over the Fed’s decisions. Asked whether he believed Powell would listen to him, Trump snickered before giving a condescending “Yeah.” The confidence is typical of Trump, but Powell’s past actions suggest otherwise. The Fed chief has resisted political pressure before, and he’s doing it again, with no fear at all. But despite their differences, Powell and Trump do agree on one thing: the need for a stable U.S. economy. But their approaches couldn’t be more different. Trump wants rapid rate cuts to keep borrowing cheap and markets booming. Powell, on the other hand, is focused on keeping inflation under control without triggering a recession. The January pause could be temporary. If inflation shows signs of cooling, the Fed might consider more rate cuts later this year. But for now, Powell is playing it safe, and Trump—in spite of himself—seems to be on board.

The price is down over 25% and there was a spike below the $2.00 support zone. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.80 and $2.50 levels. The price is now trading below $2.60 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.45 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it clears the $2.50 resistance zone. XRP Price Eyes Recovery XRP price started a fresh decline below the $3.00 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined heavily below the $2.80 and $2.50 support levels. The bears even pushed it below $2.00. There was a sharp drop of over 25% and the price tested the $1.75 zone. A low was formed at $1.75 and the price is now correcting some losses. There was a move above the $2.00 level. The price surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.155 swing high to the $1.750 low. The price is now trading below $2.750 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.30 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.40 level. The next resistance is $2.450. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.45 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.155 swing high to the $1.750 low. A clear move above the $2.450 resistance might send the price toward the $2.50 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance or even $2.720 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.00. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.40 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.10 level. The next major support is near the $2.00 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.00 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $1.850 support. The next major support sits near the $1.750 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

In fact, nearly 60% of this activity is driven by the popular Solana-based meme coin platform pump.fun transactions, according to OKX’s recent report shared with CryptoPotato . Solana vs. Ethereum While Solana leads in overall transaction volume, Ethereum and its Layer 2 networks maintain a stronghold on high-value trades, particularly those exceeding $50,000. In terms of liquidity pool quality, Ethereum continues to lead, holding 10 of the top 20 positions, followed by Base with five, Arbitrum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) with two each, and Solana securing just one spot. This data from the crypto exchange highlighted Solana’s strength in retail trading, even as Ethereum remains the preferred choice for large-value transactions and deep liquidity pools. Commenting on the report’s findings, OKX Chief Innovation Officer Jason Lau said, “Decentralized Exchanges are the lifeblood of the onchain economy, embodying the core ethos of crypto through their permissionless, self-custodial, and community-driven nature. Our findings reveal how the DEX landscape has grown – with activity recently hitting all-time highs.” Decentralized derivatives are gaining traction as platforms like Hyperliquid and dYdX introduce appchain innovations aimed at achieving centralized exchange-level performance. Although spot trading volumes on decentralized exchanges still surpass derivatives trading by a factor of 10, these advancements highlight a significant shift in the market. At the same time, traditional finance (TradFi) yield instruments are making their way into DeFi, with tokenized Treasury Bills (T-Bills) and basis trading assets like USDe and USR emerging as yield-bearing base currencies. This development, according to OKX, is “fundamentally changing” the derivatives landscape by offering new opportunities for traders and ramping up capital efficiency in DeFi markets. Asia Leads in Developer Wars From the demographic front, Asia is emerging as the leading hub for blockchain development and has even surpassed Europe and North America, with 32% of the industry’s developers based in the region. OKX found that builder preferences indicate Ethereum as the dominant platform, attracting 20.8% of developers. Next up was Solana, capturing 11.2%, and Base, with 10.7% of developers. Additionally, artificial intelligence (AI) integration has become a major focus and accounted for almost 34% of developer activity. As a result, it has outpaced other sectors, such as blockchain infrastructure and decentralized finance, which accounted for 20.1% and 14.2%, respectively.

This comes in response to growing concerns about Japan’s existing tax regulations for crypto traders. According to Iolite , Kato made the announcement during a plenary session of the House of Representatives on January 31, 2025. He explained that the Financial Services Agency (FSA) would lead the review, with proposals from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on potential changes to the tax system. The review is expected to include recommendations for necessary legislative amendments. “We are discussing the matter in line with the 2025 Tax Reform Outline, and are considering the necessary legal arrangements. The Financial Services Agency will verify the system regarding crypto assets by June of this year,” he said. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, also weighed in on the matter, stressing the importance of the healthy development of Web 3.0 technologies, including cryptocurrencies. Ishiba said that crypto assets have the potential to address some of Japan’s social issues and improve productivity. He also opened up about the need for the government to ensure user protection and improve the environment for domestic crypto markets. Challenges with Japan’s Current Crypto Tax Laws Currently, Japan’s tax system requires crypto traders to report their trading profits as part of their annual income tax returns, leading to some high tax rates. Critics of the tax system argue that these high tax burdens have stifled the growth of the crypto sector in Japan. The Finance Ministry and FSA are also considering amending the Payment Services Act to include crypto as an asset class under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. This could mark a shift in how cryptocurrencies are regulated and taxed in Japan, aligning with international standards.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ASIA|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-03 04:33:35

On Monday morning in Asia, the Korea Premium Index rose to 9.7%, marking its highest since April 14, 2024. According to CryptoQuant data , the premium is down to 8.2% at press time. The “kimchi premium” refers to a price gap between the South Korean exchanges and foreign markets. It may indicate a stronger buying pressure among Korean retail investors. While Bitcoin’s price is tanking below $92k and Ethereum is down 20%, the Korea Premium Index is up as the South Korean market is difficult for foreign investors to enter. Bitcoin: Korea Premium Index (Source: CryptoQuant) According to a report by The Block, an analyst at Presto Research, Min Jung, said, “The Kimchi Premium typically rises in bull markets when Korean investors bid higher, but it can also spike during periods of panic selling.” Jung predicted the kimchi premium would remain elevated so long as American investors maintained their selling activities. He added “However, historically, the Kimchi Premium has averaged around 5%.

On-chain data suggests whale investors are buying the dip. How could SHIB price react in the week ahead? Shiba Inu Price Plunges 30% amid Weekend Sell-off Shiba Inu (SHIB) price stabilized at $0.000014 on Monday, February 2, following a sharp 32% decline over the weekend. This marks SHIB’s lowest price in five months, dating back to September 2024. The sudden downturn comes amid broader market instability fueled by the latest trade war developments involving Trump-led tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada . Macroeconomic concerns have triggered a wave of risk-off sentiment, prompting investors to offload speculative assets, particularly low-liquidity altcoins like SHIB. Social media reports suggest that U.S. consumers are preparing for inflation-driven price hikes. In response, investors appear to be shifting capital away from volatile memecoins in favor of more stable assets. Shiba Inu price action, Feb 3, 2025 | Source: TradingView Interestingly, SHIB price has been hit harder than other major altcoins , with its 30% decline surpassing losses seen in Solana (SOL), Chainlink (LINK), and Avalanche (AVAX), which remained under 20%. This suggests that SHIB’s downturn is not solely tied to macroeconomic events but rather a result of multiple pre-existing bearish catalysts that were already weighing on the token before the latest market-wide sell-off. Whales Back in Action as Large Transactions Jump to 4.3 Trillion While the market sentiment remains overwhelmingly bearish, whale investors appear to be making strategic moves amid the dip. One key indicator pointing to this is the sharp increase in Large Transactions, a metric tracked by blockchain data analytics platform, IntoTheBlock , monitoring transfers from wallets holding at least 0.1% of SHIB’s total circulating supply. These transactions often serve as a proxy for spotting odd whale activity, as large holders react to significant market events. Shiba Inu Large Transactions vs. SHIB price | IntoTheBlock As shown in the chart, SHIB’s Large Transactions volume stood at just 1.5 trillion on January 31. However, as SHIB’s price plummeted 32% over the weekend, this figure surged to 4.3 trillion SHIB by the end of February 2. This nearly 200% increase in whale transaction volume suggests that institutional and large-scale investors may be capitalizing on the price dip to accumulate more SHIB at lower prices. Historically, spikes in whale accumulation during price crashes have acted as a stabilizing factor for SHIB, as these high-volume transactions absorb excess selling pressure. If this trend continues, we could see SHIB’s price finding support around the $0.000014 level, preventing further declines. Shiba Inu Price Forecast: $0.000010 breakdown signals emerge despite whale Support Shiba Inu has been one of the biggest losers in the current market correction, with a 32% weekend decline bringing its price to a five-month low. While macroeconomic fears and retail capitulation have contributed to the sell-off, whale investors have significantly increased their accumulation, signaling potential price stabilization. In this bullish Shiba Inu price forecast scenario, Elliott Wave analysis suggests SHIB could be completing a corrective ABC pattern, with the latest drop marking the end of Wave C. This phase often precedes a new impulsive wave to the upside, particularly if whale accumulation sustains. The recent low near $0.000013 aligns with a major support zone, historically serving as a reversal point. If SHIB manages to reclaim $0.000015, bullish momentum could build, potentially driving a breakout toward $0.000018 in the short term. The MACD histogram, while still negative, is showing early signs of bearish momentum exhaustion, with the signal line curving upward. This suggests that selling pressure might be fading, and a bullish crossover could occur if SHIB stabilizes above key moving averages. Shiba Inu Price Forecast | SHIBUSD Nonetheless, SHIB remains vulnerable to further downside risks, particularly if U.S. trade tensions escalate further or broader crypto market sentiment deteriorates. Traders should closely monitor whale transaction trends and key support levels, such as $0.000014 and $0.000013, for potential signs of recovery or further breakdown. If the bearish narrative plays out, SHIB’s price action could extend losses below $0.000013, confirming a deeper Wave C breakdown. The 30% drop over the past two days signals a severe bearish impulse, and failure to hold $0.000012 could open the door for further declines toward $0.000010. The MACD’s negative trajectory and widening histogram bars reinforce the risk of continued selling pressure, suggesting weak demand despite whale accumulation. Moreover, a breach below $0.000010 would invalidate the potential for an immediate bullish reversal, exposing SHIB to a prolonged downtrend. In this case, traders should watch the $0.0000095 level as the last line of defense before capitulation accelerates. Without a steady inflow of new demand, SHIB could enter an extended consolidation phase.

The sharp rise in probability follows a renewed import tariff war between the U.S. and its top trading partners, Canada, Mexico and China and concerns it will add to inflation in the global economy, making it difficult for central banks, including the Fed, to cut interest rates. “The recent tariffs imposed by Trump, including 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada and 10% on Chinese goods, are likely to lead to increased inflation, which could dampen investor sentiment in crypto markets,"" Derive said in an email. Andre Dragosch, head of Europe at Bitwise, said on X, that tariffs are sending shock waves via USD strngth & contraction in global money supply. Bitcoin has already dropped 11% to $93,700 in four days, CoinDesk data shows. ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, fell below $2,200 early Monday, the lowest since Aug. 5. BTC appears on track to complete a double top reversal pattern , which would open the doors for a drop to $75,000. Recently, Arthur Hayes, chief investment officer of Maelstrom and former BitMEX CEO, said that BTC will first drop to around $75,000 before chalking out a bigger bull run. The broader outlook, however, remains constructive, according to Derive. ""We’re seeing a number of active spot ETF filings for assets like DOGE, SOL, XRP, and LTC from major players like Bitwise and Grayscale. If the SEC approves these, it will signal greater legitimacy for the digital asset industry and trigger more capital inflows, potentially driving prices upward,"" Derive told CoinDesk, noting the momentum for creating strategic BTC reserves in several U.S. states. Dragosch expects the Fed to eventually step in, putting a floor under asset prices. ""At some point, Fed will need to reignite QE to curb the Dollar from rising further and to stop a continued tightening in financial conditions & deceleration in global growth,"" Bitwise's Dragosch noted.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Options|On-chain Data,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|TRADING|ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-03 04:50:24

The second-biggest crypto by market cap plunged 26.53% on Monday in Asia, falling to $2,135, according to Bloomberg data. It was Ether’s steepest fall in nearly four years, beating its May 2021 disaster. Bitcoin took a 8% dip to $92,000, dragging every major token down with it. Solana (SOL) lost 13% and is trading at $184, and XRP crashed by 28% in Asia, plunging to $1.82, way below its $3 high from just a month ago, according to data from CoinGecko. Trump’s infamous memecoin (TRUMP), which had seen some early hype post-election, crashed 12%, proving once again that meme coins are as fragile as they sound. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20), which tracks for top 20 crypto assets, slumped nearly 21%. Data from Coinglass confirmed just how bloody the day was. Within 12 hours, traders watched $1.3 billion in long positions get liquidated. Ether holders suffered the worst, with $400 million gone in an instant. Bitcoin wasn’t far behind, with $300 million in long BTC positions obliterated. Source: Coinglass This whole panic was triggered by self-proclaimed ‘crypto president’ Donald Trump’s announcement over the weekend that the US would impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. Traders (sensitive as ever) saw the decision as a sign of global economic instability, and so markets reacted fast. An op-ed from The Wall Street Journal didn’t hold back, calling the tariff escalation “the Dumbest Trade War in History.” But Trump fired back on Truth Social, doubling down on his stance. “Anybody that’s against tariffs, including the Fake News Wall Street Journal and Hedge Funds, is only against them because these people or entities are controlled by China,” he wrote. He claimed the tariffs were necessary and hinted that they should’ve never been replaced by the income tax system back in 1913. “The response to tariffs has been FANTASTIC!” he added . But interestingly enough, according to Spot on Chain, the Trump family crypto project World Liberty has lost $51.7 million or about 21%, from its $242.77 million crypto investment since the tariff announcement. Among them of course is Ether, which lost $36.7 million (-24.4%), WBTC which tumbled by 12.1% losing $8 million, and ENA which lost $2.05 million (-43.7%). Meanwhile, according to Parsec, in the past twenty-four hours, the lending liquidation volume on the DeFi chain exceeded $310 million, the highest point since early August 2024, of which ETH collateral liquidation volume reached $181 million, followed by wBTC at $49.2 million. Dogecoin, backed by Elon Musk, lost 14% on Monday, continuing its free fall to 45% below the high it hit after Trump’s election win in December. Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), and Chainlink (LINK) all posted double-digit losses, each dropping more than 10%.

Deaton said that the SEC’s case against Ripple went beyond just targeting the company—it also claimed that XRP itself was a security, ignoring 75 years of legal precedent. Deaton has represented over 75,000 XRP holders in the ongoing case between Ripple and SEC. Many in the crypto world hoped this was a one-time issue, but when similar lawsuits were filed against platforms like Coinbase and Kraken, it became clear the issue was bigger than just Ripple. Then came “Chokepoint 2.0,” a push by regulators to clamp down on crypto, along with battles from figures like Caitlin Long and Custodia Bank against the Federal Reserve. Although the recent departure of Gary Gensler from the SEC might suggest an end to some of these fights, Deaton warns that many battles are still ongoing. One of the biggest concerns now is a legal case against Roman Storm, the developer of Tornado Cash, and two developers of the Samourai Wallet. These cases involve Section 1960 of the U.S. Code, which deals with unlicensed money transmitting businesses. The crypto community had long believed that developers who don’t directly control users’ funds were not considered money transmitters, but the Department of Justice (DOJ) disagrees. “I hope to help raise awareness of just how significant these cases are. If Roman Storm is found guilty and loses a single day of his freedom, imagine the chilling effect it would have on the DeFi industry,” he wrote. While there’s still debate over issues like spot ETFs and whether some tokens are securities, the real danger to crypto comes from these legal cases targeting DeFi.

Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Dogecoin have all taken a hit, with some dropping by nearly 20%. But what’s causing this sudden crash? Let’s dive into the key reasons behind the turmoil. Trump’s Tariff War Sparks Fear One of the biggest reasons behind the market drop is the recent trade war sparked by former U.S. President Donald Trump. Declaring a national emergency under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), Trump imposed strict tariff rules, 25% on Mexico and Canada and 10% on Chinese imports. pic.twitter.com/SWZtSm6NMX — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 1, 2025 The market reacted instantly, fearing higher prices, rising inflation, and economic instability. As a result, U.S. stock indexes fell sharply, dragging the crypto market down with them. Bitcoin Network Activity Slows Down Aside from external economic factors, Bitcoin’s network activity has declined significantly. Data from CryptoQuant shows that the mempool is nearly empty. This means fewer transactions are taking place, which is unusual for Bitcoin. Additionally, Bitcoin transaction fees have fallen to just 1 sat/vB, signaling low demand for block space. This is the lowest level of activity recorded since March 2024. Crypto Sees $2.18 Billion in Liquidations The market has also seen a wave of liquidations, with over $2.18 billion worth of crypto positions being wiped out in a day, affecting more than 715,000 traders. Long traders suffered the most, losing $1.85 billion, while short traders lost around $334 million. The largest single liquidation happened on Binance, where one trader lost $25.64 million in a single trade. Stronger U.S. Dollar Adds Pressure Another factor weighing down Bitcoin is the strengthening U.S. dollar. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has surged to 108.50, while the 10-year Treasury yield has risen above 4.54%. Historically, Bitcoin moves in the opposite direction of the dollar and Treasury yields, meaning a stronger dollar often leads to lower BTC prices. Bitcoin’s Critical Support Level Currently, Bitcoin is struggling to hold above $93,000 . If it falls below the psychological support level of $90,000, analysts warn that further declines could be ahead. Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has fallen to 38, shifting from Neutral to Fear.

The next major resistance is near the $0.270 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3416 swing high to the $0.20 low. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.270 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. A close above the $0.270 resistance might send the price toward the $0.2880 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.30 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.320.

How Low Can ETH Price Drop? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market, led by Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), shed more than $500 billion in net valuation since Friday to hover about $3.16 trillion on Monday, February 3, during the early Asian session. Following the heavy deleveraging in the crypto market, more than $2.1 billion was liquidated in the past 24 hours, higher than the FTX and COVID-19-induced crypto crashes. Bitcoin price has dropped more than 10 percent in the past two weeks to retest a crucial support level above $91k. Ethereum price shed more than 30 percent in the past two weeks to retest the multi-month support level of around $2,136. Top Reasons Why Crypto Market Crashed Today The cryptocurrency market has been reacting to the onset of Donald Trump’s second term in the past few weeks. After receiving significant hype in the months leading to Trump’s second inauguration in mid-January, the crypto market has experienced a sell-the-event scenario in the past two weeks. Notably, US President Donald Trump launched trade wars with Canada, Mexico, and China, thus triggering retaliation from the affected nations. As a result, the crypto market followed major stock indexes led by the Dow Futures. Ethereum Whales Capitulate The notable capitulation in Ethereum price was heavily fueled by whales’ panic selling.

It is the lowest level markets have seen this year, wiping out more than $400 billion in less than a day as the sell-off accelerated during the Monday morning Asian trading session, sending them back to mid-November levels. Additionally, more than 700,000 traders were liquidated to the tune of $2.2 billion over the past 24 hours, according to Coinglass liquidation data. “Damn, I just realized that was the biggest liquidation event in the history of crypto,” commented Reflexivity Research co-founder Will Clemente. Altcoins Bleed Double Digits After months at green greed levels, the Bitcoin fear and greed index has fallen back to ‘fear’ at 44 as February hopium evaporates. BTC crashed around 7.5% from just over $100,000 to hit an intraday low of $91,300 on Monday morning. It recovered to reclaim $93,000 and remains within its range-bound channel at the time of writing. The same cannot be said for altcoins, which have all been obliterated. Ethereum has been smashed 25% in a plunge below $2,400, its lowest level since October. This pushed the ETH/BTC ratio to a multi-year low of 0.023, according to Tradingview. ETH settled at around $2,500 and is almost 50% down from its all-time high in 2021. This is insane: Ethereum just fell -37% in 60 hours since the trade war headlines mid-day on Friday. pic.twitter.com/6UoIIinJqP — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) February 3, 2025 Ripple’s XRP also got hammered hard, falling more than 26% in a matter of hours in a plummet to under $2 before a slight recovery. Solana (SOL) returned to the $180 level after losing 14%, Binance Coin (BNB) lost 16% in a decline to $550, while Dogecoin (DOGE) dumped 24%, crashing back to $0.22. The pain didn’t end there as there were larger losses for Cardano (ADA), which crashed almost 30% in a fall to $0.60; Chainlink (LINK) was crushed by 23%, falling to $17, while Avalanche (AVAX) bled 25% in a fall to $23. Some of the lower-cap altcoins had wiped out almost a year’s worth of gains in a few hours. Trump’s War on Trade Donald Trump’s imposition of trade tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China over the weekend has rattled markets across the globe, with US stock futures deep in the red on Monday morning and Asia bourses getting battered. “Bitcoin is mainly a risk asset. Tariffs this aggressive are very negative for risk assets. And the economy will take a hit,” commented economist Alex Krüger. “The hope for crypto is that it has already dropped a lot in anticipation, considerably reducing the downside. Particularly so for altcoins, which have been demolished.” “I’m torn between the entire market putting a major local bottom on Monday or BTC re-testing the bottom of the range ($90k),” he added. “Trump’s tariff war is impacting the whole market,” Caroline Bowler, chief executive officer of BTC Markets, told Bloomberg. “Concerns about trade wars and stagflation, triggering recessions, are cascading across altcoins and Bitcoin,” she added.

While some analysts suggest these policies could drive Bitcoin prices higher in the long run by weakening the US dollar, the immediate impact has been a sharp sell-off across crypto assets. Over the past weekend, the market saw over $1 billion in liquidations as investors reacted to growing concerns over inflation, interest rates, and macroeconomic uncertainty. As the situation unfolds, market participants are closely watching for further developments that could shape the future trajectory of digital assets. Trump’s Trade Tariffs Could Drive Bitcoin Prices Higher, Despite Immediate Market Shock US President Donald Trump’s latest round of trade tariffs has sparked intense debates regarding the future of the US dollar and its influence on global markets. According to Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at financial services firm BitWise, these tariffs may have a significant long-term effect on Bitcoin (BTC) prices, potentially driving them “violently higher.” Park argues that Trump’s trade policies are engineered to devalue the US dollar in international markets, aiming to correct trade imbalances and make US exports more competitive. This strategy, he asserts, echoes historical precedents, such as the Plaza Accord of 1985—a multilateral agreement between the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, and the UK to weaken the dollar. If a similar scenario unfolds, the resulting economic shifts could bolster Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against currency depreciation. One of the key reasons Park believes Bitcoin will benefit from Trump’s tariffs is the inflationary pressure they may exert on the global economy. As tariffs lead to higher costs for imported goods, inflation could accelerate both in the US and among its major trading partners. The impact will be particularly severe for countries heavily reliant on trade with the United States, as they may face weakened national currencies and a loss of purchasing power. As the value of fiat currencies erodes, people worldwide may increasingly turn to alternative store-of-value assets, such as Bitcoin, to preserve their wealth. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and fixed supply make it an attractive option in times of economic uncertainty and inflationary risk. Park’s theory suggests that a broader shift toward Bitcoin adoption could emerge as investors and citizens seek refuge from fiat currency instability. While gold has traditionally played this role, Bitcoin’s digital nature and ease of transfer make it a compelling modern alternative. Despite Park’s long-term bullish outlook for Bitcoin, the short-term market reaction to Trump’s tariffs has been anything but positive. Following the announcement of new tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico, cryptocurrency markets faced a sharp downturn, with Bitcoin shedding approximately 7.2% over the past week. Data from CoinMarketCap reveals that altcoins bore the brunt of the market selloff. Ethereum (ETH) plummeted by 11.6%, Solana (SOL) suffered a 19.3% decline, and XRP (XRP) dropped by 16.6%. The immediate fear among investors is that escalating trade tensions will lead to a risk-off environment, pushing capital away from speculative assets like cryptocurrencies and into traditional safe-haven assets such as US government securities and gold. The cryptocurrency downturn aligns with a strengthening US dollar. The US Dollar Currency Index (DXY), which measures the dollar’s performance against other major fiat currencies, has been on an upward trajectory since October 2024. Although the index experienced a slight pullback in January 2025, it has regained momentum in early February, suggesting continued confidence in the greenback despite inflationary risks. A stronger US dollar poses a challenge for Bitcoin and other risk assets in the short term. Rising US Treasury yields further compound this effect, as investors shift capital from riskier markets into government-backed securities, which offer safer returns in uncertain economic conditions. Will Bitcoin’s Long-Term Potential Outweigh Short-Term Uncertainty? While the immediate market reaction suggests bearish sentiment toward Bitcoin, long-term macroeconomic trends could support Park’s thesis. If Trump’s tariffs successfully weaken the US dollar over time, Bitcoin could emerge as a primary beneficiary, attracting investors looking to hedge against currency debasement and inflation. Historical data suggests that Bitcoin has performed well during periods of economic turmoil and currency devaluation. The asset’s finite supply and decentralized nature provide a level of protection against traditional monetary policies, making it a viable alternative in times of financial instability. However, traders and investors must navigate the complexities of short-term market volatility. While Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains promising under Park’s framework, the near-term risk-off environment and a stronger US dollar could lead to further price declines before any sustained upward movement materializes. Trump’s trade tariffs have introduced new uncertainties into global financial markets, leading to immediate volatility in Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency space. While analysts like Jeff Park foresee a scenario in which Bitcoin’s price could rise significantly due to long-term currency debasement, short-term market movements remain unpredictable. As the US dollar strengthens and investors flock to safer assets, Bitcoin faces headwinds in the immediate term. However, should the anticipated weakening of the dollar materialize in the coming months or years, Bitcoin could see renewed interest as a hedge against economic instability—potentially setting the stage for the next major price surge. Crypto Market Sees Over $1 Billion in Liquidations Following Trump’s Tariff Announcement The cryptocurrency market experienced a dramatic sell-off, with over $1 billion in long and short liquidations over the weekend. The market turbulence followed US President Donald Trump’s announcement of impending tariffs on imported goods, a move that triggered widespread risk-asset sell-offs. According to Coinglass data , more than 450,000 traders were liquidated in 24 hours, amounting to $1.79 billion in total. Long liquidations made up the majority at approximately $1.57 billion, while short liquidations accounted for $219 million. “The market sell-off was triggered by the White House’s announcement on Saturday that it will impose tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China,” said Min Jung, a research analyst at Presto Research, in a statement. Trump’s plan includes a 25% tariff on imported goods from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on Canadian energy and goods from China, set to take effect Tuesday. Canada has already announced a retaliatory 25% counter-tariff, while similar responses are expected from Mexico and China. The escalating trade tensions have led many analysts to describe the situation as an emerging ”trade war.” “This reignited concerns over inflation, as additional tariffs could further pressure prices, weighing on risk assets, including crypto,” Jung noted. Kronos Research CEO Hank Huang echoed these concerns, stating that investors fear the inflationary impact of these tariffs could force the Federal Reserve to maintain high interest rates for longer than anticipated. The sharp downturn in crypto prices was exacerbated by liquidations of overleveraged positions. Rachael Lucas, a crypto analyst at BTC Markets, pointed out that the lack of Federal Reserve stimulus and persistently high interest rates have disproportionately impacted altcoins, leading to deeper losses. Uncertainty Over Trump’s Crypto Stance The latest downturn also raises questions about the broader market sentiment regarding Trump’s policies. Optimism had initially surged among crypto investors following Trump’s reelection, but as macroeconomic fears mount, that optimism is starting to fade. Analysts note that since his inauguration, the US President has not made any significant statements regarding cryptocurrency policy. “So far, the major crypto-related headline has been about digital asset stockpiles, with no concrete policy details emerging,” Jung explained. With Trump’s trade policies still evolving, further volatility in the crypto market is anticipated. BTC Markets’ Lucas suggested that any additional escalation in tariffs or changes in Federal Reserve policy could significantly impact investor sentiment. As investors navigate these uncertain conditions, the crypto market remains highly sensitive to macroeconomic developments, with traders closely watching both trade policy and Federal Reserve decisions in the coming weeks.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-03 05:30:00

Investors who realized the potential of Ripple (XRP) earlier enjoyed phenomenal returns, transforming pennies into riches. Blockchain specialists and financial professionals now think that a new altcoin called Remittix can present a comparable fantastic potential. Learning from Ripple ’s Success Few people were aware of Ripple’s (XRP) full potential when it first began. Sceptics wrote it off as just another digital token when it was first priced below $0.01 . But at its height, its goal of using blockchain technology to transform international payments caused a price spike above $3 . Early investors had transformative benefits. The most important lesson? Cryptocurrencies that are widely used and have practical applications frequently see exponential growth. Ripple ‘s success was largely driven by its partnerships with banks and financial institutions, which streamlined international transactions with speed and efficiency. It proved that blockchain technology could go beyond speculation and solve real-world financial challenges, but its centralized nature and regulatory scrutiny have posed limitations. Why Remittix Is the New Altcoin to Watch Remittix is addressing a trillion-dollar issue rather than being just another new altcoin . Remittix goes beyond Ripple’s optimization of banking transactions by providing financial inclusion to millions of people globally. Its strong real-world use case positions it as the best cryptocurrency investment for forward-thinking investors. Remittix is attempting to address the fact that billions of people around the world are unable to access traditional banking by providing a decentralized financial network that enables simple transfers, affordable transactions and secure online banking choices. To address that, Remittix is providing a decentralized financial network that enables simple transfers, low-cost transactions and secure online banking choices. Remittix makes financial transactions easier for the average user, in contrast to traditional crypto assets that have trouble being adopted because of their volatility or complicated usage. Without requiring a conventional bank account, users can use Remittix to transform payments into local currency, receive them promptly with almost no fees and even use the money for necessary services. This type of tangible influence is what makes Remittix a cryptocurrency revolution. Many cryptocurrencies struggle to acquire popularity due to legal barriers, high transaction costs, and limited banking access. This coin addresses these issues directly, which makes it one of the best cryptocurrency investments for those who wish to do more than just speculate. This new altcoin also promotes financial inclusivity and the core tenets of cryptocurrencies: decentralization, anonymity and security. It guarantees that users are independent of other parties and have complete control over their finances by eliminating middlemen. The fees associated with traditional banking are infamously high, particularly when making payments abroad. Remittix uses blockchain efficiency to reduce fees to negligible amounts, making transfers affordable for anyone. This coin is a digital financial service that can be accessed on a mobile device, enabling individuals in remote locations to participate in the global economy. Currently, about 1.7 billion individuals globally lack access to banking services. This new coin offers users financial sovereignty in contrast to existing banking systems, which impose stringent rules and limitations. A business owner in Africa, a freelancer in Asia or a gig worker in Latin America, for example, can now receive payments worldwide without any problems or excessive costs. As the financial industry shifts to digital assets, investors are always searching for the next great thing. Remittix is the best cryptocurrency investment of our time because of its unmatched usefulness, potential for widespread adoption, and solution-driven methodology. Remittix has given those who missed out on Ripple’s initial success another opportunity. It fills important gaps in the global economy with its emphasis on financial inclusion and smooth banking integration. Now is the ideal time to get involved because early investors may see large returns as adoption increases. Conclusion Similar to the early days of Ripple , Remittix presents a special opportunity for investors by tackling financial inclusion and lowering remittance costs. It is well-positioned for substantial development because of its safe, decentralized platform and practical use cases. As Remittix becomes more widely used, early investors may experience significant returns. Don’t pass up this opportunity to revolutionize the cryptocurrency industry.

XRP, dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano’s ADA fell more than 25% to reverse all of the gains since December, reaching pre-U.S. election levels from early November. Most majors are down 40-50% in the past month, data shows, making it one of the steepest dives in recent years. Overall market capitalization fell 12%, the worst fall in over a year, while the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) lost 10%. Bitcoin (BTC) dropped 6%. Futures markets reflected these losses with traders of ether (ETH)-tracked products losing over $600 million in the past 24 hours, majorly in early Asian hours. XRP and DOGE bets lost a cumulative $150 million, altcoin-tracked products lost $138 million and ether-tracked futures lost $84 million. Total liquidations crossed $2.2 billion, the highest this year and among the biggest such levels in the past year. The largest single liquidation order happened on Binance, a tether-margined ETH trade valued at $25 million.Some traders cautioned of further losses as the week progressed.“While BTC has fallen over 8% over the weekend it was Ethereum that shocked the market with a straight 20% decline and it's behaving like an altcoin on the downside without the benefit of long-term institutional inflows and a lack of near-term catalysts,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Massive long futures liquidation was observed over the weekend with over 2 billion in futures stop outs over the past 24 hours, the sharpest liquidation event in crypto history. Markets are likely to be in a full risk off mode as we await the US equity market open,” Fan added. Liquidation happens when a trader has insufficient funds to keep a leveraged trade open. The crypto market's high volatility means liquidations are a common occurrence, although major events such as Monday’s can provide actionable cues for further market sentiment or positioning. The market correction stems from a trade war that U.S. President Donald Trump has seemingly ignited with 25% tariffs being placed on Canada and Mexico. The move has caused immediate disruptions in North American trade relations, with both countries threatening retaliatory tariffs. Financial markets are concerned about the potential for increased costs on goods, impacting industries from automotive to agriculture. The interconnected economies of these nations suggest that this tariff imposition could lead to a broader economic slowdown, threatening jobs and raising costs for consumers.",Markets|XRP|DOGE|Markets,EN,0,0,MARKET|DOGE|XRP|BTC|ADA,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-03 05:31:09

Although that was a painful crash of its own, it turned out to be just the beginning. BTC kept plunging on Sunday but remained at around $97,000-$98,000. However, the Monday morning Asian trading session has not been kind to the asset as it plunged further to $91,500, which became its lowest price point since the January 13 massacre. This means that the largest cryptocurrency had lost over ten grand within 24 hours or so. Moreover, it went down by $15,000 since Friday’s top of over $106,000. The violence, though, has spread a lot more among the altcoins. There’s almost no alt sitting with a single-digit price drop, aside from Solana (-8%). The rest, such as ETH (-20%), XRP (-23%), BNB (-15%), DOGE (-24%), ADA (-25%), LINK (-21%), AVAX (-24%), and XLM (-20%), have shed billions of their own market caps, while the total crypto market cap is down by over $400 billion .

A total of 500 million XRP was unlocked from escrow, with 100 million XRP, valued at approximately $283.89 million, being released first, and another 400 million XRP, worth about $1.13 billion, unlocked from escrow shortly after. A few hours before these transactions, Ripple locked substantial amounts back into escrow. A total of 700 million XRP was locked back, with 430 million XRP, valued at $1.27 billion locked first, and 270 million XRP, worth approximately $796.96 million secured shortly after. Ripple unlocked 500 million XRP instead of its usual 1 billion XRP unlock. This mirrors escrow unlock errors from early 2024, which plagued the company’s escrow transactions for four months. However, Ripple often unlocks an additional 500 million later in the month to complete its escrow commitment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Whale Movements in the XRP Market Beyond escrow transactions, Whale Alert detected multiple large XRP transfers involving unknown wallets and Ripple. One of the largest movements involved 430 million XRP, valued at approximately $1.27 billion, transferred from an unknown wallet to Ripple. This was preceded by another major transfer of 200 million XRP, valued at $588.76 million. Ripple also received a transfer of 299.99 million XRP, worth around $882.64 million, and a transfer of 70 million XRP, worth approximately $206.5 million, from unknown wallets. These large inflows to Ripple suggest potential liquidity management or preparations for operational use. They might also involve some of Ripple’s many On-demand Liquidity (ODL) partners worldwide or similar institutional partners that utilize XRP. What’s Next for XRP? Approximately 2.2 billion XRP tokens moved in under 24 hours, drawing attention from the broader market to the XRP ecosystem. However, this has not helped the digital asset’s price, as a wider market downturn sent it below $3, pushing it to $2.51, its lowest level since mid-January. The digital asset has recovered slightly and is now trading at $2.58. Despite the decline, whales have been preparing for a big move since late 2024, and many market participants are still confident that a swift recovery is coming.

Although it has bounced off to above $2 now, there’s a warning sign that suggests its run could have been halted, at least for now. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView The chart above paints a highly painful picture. XRP neared its all-time high on January 17 and peaked at $3.39, which was just 1% away from the 2018 record. Although it failed there, it mostly maintained its valuation above $3 for the next couple of weeks. That all changed on Sunday morning when it dumped from $3.07 to $2.7 at first before it took another beating to $2.5. Nevertheless, it jumped back 10% before the Monday morning massacre brought back the pain. Within hours, Ripple’s token plunged from $2.7 to under $1.8 (on Bitstamp), which became its lowest price level since late November when Gary Gensler announced his departure from the SEC. XRP has managed to recover some of the losses, at least for now, and sits above $2.2 as of press time. Yet, this is still a 24% daily drop, which has driven its market capitalization to well below $130 billion. Consequently, USDT, with a market cap of $140 billion, has once again surpassed XRP as the third-largest crypto asset. What’s even more worrying for XRP is the fact that whales have reversed their strategy. As reported yesterday, these large market participants had offloaded over 70 million XRP in 96 hours. However, further data from Ali Martinez shows that they have continued to sell off their tokens by dumping another 130 million in a day over the weekend. Whales play a significant role in the crypto market due to their ability to buy or sell substantial portions of an asset. They went on a massive buying spree ahead and during XRP’s rally but seem to have changed their tune, which could spell even more trouble for the asset.

Although Utah is the latest state to propose the Bitcoin reserve bill, Satoshi Action Fund CEO Dennis Porter believes it could still be the first to establish one, citing its short legislative calendar and strong political momentum. He said: “It’s either sink or swim in 45 days; no other state has a faster calendar, and no one else has the political momentum and willpower to get it done.” – Dennis Porter Utah House Economic Development Committee voted in favor of the digital asset reserve bill on January 28 In a recent interview with Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, Porter said that every bill passed by the Utah House Economic Development Committee has become law. He argued that the committee had already passed a recommendation for Utah’s H.B. 230 Blockchain and Digital Innovation Amendments to be approved, meaning it could soon pass into law. The Committee passed the bill by an 8-1 vote on Tuesday, January 28. If the bill is approved, state funds will be invested in digital assets. State treasurers can even allocate up to 5% of each account’s total funds into eligible digital assets with a market value exceeding $50 billion. Aside from Porter, State Representative Jordan Teuscher is optimistic that Utah’s digital asset bill will get approved quickly. In an X post on January 21, Teuscher stated that the state will continue leading the country in blockchain and digital innovation, claiming it would be the first to establish a digital reserve. Thrilled to join with @Dennis_Porter_ to announce HB230 which will allow the state to invest in digital assets. While Utah is the 11th state to introduce similar legislation, we will be the first to pass it. Utah continues to lead the nation in blockchain and digital innovation! https://t.co/mBTt12UaQw — Jordan Teuscher (@jordanteuscher) January 21, 2025 Spencer Cox, Utah’s governor, has already expressed his openness to cryptocurrency by signing the blockchain and digital innovation task force into law. If the reserve bill successfully passes the Senate, he will likely sign it into law. Wyoming has made progress in earning bipartisan support for the reserve bill Utah is the 11th state to introduce the Bitcoin reserve bill and the latest to do so. However, Porter believes the state count could rise to 15 in 2025 as lawmakers compete to have theirs approved first. Porter expects states to benefit from Bitcoin reserves, saying they could protect their purchasing power and continue paying for state programs without raising taxes. In her interview with Porter, Senator Cynthia Lummis, when asked about which reserves could get approved first, state-level reserves or the federal stockpile, stated that they are likely to have their proposals approved first and experience the benefits sooner since they are the “incubators of innovation” Like Porter, she believes Bitcoin reserves will greatly profit states, saying they could help right the wrongs of older generations and clear the debt burden they created. She added that Wyoming’s reserve bill has had “good success” in securing bipartisan support, though it is not quite there yet. Wyoming’s digital asset bill is past the committee approval stage and only has to get the House’s approval before it’s signed into law.

The crypto veterans and the proponents believed Bitcoin and the other cryptos would thrive under his rule, but with stricter impositions, the crypto markets are facing extreme repercussions, which may push the market participants into a deep sea of uncertainty and fear. Bitcoin, which was on its way to mark a new ATH, drained heavily to form the local button close to $91,000. Besides, the altcoins also plunged with a very huge margin, letting off huge bearish waves across the crypto markets. What Went Wrong? Why Crypto Markets Plunged Hard? Investors foresaw the strengthening of the crypto markets as soon as Donald Trump won the elections, which kept the markets elevated. During the past week, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imports of goods from Canada and Mexico and 10% on China. Moreover, he has announced additional tariffs on Chinese goods and imported cars. pic.twitter.com/SWZtSm6NMX — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 1, 2025 With this, the rates are expected to increase for Americans, leading to a rise in inflation and layoffs. This is the prime reason for a billion-long liquidation during the past weekend, wherein more than 700,000 traders were liquidated, with the total liquidations raised over $2 billion. Apart from this, the DXY index, which measures the strength of the U.S. dollar, surged above 109.7 while the Treasury yield rose to 4.54%, which is not good for the BTC price and the entire crypto space. What’s Next for the Crypto Markets? Will Bitcoin Price Rise Back to $100,000? With the institutions remaining uncertain about the next market trends, the fate of the spot ETF remains hung. Besides, some reports suggest hedge funds are betting on a stock market correction and the data from Goldman Sachs indicates a massive rise in the short positions of the U.S.-based stocks. More importantly, the latest pullback has helped the BTC price complete a massive bearish pattern, which is circulating bearish waves across the crypto markets. The weekly chart of Bitcoin suggests the price is testing the neckline of a massive double-top or ‘M-shape’ pattern. The bulls are trying hard to keep up the levels above the crucial support range between $91,408 and $92,285. Meanwhile, the weekly MACD underwent a bearish crossover while the Bull Market Support Band (BMSB) and Direct Movement Index (DMI) are heading for a similar price action. On the other hand, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) face a bearish reversal and are plunging towards the lower range. Hence, the overall sentiments for the Bitcoin price and the crypto markets have turned negative and hence the traders also seem to be staying away until the market conditions stabilize.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|BTC|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-03 05:58:44

Will Global Changes Force a Policy Shift?,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-tax-in-india-hits-70-will-global-changes-force-a-policy-shift/,"The post Crypto Tax in India Hits 70%? Will Global Changes Force a Policy Shift? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News India has had a rocky relationship with cryptocurrency. Since 2013, the country’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has warned people about the risks of digital assets. In 2018, things got worse when the RBI banned banks from working with crypto businesses, making it almost impossible for exchanges to operate. But in 2020, India’s Supreme Court removed the ban, giving crypto a second chance. Even after that, the government remained strict. It introduced a heavy 30% tax on crypto profits, making trading very expensive. Recently, a new 70% tax was announced on undisclosed crypto gains. In short, it means, if they lose money, they can’t use those losses to reduce their tax burden. Also, if someone makes crypto transactions worth more than ₹50,000 in a year, they must pay extra taxes. Many believe these harsh rules are meant to discourage people from using cryptocurrency. Some government officials even compare crypto to gambling, saying it is only used for illegal activities. Interestingly despite so many challenges data suggests, that India’s crypto market was worth $2.6 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow to $13.9 billion by 2033, growing at 18.48% per year. Trump’s Crypto Push Could Change Everything Following international pressure, reports suggest that India may rethink fast-tracking its crypto framework. The buzz came after, Donald Trump had signed an executive order to explore digital assets at a national level. His administration is even considering a government-owned stockpile of cryptocurrencies. This move could push other countries to act fast before they fall behind in the global crypto race. India May Be Forced to Rethink Its Crypto Rules According to the Reuters reports , India is now reviewing its crypto policy. Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth recently said that digital assets “don’t believe in borders,” hinting that India might have to change its stance. If other major countries start adopting crypto, India may have no choice but to follow. Right now, the Indian government is more focused on its own central bank digital currency (CBDC). Former RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das called CBDCs “the future of currency,” and India has already launched a digital rupee pilot program. The RBI is also working on a cross-border payment system where CBDCs could be used for transactions between countries. The Indian government is willing to adopt crypto, but they are also pushing for unified crypto regulations to make the digital assets streamlined, and it also reduces the risk factors. But for now, strict rules and high taxes make it difficult for the industry to grow.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-03 05:58:59

A Fresh Entrant With Massive Potential: As a newly launched coin, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors the chance to enter at the ground floor. Its early-stage momentum makes it one of the most promising opportunities to achieve life-changing gains. 2.

These accounts took in a staggering 560 million Dogecoins, just shy of $40 million. This buying frenzy came on the heels of a pretty intense sell-off in $DOGE, and it’s definitely something we want to keep our eyes on. The question is, of course, why are they doing this? And could we see a kind of “reclaimed interest” in $DOGE? Or is this just a set-up for a local top? Whales have accumulated 560 million #Dogecoin $DOGE in the past week following an intense sell-off, signaling renewed interest from large holders! pic.twitter.com/ObAVfqC9xi — Ali (@ali_charts) January 31, 2025 Potential Market Shift for Dogecoin Big investors, commonly known as whales, influence the price movements of cryptocurrencies. For Dogecoin, the recent accumulation of over half a billion DOGE coins into whale wallets might mean that these investors are bracing for a possible price rally. But this is not a certain outcome. We could also interpret it to mean that, having just sold off a significant portion of their holdings, Dogecoin’s whales are taking the opportunity to buy back into the market at lower prices, perhaps figuring that the price trend is stabilizing after having been in freefall. Even with this outcome being a positive one, there are still some warning signs for investors in Dogecoin. The price of Dogecoin, much like other cryptocurrencies, could really take a hit if the broader market takes a turn for the worse. Analysts have expressed worry over what could happen if DOGE breaks below its $0.31 support level; a move like that could very well trigger a correction that would push the price down toward $0.20 and would have all the markings of a “whales taking profits and re-positioning” kind of dip, which in Dogecoin’s case could set off a temporary bearish trend. Is #Dogecoin following $PEPE ? If so, a breakdown below $0.31 could trigger a correction toward $0.20 for $DOGE ! pic.twitter.com/fuKfgUwPNI — Ali (@ali_charts) February 1, 2025 Grayscale’s Move to Offer Dogecoin Exposure Besides the endeavors of large investors, another significant development could direct more institutional focus toward Dogecoin. Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest crypto asset manager, has just launched the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust. This move gives high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors a straightforward way to gain exposure to $DOGE, the native coin of the Dogecoin network. The trust is now open for daily subscription. This means eligible investors can now buy into the trust and indirectly hold Dogecoin. And do you know what they don’t have to do to hold it? That’s right. They don’t have to buy it directly on exchanges. @Grayscale Investments announces the launch of Grayscale @Dogecoin Trust Grayscale Dogecoin Trust goes live, offers investors the opportunity to gain exposure to $DOGE , the native coin of the Dogecoin network. The Trust is now open for daily subscription by eligible… pic.twitter.com/t3cJVa17Ol — CryptoDep #StandWithUkraine (@Crypto_Dep) January 31, 2025 For Dogecoin, this launch represents a major milestone. It potentially paves the way for far more institutional investment in the asset than we have seen thus far. Unlike Grayscale’s other trusted digital currency products, which hold only Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Zcash, the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust could help make the Dogecoin Dream come a little closer to reality. The Grayscale Dogecoin Trust’s inception substantiates Dogecoin’s legitimacy as a serious contender in the space. Yet it operates within an asset class more emblematic of the Wild West than Wall Street. Although the trust offers a more structured way for investors to gain direct exposure to DOGE, the trust’s underlying asset, the Dogecoin network, is still very much in play; and it too is characterized as a “serious asset” by Grayscale’s parent company, Digital Currency Group. Conclusion: A Critical Time for Dogecoin With Grayscale’s trust offering new ways to invest, the meme coin is at a make-or-break moment. But for those who own it, the news isn’t all bad. Accumulating a significantly large amount of the coins may, in fact, signal that the next big move for Dogecoin is to the upside. This may be enhanced, too, by the 8th anniversary of the coin, which will occur in December 2023. Investors should keep a close watch on both the price action and the critical support that Dogecoin is at right now. If it drops below that, it could be a key signal that more downside is coming. As interest from institutions rises and large investors take action, coming months should provide greater clarity on whether Dogecoin is carving out a place for itself in the overall cryptocurrency market or whether it could be poised for another stagnation or decline in price. Anyone considering an investment in this extremely volatile and not particularly well-understood asset would do well to proceed with caution and to keep a close watch over the Dogecoin situation.

39856496,https://nulltx.com/?p=143495,1738562964,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,MUSKIT Memecoin Surges 200% Amid Speculation of Musk Family Backing,https://nulltx.com/muskit-memecoin-surges-200-amid-speculation-of-musk-family-backing/,"Elon Musk’s father, Errol Musk, is working on something that’s got the cryptocurrency market really buzzing. It’s called Just Musk It (MUSKIT), and it’s a memecoin linked to none other than the Musk family. Reports suggest that Errol is in the process of raising $200 million through the digital currency, which will supposedly go toward the establishment of the Musk Institute, a for-profit think tank that will, in Errol’s words, “do what no one else is doing.” This disclosure has sent a jolt of enthusiasm among investors and caused speculation to bubble over. The result has been an eye-popping 200% increase in the price of MUSKIT. The memecoin’s market cap has doubled to $35.4 million, and its price has reached $0.03432. Trading volume, meanwhile, has surged by an unbelievable 7,000%. That means there is now a strong market interest and, it seems, a much stronger confidence in MUSKIT’s price appreciation potential. MUSKIT’s Meteoric Rise: Driven by Musk Family Ties The crypto realm has been affected for quite some time by the Musk family, with Elon Musk’s tweets and public utterances almost always resulting in major price fluctuations for digital assets such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Now, it seems, that influence might be extending into the realm of governance tokens, with Errol Musk reportedly backing a new digital currency called MUSKIT. It was recently reported by Cointelegraph that Errol Musk’s plan to raise $200 million through MUSKIT could partially fund the Musk Institute, which is expected to do advanced engineering and focus on technological breakthroughs of the sort that don’t happen every day. Many people who look at cryptocurrency connections for a living saw this and assumed we were just seeing a “funding the family business” story. The sharp increase in price and huge trading volume show that the market is reacting very positively to the idea of the Musk family being involved in this prospect. Even though Elon Musk hasn’t said anything about the project, we think it’s quite possible that rumors or indirect involvement from him could really light a fire under MUSKIT’s price. Memecoin Mania: How MUSKIT Is Defying Expectations Traditionally, memecoins are seen as speculative assets that experience wild price swings based on hype and trends on social media. But MUSKIT seems to be staking out a different, possibly more sustainable, position by aligning itself with a tech-driven initiative instead of relying just on internet virality. MUSKIT’s market cap has recently doubled in a very short time, and that shows how sentiment plays a big role in memecoin rallies. The token’s trading volume surged 7000% in that same short time, and both retail and institutional investors are starting to take notice. If this keeps up, MUSKIT could make its way into the holy grail of the best memecoins in the market. The possible success of MUSKIT will likely rely on the Musk Institute taking shape as intended and on the use of funds raised through the memecoin. If the think tank somehow manages to pull off what it claims will be a series of “world-changing projects,” MUSKIT might evolve beyond being a speculative token and become something with real application—application, in this case, associated with one of blockchain’s many oft-discussed “use cases.” Will MUSKIT Follow in Dogecoin’s Footsteps? What began as a joke turned into a major player in the crypto world. Dogecoin got to where it is largely because of Elon Musk’s high-profile, uh, support. Now that MUSKIT appears to be linked to Errol Musk, many are asking if it, too, will chart a course to the crypto stars. Musk might have clearly been involved in Dogecoin’s rise, but it’s not at all evident what’s going on with MUSKIT. If Errol Musk is a real cheerleader for the project and is updating us on the progress of the Musk Institute, then you could surmise that translating Earth invaders into another medium could mean further adoption of and appreciation in value for the token. Follow-through on this point isn’t guaranteed, though. If all of this translates into a real slog for the Musk Institute with no further updates coming, the hype we’ve been discussing becomes rather meaningless. Conclusion The MUSKIT memecoin is ascendant; it’s as if it has been shot out of a cannon. The immediate reason for this is the frenzied speculation that it has actual, if indirect, support from the Musk family. Adding to this price surge is the equally ambitious, if currently vague, plans for the Musk Institute to put the money to actual use. With a price up 200%, market cap of $35.4 million, and trading volume up an incredible 7,000%, this token has everyone’s attention, at least for the moment. The next phase of MUSKIT’s journey will depend closely on whether the Musk Institute comes into being and if the token’s recent burst of popularity can last. Will the next chapter of its story turn out to be a Dogecoin-like success? Or will it ruefully fizzle out and be into another short-lived memecoin? For now, though, the buzz around MUSKIT is nothing if not palpable. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The Sharp Drop Hits Altcoins Harder Major digital assets including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana, and XRP have faced significant sell-offs as traders assess global economic risks. Altcoins in general have seen a 20 percent collapse in the past 24 hours. BTC fell 8% in early trading hours in Asia to around $91,200 before making a slight recovery to $94,000 by afternoon in Hong Kong. ETH took a harder hit, falling to $2,100 levels. While SOL was dropping to $177, XRP fell by 27% to $1.70. The decline dwarfed even the sharp downturn during the Covid pandemic, and experts say it could be the biggest decline in history. Trump's Trade War Sparks Crypto Market Selloff The sharp correction came after Trump announced that he would impose 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, reigniting fears of a global trade war. The move triggered widespread anxiety among investors not only in traditional markets but also in the crypto sector. World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto project with ties to Trump’s family, saw its January crypto investments drop by 20%, according to SpotOnChain data. Massive Liquidations Increase Market Volatility Data from CoinGlass shows that over $2.2 billion worth of liquidations occurred in the last 24 hours. $400 million was wiped out in long ETH positions alone. Additionally, $300 million was liquidated in long BTC positions.

Nevertheless, XRP finished off the month of January at an all-time high of $3.0359, a definitive show of market confidence in the long-term potential of this asset. The large investor sell-off has put some short-term price pressure on the token. Still, with much-talked-about “fundamentals,” XRP is said to remain on the track for mass adoption and increased utility in the years to come.

This stunning close has revived retail and institutional interest in XRP, indicative of renewed vigor for the cryptocurrency not just in the XRP-verse but also in the broader cryptocurrency market. Concurrently, the chances of a Ripple XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) being sanctioned this year are increasing to new highs. Experts are now estimating an 82% probability of approval, a number that indicates a high level of optimism for the asset’s future. Were the ETF to be given the green light, it could unleash a wave of institutional investment that would almost assuredly send XRP’s price soaring. If an XRP ETF gains approval, it would constitute a significant advancement for Ripple and the users of its products, stamping XRP with the quality of being an asset that can be confidently held by institutions and regulated in a clear manner. More broadly, the approval of an XRP ETF would be a bullish sign for the acceptance of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology by the financial system.

Ripple’s vision of making XRP a global reserve currency and an intermediary to facilitate the seamless exchange of currencies is starting to materialize. One of the most meaningful events in the recent past is Japan’s decision to adopt XRP as part of its national financial framework. Every bank in Japan will start utilizing Ripple’s XRP cryptocurrency next week, reports say—that’s the monumental step Ripple just took on its way to becoming the financial system’s next big thing. And if this series of events carries as much significance and weight as it seems to, we might want to ask why XRP, and not Bitcoin, is headed to Japan’s banks. BOOOOOOOOOOOOM #RIPPLE is ranked #1 for CBDC’s #XRP to become a world reserve currency and a bridge to interoperate with other currencies. Mass adoption is absolutely happening through the #XRPL . pic.twitter.com/9CwlF2RN8H — XRP Avengers (@XRP_Avengers) February 1, 2025 Japan’s move also underscores Ripple’s burgeoning prominence in the worldwide financial arena. The decision of the banks in that country to use XRP for their operations could prompt other nations and financial entities to do likewise, especially with the rising clamor for swifter, less costly, and more efficient means of engaging in cross-border transactions. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM! Japan's financial landscape, indicating that every bank in the country will begin utilizing Ripple's $XRP cryptocurrency next week. pic.twitter.com/KIGkczC7et — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) February 1, 2025 Whale Sell-Off and the Challenges Ahead for XRP Even though there have been good reports about the growth of XRP, some investors have become uneasy about recent price swings. Over the past 96 hours, however, over 70 million XRP tokens were dumped by whale holders, and this is downward pressure on the price. Large holders tend to sell when prices are high, and these kinds of sales can make the market more volatile. XRP’s fundamentals, by contrast, are relatively unscathed. A strong close in January and an ETF approval probability that’s either increased or just became clearer point to a long-term bullish picture. The market’s natural ebb and flow makes it laughable to consider whale-induced shakedowns a viable short-selling thesis. In the coming weeks, XRP’s price may keep fluctuating, much like it has for the past several months, under the influence of certain large players in the market and those who would sell off their holdings. But the trend overall for XRP seems to be in a very good place, thanks to a number of partnerships, quite a bit of adoption, and a big uptick in interest from institutions. The Road Ahead for Ripple and XRP The next several months will be crucial for XRP as it moves through an increasingly fast-moving market. Two potential developments—the approval of an XRP ETF in the U.S. and Japan’s adoption of Ripple’s technology—are major milestones that could lead to something truly revolutionary: the global adoption of XRP as a bridge currency for payments that instantly cross any border. If that happens, “I think you’re going to see a pretty substantial increase in value,” said Tim Davis, an Ashtabula-based investment advisor who keeps an eye on Ripple and XRP. The present instability in the market may give investors the chance to buy XRP at lower prices before the first major step in the digital asset’s journey—to financial services—to the real world is taken. As the network grows and new use cases for XRP emerge, its Bone-Structure remains solid, giving no hint of the Break-Up Death Spiral, which HSBC’s Mason Bullard suggests is “the biggest risk to the long-term viability of any digital currency.” In the end, XRP’s odyssey has just commenced. Given an ETF’s imminent approval, the likely transformation of the supposed currency into something we can spend, and the burgeoning interest in XRP from institutions, the next wave of growth for XRP seems to be upon us. And this may well be the wave that captures the currency’s full potential. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

As DeFi activity and ETF adoption expand, analysts are eyeing a potential rally to $11,000. At the same time, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is attracting whale attention because it could address Bitcoin’s biggest limitations. With near-instant transactions, lower fees, and Ethereum compatibility, this Layer-2 solution could redefine Bitcoin’s efficiency and real-world use cases. Here’s the latest on both projects. Can Ethereum (ETH) Skyrocket to $11,000 as Market Momentum and DeFi Growth Accelerate? Ethereum (ETH) is currently priced at $3,212.18, which reflects a 2.4% gain over the past 24 hours. With a circulating supply of 120.52 million ETH, the asset continues to be one of the most actively traded and influential cryptocurrencies. Ethereum has been building strong momentum. It recently reached around $3,900 — a 66% surge in the past month. Several key factors are causing this growth. Institutional interest continues to rise, with BlackRock acquiring over $230 million worth of ETH. Ethereum remains the backbone of the DeFi ecosystem, with more than $70 billion in total value locked. IAmRich, a crypto analyst on X, predicts that Ethereum (ETH) could reach $11,000 in 2025. How PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Could Transform Bitcoin With Lightning-Fast Transactions, Lower Fees, and Seamless Ethereum Integration Bitcoin remains the most dominant cryptocurrency, but it still struggles with slow transactions, high fees, and network congestion. While other blockchains, like Ethereum and Solana, have introduced faster and more scalable solutions, Bitcoin has lagged behind in efficiency. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is looking to change that. As a Layer-2 solution built for Bitcoin, it could boost transaction speed, lower costs, and improve usability, which would make Bitcoin more practical for everyday use. PlutoChain operates alongside Bitcoin, which could help reduce congestion and streamline transaction processing. Instead of waiting 10 minutes for a single confirmation, PlutoChain offers block times of just two seconds by leveraging Layer-2 technology. This dramatic speed increase could make microtransactions and daily payments more feasible and open up new possibilities for Bitcoin beyond being just a store of value. Additionally, PlutoChain’s lower fees could remove financial barriers and make Bitcoin more accessible for users and businesses. Beyond just improving speed and cost-efficiency, PlutoChain could also enhance Bitcoin’s interoperability. It is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which means Ethereum-based applications — DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and AI-driven projects — could seamlessly integrate with Bitcoin. This cross-chain compatibility could unlock new use cases and significantly expand Bitcoin’s real-world applications. During its testing phase, PlutoChain efficiently handled 43,200 transactions in a single day without any interruptions, which demonstrates its ability to support high-volume activity. Security is a top priority for PlutoChain. The platform has undergone audits by SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi to ensure network resilience. It also performs routine code reviews and stress tests to maintain stability and prevent vulnerabilities. With its focus on instant transactions, reduced fees, and cross-chain compatibility, PlutoChain has the potential to revolutionize Bitcoin by making it faster, more scalable, and ready for broader adoption. The Takeaway Increasing institutional investment, DeFi expansion and technical upgrades all contribute to Ethereum’s outlook this year. At the same time, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could play a critical role in Bitcoin’s evolution. By offering lightning-fast transactions, lower fees, and Ethereum compatibility, it has the potential to make Bitcoin more efficient, scalable, and adaptable for real-world use. ————- This article is purely informational and should not be interpreted as financial advice.

Notably, SHIB price slumped to as low as the $0.000012 level intraday, whereas DOGE price plunged to the $0.2 level, sparking investor concerns. A stockpile of factors appears to be driving the current slumping action in the mentioned meme coins, including investor uncertainty and massive liquidations amid broader developments. Here’s Why Dogecoin & Shiba Inu Price Are Slumping Over 25% Intraday Mentioned below are some vital factors that appear to be fueling the leading meme coins ‘ crash of over 25% in a day. Trade War Speculations Trigger Crypto Market Crash Amid Trump’s New Tariffs The global crypto market witnessed a crash recently as U.S. President Donald Trump announced new import tariffs, triggering speculations of a trade war. CoinGape reported that the 47th president announced new increased import tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China, sending shockwaves across global markets. In turn, even the crypto sector took a hit, with experts speculating over a looming trade war that can affect global markets. Simultaneously, despite Trump’s pro-crypto standpoint, the new tariff mover has conversely brought about a market-wide crash. Bitcoin dipped to as low as $91K, with altcoins bearing further heat. Even the meme coin sector followed the bearish trend, with DOGE and SHIB prices in a slump. Dogecoin & Shiba Inu Price Take Hear Amid Heightened Liquidations Simultaneously, massive liquidations amid the broader market uncertainty have added pressure on the meme coins’ prices. Coinglass data indicated that Dogecoin saw $87.12 million worth of liquidations in the past 24 hours. Whereas, Shiba Inu saw nearly $7.5 million worth of liquidations intraday. These massive liquidations, bringing selling pressure to the asset, further align with the current price crash. Futures OI On Decline Signal Reduced Market Interest Further, Coinglass data has revealed that DOGE futures OI was down by 33% intraday, reaching $2.44 billion. Simultaneously, SHIB futures OI plummeted by a remarkable 46% intraday, reaching $155.01 million. Altogether, this data underscored diminishing market activity surrounding the meme coins, reflecting investor uncertainty amid broader market trends. This statistic is also one of the reasons for a price drop. How Are The Tokens Currently Performing? At the time of reporting, Shiba Inu price witnessed a 22% crash and is resting at $0.00001368. However, the coin’s intraday low and high were $0.0000123 and $0.00001764, underscoring a loss of more than 25% in a day. Notably, SHIB’s waning movement further falls in line with a nearly 100% decline in its intraday burn rate, as per the latest burn data. Similarly, DOGE price followed, plunging 21% to $0.2394 intraday. Its 24-hour bottom and peak were $0.2117 and $0.3061, respectively. Market watchers continue to stay cautious surrounding future movements, reflecting uncertainty amid recent trends.

The losses raise serious concerns about the security of the major US-based cryptocurrency exchange. On January 31, blockchain analyst ZachXBT exposed another large-scale theft , showing how scammers continue to exploit Coinbase customers. In this case, a user lost 110 cbBTC—Coinbase’s wrapped version of Bitcoin—after falling for a fraudulent scheme. The stolen crypto was quickly laundered through various instant exchanges, making recovery nearly impossible. The attackers swapped, bridged, and mixed the funds across multiple platforms before combining them with other stolen assets on Ethereum. ZachXBT explained that this case is part of a much larger pattern, estimating that at least $150 million has been stolen from Coinbase users in the past year. The actual figure could be significantly higher, as his estimate is based only on independently verified incidents. “Coinbase has a serious fraud problem,” he stated, adding that he continues to uncover more cases regularly. Coinbase has yet to respond publicly to the latest theft. However, scams where criminals impersonate Coinbase support have become widespread. These fraudsters use phishing emails, fake customer service calls, and other deceptive tactics to steal login credentials and drain wallets. Once inside an account, they rapidly transfer and conceal stolen funds. Similar incidents have occurred before. In December, a Coinbase Commerce vendor lost $15.9 million, with no action taken by the exchange’s anti-money laundering system. In October 2024, an imposter stole $6.5 million through a phishing scam, pretending to be part of Coinbase’s support team. ZachXBT emphasized that Coinbase users frequently reach out to him after falling victim to these attacks. He criticized the company’s lack of response, claiming that no other major exchange faces such a widespread issue. He accused Coinbase’s leadership of being out of touch, hiding behind internal policies rather than addressing security threats and helping victims. As the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, Coinbase is under growing pressure to improve its fraud prevention measures. If scams continue unchecked, they could further damage trust in centralized exchanges, emphasizing the urgent need for stronger security protections.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-03 06:55:39

Stellar’s XLM has made some corrections in the past week but the price is still within a buying range as it remains neutral-bullish on the daily timeframe. Meanwhile, things are getting ugly on the hourly chart as the trend turned bearish. The price is now looking weak amid rising supply. The closest level for selling right now lies at $0.32 which was held as support last December. Whether this support will hold or not is yet unknown. But looking at the setup from a technical standpoint, the level is likely to break significantly as soon as the market tests it. If that happens, we can expect a huge drop to retest the $0.162 level that broke as resistance during the November 2024 surge. Such a fallout could lead to a major market reset before picking up again. Sustaining bullish momentum, it must stay above the December support to form a new bullish (double-bottom) pattern before bouncing back. A break above $0.64 should set the stage for another upward move daily. XLM’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Losing December’s $0.32 support could sink the price to a low of $0.27, followed by the $0.189 level. The lower level to consider for a broader correction is $0.115. It may even test the $0.1 level before resuming buying. The current drop was initiated from $0.51. If the bulls pushed back to reclaim this resistance level, the next line of interest would be $0.63. A cross above this level should set the market up for a new rally to $0.7.

She argues that Bitcoin’s value growth could significantly reduce the debt over the next two decades. Lummis believes this reserve would correct financial mistakes made by past generations and relieve the economic strain on younger Americans. She sees Bitcoin as a tool that can offset debt while reinforcing the US dollar as the world’s dominant currency. In a recent interview, Lummis explained that a Bitcoin reserve could potentially cut the debt in half. She pointed out that Bitcoin has historically grown at an annual rate of about 55%, though she expects this to slow over time, dropping to 45%, 35%, 25%, and so on. Even with this decline, she believes that holding Bitcoin now could help pay off a significant portion of the US debt in 20 years. Lummis referenced Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has promoted a similar strategy. If a large enough reserve is established, she suggests it could eliminate the national debt entirely. She views Bitcoin as the only asset with the potential to grow at such a scale and reverse decades of financial mismanagement. Last July, Lummis introduced the BITCOIN Act, proposing that the US government acquire 1 million Bitcoin as part of its financial strategy. She recently became the first chair of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets , further cementing her leadership in crypto policy. Momentum for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is growing at the state level. According to Dennis Porter, founder of the Satoshi Action Fund, 15 states have expressed public support for the idea. At least 11 states have introduced bills to establish such a reserve, and Arizona and Utah have already advanced their proposals through legislative committees. Public advocacy for Bitcoin as part of a national reserve is also increasing. Porter noted that over 3,300 letters have been sent to Members of Congress urging them to recognize Bitcoin as a key strategic asset. This push gained further attention after former President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a national digital asset stockpile, though it did not specifically name Bitcoin. Lummis remains confident that a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could be the key to restoring financial stability in the US. She views it as a critical step toward reducing debt while ensuring the dollar remains the world’s leading currency.",,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-03 06:58:31

While major tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) , and Ethereum (ETH) have strong use cases, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN sets itself apart as the most exciting opportunity for exponential value creation. Here’s why this token is dominating the conversation. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Stands Out 1. Limited Supply Creates Scarcity With a total supply capped at 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN ensures scarcity that fuels long-term value. Unlike BTC and LTC, which have slower growth due to high circulation, this token’s deflationary model guarantees increasing demand. 2. Exclusive Availability Unlike UNI and DOT, which are available on multiple exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity gives early adopters an edge and keeps the token’s growth stable and controlled. 3. Unparalleled Growth Potential Analysts project that THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN could deliver returns of up to 2,000%, thanks to its early-stage momentum and community-driven development. While Bitcoin and Polkadot are well-established, they can’t match the rapid trajectory of this groundbreaking token. 4. Investor Demand at Record Levels Raising $1,000,000 within minutes of its presale launch, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven its appeal. Investors recognize its potential to redefine the market, driving interest far beyond what UNI, BTC, or LTC have recently seen. How THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Compares Uniswap (UNI): A strong DeFi platform but lacks the exclusivity and demand-driving scarcity of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Polkadot (DOT): Reliable for interoperability but cannot match the early-stage explosive growth seen here. Bitcoin (BTC): A store of value, yet its market maturity limits growth opportunities compared to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Litecoin (LTC): Known for efficiency, but it hasn’t captured the market excitement that this new token has.

Last week , Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said that policymakers didn’t need “to be in a hurry” to cut rates while maintaining them at 4.25% to 4.5%. He also said it would be helpful if there were a “greater regulatory apparatus” around crypto while advising banks not to debank crypto customers.

Bitcoin crashed to $91,500 during the Monday morning Asian trading session, its lowest level for three weeks. However, the altcoins were getting absolutely obliterated, with the entire top twenty seeing double-digit losses as the selloff accelerated. Ethereum had wiped out three months of gains, falling to pre-US election levels below $2,500, while XRP fell a massive 27% back to $2 in a matter of hours. Meanwhile, Dogecoin, Cardano, Chainlink, Stellar, Avalanche, Sui, Toncoin, and many others were bleeding out by more than 20% on the day.

Although some might consider an estimate of $70 unrealistic, it is not just based on wishful thinking. The potential for more institutions to adopt and clearer regulations, which experts see as broader market trends, are key factors driving this increase.

A stronghold there could bring a bounce back! Since the massive explosion in the first quarter of the year 2024, Ton’s price has remained well above $4.45. However, several attempts to slip below this price level have proven abortive as it holds as crucial support. But following the latest bearish setup, this support might get bridged any moment from now as the price trades around it for the fourth time. A breakdown from there should set the stage for a major loss in the mid-term capable of causing a 50% drop to refill the February 2024 gap. Such a drop will confirm the bearish (double-top) pattern forming on the weekly timeframe. This could bring a serious negative sentiment in the market, although a buyback is expected once the gap is refilled at $2.2. Considering the latest sell signal, there’s no room for the bulls. If by any chance they manage to defend the crucial support well, we can expect a short bounce before resuming bearish at full speed. Nonetheless, the bears are suggested to win the battle. TON’s Key Level to Watch Source: Tradingview The main key level to watch for a breakdown is $4. A further extension of the selling pressure could drive the price to the $3.32 level and lower. While there’s no room for buying at the moment, we may see a short bounce to $5 if the bulls react strongly to the latest drop. Meanwhile, the resistance above this price level is $5.66, followed by $6.5 and $7.2.

They believe Bitcoin’s past growth outperforms traditional investments like stocks, despite its volatility. Many parents view Bitcoin as a way to protect their savings from economic uncertainty. While some use it to replace traditional savings plans entirely, others see it as a diversification strategy. They believe their children will have time to handle market ups and downs before needing tuition funds. “If you’re saving for your kids, add Bitcoin to the portfolio. Buying $10-$100 of Bitcoin per month over 18 years will set your kids up for an excellent life. It will massively outperform the rest of the portfolio,” wrote Rajat Soni, a well-known financial expert, on X (formerly Twitter). Bitcoin’s price surge has boosted investor confidence. This year, it reached an all-time high of nearly $110,000—a massive 500% increase from its 2022 low of under $20,000. Supporters believe its growth is far from over, fueling more adoption from both individuals and institutions. However, Bitcoin-based savings have drawbacks. While Bitcoin may bring higher returns, parents choosing it over 529 plans lose access to tax advantages, including tax-free withdrawals for educational costs. Bitcoin adoption is expanding beyond individual investors . In the past year, institutional demand has skyrocketed, with more than 70 publicly traded companies now holding over 600,000 BTC. This trend signals rising confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a valuable financial asset. Political shifts have also influenced Bitcoin’s growth. Formerly skeptical, President Donald Trump has now become a strong supporter, pushing for a national Bitcoin reserve. His stance has fueled global interest, with countries like the Czech Republic and Hong Kong exploring their own Bitcoin holdings. Experts argue that Bitcoin’s decentralized structure, fixed supply, and worldwide accessibility make it a powerful alternative to traditional investments. Travis Kling, founder of Ikigai Asset Management, sees Bitcoin as a hedge against central bank policies, stating: “Eventually, you come to Bitcoin and you can squint a little bit and actually put together a cogent argument that Bitcoin would be a better collateral foundation than Treasuries.” Kling explained that Bitcoin is designed to absorb much of the world’s money supply growth. This could make it a stronger financial asset than fiat-based investments. While still volatile, Kling expects Bitcoin to become more stable and widely used over the next decade. By 2035, he predicts its market cap could reach $15 trillion, with an annual trading volume of $200 trillion. If this happens, Bitcoin could become a superior financial asset compared to US Treasury bonds.",,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-03 07:02:13

On Saturday, the country purchased another 5 BTC , bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to approximately 6,055 BTC, valued at over $606 million. These acquisitions align with El Salvador’s long-term commitment to Bitcoin, even as it modifies policies to comply with a $1.4 billion loan agreement with the IMF. Since adopting Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, the country has consistently increased its holdings. However, to meet the IMF’s requirements, the government has adjusted its Bitcoin policies, making acceptance optional for businesses, removing tax payments in BTC, and phasing out the state-backed Chivo wallet. The IMF has frequently raised concerns about El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption, citing potential financial stability risks. Despite these policy changes, the government remains committed to its broader Bitcoin strategy. Last December, Stacy Herbert, director of the National Bitcoin Office, hinted at an accelerated Bitcoin acquisition plan, alongside initiatives to expand Bitcoin education and training within the public sector. Herbert reaffirmed this position earlier this year, stating, “El Salvador will continue buying bitcoin (at possibly an accelerated pace AND at a discounted price) for its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” El Salvador’s strong support for Bitcoin has attracted significant interest from major crypto firms. Stablecoin issuer Tether recently moved its headquarters to the country, praising its crypto-friendly regulatory environment under President Nayib Bukele . Shortly after, Bukele encouraged Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski to consider relocating his company to El Salvador as well. Despite regulatory adjustments, El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption remains a key part of its economic strategy. The country continues to strengthen its position in the global crypto space while attracting major industry players seeking a favorable regulatory climate.",,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-03 07:05:20

The trial used ZKSync’s Validium mode, allowing fractional gold purchases with secure and private transactions. This move highlights the increasing adoption of blockchain by traditional financial institutions for asset tokenization. On January 31, ZKSync confirmed that UBS, which manages $5.7 trillion in assets, is exploring blockchain to simplify gold investments. The test enables Swiss customers to buy physical gold through a blockchain system that prioritizes security , efficiency, and privacy. UBS Key4 Gold offers retail investors the ability to purchase fractional gold shares, benefiting from real-time pricing, strong liquidity, and secure storage. The platform runs on the UBS Gold Network, a permissionless blockchain that connects vaults, liquidity providers, and distributors. To enhance efficiency, UBS used ZKSync’s Validium mode—a zero-knowledge rollup that boosts scalability by keeping data off-chain. As part of the trial, the bank deployed smart contracts on the Validium testnet to simulate the UBS Gold Network. These contracts allowed gold token issuance and transaction processing while maintaining security. “This proof-of-concept reflects UBS’ commitment to using blockchain to improve financial services and advance its digital asset strategy. I firmly believe the future of finance will happen on-chain,” stated Alex Gluchowski, the inventor of ZKSync. The testnet also improved privacy, ensuring that participants could only see their own transactions while keeping verification systems intact. Additionally, it enabled stablecoin integration with Ethereum, making gold token purchases more affordable and scalable. UBS’ blockchain test is part of a growing trend among financial institutions exploring blockchain technology. The bank has previously experimented with tokenization, launching an Ethereum-based money market investment fund. UBS Digital Assets Lead Christoph Puhr emphasized that tokenized securities have enormous potential, but scalability, privacy, and interoperability remain challenges. He noted that ZKSync’s proof-of-concept demonstrated how Layer-2 networks and zero-knowledge technology can help address these issues. “This is another example of how UBS works with tech providers to stay at the cutting edge of innovation. Our test with ZKSync showed that Layer 2 networks and zero-knowledge technology could solve these challenges,” Puhr explained. ZKSync co-inventor Alex Gluchowski reinforced this idea, stating that these initiatives prove that finance is moving on-chain. He believes zero-knowledge technology will drive innovation, creating a strong foundation for tokenized assets and accelerating Web3 adoption.",,EN,0,0,FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-03 07:08:33

This project is breaking new ground by combining the typical meme coin hype with an exciting Play-to-Earn (P2E) game element. Not only does BTFD Coin tap into the viral meme coin culture, but it’s also offering something more—a genuine, engaging experience for holders. The ongoing presale has raised over $5.9 million, with more than 68 billion coins sold, and the buzz around this coin continues to grow. The key to BTFD Coin’s success lies in its ability to merge the world of gaming with meme coin culture.

Its distinctive branding, centred around a rebellious mog (a slang term for a cool cat), strikes a chord with meme lovers looking for a fun yet potentially lucrative investment.

The coin plays off this theme to create an engaging community where pet lovers and meme enthusiasts alike can rally around a shared love for internet humour and cryptocurrency. What sets Cat In a Dog’s World apart from other meme coins is its focus on community-driven growth and the sense of belonging it offers.

For anyone looking for a bit of fun and a potentially rewarding investment, Cat In a Dog’s World offers a great combination of entertainment and passive income opportunities.

A mix of fresh U.S. tariffs, weak liquidity, and panic selling wiped over $2 billion from the market in the last 24 hours, according to data from Coinglass. Amid the chaos, Bitcoin ( BTC ) price dropped nearly 6% to around $91,200 before bouncing back slightly, but altcoins took an even harder hit. Liquidation heatmap after President Donald Trump announced tariffs | Source: Coinglass Ethereum ( ETH ) tanked 18%, XRP ( XRP ) was the biggest loser with a 20% drop, and Solana ( SOL ) fell 8% as the total market cap sank nearly 12% to $3.15 trillion.

The tariffs won’t lead to much productivity shock or inflation shock for the U.S. – market will recover soon. — Daniel Yan (@_D_Y_A_N) February 3, 2025 Matrixport co-founder Daniel Yan called it “another typical weak Monday,” blaming Asia markets for their knee-jerk reaction to bad news.

Santiment data shows traders are stepping back. One user analyzing aggregated sentiment noted, “Talks of buying the dip have calmed down. Big targets like $110K-120K for Bitcoin are getting less attention.” Despite the chaos, Bitwise’s head of alpha strategies Jeff Park believes tariffs are part of a much bigger game. He argues that the U.S. is looking for a way to weaken the dollar without crashing its ability to borrow cheaply — a kind of “Plaza Accord 2.0.” This is the only thing you need to read about tariffs to understand Bitcoin for 2025. This is undoubtedly my highest conviction macro trade for the year: Plaza Accord 2.0 is coming.

With a weaker dollar, lower U.S. rates, and global economic uncertainty, Bitcoin could be heading “higher, violently faster,” Park wrote in a Feb. 3 post on X.

Although the market has yet to witness massive rallies since the swearing-in, forecasters think that top altcoins like Dogecoin and Cardano values will surge in the coming weeks. While Dogecoin and Cardano’s market activity is booming, Elluminex (ELX), a presale star, is breaking barriers in the DeFi space. The Elluminex project, which brings DeFi features to the vast TON network is seen as a key player in the growing DeFi industry with predictors anticipating exponential growth on launching. Blockchain Baller Bullish On Dogecoin, Forecasts $0.36-$0.40 Price Range While many expected the Dogecoin (DOGE) price to surge when President Donald Trump confirmed the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the price movement has not been as swift as anticipated. However, crypto analyst Blockchain Baller thinks that Dogecoin crypto is primed for a reversal after sweeping liquidity at the lows. The forecasters expects the Dogecoin crypto to move upward towards the $0.36-$0.40 range. Meanwhile, Ali Martinez observed that whales accumulated over 460M DOGE tokens in the recent market dip, suggesting that a massive rally might be on the way. CoinMarketCap data shows that Dogecoin price has increased by 7% in the past 24 hours, signaling a bullish move. Looking at Dogecoin key oscillators at Tradingview , the VWMA (10) and Hull Moving Average (9) are flashing sell signals, while the rest remain neutral. Coincodex , in their Dogecoin price prediction, forecast the meme coin price to rise to $1 in the next 90 days. Cardano Coin Receives Positive Outlook From Ali Charts Although Cardano (ADA) is one of the top players in the crypto industry, ranking among the top 10 cryptos in CoinMarketCap , the popular altcoin has yet to replicate the success witnessed in the 2021 bull season. Having gained 9% in the past 24 hours, Cardano’s price has yet to break into the $1 mark, as per the market stats . Reacting to the current Cardano market sentiment, crypto analyst AMCrypto thinks that as long as the ADA price stays above the $0.80 support level, there is no need to panic. Confirming that, another popular analyst with over 1.4M followers on X, Carl Moon claims that as long as the Cardano token holds the $0.90 support zone, it could hit $1.3 and potentially $1.90 soon. Ali Charts, in the latest Cardano price analysis, claimed that the altcoins TD sequential present a buy signal. Meanwhile, technical analysis from Tradingview shows that the Cardano crypto price is slightly below the 30-day SMA ($0.986). However, with the RSI at 46, a move above $1 could be a catalyst that will drive the price towards $2. Elluminex: A Revolutionary Crypto Project Offering DeFi Solutions On The TON Ecosystem Elluminex (ELX) is an innovative crypto project that seeks to transform the TON blockchain and extend its capabilities and vast reach to the next level. By introducing liquidity to the network, users and developers will be able to tap into and use it. The cross-chain bridging solution allows users to swap digital assets seamlessly across various blockchain networks at the lowest cost. Just like when Jupiter was launched on Solana, which saw the rise of billion-dollar meme coins like Dogwifhat, Elluminex wants to make TON a go-to DeFi hub. By leveraging the over 950 million active users and Telegrams’ close to 1 billion users, Elluminex seeks to offer users a platform that will allow them to trade, stake, farm, and track their portfolio with ease. In the Elluminex DEX, users trade digital assets directly from their wallets with little or no slippage and faster transaction processing. Traders can utilize the AI-powered portfolio track to gain insights about their assets’ market performance, ensuring that they stay updated about market events. The educational platform also allows users to learn more about DeFi. Outside that, the OTC platform gives users access to new TON projects before the official listing, ensuring that users capture new projects at the nascent stage. Powering the platform is the ELX token, which is sold for just $0.06. With over 5 million tokens sold and rising interest, traders anticipate 1000% rallies in presale. As such, it is one of the best altcoins to buy in Q1. Best Cryptos To Buy For Maximum Return In Q1 Dogecoin looks set to break the $1 barrier in the year, while Cardano could hit the $2 mark in the coming months. However, Elluminex is primed to outshine both altcoin titans in the year. The DeFi features it is bringing to the TON blockchain and the common DeFi problems it is solving make it a key player in the lucrative DeFi industry. As one of the fastest-growing blockchains, the integration of Elluminex in the TON network will increase the demand for ELX, making it the best crypto coin to buy.

Bitcoin (BTC) changed the game for early investors, delivering life-changing returns, and Solana (SOL) is recognized for its exceptional scalability. Now, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a new coin in the market, is grabbing headlines with predictions of 55,000% growth potential. Having raised $1 million during its presale in minutes, it’s being closely watched by experts who see it as the next breakout token alongside top contenders. Why THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is Creating a Buzz 1. Fresh Entry, Massive Upside Being new to the market, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers a rare opportunity to invest before its value skyrockets. Early investors stand to benefit from the kind of exponential returns only seen in the early days of tokens like SOL and XRP. 2. Exceptional Presale Success The presale success of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN , raising $1 million almost instantly, is a clear indicator of its high demand and market appeal. Its early momentum positions it as a leader among emerging cryptos. 3. Exclusivity Fuels Demand Unlike XRP, LINK, and DOT, which are widely available across exchanges, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively sold at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This controlled access ensures scarcity, increasing its value for early adopters. How It Stands Against Competitors XRP: Dominates payments but lacks the early-stage growth potential of this new coin. Solana (SOL): Scalable and fast, but its growth is already stabilizing compared to this fresh token. Chainlink (LINK): Strong in decentralized oracles but can’t match the excitement surrounding THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An emerging project, but its momentum falls short of this token’s presale success. Don’t Miss This Game-Changing Opportunity With experts predicting up to 55,000% gains, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is becoming the most talked-about crypto of 2025. Its record-breaking presale, exclusivity, and high-growth potential make it a must-watch token alongside Solana. Secure your tokens now at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM and join the revolution!

39859257,https://nulltx.com/?p=143528,1738567973,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Why Are Sui Investors Accumulating ELX and AVAX,https://nulltx.com/why-are-sui-investors-accumulating-elx-and-avax/,"Ali Charts Confirms 40% AVAX Rally, As Sui Holders Look Towards Elluminex Dubbed Top Crypto Of 2025 Sui (SUI) has seen an incredible performance after the August 2024 market correction. It was among the tokens that fully regained its previous losses and moved to new highs. Cracks began to show when SUI crypto created lower highs and fell below its critical level. This sparked speculation of whether this is the start of a deeper correction or a pause to commence its rally. Similarly, Avalanche (AVAX) entered a consolidation phase and has been trading within a descending triangle pattern. This technical setup is marked by lower highs with a downward-sloping trendline and horizontal support level at $34.18. This level has become a strong support base for buyers. Following their bearish trends, AVAX and SUI investors have turned to Elluminex (ELX), a revolutionary DeFi platform set to transform TON, which already has the fastest-growing network. With its comprehensive DeFi hub, seasoned traders believe ELX could hit $1 before the first half of 2025. Sui (SUI) Price Breakdown Since August, SUI’s price action has followed an ascending support trendline, which triggered multiple bounces every moment the price returned to it. Its most recent bounce is in December, culminating in a new high price of $5.35 on Jan 6. Afterward, the price of Sui declined from the trendline after two weeks. This trendline has existed for 161 days; therefore, a breakdown marks the end of upward movement. Meanwhile, the Sui Crypto has not yet validated this support line as a resistance. If the downward movement persists, the closest Fibonacci at $4.48 could become support, while the closest horizontal support is at $1.80. Sui’s technical setup validates the conclusion of upward movements. For example, its RSI has generated a bearish divergence , falling below the neutral position of 50. Additionally, its MACD has made a bearish cross, while the histogram indicates a bearish divergence. Therefore, Sui’s upward movement appears to have ended, signaling the start of a bearish trend. Alongside a breakdown from its long-term ascending support trendline, SUI has also broken down from its short-term wedge pattern. As such, Sui has reached the top of its upward movement, and if this is confirmed, the price of Sui could begin a lengthy correction that could take it below $3. Ali Charts Confirms 40% Rally For Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche has been on a downtrend in the past week but has not deterred optimism among investors. Netflow data highlight an outflow of 2.18 million AVAX tokens, suggesting investors are moving away from the exchanges. This trend typically reflects increased whale accumulation or reduction in selling pressure. This consistent outflow of AVAX tokens indicates that many investors are still holding onto their tokens rather than preparing to sell. Meanwhile, large inflows exceeded $20 million between mid-November and early December, which aligns with selling activity during its price peaks. Notably, Ali Charts predicts that the price of Avalanche is primed for a 40% rally once it breaks above its descending channel pattern at $37 and $38. Its technical setup aligns with this bullish sentiment, though the direction of the breakout could determine the next significant move. The crypto’s daily price chart has been trading with a descending triangle pattern , demonstrated by a downsloping trendline and horizontal support level at $34.18. this level has acted as a defense for AVAX buyers, but repeated tests could weaken this zone. A breach below the $34.18 level could set the stage for downside support levels at $29.17, $24.69, and $22.18, aligning with the Fibonacci extension levels. To regain bullish momentum, AVAX price must break the descending trendline near $37-$38. Any additional resistance could be around $37.53 and $40.17, which have previously rejected price recovery attempts. Elluminex (ELX): Top Crypto Of 2025 Despite TON being among the fastest blockchains, bolstering over 950 million users, its network’s DeFi market remains largely underdeveloped. This might soon change, thanks to Elluminex (ELX), a revolutionary DeFi platform on TON. Just like how Uniswap turned Ethereum into the heart of DeFi, Elluminex is about to drive a new wave of success to the Toncoin network, elevating it to new heights. This single DeFi platform will be the missing bridge for the TON ecosystem, enabling easy transfer of assets between chains, which could change the entire trajectory of Toncoin. Most traditional DEX suffer from high gas fees, fragmented liquidity, and slow transaction times. Elluminex has tackled these issues head-on, aggregating liquidity across multiple blockchains, minimizing slippage, and enabling a seamless trading experience with a wide array of crypto assets. Even by holding the ELX token, investors can earn passive income by staking their tokens at dynamic rates that reward early adopters and loyal stakers. This has contributed to the platform’s liquidity. Moreover, it has reduced sell-offs and built a loyal community, stabilizing the ELX token. Besides trading, Elluminex offers an AI portfolio tracker, learning academy, and pre-market access, positioning the platform as a premier DeFi hub. So far, Elluminex is available at presale and selling for only $0.06. Thanks to these features, market participants are optimistic that this new DeFi coin could rally exponentially in this bull cycle. Why Elluminex Could Outpace SUI And AVAX While Avalanche looks forward to new highs and Sui navigates price breakdown, Elluminex has signaled itself as a promising contender in DeFi. For those who missed Sui’s rise or are looking for the next high-return altcoin, Elluminex is the next ticket for unlocking a huge growth potential.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. With strong tokenomics and real-world utility, Rollblock is emerging as a top GambleFi contender, challenging assets like PEPE and XRP. Table of Contents Rollblock: The next big altcoin? PEPE’s market volatility and whale influence XRP’s regulatory challenges and market uncertainty Conclusion The crypto market is heating up, and Rollblock (RBLK) is making waves as a top contender. While PEPE and XRP have seen significant hype, Rollblock is emerging as a competitor with real-world utility. Its GambleFi model, revenue-sharing rewards, and strong tokenomics set it apart from speculative assets. Rollblock: The next big altcoin? Rollblock is taking GambleFi to the next level, offering over 7,000 games, live casino platforms, and sports betting. Its blockchain-backed gaming ecosystem generates passive income for investors. The project has already secured $9.9 million in its crypto presale, with a $0.052 token price. Analysts see strong return potential, making it a top 2025 bull run pick. RBLK holders earn weekly dividends from casino profits, adding long-term value and extra earning opportunities. Tokenomics make Rollblock even more attractive. Regular buybacks and burns reduce supply, with 60% of repurchased tokens burned and 40% distributed to stakers. Investors can stake RBLK tokens to earn up to 30% APY, creating strong incentives for long-term holding. As the top GambleFi platform on Ethereum, Rollblock is quickly gaining traction. Analysts suggest it could outperform major altcoins thanks to its focus on real-world applications. With strong investor backing and a transparent, blockchain-powered ecosystem, Rollblock stands out as a true utility-driven altcoin. You might also like: Cardano ETF looms but whales shift focus to Rollblock amid market uncertainty PEPE’s market volatility and whale influence As of January 31, 2025, the PEPE price is trading at $0.000014. Despite its explosive rise in 2024, recent trends indicate increased market instability. Benzinga reports that Changelly predicts PEPE could trade at an average price of $0.0027 by 2025, while CoinPedia forecasts an average of $0.000055. Massive whale movements continue to shake PEPE’s market. Recently, a single investor turned $3,000 into $51 million, selling 500 billion PEPE tokens. This kind of price manipulation raises concerns about long-term sustainability. While PEPE remains popular due to social media hype and the meme coin trend, it relies purely on speculation. If whale activity continues, PEPE’s future could be highly unpredictable. XRP’s regulatory challenges and market uncertainty Ripple’s coin is trading at $3.08. The coin’s market performance has been heavily influenced by ongoing legal battles with the SEC. Recent closed-door SEC meetings have sparked speculation about a shift in regulatory enforcement, but uncertainty remains. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin is expected to improve its cross-border payment functionality. Regardless, price predictions differ, with 2025 targets between $1.81 and $4.44 and some bullish forecasts placing XRP above $9 by 2030. Despite its legal and technological advancements, XRP still faces hurdles. The regulatory landscape remains unstable, and investors remain cautious. While some analysts see XRP as a long-term play, others argue that other projects with clearer growth paths offer better returns. With ongoing legal concerns still in play, many traders are hesitant to go all-in on XRP’s future. Conclusion While PEPE, XRP, and Rollblock all have market potential, Rollblock’s utility-driven model and strong tokenomics make it the most promising investment. With crypto presale momentum and real passive income opportunities, RBLK could outperform speculative assets. Investors looking for stability and growth should keep Rollblock on their radar.

Another Region Is Being Taxed!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/donald-trump-makes-statement-after-taxes-imposed-on-mexico-canada-and-china-another-region-is-being-taxed/,"President Donald Trump defended his administration's sweeping tariff strategy, acknowledging that duties on Mexico, Canada and China could cause “short-term” economic pain for Americans. Trump Acknowledges 'Short-Term' Pain of Tariffs as Global Markets React Trump's comments come amid growing concerns that these trade measures could undermine global growth and reignite inflation. Speaking to reporters, Trump defended the tariffs as a necessary tool to correct what he described as unfair trade practices, even as global markets showed signs of strain in response to escalating trade tensions. “There may be some short-term pain, but it is a small price to pay for the long-term strength of the American economy,” Trump said. Tariffs on European Union 'Will Definitely Be Implemented' Trump also signaled that tariffs on the European Union (EU) were imminent, saying it “absolutely will happen,” although he declined to give a timeline. The statement added to growing unease in financial markets that fear a wider global trade war is looming on the horizon. Global stock markets and commodities have been volatile in recent days as investors digest the potential impact of Trump's trade policies: US and Asian stock markets have fallen sharply on fears that economic growth will slow. Bond yields fell, signaling investor concerns about a potential recession. Commodity prices, including oil and metals, have fluctuated due to uncertainties surrounding global supply chains. Economic and Political Reflections Economists warn that tariffs could fuel higher prices for consumers, squeeze corporate profits and disrupt global supply chains. Meanwhile, international leaders including officials from the EU, Mexico and Canada have voiced strong opposition, hinting at possible retaliatory measures. Despite the mounting criticism, Trump remains firm, framing the tariffs as part of his broader agenda to “put America first” in global trade negotiations. As markets brace for the possible outcomes, all eyes will be on the White House for more details on the timeline and scope of the upcoming EU tariffs. *This is not investment advice.

A staggering $2 billion worth of liquidations have happened within 24 hours. Ethereum Price Analysis: Ethereum’s price has dropped below key support zones, including the $2500-$3,000 range. This has triggered concerns over a potential bearish trend as lower highs and lows continue to form. While a daily candle close beneath these levels is still needed to confirm a bearish trend, Ethereum’s outlook remains cautious with resistance at higher levels around $3,430 to $3,560. Solana Price Prediction: Solana has been following the same downward trend as Bitcoin and Ethereum. It recently broke below an important support level around $220–$225. Furthermore, breaking below $220 has led to a drop to $200–$190. The next support could be around $177–$180. Now, the old support zone between $220–$225 will likely act as resistance. Overall, the price is still in a bearish trend, and things aren’t looking great for Solana in the short term. XRP Price Prediction: XRP is also showing a bearish trend, similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum. It has broken below the support around $2.60–$2.70, where the price bounced before. If it closes below this level, it could see XRP fall to around $2.33–$2.26 next. The RSI on the 4-hour chart is getting close to oversold territory, which could signal that the price might be ready for a short-term bounce. But, it’s not guaranteed. This just means XRP could see some relief soon before it potentially continues to fall later on. ADA Price Prediction: Cardano’s price is facing strong resistance above the $1 level. It has been struggling to break through this level for months. The price has now dropped below key support around $0.72 to $0.73. If the price falls further, it might drop to $0.60, with a potential 25% decrease.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|ETH|XRP|ADA|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-03 07:41:26

At the time of writing, ZACH has gained a market cap of around $49,300 since its launch on Feb. 1. The token is described as “a support fund” dedicated to renowned crypto sphere investigator, ZachXBT, for his work in uncovering crypto-related scams and rug-pulls in the community. Flaunch.gg is a new meme coin launch platform on the Base ( BASE ) network and is powered by Uniswap ( UNI ) V4. Unlike other launchpads, Flaunch.gg allows users to buy, sell, and launch tokens with 100% of the trading fees going to developers rather than centralized entities. In the case of the ZACH token, it claims that 96% of the trading fees will be paid to ZachXBT in Ethereum, while the other 4% goes to the community in the form of buybacks. “Zach doesn’t have to hold or sell a single coin. This is an entirely new way to fundraise for others,” wrote X user @0xCaps, one of the main supporters of Flaunch.gg. According to data on Flaunch.gg, ZACH has yielded more than $2,000 in total revenue. This means that ZachXBT will receive at least $1,920 from the 96% of revenue. In the past 24 hours, the token’s price has gone down by nearly 11% and is owned by 222 holders.

You might also like: ZachXBT tracks over $100m in XRP sent to exchanges by Chris Larsen Many traders were quick to jump into the conversation regarding the new ZachXBT token on Flaunch.gg. Rohit Chauhan from Polygon Labs asked Caps if he was the one who launched the token, while Account Director of Hype Partners, Jayrabs.eth also chimed in with “let me guess, launched on flaunch.gg.” “Flaunch is a better mechanism,” wrote Bankless Venture’s David Hoffman on X, responding to the ZachXBT token. Ex-Polygon and current Base developer @Sir_Damilare said the token’s launch was “interesting,” highlighting that Zach has earned around $2,400 revenue so far, based on a screen-capture taken on launch day. Other traders have also tagged Zach’s account and called the token a “new method of donation.” At the time of writing, ZachXBT has not posted anything on his socials acknowledging the Flaunch token’s existence or whether he has received the funds. ZachXBT meme coin controversy This is not the first time developers have launched a token dedicated to the crypto sleuth with the purpose of raising funds for his investigative efforts. In mid-January this year, a Solana ( SOL )-based meme coin was created called Justice for ZachXBT or ZACHXBT. According to data on CoinGecko, ZACHXBT has gone down by 11.2% and is currently trading hands at $0.0004276. The anonymous developers sent Zach 50% of the token supply. ZachXBT sold a portion of his holdings, bringing the meme coin’s value down. Many accused him of rug-pulling the token, even though the token was launched to support him. He denied being behind the token’s creation as he claimed to not know the developers and never promoted the token on his socials. The internet investigator has been candidly honest about not getting paid for his past efforts in maintaining safety and transparency in the crypto community. One such instance was when the crypto sleuth uncovered $12 million linked to the Caesar ransomware incident in September 2023. “Wasted my time on bs like this which never rewarded me at all and only warped my view of doing good,” wrote ZachXBT on his post . So far, ZachXBT’s X account bio has a link for people to send donations in Solana for his efforts and a link to his public Telegram channel.

Ethereum ( ETH ) fell 23.6% to an intraday low of $2,368 on Feb. 3 Asian morning after U.S. President Donald Trump announced trade tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico over the weekend. Higher import tariffs could drive up inflation, potentially leading to higher interest rates. This, in turn, triggered a risk-off sentiment, which pressured cryptocurrency prices. As of press time, the altcoin market fell 28% to nearly $1.07 trillion, with several major altcoins like XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), and Cardano ( ADA ), among others recording losses between 15-30% over the past day. Ethereum experienced its largest liquidation event in the past two years, with $475.72 million liquidated from long positions and $127.78 million from short positions over the past 24 hours. During the same period, open interest in its futures market fell 27% to $23.36 billion, while its funding rate dropped to levels last seen during the March 2020 COVID crash. The sharp drop in Ethereum’s open interest suggests traders are pulling back from leveraged positions, likely due to heightened market uncertainty.

Investors have withdrawn $326.7 million worth of ETH from exchanges over the past three days, according to data from CoinGlass. Typically, such outflows suggest that investors are accumulating during the dip, anticipating a price recovery once bearish pressure eases. Whales have also begun buying the largest altcoin following its recent price plunge. According to a Feb. 3 X post from Onchain Lens, a whale purchased 35,494 ETH, worth nearly $88 million.

However, he noted that Ethereum has struggled in recent days and, without strong catalysts or fresh narratives, it is likely to remain weak against Bitcoin. “If global tariff concerns escalate or another wave of negative news hits the market, we could see one more leg down before ETH finds more stable ground,” he added. Meanwhile, analyst Ali Martinez identified an ascending parallel channel in Ethereum’s price action on the 3-day chart. He noted that ETH must hold the $2,750 support level to sustain its trajectory within the channel. If this level holds, Martinez projected a potential rebound to $6,760.

The Bitcoin Kimchi Premium has spiked to a three-year high of 11.9%. The premium represents the price gap between Bitcoin ( BTC ) in South Korea and the rest of the world. The increase suggests that there is a solid domestic demand for the asset even as prices fall globally. Even as BTC’s price dropped to $93,900, South Korean traders are paying a significant markup. At the same time, a high U.S. Dollar Index has added downward pressure on BTC’s price globally amid a massive Trump-tariff sell-off in the Asian markets. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju believes the surge in BTC’s “Kimchi Premium” is not attributed to Korean traders entering to buy the dip; rather, BTC is being converted to USD instead of Korean Won. This suggests that relatively few Koreans are cashing out BTC for their fiat, and similar patterns may be playing out in other markets. #Bitcoin Kimchi Premium is 12% right now—a three-year high.

Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada and 10% tariffs on Chinese products. Tariffs are set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. EST on Tuesday. As per The Tribune , Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dropped 2.07%, while all the other Asian indices—including Japan’s Nikkei 225 index—tumbled over 2.27%. The KOSPI index of South Korea fell 2.87%, and Taiwan’s weighted index dropped 3.74%. The Indian stock futures are also down with the tariff impact. To explain the current situation unfolding in the Asian stock market, Daniel Yan wrote on X on Feb. 3 that it was “another typical weak Monday.” The large sell-off reflects Asia’s vulnerability to protectionism policies by the U.S. and the growing concerns about global economic instability, believes Yan. Sell-off: another typical weak Monday driven by low liquidity and CTAs chasing – Asia market these days can’t take any negative news nor apply independent thinking. The tariffs won’t lead to much productivity shock or inflation shock for the U.S. – market will recover soon. — Daniel Yan (@_D_Y_A_N) February 3, 2025 Protectionism, in the form of tariffs and quotas, has a long pedigree from the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 that exacerbated the Great Depression. The wider market slump coincides with the crypto market crash, with over $2 billion in liquidations on exchanges, the greatest single-day event in history. However, analysts such as Ansem are positive that the stock and crypto market would revive if Trump’s diplomatic discussions with Canada and Mexico on tariff do not go “ horribly wrong “. Another analyst, Smart Money Asia, pointed out on Jan. 23 that the present executive order by Trump aims to regulate crypto but does not provide traders with plans for a U.S. reserve of BTC, which has been pending for a while. He also sheds light on how the Central Bank of Japan raised rates to 0.5% to combat inflation, its highest in 17 years. According to him, BTC and tech stocks remain a potential powerful hedge against inflation in the Asia market, but he suggests investors practice caution as the BTC bull market matures.

This downturn follows Trump’s decision to introduce 25% tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, sparking the broader financial markets uncertainty.

USDe differs from stablecoins such Circle's USDC because it's a synthetic stablecoin and not backed by fiat assets at a 1:1 ratio. The stablecoin maintains its $1 peg by collateralizing stablecoins and leveraging a hedged cash-and-carry trade, which involves taking futures positions with large open interest available to stabilize value. USDe spent most of the Monday trading day maintaining its $1 peg, with brief dips down to $0.999. Data from CoinGecko shows that the stablecoin's market cap inched above $6 billion, up from about $5.7 billion a week ago. Its funding rate also remained positive according to on-chain data. Funding rates are crucial for maintaining USDe's peg to the dollar and managing market equilibrium. A positive funding rate indicates that holders of long positions are paying a small fee to holders of short positions. This suggests a slightly bullish market sentiment. Another reason why USDe may have maintained its peg is because of the interest bearing nature of the token, which currently pays out an APY of 10%, which has been stable over the last 30 days according to a dashboard from Dune Analytics. Last year some concern was raised about the size of Ethena's reserve fund for USDe, with research house CryptoQuant highlighting that the fund might not be sustainable over $4 billion. However, this reserve fund has grown proportionately to USDe's market cap, and stands at $46.6 million at the end of Q4 2024. Crypto market safe haven? USDe's stability plus yield-bearing appeal means investors could take refuge in the token. Arthur Hayes, chief investment officer at digital asset investment fund Maelstrom and co-founder of BitMEX, who expects BTC to slide to $75,000 in coming weeks, has record exposure to USDe. ""Maelstrom has raised the amount of staked Ethena $USDe it holds to record levels and continues to take profits on several shitcoin position,"" Hayes said in a blog post last week. ""We are still bigly net long, but if my feeling is correct, then we will be positioned with copious amounts of dry powder ready to buy the dip on Bitcoin and a mega dip on many quality shitcoins,"" Hayes added.

Over the past 24 hours, SHIB’s price has fallen by 20% to $0.000014, marking a 25% drop for the week. While this decline has sparked concern, Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, has hinted at a big announcement in a mysterious video. This has left the community excited about what could be next for the SHIB ecosystem. Big Announcement in a Mysterious Video In a recent post on X, Shytoshi Kusama shared a 23-second video that has caught the attention of SHIB holders. The video includes intriguing phrases such as “something is shifting”, and “the key to the future is about to be unlocked.” pic.twitter.com/w1nqhLXeQA — Shytoshi Kusama (@ShytoshiKusama) February 1, 2025 It suggests that a game-changing update is on the way, “Prepare Yourself, This Change Is Everything”, potentially impacting the entire crypto space. The video ends with the words, “Something big is coming,” fueling even more speculation. When asked for details, Kusama responded with a zipper-mouth emoji, suggesting that while something huge is in the works, the team is not yet ready to reveal it. What Could Be Coming for SHIB? Although Kusama hasn’t revealed much, the teaser has sparked discussions within the community. Many believe the announcement could involve a new partnership, a major upgrade, or a groundbreaking innovation for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. This comes just days after Kusama hinted at revealing a powerful partnership that could benefit all SHIB-related tokens, including BONE, LEASH, TREAT, and SHIB itself. This has led to high expectations, with the community eagerly waiting to see what’s in store. Shib Price Plunge By 20% In the meantime, the price of Shiba Inu has dropped by 20% over the past 24 hours. As of now, Shib is trading around $0.00001442 with a market cap of $8.4 billion. While the situation looks challenging, there’s still hope for a turnaround. If SHIB can stabilize near its current price range, a rebound might be possible. Key levels to watch include the 50-day and 200-day moving averages at $0.000017 and $0.0000152 respectively.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 314,900 followers on the social media platform X that Solana is flashing a bearish divergence on the two-week chart. Traders keep a close watch on bearish divergences, especially on the higher time frame as it suggests that an asset is losing momentum even though its price is rising or going sideways. Says Bluntz, “SOL losing $220 is really bad in my opinion. Invalidates the ABC from the highs and makes it look more impulsive and looks like there’s a two-week bearish divergence printing in 24 hours, and it will need an absolute miracle to save that. It’s over in my opinion.” Source: Bluntz/X In his latest SOL analysis, Bluntz notes that Solana printed the same bearish divergence signal on the two-week chart in late 2021, just before SOL collapsed from a high of about $260 to a bear market low of $8. “It printed. The last time we saw one was, drum roll….. 2021.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, SOL is trading for $196.71, down over 7% in the last 24 hours.

The new tariffs of 25% on Canadian & Mexican goods and 10% on Chinese goods and a retaliatory 25% tariff from Canada on American goods have changed the market dynamics in the traditional as well as the crypto markets. Bitcoin price slipped down to $91,000 while Ethereum plunged to reach close to $2000, testing the multi-year support range. What’s Next for the Ethereum (ETH) Price Rally? In the past 24 hours, Ethereum has faced a massive long liquidation of over $610 million compared to $411 million of Bitcoin. Moreover, the single largest liquidation order was with ETH/BTC of around $25.64 million. Meanwhile, this opportunity was utilized well by a whale ‘7 Siblings’ who spent $111.72M and bought 45,047 ETH at an average price of $2,480. After the market dropped, whale ""7 Siblings"" spent $111.72M to buy 45,047 $ETH at an average price of $2,480! https://t.co/ygfREDmCQA pic.twitter.com/xkOAvsB2jp — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) February 3, 2025 This accumulation seems to have offered some momentum for the ETH price rally, which has recovered above $2500 in the times when the bottom below $2000 was on the horizon. Despite this, bearish clouds continue to hover over the second-largest token as the buying volume has not reached the expected range. Therefore, the price needs to hold above $2500 and secure levels above $2800 at the earliest, which may revive a decent upswing. With the Altcoins Losing over $700M, Has the AltSeason Differed in 2025? Throughout the year 2024, altcoins have maintained a significant strength by surging over 50% to 60% from the yearly lows. Regardless of this, the possibility of the start of an Altseason remains unclear as Bitcoin dominance is gaining traction while Ethereum dominance continues to drop. the latest correction not only caused a huge drop in BTC price but also helped the BTC dominance to spike above the crucial resistance and reach 61.83%. On the other hand, ETH dominance, which had stabilized at around 20%, has plunged to levels close to 10%. On the other hand, ETH/BTC has broken down from a descending parallel channel, flashing bearish waves across for the second-largest token, delaying the Altseason. After facing massive liquidation among the top 10, the macro-buy signal for Ethereum has just flashed on. Therefore, the ETH price is expected to bounce back strongly as it has been used as a rare opportunity to bid amid the larger sell-off than expected.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|BTC|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-03 08:11:23

The entire meme coin niche is in red today (February 3), with WIF, BONK, FLOKI, and more among the biggest losers. Just a Temporary Correction? The past 24 hours have been calamitous for the cryptocurrency market, with numerous leading digital assets recording double-digit losses. Bitcoin (BTC) briefly crashed below $92,000, but it was the altcoins that took the major blow. Among the worst affected was the popular meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB), whose valuation collapsed to $0.00001284, representing the lowest point since September last year. In the following hours, the bulls managed to restore some of the lost ground, and the price is currently hovering at around $0.00001443, a 17% daily decline. Despite the bearish environment, the SHIB Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests an incoming reversal. The metric, which measures the speed and change of price movements, varies from 0 to 100 and helps traders identify oversold or overbought conditions. The ratio recently dipped to 16, which signals that the asset might be undervalued and potentially headed for a rally in the short term. Additionally, SHIB’s exchange netflow has turned predominantly negative in the past week . This indicates a possible shift from centralized platforms toward private wallets, hence a reduced immediate selling pressure. SHIB Exchange Netflow Overall Meme Coin Outlook The total market capitalization of the meme coin sector currently stands at approximately $75 billion. This represents a major crash of over 17% on a 24-hour scale . Some of the biggest losers include Pepe (PEPE), Bonk Inu (BONK), Floki (FLOKI), dogwifhat (WIF), and Brett (BRETT). All of those saw their prices plummet by more than 20% during the aforementioned timeframe. The meme coins that made the headlines towards the end of January – Official Trump (TRUMP) and Melania Meme (MELANIA) – have also headed south. The former lost its spot in the top 3 list and is now the fourth-biggest meme. For its part, MELANIA (whose market cap briefly spiked above $2 billion last month) now has a capitalization of just $220 million. On the other hand, Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), AI Rig Complex (ARC), and Elon4AfD (ELON4AFD) are among the very few charting some gains.

During its presale phase, this community-driven platform has captured the attention of savvy investors looking for the next big opportunity in the digital entertainment space. BitLemons: Leading the Gaming Revolution The crypto gaming landscape is undergoing a massive transformation, and BitLemons is at the forefront of this change. Built on the robust Base chain, this platform is rewriting the rules of online entertainment with its unique community-first approach and custom-designed gaming experience that stands apart from cookie-cutter competitors. What’s driving the buzz? BitLemons’ revolutionary profit-sharing model redirects 30% of the platform’s Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) back to the community through a dual mechanism of token buybacks/burns and staker rewards. This creates constant buying pressure while rewarding loyal holders – a winning combination that’s attracted significant investor interest. The platform’s ecosystem is expanding rapidly. BitLemons offers a comprehensive sportsbook, live gaming experiences, and the soon to be viral “Lemon Smash Frenzy” – a play-to-earn game available on Telegram. Each component is designed to generate sustainable revenue while enhancing user engagement. Security meets innovation at BitLemons. With its Anjouan Gaming License and comprehensive SolidProof smart contract audit, the platform provides the trust and transparency that modern crypto investors demand. This solid foundation sets the stage for long-term growth and market dominance. The $BLEM token, now available in presale at an attractive entry point of $0.01, represents a ground-floor opportunity in the evolving crypto gaming sector. With a total supply of 1 billion tokens and a carefully structured tokenomics model featuring regular buybacks and burns, $BLEM is positioned for potential significant value appreciation. Hedera (HBAR) Faces Uncertainty Despite Coinbase Derivatives’ recent CFTC filing for Hedera futures, HBAR continues to show weakness in the market. The token’s technical indicators present a mixed picture, with negative MACD levels suggesting possible further downside. Even with a fixed supply of 50 billion tokens, HBAR has struggled to maintain upward momentum, risking a decline to critical support levels. Sui (SUI) Battles Bearish Pressure The outlook for Sui remains challenging after a 32% decline from recent highs. Despite attempts to stabilize above $3.5, negative funding rates indicate dominant short positions. Technical analysis reveals a concerning descending channel pattern, suggesting potential further downside if current support levels fail to hold. Join the Lemon Revolution While established tokens struggle, BitLemons presents a compelling opportunity for forward-thinking investors. Led by the visionary Lemon Bros and supported by a growing community of Lemonites, the platform is positioned to capture significant market share in the expanding crypto gaming sector.

39863403,https://timestabloid.com/?p=56208,1738574056,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Attorney Jeremy Hogan’s Perspective On XRP as a U.S. Strategic Reserve Asset,https://timestabloid.com/attorney-jeremy-hogans-perspective-on-xrp-as-a-u-s-strategic-reserve-asset/,"Attorney Jeremy Hogan recently shared his thoughts on the possibility of XRP being included in a U.S. digital asset strategic reserve. Hogan’s comments highlight a different perspective from the typical discussions within the cryptocurrency community, focusing on how the federal government might assess digital assets in a broader economic and geopolitical context. Government vs. Crypto Community Perspectives Hogan pointed out that most discussions about XRP in the cryptocurrency space focus on technical and governance-related factors, such as decentralization and validator selection. He argues that these aspects, while important within the crypto industry, may not be the primary concerns of the U.S. government when deciding to hold an asset in reserve. A strategic reserve is typically composed of assets the government believes are necessary to maintain stability and national security. Historically, reserves have included commodities like gold and oil, which serve as economic safeguards in times of crisis. Hogan suggests that if the U.S. government were to hold XRP , the decision would likely be based on its perceived strategic value rather than its technical attributes as a blockchain-based asset. Potential Geopolitical and Economic Considerations Hogan raises the possibility that the U.S. government has greater insight into geopolitical and economic trends than the average market participant. While cryptocurrency investors analyze digital assets based on public data, government agencies have access to classified intelligence and long-term economic models that could inform their decisions. If the government were to accumulate XRP, it could be as a hedge against certain financial contingencies. This might include the potential decline of the U.S. dollar’s dominance in international trade, the increasing digitization of global finance, or the emergence of alternative financial systems outside of U.S. control. Hogan does not claim whether the government is considering such a move. He only suggested that its decision-making process would likely be based on factors beyond those commonly debated within the crypto space. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Government Control and Historical Precedents A common argument against XRP’s inclusion in a strategic reserve is the perception that Ripple, the company associated with its development, has significant influence over its ecosystem. Hogan addresses this concern by pointing out that if the U.S. government saw Ripple’s role as a risk, it could take action to neutralize it. He references historical precedents in which the federal government exerted control over private assets during a crisis. During World War II, the government took control of private companies to support the war effort. In 1933, the U.S. confiscated privately held gold to stabilize the financial system. Hogan suggests that if XRP were deemed strategically important, the government could take similar actions, such as seizing Ripple’s escrowed holdings or exerting control over the company itself. While there is no official indication that the U.S. government is considering XRP for a strategic reserve, Hogan’s analysis presents a thought-provoking argument about how digital assets might be evaluated at the highest levels of policy and strategy.

Dogecoin (DOGE) continues expanding its role in the crypto space, while Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is gaining widespread popularity as it bridges the NFT and meme coin markets. Meanwhile, BTFD Coin’s presale performance is turning heads, setting the stage for massive potential gains as analysts predict a strong future for this bullish token. Meme coins have evolved beyond their fun origins, with projects like BTFD, Dogecoin, and Pudgy Penguins attracting serious investor interest. These three coins are generating buzz in their respective ecosystems, with BTFD’s explosive presale , Dogecoin’s growing adoption, and Pudgy Penguins’ community expansion making them some of the most sought-after meme assets in the market today. BTFD Coin Surpasses $5.9M in Presale, Analysts Predict Major Surge BTFD Coin’s presale is setting the stage for major gains, with over $5.9 million already raised, 68 billion coins sold, and a strong community of 10,200 Bulls backing the project. As the presale has reached Stage 14, investors are eager to secure tokens at $0.00016 per coin before the listing price jumps to $0.0006. Crypto analysts are predicting a major surge for BTFD Coin, with projections pointing to a potential moon price of $0.006. The numbers tell an exciting story—an investment of $25,000 at the current presale price secures 156,250,000 BTFD tokens. At the listing price of $0.0006, that investment would be worth $93,750, and if BTFD reaches its projected price of $0.006, it could soar to $937,500. Adding even more incentive, BTFD has introduced a 100% bonus code (LAUNCH100), doubling the number of tokens purchased during Stage 14. This is a game-changer, making this one of the top new meme coins to join for long term . Buying BTFD is easy. Investors need to set up a MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, enter the LAUNCH100 bonus code on the buy page, and confirm their purchase. Tokens can be claimed after the presale, and staking rewards kick in immediately. With the presale nearing its final stages, now is the perfect time to run with the Bulls. Dogecoin Expands Its Network and Adoption Dogecoin (DOGE) remains one of the most well-known and widely used meme coins, continuing to expand its network and real-world adoption. Originally launched as a lighthearted cryptocurrency, Dogecoin has grown into a major digital asset used for payments, tipping, and community-driven initiatives. More businesses are integrating DOGE into their payment systems, allowing holders to use it for online purchases, donations, and even services. Tesla, sports teams, and various online retailers have embraced Dogecoin as a form of payment, helping to sustain its relevance in the digital economy. Beyond payments, Dogecoin’s network is constantly evolving. Its vibrant community and increasing adoption make it one of the top new meme coins to join for long term. As mainstream brands continue to engage with Dogecoin, its long-term potential looks promising for investors. Pudgy Penguins Gains Popularity as an NFT-Driven Meme Coin Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is making waves in the crypto market as it blends NFT culture with meme coin appeal. Originally launched as an NFT collection, Pudgy Penguins has quickly gained popularity. Today, it has expanded beyond digital art, growing into a widely recognized brand. PENGU, the official cryptocurrency of the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem, plays a vital role in connecting NFT holders, crypto traders, and mainstream audiences. With a strong social media presence and strategic marketing moves—like featuring in ETF commercials—Pudgy Penguins is rapidly becoming a household name. With growing enthusiasm surrounding NFT-driven meme coins, Pudgy Penguins is positioning itself as a major player in the evolving meme economy. Investors looking for exposure to meme coins with real brand recognition and long-term growth potential are paying close attention to PENGU’s rise. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin’s presale performance, Dogecoin’s expanding network, and Pudgy Penguins’ mainstream popularity make these three projects some of the top new meme coins to join for long term. BTFD’s ongoing presale offers early investors a rare opportunity to enter at a low price, with predictions pointing to massive future gains. With the LAUNCH100 bonus doubling investments, and only two presale stages left, the perfect dip to invest is now. Investors who act quickly can secure BTFD before it hits exchanges and ride the wave of this bullish opportunity. Join the BTFD Coin presale now before the Bulls take off.

With market sentiment swinging wildly, traders are betting big on high-potential projects that could deliver massive gains. One meme coin, in particular, has captured the community’s attention— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . Currently in Stage 14 of its presale at just $0.00016 per token, BTFD is making waves with its 90% APY staking rewards and an exciting P2E game that’s already live. But is BTFD the only one worth watching? Not at all. Other well-established meme coins like Bonk (BONK), Cheems (CHEEMS), and Apu Apustaja (APU) have been riding the meme coin frenzy, proving themselves as viable alternatives to traditional investments. If you’re looking to cash in on the hottest meme coins, here’s everything you need to know about the best new meme coins to invest in this week. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Ultimate Meme Coin for Staking and P2E What if you could invest in a meme coin before it hits the big leagues? That’s exactly what’s happening with BTFD Coin, a project designed for those who know that market dips are golden opportunities. Currently, in Stage 14 of its presale at $0.00016 per token, BTFD is gaining traction fast, with over 68 billion tokens sold and more than $5.9 million raised. BTFD isn’t just another meme coin—it’s an entire ecosystem. Its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , which launched in full on January 1, 2025, allows users to earn real rewards while playing. This adds an exciting utility layer that separates it from hype-driven meme coins. And let’s not forget the massive staking rewards—BTFD offers a jaw-dropping 90% APY, meaning early investors can stack serious passive income just by holding their tokens. At its current presale price, a $3,500 investment in BTFD would get you 21,875,000 tokens. If BTFD reaches its planned listing price of $0.0006, that same investment could balloon to $13,125—a 275% increase. Want to grab BTFD before the price jumps? Here’s how: Go to the BTFD Presale Connect Your Wallet: Click “Connect Wallet” and choose your preferred option (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.). Enter Purchase Details: Input the number of BTFD coins you want to buy. Confirm and Buy: Click “Buy Now” and approve the transaction in your wallet. The FOMO is real—BTFD’s presale is moving fast, and with just two more stages to go before its listing at $0.0006, now is the time to act. 2. Bonk (BONK) – The Solana King of Meme Coins If you’ve been following meme coins, you already know Bonk (BONK) is a Solana-based powerhouse. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, BONK has embedded itself deep into the Solana ecosystem. It’s used across multiple DeFi applications, NFT projects, and even decentralized exchanges. The community-driven nature of BONK keeps it strong, with regular airdrops and collaborations with top-tier projects on Solana. Its fast transactions and low fees make it an attractive alternative to Ethereum-based meme coins. Why did BONK make it to this list? Because its steady market presence and deep integration into Solana’s DeFi ecosystem make it more than just a meme—it’s an investment with staying power. 3. Cheems (CHEEMS) – The Meme Coin OG with DeFi Utilities Cheems is no stranger to the meme coin world. Known for its iconic “cheemsburbger” meme, this project has established itself as more than just internet humor. Cheems is evolving, integrating DeFi applications that allow users to stake, lend, and borrow against their holdings. Cheems holders enjoy access to exclusive community events and NFT drops, further solidifying its status as a go-to meme investment. With a focus on real-world use cases, it’s proving that meme coins can be more than just speculative assets. Why did Cheems make this list? Because it continues to provide investors with opportunities beyond memes, giving them access to DeFi utilities and passive income streams. 4. Apu Apustaja (APU) – The Underdog with Massive Community Support Apu Apustaja (APU) might not be as mainstream as BONK or Cheems, but it’s quickly building a cult following. Its unique branding and engaging community initiatives have fueled its rise in the meme coin space. The APU project is all about decentralization and community involvement. With DAO governance, holders actively participate in shaping the coin’s future, making it one of the most interactive meme projects. Why did APU make this list? Its community-driven nature makes it a unique meme coin investment, blending humor with real utility and decentralized decision-making. Final Thoughts Meme coins are no longer just internet jokes; they’ve become serious investment opportunities. BTFD Coin stands out as the top choice for those looking to maximize returns, thanks to its high-yield staking rewards, growing community, and innovative P2E game. But established coins like Bonk, Cheems, and Apu Apustaja also offer strong investment potential due to their proven market positioning and expanding use cases. Don’t miss out on BTFD’s presale before it hits $0.0006. Visit the BTFD Presale now and lock in your investment before the price skyrockets!

Kiyosaki said that crashes are assets on sale and now is the time to get richer. Bitcoin crashed from $100K to $91K in the past 24 hours as the broader market turned red. Robert Kiyosaki, author of the best-selling financial self-help book “Rich Dad, Poor Dad,” stated that it was the best time to build wealth as stocks, crypto, real estate, along with gold, silver, and Bitcoin tumbled. The financial expert asserted that a buying window opened for investors to profit. Within the day, global markets suffered a massive sell-off shortly after China’s DeepSeek AI bot triggered a similar scenario for Bitcoin and US equities. Meanwhile, Bitcoin slid from a high of $100,000 to as low as $91,242.89, according to CoinMarketCap data . On X (formerly Twitter), Kiyosaki warned of a significant financial correction, forecasting that millions would lose their jobs as top assets went on sale. “Don’t be a loser. Stay cool. Take care,” he remarked on X. BRUTAL CRASH HERE NOW. The stock, bond, real estate, gold, silver, and Bitcoin markets are crashing.

TRUMP was issued a couple of days before Trump’s swearing-in ceremony on Jan.20 as the first-ever memecoin officially endorsed by a sitting president. It ran from zero to a market cap peak of $14 billion less than 48 hours after going live, though most retail traders lost money on the token, as a CoinDesk analysis showed . Trump continues to endorse the token on his social media platform, Truth Social, where he posted ""I LOVE $TRUMP!!"" alongside a link to purchase the token over the weekend. However, the market responded with less enthusiasm than anticipated. By Sunday morning, the TRUMP token had dipped to a low of $19.09, its lowest since Trump's return to the White House and a price below where it was listed on most major exchanges (around the $40 mark). This is a stark reminder of the volatility in celebrity-backed meme tokens, where even high-profile endorsements can backfire in the face of broader economic policies and market trends. As such, TRUMP’s fall isn’t isolated; it coincided with a broader market decline triggered by Trump's announcement of new trade tariffs against Canada and Mexico. Bitcoin (BTC) slumped 6% in the past 24 hours, while majors xrp (XRP) and dogecoin (DOGE) are down more than 25% in a steep drop that has reversed all of December and January’s gains.",Markets|Trump|Donald Trump|Memecoin,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|DOGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-03 09:17:04

The cryptocurrency fell to a low of $2,100, trading below $2,500, marking its steepest loss in nearly four years. This sharp drop occurred over 60 hours and was attributed to investors reducing risk exposure following tariffs announced by former President Trump. The decline in Ethereum's value was part of a broader market reaction, with Bitcoin also experiencing a downturn, albeit less severe at around 7%.

The Official Trump coin took the crypto-verse by storm, leaving many top meme coins like Shiba Inu in its trail. Panshibi is a new meme project reflecting the essence of memes and featuring the best profits yet. Shiba Inu latest news describes a spike in the burn rate, but the SHIBI token price has not seen a corresponding increase. The presale is where the hype is at now. Trump Meme Coin Launch: How Did It Impact the Memes? The TRUMP coin represents one of Donald Trump’s forays into mainstream cryptocurrency, as his family spearheaded the World Liberty Financial project. However, the Official Trump Coin was a different case. The Trump meme coin was launched only days before his inauguration as the 47th president of the US. With so much hype around, the token went on to dominate the proceedings in the meme sector and most of the crypto market for the following week. TRUMP reached a peak market capitalization of about $13 billion less than a day into its launch. All that market cap was partly driven from top meme coins, notably Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe. The spike led TRUMP to its ATH at about $79 before correction set in. Shiba Inu Latest News: Death Cross, Burn Rate Spikes, and the Shib Price Future Shiba Inu has not had the most stellar year in the crypto-verse, even with the November rally, courtesy of Donald Trump’s victory at the polls. Currently, SHIB battles against the $0.00002 resistance with no breaks in sight. The struggle is due to several reasons, starting with the Trump meme coin launch in mid-January. The SHIB token took a hit at the time, as its lackluster token lacked the appeal that the TRUMP coin had. Last week, Shiba Inu seemed back on track for massive gains with its 7,200% burn rate spike, but there’s yet another obstacle. There has been the formation of a Death Cross on the Shiba Inu charts, and the downward spiral might very well continue. More bearish pressure could see SHIB hit $0.0000160. Panshibi (SHIBI) is a worthy top meme coin contender, and here’s why the SHIBI tokens are on track to the top of the meme charts. Every Trader Wants Panshibi! The latest meme project is an obvious asset to the crypto-verse, and it’s not just for meme enthusiasts. It is a get-away for crypto traders, a modification that mirrors the Metaverse and offers traders a chance to explore an AI-enhanced world without restrictions or the need to compete. Panshibi’s ecosystem is based on Pandas, Asia, and memes. With AI elements and SocialFi, the network aims to encourage its users to interact, making the ecosystem one fun platform for everyone. And much unlike other meme coins, Panshibi has plans for longevity. Now, that’s what is bringing investors to the SHIBI presale. The team plans to launch the tokens on CEXs, namely Binance, Coinbase, and KuCoin, a ploy to enhance the availability of Panshibi. It’s said that the token will experience a 145,000% pump post launch! So you can only imagine what could happen if launched on CEXs. So, for most crypto traders, the presale is your best bet to jump on the Panshibi ecosystem. Get your SHIBI Coins Here! The Panshibi tokens are in its presale Stage 3 already, selling at $0.004 and raring to go further. Getting in early on the presale sets you up for 1,200% profits by launch day. And that’s separate from the 145,000% expected post-launch. SHIBI is about to pull a SHIB-like launch, and you don’t want to miss it! Join the Panshibi presale today before the price surges.

It raised $1 million within minutes of its presale launch, securing its position as the most promising token of 2025. While competitors are gaining traction, none come close to the explosive momentum or investor demand driving THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Could a $100 investment in this revolutionary token truly grow into $1 million? Here’s why experts and investors believe it can. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Dominates the Market 1. Record-Breaking Presale Performance Raising over $1 million in minutes demonstrates the exceptional confidence investors have in THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. This achievement places it leagues ahead of ARB, ADA, INJ, and KAS, which lack comparable early-stage success. 2. Limited Supply with Maximum Value Potential With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN leverages scarcity to drive value. Its deflationary tokenomics gives early investors a significant advantage, making it a standout compared to ADA’s gradual growth or KAS’s slower adoption. 3. Exclusive Access Drives Urgency THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively sold at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity ensures a controlled rollout and higher value for investors, setting it apart from more saturated markets. How It Outperforms Key Competitors Arbitrum (ARB): A strong Layer-2 contender but overshadowed by THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s overwhelming demand. Cardano (ADA): Reliable but unable to match the rapid adoption of this market leader. Injective Protocol (INJ): A strong player in DeFi yet no match for the presale performance of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Take the Lead with THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Proven as the standout crypto of 2025, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is your ultimate opportunity to multiply your portfolio. With its record-breaking presale, limited supply, and exclusive availability, now is the time to take action and secure your position in this revolutionary token.

This event surpassed previous significant liquidations such as those during the COVID-19 crash and the collapses of LUNA and FTX. Bitcoin prices fell below $95,000, reaching as low as $91,000, while Ethereum saw a 20% drop to $2,300. The market turmoil was triggered by a trade war initiated by former President Donald Trump, who imposed 25% tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. This led to a cascade of long position liquidations, with Ethereum and Bitcoin seeing the heaviest losses at $600 million and $400 million respectively.

Analysts Said ""Risk Continues"", Announced Risky Level!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-bitcoins-decline-continue-analysts-said-risk-continues-announced-risky-level/,"Led by Bitcoin (BTC), altcoins experienced a major decline and the cryptocurrency market turned into a bloodbath. According to Coinglass data, liquidations exceeding $2 billion occurred in the last 24 hours during this decline, surpassing even the liquidations experienced during the COVID-19 and FTX crises. While the sharp decline in BTC and altcoins has investors worried, data shows that the risk of Bitcoin falling to $75,000 by the end of March is increasing. Accordingly, cryptocurrency exchange Derive options data shows that the probability of Bitcoin falling to $75,000 by March 28 has increased. And according to the data, that probability is now 22%, up from 10% last week. Derive analysts said that this increase in the probability of Bitcoin falling to $75,000 is linked to the recent tariffs imposed by the US on Canada, Mexico and China, which could increase inflation and weaken sentiment towards the cryptocurrency market. “Trump's recent tariffs, including a 25% surtax on imports from Mexico and Canada and a 10% surtax on Chinese goods, are likely to increase inflation. This could undermine investor confidence in cryptocurrency markets. However, we are also seeing a number of active spot ETF applications from major players like Bitwise and Grayscale for assets like Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), XRP and Litecoin (LTC). “If the SEC approves these, it will signal more legitimacy for the digital asset sector and trigger more capital inflows, potentially pushing prices higher.” As you may recall, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes recently said that BTC would first fall to around $75,000 before starting a bigger bull run.

Primarily, as the dump occurred amid a broader market crash in light of Trump’s new tariffs, market watchers convey severe concerns over future price movements. Notably, DOGE price tanked nearly 20% in the past 24 hours as of press time, in sync with the broader crypto market crash. Dogecoin Whale Dumps Heavily Raising Market Concerns According to an X post by Whale Alert on February 3, a Dogecoin whale offloaded 200 million tokens worth $49.94 million to the crypto exchange giant Binance. Notably, the wallet address “DU8gPC5m” was recorded to have made the transaction. For context, usual market sentiments remain bearish in light of such massive whale dumps, signaling a loss of large-scale investors’ confidence in the asset. Moreover, the massive dump also adds to a coin’s exchange supply, negatively impacting tokenomics. As a result, the DOGE whale dump raised severe concerns about future movements amid a broader market crash. Crypto Market Slumps Amid Trump’s New Tariffs CoinGape reported that the crypto market crashed as the week kicked off amid broader macroeconomic developments. Bitcoin swooped to a $91K low intraday, whilst meme coins mirrored a bearish trend. This bearish action is primarily attributed to Donald Trump announcing new import tariffs recently, sending shockwaves across global markets. As a result, even the cryptocurrency sector took a hit, with massive liquidations occurring over the past day. The Dogecoin whale’s massive dump amid the current bearish market trend further solidifies investors’ cautiousness on the meme-themed asset. DOGE Price Crashes At the time of reporting, DOGE price lost 19% of its value and exchanged hands at $0.247. The meme coin’s intraday bottom and peak were $0.2117 and $0.3043, respectively. A recent CoinGape report revealed that Dogecoin’s price slumped amid massive liquidations, declining OI, and the broader crypto market trend. The Dogecoin whale’s massive dump also aligns with this bearish dynamic. However, it’s worth keeping in mind Elon Musk’s DOGE-related developments have managed to help the meme coin secure a prominent spot on traders’ radars. A DOGE price analysis by CoinGape revealed that in light of the D.O.G.E. department’s success in saving Americans $1 billion, positive sentiments over long-term prospects prevail. Nevertheless, traders and investors continue to monitor the token, expecting price shifts amid dynamic market trends.

Parents are now looking to crypto, particularly Bitcoin, as a way to boost their kids’ future savings. Some decide to ditch traditional methods like 529 plans or brokerage accounts in pursuit of better returns in crypto, while others see Bitcoin as a smart way to diversify. With the BTC price surging over 500% since the last lows and moving past $105k – albeit with occasional dips, like the ongoing one – in January, families believe Bitcoin’s potential is only starting to manifest. Bloomberg brings up the case of Jim Crider, a certified financial planner. Based in San Antonio, the 35-year-old father of four plans to save one whole Bitcoin for each child by the time they turn 18. Crider is convinced BTC will hit $1 million in ten years. The man knows the risks but sees even more risk in having zero exposure to Bitcoin. More parents are following in Crider’s footsteps and taking even more chances. Travis Headley, a 43-year-old doctor from Louisiana, is shifting his kids’ 529 plan savings into Bitcoin. Headley believes the traditional approach won’t cut it for covering skyrocketing college costs, and his kids have enough time to recover if things go wrong. Alex Crognale, a professional soccer player, shares this sentiment. Disappointed by the returns of 529 accounts, he decided to opt for Bitcoin as a more flexible and promising asset. The rise of Bitcoin ETFs has brought new attention to crypto, following its recovery after several scandals. While most financial advisors don’t recommend going all-in, some suggest that small crypto investments could align with long-term financial strategies. For many, the math is pretty obvious. Rajat Soni, a Toronto-based financial analyst lays out the details for parents looking to shift from 529 to crypto. “Buying $10-$100 of Bitcoin per month over 18 years will set your kids up for an EXCELLENT life. It will MASSIVELY outperform the rest of the portfolio (especially REITs and index funds like VOO and SCHD) (...) At some point, 0.001 Bitcoin (100,000 Satoshis) will buy you what $100,000 buys you today,” he persuades. Some Bitcoin enthusiasts are going as far as to educate the youngest ones to ensure them a smoother entry into adulthood. Chris and Frieda Bobay, a crypto-loving couple from Nashville, created an illustrated kids’ book, Bitcoin for Kiddos, to teach their children, aged 4 and 7, about the new investment opportunities.

As altcoins struggle, traders are closely watching BTC’s price movement, particularly the $102,000 CME Gap—a crucial level for potential reversals. As of Feb. 3, Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) market dominance has climbed to nearly 62%, marking its highest level since February 2021. BTC market dominance measures the share of total cryptocurrency market cap accounted for by Bitcoin. A dominance of 62% indicates that BTC makes up the bulk of the market, leaving altcoins with the scraps. Bitcoin’s market dominance reaches 61.66% on February 3, 2025, marking its highest level since 2021. Sourced from Trading View by crypto.news In February 2021, Tesla announced a $1.5 billion investment in BTC and a commitment to accept it for payments, causing the price to surge above $44,000, according to Reuters . This momentum continued throughout the year, driven by growing adoption among businesses and organizations, ultimately pushing BTC’s price past $68,000 in November 2021.

Inspite of this intensifying volatility SOL has maintained its position, reflecting strong investor confidence. Let’s understand why Solana (SOL) remains not as affected as relative to other altcoins and what to expect next. Why Solana Price Trades Around $200 Even After Brutal Selloff? Solana price remains resilient around the $200 mark despite experiencing a sharp market correction. The blockchain’s growing popularity, fueled by the ongoing meme coin frenzy, continues to drive demand. Notable tokens like BONK and WIF have attracted significant retail participation, leading to sustained interest in Solana-based assets. As a result, investors are holding onto their Solana holdings to engage in meme coin trading rather than liquidating their positions. This has effectively reduced selling pressure, allowing the asset to maintain its value amid market fluctuations. Another critical factor supporting Solana’s price stability is its role as a key platform for meme coin trading. Many traders rely on the network’s low fees and fast transactions, making it an attractive hub for speculative trading. The broader Solana meme coin market cap currently stands at $12 billion, reflecting a 13.4% decline in the last 24 hours. Crypto analysts recently expressed confidence in Solana’s price, calling it a bargain below $200. The cryptocurrency market has faced intense volatility, yet Solana has managed to hover around this crucial level. Despite a broader selloff, Solana continues to maintain strong investor interest. Solana under $200 is free money — barney (@barneyxbt) February 2, 2025 Key Levels to Watch SOL price hovers at $200, with an 8% decrease following other crypto market decreases. Solana price is resilient despite recent market fluctuations, with technical indicators pointing to a possible price bounce. Analysts have identified two critical support zones where buying interest is expected to be strong. The first major support level is around $186, which coincides with a historically significant demand zone. A deeper retracement could push the price toward the $161-$149 range, where previous accumulation has occurred. If bulls maintain control at these levels, a recovery toward higher resistance zones could be imminent. On the upside, the Solana price prediction faces resistance near $220, a level that aligns with a previous rejection area. A breakout above this region could open the door to $260-$280, where sellers might attempt to cap further gains. If momentum remains strong, an extension towards the $300 mark could be on the table. However, failure to reclaim $220 could lead to another retest of support before a sustainable uptrend forms. Solana’s ability to hold above crucial support zones suggests strong demand, preventing significant downside. If buyers step in, the next leg higher could bring a fresh attempt to reclaim the previous 220 levels.

In an interview with US Senator Cynthia Lummis, Satoshi Action Fund CEO Dennis Porter shared that Utah has a unique advantage, with only 45 days to decide on the bill. Porter believes the state’s fast-moving legislative window and growing political will make it a strong contender to take the lead in the Bitcoin reserve movement. Utah to Lead Bitcoin Reserve Effort? Porter’s comments came after Utah’s House Economic Development Committee voted overwhelmingly in favor of a bill on January 28, paving the way for the state to invest a portion of its public funds in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization exceeding $500 billion. This bill would also permit the investment in approved stablecoins, signaling the state’s readiness to embrace digital assets. With the bill receiving broad support within the committee, many experts now believe Utah is primed to set a precedent for other states looking to explore Bitcoin reserves . A Crypto Leader Porter emphasized that Utah’s track record in passing legislation in the Economic Development Committee further strengthens the belief that the state will be the first to implement this innovative reserve. Over the last several years, every bill that has passed through the committee has been signed into law, increasing confidence that this Bitcoin bill will be no exception. While Utah is on the brink of potentially becoming the first state to establish a Bitcoin reserve, other states are not far behind. Arizona has already moved forward with a similar bill, while states like Illinois, Ohio, and Texas have introduced their own proposals to create Bitcoin reserves. Furthermore, officials in Alabama, Florida, and other states have expressed public support for the idea, although formal bills have yet to be introduced. At the federal level, progress is also being made. Senator Lummis has introduced a bill that aims for the United States to accumulate 1 million Bitcoin over the next five years. Should it pass, the plan would involve using a combination of asset seizures and possibly liquidating portions of the nation’s gold reserves. According to a VanEck analysis, Bitcoin could reduce the national debt by 35% by 2049 if its price continues to rise.

With market dynamics shifting and new projects emerging, it’s crucial to stay updated.

Its Web3 aggregator model and innovative QubeQode IDE make blockchain development easier for businesses and individuals alike. But Qubetics isn’t the only coin worth watching—let’s dive into some of the top crypto investments to consider this month. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): The Web3 Aggregator Making Waves Qubetics is turning heads with its innovative approach as the world’s first Web3 aggregator. Currently, in its 19th presale stage, Qubetics has already raised over $11.5 million, with more than 453 million $TICS tokens sold to over 17,600 holders. The current price per token is $0.0606, and early investors are eyeing major returns. At the heart of Qubetics is the QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE), an AI-powered platform designed to simplify blockchain application development. Imagine a small business owner wanting to implement a blockchain-based loyalty program. With QubeQode IDE, they can create and deploy a custom application without extensive coding knowledge. Similarly, a freelance artist could tokenize their digital art and sell it globally, all through this user-friendly platform. The IDE’s drag-and-drop interface, combined with AI-driven debugging and optimization, makes blockchain development accessible to a broader audience. Analysts are optimistic about $TICS’s potential. Predictions suggest that by the end of the presale, the token could reach $0.25, offering early investors a significant return. Looking ahead, forecasts indicate that $TICS might hit $1 post-presale and possibly $15 after the mainnet launch, translating into substantial gains for those who get in early. Why did this coin make it to this list? Qubetics addresses real-world challenges by making blockchain technology more accessible and user-friendly, positioning itself as a promising investment in the crypto space. 2. Cronos (CRO): Riding t he Wave of Expansion Cronos, the native token of the Crypto.com exchange, has been gaining traction, especially with Crypto.com’s recent expansion into the U.S. market.

As of January 31, 2025, CRO is trading at approximately $0.13. Analysts predict a potential increase to $0.14 in the near term, with some forecasts suggesting it could reach up to $0.2644 by the end of the year. Why did this coin make it to this list? Cronos’s association with a major exchange and its expanding user base make it a noteworthy contender this month. 3. Avalanche (AVAX): Scaling New Heights Avalanche is renowned for its high throughput and scalability, making it a favorite among developers and investors.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Amid the wins of Cardano and Solana, 1Fuel is emerging as a major disruptor in the blockchain space, offering cross-chain transactions and real-world utility. Table of Contents 1Fuel: The multi-chain solution with massive growth potential Solana traders eye $500 this cycle Can Cardano top $5 in 2025? Conclusion Cardano and Solana have long been competing for dominance in blockchain innovation. Each protocol offers unique solutions for scalability and efficiency. A new protocol has emerged, adding to the options in the space: 1Fuel’s exchange. With seamless cross-chain transactions and real-world utility, 1Fuel is turning out to be a strong contender. As its presale gains momentum, investors are beginning to see why this new exchange could be a smart choice. 1Fuel: The multi-chain solution with massive growth potential Early Cardano and Solana investors know the value of getting in early, and many are now turning to 1Fuel (OFT) for their next big opportunity. With over $1.7 million raised in presale and a 500% surge predicted before launch, 1Fuel is shaping up a leading crypto in 2025. Unlike Cardano and Solana, which focus on single-network scalability, 1Fuel offers seamless cross-chain swaps across 10+ networks, all within a single app. Investors don’t have to worry about complicated bridging processes; transactions happen effortlessly in the background. Security and privacy are also major strengths, with a built-in privacy mixer and cold storage ensuring full control over assets. Investors benefit from a 20% purchase bonus during presale and staking rewards of up to 30% APR, turning holdings into a passive income stream. With analysts predicting a 20x surge by 2025 end, investors are securing 1Fuel tokens before Stage 3 ends. You might also like: XRP, SHIB hold strong while positive market buzz fuels 1Fuel’s presale Solana traders eye $500 this cycle Solana surged past $230 on Friday, driven by speculation surrounding an early approval for a Litecoin ETF. The price jump caught many short traders off guard, leading to over $217 million in liquidations. Despite briefly pulling back from its $235 peak, Solana remains in an uptrend, with investors eyeing the $250-$265 range. The key resistance sits at $240, while support at $231.44 is holding firm. If bullish momentum continues, a short squeeze could propel Solana higher. However, failure to maintain above mid-Keltner levels may expose it to a retracement toward $194.49. Market optimism, fueled by ETF chatter and Fed rate discussions, remains a crucial factor in Solana’s next move. Can Cardano top $5 in 2025? Cardano has shown resilience despite a recent whale sell-off of 180 million Cardano, which pushed its price from $1.14 to $0.93. As of writing, Cardano recovered slightly, trading at $0.934, suggesting reduced selling pressure and a potential rebound. If whales resume accumulation, Cardano could break past $1.00 and aim for $1.15. However, further whale sell-offs may create resistance and slow growth. Technical analysis shows that Cardano is stuck in a parallel channel, with bullish momentum supported by an RSI golden crossover. A drop below $0.90 could trigger a bearish trend. Whale activity remains key in shaping Cardano’s price trajectory in the coming weeks. Conclusion While Cardano and Solana continue to battle for dominance, 1Fuel’s new exchange is proving to be a serious contender in the space. With seamless cross-chain transactions, enhanced security, and real-world usability, it offers smart solutions. As its presale surges past $1.7 million and analysts predict massive growth, 1Fuel is emerging as a promising option. To find out more about 1Fuel presale, visit its website, Telegram, and Twitter.

33767162,[object Object],1738576568,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Trump Tariffs Crash Bitcoin and Stocks. But Presales like Meme Index Can Survive and Thrive,https://bitcoinist.com/trump-tariffs-crash-btc-presales-can-survive/,"Bitcoin ($BTC) now trades at $95K after briefly touching $92K for the first time in three weeks. Out of the 100 top tokens, only four recorded minor 24-hour gains, including $FARTCOIN with an 8% increase (huh). The reason? Investors panic-sell on the back of Trump’s tariff war with Canada and Mexico. The stock market suffered a similar fate as S&P 500 futures dipped 1.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average spiraled by 1.5%. Is the meltdown warranted, or is there more to Trump’s plan than meets the eye? Tit-for-Tat: Trump’s Trade War Escalates First, context. Trump hit Canada and Mexico with 25% tariffs , excluding Canadian energy resources that are subject to a 10% levy, warning it could get a lot worse. China will pay a 10% duty on US imports. In response, Justin Trudeau counter-slapped the US with a 25% tariff. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum also promised to push back but didn’t yet specify the levy. The bottom line: everything just got a lot more expensive. You might not have to pay more for a new Ford F-150, but wait until you see prices on those Mexican avocados you buy for breakfast. And when the time comes to fill up your Ford’s tank, you might find gasoline also became pricier – because 60% of oil in the US comes from Canada. It’s easy to see why risk-averse investors decided to take their crypto profits and, perhaps, reinvest in safe-haven assets (Gold? Cash under the mattress?). The CoinMarketCap 100 Index fell by 8.28%, and market sentiment crossed the Fear territory for the first time since October. A Gambit to Reshape the Global Monetary Order? Now, let’s think – why does Trump need tariffs in the first place? In a nutshell, tariffs are a tool to force a restructuring of the global monetary system. The dollar being the most common reserve currency means three things: The dollar is structurally overvalued The US must maintain trade deficits to supply global dollar needs US gets cheaper borrowing costs Trump wants to keep yields low while also lowering the dollar value. Countries would then have to reduce their short-term dollar bill reserves and hold longer-term Treasury bonds instead. Triffin dilemma at its finest – a strong dollar is a headache for US exporters. A weaker dollar could make US exports more competitive and reduce US refinancing risk. But how Traditional inflation hedges like gold would also plunge due to global currency debasement. Crypto exists outside the traditional financial system and thus offers a unique alternative. And not just for retail investors – banks and governments, too, might increase crypto exposure because all that capital from dollar reserves needs to flow somewhere. This theory ties perfectly with Senator Lummis’ recent proposal for the US to purchase 200K $BTC annually for five years to create a strategic reserve. Meme Index ($MEMEX) Manages Meme Coin Risk in Uncertain Times Ultimately, Trump’s economic agenda is a complex and far-reaching scheme that will drive crypto adoption in the long run, whether intentionally (most likely) or not. So when, not if, the market recovers, altcoins will surge to new heights. Presale tokens are particularly resistant to this temporary storm. Their low prices offer a cushion against downturns and greater upside potential upon recovery. Namely, Meme Index ($MEMEX) , which raised $3.2M in funding since December, takes a unique approach to risk management. No longer are indexes a Wall Street tool – degen traders can now diversify their meme coin portfolios with four baskets catered to different risk appetites. By spreading investment across eight projects instead of going all-in on one, you offset potential losses and generate higher returns. $MEMEX token holders gain access to all four Meme Index baskets and the right to vote on project development proposals. One $MEMEX now costs $0.0158443. This is the best time to buy $MEMEX at a discounted price. When $MEMEX launches on exchanges and Meme Index rolls out its platform, the token could hit $0.074 , a 368% increase from the current level. And given the market’s cautious future outlook, Meme Index’s focus on mitigating risk is likely to drive demand for $MEMEX for years to come. Is The Great Rotation Underway? When bulls see red, they buy the dip. Today’s charts might be scary, but Trump’s tariffs will ultimately benefit crypto in the long run. Restructuring of the global economy is rarely, if ever, easy, but capital flowing out from fiat and commodities will likely end up in the crypto market. Meme Index ($MEMEX) is set to launch just in time to capitalize on this influx of new capital and provide newcomers with a less risky way to invest in meme coins. However, we remind you that no gains are guaranteed, so DYOR and only invest as much as you can afford to lose.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-03 09:56:08

The Shiba Inu price faces significant resistance while Dogecoin displays recovery signals and Pepeto brings innovative features for continued growth in the market. The analysis of the most successful memecoin demands an examination of their current price movements and market sentiments because their performances continue to change at different speeds. Shiba Inu Faces Bearish Pressure After Major Rally The price of Shiba Inu increased more than 100% during November 2024 before its market momentum faded when it approached the $0.000033 resistance barrier. The price erosion surpassed 40% until it reached the $0.00001855 support area. A weak market demand emerged after prices decreased and sustained the coins inside the $0.00002049 to $0.00002465 range for weeks. The price dropped below its previous trading level last week, which suggests a potential decrease in value. The previous day, SHIB experienced a 1.34% price increase that allowed it to reach $0.00001859, while its trading activity rose by 21.5%. The recent upward movement of SHIB has not managed to surpass the 200-day simple moving average, which suggests additional price declines could occur. The price may fall to $0.00001596 support unless the market experiences contrasting movement. Although SHIB holds investors in a state of watchfulness because it has not produced any substantial indication of turnaround. The continuously negative trend suggests SHIB might face difficulties maintaining lasting strength in its price action. Dogecoin Shows Recovery Potential Amid ETF Speculation Dogecoin struggled in December 2024, dropping 27.27% from $0.44 to $0.32. However, DOGE rebounded by 21.87% in early January 2025, reaching $0.39 before falling back to $0.33. Despite this volatility, analysts suggest that a potential Dogecoin ETF could trigger a significant price surge. Crypto market analyst Ali Martinez has predicted that a DOGE ETF could push the price toward $15. His analysis indicates a bullish pattern forming on Dogecoin’s price chart. Although speculative, this prediction has fueled optimism among investors looking for the next major rally. The current price fluctuations reflect uncertainty, but DOGE maintains strong community backing. If ETF approval materializes, investor interest could drive a substantial price increase. Until then, DOGE remains in a consolidation phase, awaiting further catalysts.

The altcoins were obliterated within the past 36 hours or so, with massive double-digit price dumps coming from many of them. BTC Dominance on the Rise It was just three days ago when the primary cryptocurrency stood above $106,000 despite the US Fed’s decision to keep the interest rates unchanged. It cooled off on Saturday and slipped to $102,000, but that was just the start of a more severe correction. Sunday morning turned red after US President Donald Trump imposed taxes on Canada, Mexico, and China, and the subsequent retaliation didn’t take long. BTC slumped from $102,000 to $97,000 but maintained within those levels for most of the day. However, the bears took complete control of the market on Monday morning, and they pushed BTC south hard. Within a few hours, the cryptocurrency plunged by six more grand and dumped to under $92,000, thus losing $10,000 since Sunday morning. It bounced off after that low and now sits above $95,000. Still, its market cap has plunged to under $1.9 trillion. However, its dominance over the alts has gone up to almost 59% on CoinGecko, which is a nearly 3% increase in a day. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Altcoins Bleet Out As BTC’s rising dominance suggests, the altcoins were battered a lot harder. Ethereum went from over $3,000 to under $2,300 before settling at close to $2,600 as of now. Solana and Tron are among the few altcoins with a single-digit price drop on a 24-hour scale now. At the same time, BNB, XRP , DOGE, ADA, LINK, AVAX, XLM, TON, SUI, HBAR, and SHIB have plummeted by double-digits, with losses of up to 23% in the case of ADA. The total crypto market cap lost over $400 billion from top to bottom at one point and now sits just inches above $3.2 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

The White House imposed 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and a 10% levy on China . Canada responded with its own 25% tariff on $106 billion of U.S. goods, with Mexico likely to follow. Analysts at Singapore -based crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote in a Feb. 3 note that Treasury yields bear-flattened, with 2-year yields rising while 10-year yields fell, signaling short-term inflation concerns and “long-term trade war” risks. Equities dropped, gold prices fluctuated, oil spiked, and crypto saw sharp sell-offs. You might also like: Bitcoin will eventually be zero, economist predicts: Here’s when QCP Capital thinks the uncertainty will stick around as President Donald Trump gears up for talks with Canada and Mexico and keeps hinting that new tariffs on the European Union will “definitely happen.” Speaking to reporters Sunday night, Trump repeated his warning to the E.U., saying tariffs are definitely on the table because of a big trade deficit with the bloc. “They don’t take our cars, they don’t take our farm products. They take almost nothing, and we take everything, and then millions of cars, tremendous amounts of food and farm products,” Trump said of the E.U. QCP Capital’s analysts say the decorrelation “reinforces the view that today’s risk-off move is driven by cross-asset portfolio rebalancing rather than a single-asset event.” They also noted the growing gap between New York and London gold prices, which could mean traders are unwinding popular carry trades or facing issues moving gold between vaults.

A large part goes to staking benefits to reward long-term owners, plus a special fund helps list on exchanges or expand the system. As #PEPETO grows in popularity, it shows potential to rival major coins like #Pepe and #WallStreetPepe. Many investors see it as a valuable crypto asset for 2025. Litecoin ETF Gains Regulatory Momentum The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged Canary Capital’s proposal for a Litecoin ETF as a notable step for altcoin ETFs. The agency requested public input, which marks progress toward possible approval. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that this Litecoin ETF sets a record as the first altcoin 19b-4 filing the SEC accepted and leads proposals in the altcoin sector. A new path opened as many similar ETF applications met rejection or withdrawal because of regulation rules. The SEC’s acceptance shows interest in reviewing altcoin funds besides Bitcoin or Ethereum which could affect the crypto market. The question remains if the SEC needs all 240 days to review or decide earlier. Why PEPETO Stands Out Among Crypto Investments A Litecoin ETF approval marks a shift in regulations but Pepeto presents a better chance for growth. The meme coin space has many competitors or new tokens yet #Pepeto stands out with its tech along with straightforward plans for expansion. A decentralized exchange without fees makes it different from other platforms plus its bridge connects multiple chains with ease. Pepeto proves to be the best meme coin to buy. The token design supports market stability next to rewards for holders as well as lasting value. Many meme coins depend on quick fame to gain value but Pepeto builds a system that aims to last. The project shows promise to become a top crypto choice by 2025 or lead future meme tokens. Conclusion The SEC accepted the Litecoin ETF proposal which marks a notable advance for institutions to adopt altcoins and makes LTC more accessible to markets. However, rules and approvals do not always lead to better profits. PEPETO is a better choice for people seeking high returns with its fast-selling presale and exchange without fees or taxes and modern blockchain tools. A presale total above $4 million, aiming toward $5 million, shows #PEPETO’s worth extends past typical meme coins. As Litecoin moves through ETF procedures, #PEPETO keeps its place as the best meme coin to buy.

Analyst Comments on the Situation, Explains Its Impact on BTC!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoins-korean-premium-reaches-10-month-peak-analyst-comments-on-the-situation-explains-its-impact-on-btc/,"After US President Donald Trump imposed new customs duties on Canada, Mexico and China, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins experienced sudden and sharp declines. While BTC fell to $91,000 levels, the difference between the Bitcoin price on South Korean exchanges and the price on global exchanges, called the Kimchi premium, reached 10% in the Asian morning hours on Monday. According to CryptoQuant data, the Bitcoin kimchi premium reached 9.7% on Monday morning in South Korea. This is the highest South Korean premium since April 14, 2024, when the kimchi premium rose above 13%. This premium is due to the fact that the South Korean cryptocurrency market is closed to foreign investors. While local investors buy large amounts of BTC from foreign exchanges for arbitrage purposes and aim to profit from the price difference, it is difficult for them to pocket their actual profits due to South Korea’s strict capital controls. Presto Research Analyst Min Jung said the following regarding this: “The kimchi premium typically rises in bull markets when Korean investors bid higher, but can also rise during periods of panic selling. This occurs when selling pressure is lower in Korean stock markets compared to global markets. “If selling pressure continues among U.S. investors, the premium could remain high. However, historically, the Kimchi Premium has averaged around 5%. If the market stabilizes and recovers, we could see the premium narrow back to that level.” Jung also noted that the kimchi premium could also rise when asset prices on overseas exchanges drop significantly, adding that a rising kimchi premium is not a positive sign for Bitcoin in the short term. *This is not investment advice.

This move is similar to actions taken by other crypto exchanges like Crypto.com and Coinbase. Meanwhile, Kraken reported a 128% year-over-year revenue increase, reaching $1.5 billion in 2024, and resumed staking services in the US after settling with the SEC. Tether also reported record-breaking $13 billion in profits, driven by its expanding US Treasury holdings, though its market dominance declined. Kraken Announces Phased Delisting of USDT Kraken, one of the world’s leading crypto exchanges, announced that it plans to delist five stablecoins, including Tether’s USDT. The stablecoins will be delisted to comply with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). The move is similar to actions that were taken by other major exchanges like Crypto.com and Coinbase. The exchange will fully remove support for USDT in the European market by March 31, 2025. Alongside USDT, Kraken will gradually phase out PayPal USD (PYUSD), Tether EURt (EURT), TrueUSD (TUSD), and TerraClassicUSD (UST). The company stated that the decision is necessary to ensure compliance with MiCA and to continue providing services to European clients in the long run. Kraken outlined a structured delisting process in line with the European Securities and Markets Authority’s (ESMA) recommendations to prevent any disruptions in the crypto market. Starting Feb. 13, Kraken will set all margin trading pairs involving the affected stablecoins to “reduce-only” mode. This means that European users will only be able to close out existing positions. By Feb. 27, trading for these assets will be limited to “sell-only” mode, preventing new deposits of these tokens but still allowing their sale. Finally, on March 24, Kraken will stop all spot trading for the delisted assets, automatically closing all open orders and exchanging holdings into other assets where applicable. (Source: Kraken ) Clients in the EEA who still hold any of the affected stablecoins by March 31, 2025, will see their balances automatically converted into an equivalent compliant stablecoin. Any future deposits of these assets to existing Kraken addresses will only be available for withdrawal. The changes will impact users in the 30 EEA countries, including Austria, Cyprus, Czechia, Malta, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden. Kraken’s move was made due to a broader regulatory push by European authorities to ensure that all stablecoins in circulation comply with MiCA rules by the first quarter of 2025. The ESMA previously urged crypto asset service providers to avoid abrupt delistings that could lead to market instability. To mitigate these potential disruptions, the agency advised exchanges to implement a gradual process starting with “sell-only” restrictions before fully stopping trading. Kraken is not the only major platform adjusting to MiCA’s new requirements. Crypto.com also recently announced that it will delist USDT and nine other stablecoins. The exchange set a Jan. 31, 2025, deadline for full removal. The exchange stated that users who do not convert their holdings before the deadline will have their assets automatically converted to a MiCA-compliant stablecoin or another asset of equivalent market value. Coinbase, another major US-based exchange, preemptively delisted USDT and other noncompliant stablecoins in December of 2024. Kraken Reports $1.5 Billion in 2024 Revenue Kraken reported $1.5 billion in revenue for 2024, which is an impressive 128% year-over-year increase compared to 2023. The company also disclosed earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $380 million for the year. Kraken saw strong trading activity with $665 billion in trading volume conducted by over 2.5 million funded accounts as well. Kraken 2024 financial performance highlights (Source: Kraken ) The release of Kraken’s financials happened after several developments that shaped the company’s trajectory. In November, the exchange decided to shut down its non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace just one year after its launch. Representatives for Kraken explained that the decision was made to redirect resources toward new product offerings and services. The NFT market experienced a big decline in 2024 after sales volumes dropped from around $3.6 billion in January to under $1 billion by September. In December, Kraken was selected by the FTX bankruptcy estate to assist in the distribution of funds to former customers and creditors of the collapsed exchange. The payments are scheduled for the first two months of 2025 and could cause increased trading activity on Kraken’s platform as recipients either cash out or swap their recovered funds. Meanwhile, exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer Bitwise has predicted that Kraken will go public in 2025. This means that the company could list on stock exchanges alongside other major players like stablecoin issuer Circle, financial services firm Figure, and blockchain analytics company Chainalysis. Kraken also resumed staking services for US customers after a two-year pause. The exchange previously stopped its staking program as part of a $30 million settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in February of 2023, after allegations that it offered unregistered securities through its staking platform. Now, residents in 37 US states can access staking for 17 digital assets through Kraken Pro, including Ethereum, Solana, and Polkadot. Tether Reports $13 Billion in 2024 Revenue Despite MiCA uncertainties, Tether reported record-breaking profits of $13 billion in 2024 after expanding its holdings of US government bonds. The company’s US Treasury portfolio is now worth approximately $113 billion. This is due to the increasing demand for USDT, which is backed 1:1 with highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets. The stablecoin’s total market cap stands at close to $139 billion, while Tether’s total reserves exceed $143 billion, according to independent accounting firm BDO . In July, Tether revealed that its Treasury reserves are more than those of all but 17 governments worldwide, including Germany, the United Arab Emirates, and Australia. In addition to US Treasuries, Tether also holds gold and Bitcoin, which contributed to $5 billion of its 2024 profits. The company’s consolidated net equity, representing total assets minus liabilities, stands at $20 billion. Throughout 2024, Tether issued approximately $45 billion in USDT, with $23 billion minted in the fourth quarter alone. Tether also expanded its regulatory footprint by securing a stablecoin issuer and digital asset service provider license in El Salvador, where it has now established its headquarters. Beyond stablecoins, the company also reinvested a portion of its earnings into various sectors, including sustainable energy, Bitcoin mining, data and AI infrastructure, peer-to-peer telecommunications technology, neurotech, and education. (Source: Tether ) Despite its strong financial performance, Tether saw a decline in market dominance in 2024, with its share of the stablecoin market dropping to approximately 65% as rival stablecoin USDC gained more traction. USDC is issued by Circle Internet Financial, and it has a market cap of around $53 billion. It now dominates stablecoin supply on Solana by comprising almost 78% of the network’s stablecoin market. USDC market cap over the past year (Source: CoinMarketCap ) USDC has been gradually gaining ground against USDT since December, particularly due to regulatory concerns surrounding Tether’s compliance with MiCA. Despite this, USDT is still the dominant stablecoin on centralized exchanges, holding an 82% market share.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|USDT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-03 10:10:57

However, a top market expert has revealed key levels for Ripple’s native crypto, predicting a potential crash to below $2. So, here we explore what lies ahead for XRP and the crucial support levels that the crypto must hold. XRP Price Faces Major Threat, Key Levels Identified A renowned analyst recently highlighted XRP’s vulnerability, citing the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) as a crucial indicator. The expert, EGRAG CRYPTO noted that the crypto market downturn has put XRP at risk of a decline, with support levels at $2.30 and $1.90 acting as potential last defenses. “ We could see a drop as low as $2.30, with $1.90 being the last line of defense. ” the expert stated on X. Despite the bearish outlook, they also suggested that this dip could present a buying opportunity, urging investors not to let fear dictate their decisions. Source: EGRAG CRYPTO, X TD Sequential Indicator Adds To Bearish Outlook Another prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez reinforced the bearish sentiment, pointing to the TD Sequential indicator. According to Martinez, this tool had signaled a sell-off a week ago, suggesting traders should have exited earlier to avoid losses. “ The TD Sequential indicator told us to sell $XRP a week ago. We should have listened! ” Martinez explained while sharing an updated price chart. Source: Ali Martinez, X What’s Next For XRP Price? With the crypto market facing heightened volatility, XRP’s next move depends on how it reacts to key support zones. If the token holds above $2.30, it might stage a recovery. However, a break below $1.90 could trigger a deeper sell-off. Notably, XRP price fell 15% to $2.43 during writing, with its one-day trading volume skyrocketing 448% to $35 billion. However, the crypto’s Relative Strength Index is at 34, signaling a bullish momentum ahead for the asset. Despite that, XRP Futures Open Interest was down by 35%, reflecting the bearish market sentiment. XRP Chart Meanwhile, experts remained bullish on the future trajectory of the coin. Despite a massive selloff by the Ripple whales and John Deaton predicting a potential crash ahead, experts predicted a potential XRP price rally to $5 ahead. On the other hand, several experts deem this recent XRP price crash to be due to the recent crypto market crash. However, as per experts, Ripple’s native crypto is poised for a rally ahead, potentially hitting the brief $4 mark.

Its goal is to replace Web2, the current generation of the web that most people still use. Despite this ambition, the development of Web3 has been painstakingly slow. While there are countless Web2 applications in use, only a few Web3 apps have managed to capture attention. However, as developers gain access to more advanced tools, this trend might shift. The slow pace of Web3's growth can be attributed to the steep learning curve developers face. Transitioning from Web2 to Web3 is intimidating, requiring developers to learn new technologies, such as blockchain, because Web3 applications, or dApps, focus heavily on decentralization and have a distinct architecture. Blockchain is pivotal to this decentralization, forming the backbone of every Web3 dApp. For developers, this represents a significant shift since blockchain technology eliminates the need for centralized platforms like web servers and databases. The emphasis on decentralization means Web3 architecture is unique. For instance, Web3 dApps utilize ""smart contracts,"" which are specialized programs written to execute specific logic and serve as the application’s backend. These contracts operate on the same blockchain as the dApp and can automatically carry out actions based on set rules. This architecture is essential for building a more inclusive and transparent digital space, free from censorship and restrictions. It aims to address the main drawbacks of Web2, notably the overwhelming control exerted by tech giants over user data. Interest Exists Although Web3 is promising, it has been a slow journey. Over ten years have passed since Dr. Gavin Wood first introduced the term ""Web3,"" yet most internet apps remain centralized. Some might view the slow progress as a sign of disinterest in a decentralized web, but plenty of evidence suggests otherwise. Significant investments are being funneled into Web3 development. Crunchbase reports that Web3 startups raised $2 billion in funding in the third quarter of 2024, marking a 43% increase from $1.4 billion the previous year. Moreover, there's considerable public interest. According to Google's data, ""Web3"" receives about 200,000 monthly searches. Additionally, many developers are drawn to Web3, with over 34,000 contributing to open-source Web3 projects in 2021, as reported by Electric Capital . These insights suggest that the limited number of Web3 apps isn't due to a lack of interest but rather the challenges developers face when shifting from conventional to decentralized applications. Complexity of Web3 Development A major hurdle for developers is the shortage of tools that simplify the creation of Web3 applications. In the Web2 realm, a plethora of tools exist to assist developers, with the industry reaching a point where little to no coding skills are required to build a functional app. The rise of ""low-code"" and ""no-code"" development tools allows almost anyone to create Web2 applications with ease. Using visual tools like drag-and-drop interfaces, users can assemble their Web2 applications, with the underlying code being generated automatically. This level of automation has revolutionized software development, enabling ordinary business personnel in large companies to develop apps without developer assistance. Low-code tools are now advanced enough to support the creation of a wide range of applications, including websites, mobile apps, and business process management platforms. Conversely, while Web2 development has grown significantly easier, Web3 development has become more challenging due to its "" multichain world ."" Blockchain networks often operate in silos, and there are hundreds of them available for developers, such as Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Cosmos, Fantom, Avalanche, and Polkadot. Each blockchain is a separate environment, trapping its tokens, liquidity, and state data within its application ecosystem. Due to their isolation, it's tough for Web3 dApps to communicate with others on different networks, limiting interoperability and affecting their usefulness. Web3 developers also face a lack of essential infrastructure, forcing them to spend significant time and effort creating their own developer tools and integrations instead of focusing on their dApps. This adds complexity and slows progress. Could Low-Code Be the Solution for Web3 dApps? There are reasons to believe the challenges of Web3 development will not persist indefinitely, as the development ecosystem is evolving. Thanks to innovations like intent-based architectures, the hurdles of dApp creation are gradually being dismantled, making the transition easier for developers. Intent-based architectures allow developers to specify their desired outcomes while the system handles the technical execution. This approach promises to bridge the gaps between different blockchain ecosystems. Instead of manually coding cross-chain processes, a developer can declare their application's goals, and the system will generate the necessary code. One prominent platform utilizing intent-based architectures is Enso Network . It acts as a unifying layer, simplifying smart contract interactions across various blockchains and Layer-2 networks like AppChains and rollups. Enso functions as an ""intent engine,"" allowing developers to outline their intentions. The platform then converts these intentions into actionable workflows that interact with underlying smart contracts on any blockchain, standardizing on-chain actions and eliminating the need for developers to master each network's complexities. 1/ Enso is blockchain shortcuts.By mapping all onchain interactions to a shared engine, Enso lets you focus on your product.Our new identity reflects what we provide: The fastest way to turn your ideas into reality. https://t.co/6V5x3tOLm0 pic.twitter.com/S2fiE54MTr — Enso 🛠️ (@EnsoBuild) January 27, 2025 In essence, Enso acts as middleware, enabling developers to integrate DeFi applications from any blockchain into their dApps seamlessly. It eliminates the need for manual protocol integrations, allowing developers to experiment with various smart contracts, regardless of their hosting blockchain. Enso isn't the only initiative striving for a low-code-like experience in Web3 dApp development. Several other projects are also working to simplify developers' tasks. For example, the recently introduced Aurora Cloud Console offers an easy way for developers and businesses to deploy and manage custom EVM blockchains with just a few clicks, without needing to write complex code. Additionally, new no-code tools have emerged, enabling anyone to create their own memecoin and liquidity pools on popular decentralized exchanges. Concluding Thoughts The rise of these tools indicates that Web3 development tools are finally evolving. By simplifying and abstracting the complexities of dApp development, they are easing the transition from Web2 to Web3. These advancements are opening doors for developers familiar with Web2, allowing them to explore decentralized applications without investing heavily in learning foundational concepts first. While Web3's rise has been sluggish, as these development barriers fall, it's only a matter of time before more developers start delving into the opportunities it presents.

It’s aiming to displace Web2, which is the second-generation of the web and what most people continue to interact with. However, the progress of Web3 development has been slow – agonizingly slow, in fact. While there are millions and millions of Web2 applications in use today, only a handful of Web3 apps get any kind of attention, but that may change as developers get access to more capable tools for building them. One of the reasons for Web2’s slow pace of development is that there’s a steep learning curve involved. As a developer, the transition from Web2 to Web3 is a daunting task that requires them to familiarize themselves with new technologies like blockchain. That’s because the architecture of Web3 apps, known as dApps, is quite different due to its focus on decentralization. Blockchain is the key component that enables this decentralization, serving as the foundation of every Web3 dApp. From the developer’s perspective, this is a big change, as the use of blockchain means there’s no need to integrate centralized platforms such as web servers and databases. Decentralization is the main focus in Web3, and so the architecture has to be different. For instance, Web3 dApps also rely on “smart contracts”, which are programs written in specialist programming languages that contain logic, acting as the backend of the application. These smart contracts, which can automatically execute actions based on predefined rules, are deployed on the same blockchain as the dApp. This architecture is necessary to create a more inclusive and transparent digital ecosystem that anyone can participate in, free from censorship or restrictions. It’s designed to address some of the main shortcomings of Web2, which is characterized by the almost total dominance of big tech giants, leading to centralized control over user’s data. The interest is there While Web3 holds a lot of promise, it has also been a long time coming. It has been more than a decade since Dr. Gavin Wood first coined the term “Web3”, and still the vast majority of internet applications remain centralized. Some might interpret the lack of progress as a sign that people simply aren’t interested in the idea of a decentralized web, but there is a lot of other data to suggest that’s not true. For one thing, there are huge amounts of money being poured into Web3 development. According to Crunchbase, Web3 startups raised $2 billion in funding in the third quarter of 2024, up 43% from the $1.4 billion raised in the same period one year earlier. Moreover, plenty of internet users seem interested. The term “Web3” currently gets around 200,000 hits per month on Google Search, according to the internet giant’s own data. And a significant number of developers are attracted to Web3 too, with more than 34,000 contributing code to open-source Web3 projects in 2021, according to Electric Capital . These data points suggest that the relatively small number of Web3 applications in existence isn’t due to a lack of interest, but rather the difficulty faced by developers in transitioning from traditional to decentralized apps. Web3 development is much more complex One of the main challenges for developers is the lack of available tools to make their lives easier when building Web3 applications. In Web2, there are literally thousands of tools available to help developers, and the industry has evolved to the point where you don’t even need any coding skills to make a functional app. The availability of so-called “low-code” and “no-code” development tools means that anyone who wants to can quite easily build Web2 applications. By using visual tools such as drag-and-drop interfaces, users can simply piece together the components of their Web2 applications, and the underlying code will be automatically generated for them. This level of automation and abstraction has transformed software development, and it’s quite common to see regular business workers in large organizations create their own apps, without the support of developers. Low-code tools have advanced to the point where they lend themselves to building a vast number of apps, including websites, mobile applications, business process management platforms and more. In contrast, while Web2 development has become significantly easier over the years, Web3 development has gotten much harder with the emergence of its “ multichain world ”. It’s often said that blockchain networks operate in silos. These days, there are literally hundreds of blockchains that developers can build on, such as Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Cosmos, Fantom, Avalanche and Polkadot, to name just a few of the more popular ones. Each of these blockchains is an isolated environment, where their tokens, liquidity and state data are trapped within its ecosystem of applications. Because they’re isolated within their own blockchain ecosystem, it’s difficult for Web3 dApps to interact with other dApps located on different networks. This means there is limited interoperability, which impacts the usefulness of dApps. Web3 developers also struggle with a lack of key infrastructure, which means that instead of developing their dApps, they have to spend substantial time and effort creating their own developer tools and integrations. This adds to the complexity of creating dApps and slows down their progress. Low-code for Web3 dApps? There are reasons to think Web3 development won’t always be so difficult though, as the underlying development infrastructure evolves. Thanks to the advancement of new concepts such as intent-based architectures, the challenges of dApp development are slowly being overcome, making the transition much easier for developers. Intent-based architectures enable developers to specify desired outcomes, with the technical execution being abstracted away, so they don’t have to worry about it. It promises to break down the silos between different blockchain ecosystems. So instead of having to write the code to enable cross-chain processes, a developer can simply state what they want their application to do, and the system will write the code that enables this for them. One of the leading platforms in terms of intent-based architectures is Enso Network , which acts as a unifying layer that abstracts away smart contract interactions across various blockchains and Layer-2 networks like AppChains and rollups. It can be thought of as an “intent engine”, allowing developers to describe their desired outcomes or define their intentions. Enso then translates these intents into an actionable workflow that will interact with the underlying smart contracts across any blockchain. In this way, it’s uniquely able to standardize on-chain actions, eliminating the need for developers to understand the intricacies of each individual network. 1/ Enso is blockchain shortcuts.By mapping all onchain interactions to a shared engine, Enso lets you focus on your product.Our new identity reflects what we provide: The fastest way to turn your ideas into reality. https://t.co/6V5x3tOLm0 pic.twitter.com/S2fiE54MTr — Enso 🛠️ (@EnsoBuild) January 27, 2025 In other words, Enso is a kind of middleware that allows developers to embed DeFi applications on any blockchain directly into their dApps, without any complexity. It removes the need for manual integration of different protocols, allowing developers to experiment with any kind of smart contract, regardless of the underlying chain it’s hosted on. Enso isn’t alone in its efforts to bring a low-code-like experience to Web3 dApp development. Various other initiatives are looking to make lives easier for developers. For instance, the recently launched Aurora Cloud Console provides a simple way for developers and businesses to deploy and manage customized EVM blockchains in a few clicks, without having to write any troublesome code. Moreover, we’ve also seen the emergence of no-code tools that enable anyone to create their own memecoin along with liquidity pools on popular decentralized exchange platforms. Final thoughts The emergence of these tools suggests the evolution of Web3 development tools is finally taking shape. By simplifying and/or abstracting away the complexities of dApp development, they’re making the transition from Web2 to Web3 much easier. As a result, they’re paving the way for developers who’re already familiar with Web2 to start exploring the potential of decentralized applications without the need to invest significant time and money in learning the basics first. Web3 has been slow to get off the ground, but as the barriers to development come crashing down, it’s only a matter of time until many more developers start exploring the possibilities it enables.

However, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is emerging as a potential game-changer, with analysts predicting a breakout of up to 50,000%. What Makes THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Stand Out? 1. Limited Supply for Maximum Value: With a total supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN leverages a deflationary model to ensure scarcity and drive demand. This gives it a major edge over tokens like Solana (SOL) and Kaspa (KAS), which have higher supply and more gradual demand growth. 2. Exclusive Sale Platform: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is only available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN , adding an exclusive appeal that many competitors lack. Unlike Solana or Optimism (OP), which are widely traded, this controlled distribution creates a sense of urgency for early investors. 3. Early-Stage Momentum: Raising $1 million within minutes, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven its market appeal. With predictions of a 50,000% increase, it’s capturing attention as a high-potential token for investors seeking exponential returns. How It Stacks Up Against the Competition Solana (SOL, $25.01): Known for speed and scalability, but it lacks the exclusive presale advantage and early momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS, $0.12): A rising star in blockchain, yet its growth doesn’t match the explosive potential seen in this new token. Optimism (OP, $1.72): A solid project for scalability, but it’s overshadowed by THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s unique market positioning.

Virtuals Protocol ( VIRTUAL ) has seen a sharp reversal in its price, dropping to around $1.30 after a brief but significant 28% surge following a recent announcement by South Korea’s leading crypto exchange Upbit that it would list the token. Read more: Are Trump tariffs crashing crypto? Virtuals Protocol, Bittensor, Neo, Jasmycoin among top laggards On Jan. 31, Upbit announced the listing of VIRTUAL across multiple trading pairs, namely KRW, USDT, and BTC. The announcement exposed the token to South Korean traders, pushing the price up to $2.61 during European trading hours. However, the price hike has proven to be short-lived. As of the latest CoinMarkecap data , VIRTUAL price has shaved 50% off its post-listing peak in the last 24 hours. On the broader weekly and monthly timeframes, it’s down by 30% and 68% respectively. VIRTUAL’s market cap has also suffered a 31% decline over the past week, placing it among the hardest-hit AI tokens. However, AIXBT and AI16Z , the two of its major competitors, have suffered even steeper losses: -43% and -45% respectively. On a more optimistic note, VIRTUAL’s liquidity remains strong at $66.77 million, according to cookie.fun data . Additionally, its 24-hour trading volume has seen a nearly 7% increase—though whether this reflects a renewed buying interest or panic selling pressure remains to be seen. However, a recent X post by Kyle Chasse may offer some insight on the matter. In his recent post on X, Chasse hinted that VIRTUAL is “doing something special,” with the context suggesting that he’s bullish on the token and the broader AI agent narrative, in general.

Austin King, co-founder of Omni, recently shared his insights on how Ripple’s approach goes far beyond stablecoin adoption, paving the way for XRP Ledger (XRPL) to become a central hub for tokenized finance. Beyond Stablecoins: Ripple’s Vision for XRP Ledger According to King, the launch of RLUSD is merely the starting point of a much larger strategy that could unlock exponential growth for XRP. He highlighted that RLUSD has already facilitated over $300 million in turnover and is being actively integrated by financial teams working with Omni . However, this is just the beginning of Ripple’s broader expansion into the tokenized finance sector. King emphasized that Ripple’s roadmap is unfolding in calculated phases. After successfully deploying RLUSD, the company is now targeting larger financial assets. An example is Ondo Finance’s recent announcement to introduce tokenized treasury bills on the XRPL. This marks a crucial step in bridging traditional finance with blockchain technology. From Tokenized Stablecoins to a Multi-Trillion-Dollar Market King outlined a phased approach that could see XRPL become a key infrastructure for institutional-grade tokenization: Establishing the Foundation: RLUSD is a proving ground for XRPL’s ability to handle tokenized assets. Scaling Up with Low-Risk Assets: Ripple is now moving toward tokenizing traditional financial instruments like T-bills, which already represent trillions in value. Expanding to High-Value Markets: The next phase involves tokenizing debt and equities, unlocking tens of trillions of dollars in on-chain value. Integrating Advanced Financial Products: Eventually, Ripple aims to integrate derivatives and other complex financial instruments into XRPL, a move that could add trillions to the ecosystem. This progressive strategy aims to integrate real-world assets into blockchain-based systems, positioning XRPL as a fundamental layer in the future of finance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 How XRP Becomes a Global Financial Powerhouse King believes that Ripple’s plan is about capturing stablecoin market share and creating a self-sustaining economic engine. He describes a “flywheel effect” in which XRP continuously fuels more tokenization, attracting further institutional adoption. As more entities tokenize assets on XRPL, Omni and other financial platforms will facilitate their integration into the broader on-chain economy. This will encourage even greater participation, making XRP a pivotal player in the global economic infrastructure. With this compounding effect in motion, XRP has the potential to move beyond its current market position and unlock a scale of value creation that is orders of magnitude greater than what most observers anticipate. A New Era for XRP and the Digital Asset Economy Ripple’s financial innovation approach sets the stage for a transformative shift in asset management, transfer, and trading. By leveraging RLUSD as a gateway, Ripple is methodically expanding into a trillion-dollar opportunity that positions XRPL at the heart of the next-generation financial system. As the industry watches this vision unfold, it is increasingly clear that Ripple’s ambitions extend far beyond stablecoins. The company is building an infrastructure that could redefine the very nature of finance, with XRP poised to benefit from an unparalleled wave of institutional adoption.

The native token of DeXe Protocol rallied nearly 17.27% on Feb. 3 to hit an intraday high of $23.22 as the major cryptocurrencies struggled to recover from a market-wide crash triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump’s double-digit trade tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. Bitcoin ( BTC ) fell nearly 6%, while losses were more pronounced across major altcoins. Ethereum ( ETH ) dropped over 16% in the past day, while Ripple ( XRP ), BNB ( BNB ), and Cardano ( ADA ) declined between 10-20%. The total crypto market capitalization had lost roughly 10% of its value in the past 24 hours. In contrast, DEXE was up over 7% when writing, hovering over $22.53. It was also one of the best-performing tokens for the past month, up 26% in January, while its yearly gains extended to 676%. Why is DEXE going up? Several factors are fuelling DEXE’s recent rally. Dune analytics data shows that the number of DEXE holders has steadily increased in recent months across both Ethereum and BNB. As of Feb. 2, 53,768 investors held DEXE, up from 41,391 seen at the end of August last year. Total DeXe protocol users across Ethereum and BNB | Source: Dune You might also like: Top cryptocurrencies to watch this week: Litentry, Flare, Pi Network The bullish momentum was also fuelled by hype surrounding recent ecosystem developments, including DeXe Protocol’s launch on Ethereum, integrating over $1 billion in DEXE tokens into governance via DeXe DAO. Other key milestones included locking the DAO Treasury, introducing staking-governance features for DAOs, and launching staking for DeXe DAO to enhance community engagement. DEXE’s rally coincided with a steady rise in staking activity on its protocol. DeXe protocol’s one-month staking tier held over 11.3 million DEX, the three-month tier held over 2.82 million tokens, and the six-month pool held roughly 690,000 tokens at publication time. By Jan. 30, 20% of the token’s total supply had been staked. Traders were also likely bullish over upcoming developments like the launch of DeXe dApp v2 and key partnerships, as mentioned in its 2025 roadmap unveiled last month. https://twitter.com/DexeNetwork/status/1874727332511993953 Technical analysis DEXE price, 50-day and 200-day MA chart — Feb. 3 | Source: crypto.news In the 1-day DEXE/USDT chart, the 50-day moving average has moved higher above the 200-day MA, suggesting that bulls are currently dominating its market. The Aroon indicator supports this with the Aroon Up at 100% and Aroon Down at 64%, which means the strength of the uptrend is far higher, which could help the rally extend further in the coming days. DEXE Aroon and RSI chart — Feb. 3 | Source: crypto.news Further, the Relative Strength Index at 62 also indicates there’s still room for growth before the asset becomes overbought. If it reaches overbought levels, DEXE could see a small pullback in price before continuing its rally. Hence, DEXE could continue its rally, targeting the next psychological resistance at $25. However, if a reversal occurs, the altcoin will find strong support at $15.8, which aligns with the 50-day MA on the daily chart.

After dropping heavily early last week, the S&P 500 has made a fantastic recovery and now sits very close to its all-time highs. The rebound was largely due to Big Tech stepping up, recording top earnings, and most importantly, reassuring investors that the US is still a leader in AI technology. Apart from Sam Altman, who reposed his faith in OpenAI, Meta and Zuckerberg, too, claimed that they’ll continue investing in AI technology. Meta’s stock jumped 6.4% last week. Even Microsoft, despite its issues scaling AI tech, looked confident as it confirmed continued investments in AI. All in all, DeepSeek might just be a much-needed boost for US AI firms to step up and do better. This also happens to be terrific news for AI projects in the crypto space, who will not only benefit from a dog fight between AI companies worldwide but also from the crypto economy’s overall bullish outlook. If you want to take full advantage of the upcoming AI-crypto rally, here are the 4 best AI agent cryptos you can consider investing into. 1. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Overall Best AI Agent Crypto to Buy In 2025 MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is already among the hottest presales of 2025 – and its popularity (and price) will only increase as the hype and demand for AI agent coins are set to skyrocket post DeepSeek’s launch and Altman’s promise of rolling out even better AI models. $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that interacts with folks on online platforms like X and gauges the broader market sentiment. It then uses cutting-edge AI technology to deliver exclusive trading insights to token holders. MIND of Pepe offers two major benefits to token holders: 1. It offers 100% objective analyses, removing all emotions and bias from ruining your crypto profitability 2. It’s able to identify potentially profitable bets when they’re still at their early stages Currently available for just $0.0032532 per token, investing in $MIND could lead to crazy gains in the upcoming bull run . The project has already raised close to $5M. What’s more, early adopters will also be able to make handsome passive income through the project’s 457% staking rewards. If this is your first time investing in a crypto presale, check out our detailed guide on how to buy $MIND . 2. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance ($FET) – Making AI Development Open & Free to All Artificial Superintelligence Alliance ($FET) is the largest AI crypto project on the market right now – it has a market capitalization of over $1.80B. This reflects its popularity and the vote of confidence from investors. $FET is truly a unique project, seeing as it’s a business alliance between three innovative AI companies: Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol. For context, alliances like this are not common in the AI space, which is still fairly new, meaning every company wants to race past the competition. The goal of this project is to make AI development open-source and free for everyone, offering a decentralized approach to improving AI technology. Not only will this result in more transparency and innovation within the AI economy, but it’ll also level the playing field for smaller, resource-strapped AI companies. 3. ai16Z ($AI16Z) – Ai-Powered Investment Advice to Venture Capitalists Where $MIND aims to offer crypto investment advice to retail traders like you and me, ai16Z is meant to simplify investing for venture capital firms. It will properly vet a company – including studying its financials and mission – to assess whether it’s worth investing into. Not only will this reduce the amount of human labor that goes into studying each prospective investment, but it’ll also massively increase the rate at which investment decisions can be made. Put together, ai16Z can very well be a game changer for venture capitalists. The $AI16Z token is currently trading at $0.38, which is a sizable dip from its all-time highs of around $2.45. However, it’s nearing earlier demand zones (like $0.2), meaning an uptick in price is highly likely from here. 4. Freysa AI ($FAI) – Get Past This AI Agent’s Defense and Win Real Money Freysa AI offers a fun challenge – convince the AI chatbot to send you money and that money will be yours! The tricky part, of course, is that you’re up against an AI agent designed to protect the very prize pool you’re trying to tap into, which is a pot of crypto. Freysa is admittedly tough to crack, but that’s exactly what’s fueling its hype. After all, who doesn’t love a real (and rewarding) challenge! That GTA V mission you’re trying to complete won’t earn you any money, but this will. The platform offers several game variations, each with a different prize pool – ranging from $7K to $50K. Interestingly, a user actually managed to convince Freysa to send him $20,843 by making the AI agent fall in love with him. With a market cap of over $270M, $FAI is currently trading at $0.034, which makes it one of the cheapest cryptos with massive potential. Verdict The larger trend for both crypto and the S&P 500 is expected to be bullish in 2025. Plus, the AI race is heating up, and crypto participants are embracing AI as part of the crypto setup, which is why the 5 AI agent cryptos mentioned above look well set to skyrocket and generate massive gains. However, no amount of market hype should overshadow smart risk management and investment hygiene. This includes only investing an amount you’re comfortable losing and doing your own research before putting your hard-earned money in crypto.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|FET,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-02-03 11:45:22

U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is back in the United Kingdom as it has secured registration with the Financial Conduct Authority, making it the latest exchange to gain approval in the country. The registration allows Coinbase’s U.K. unit, CB Payments Ltd., to offer crypto services directly. The firm is now listed on the FCA’s register under reference number 900635. Coinbase already had a presence in the U.K. through CB Payments Ltd. However, it was not allowed to sell crypto directly. Instead, it acted as a gateway for customers to trade crypto through other Coinbase entities. With the approval, CB Payments Ltd. can now provide both fiat and crypto services under its own structure. You might also like: Coinbase taps four finance, political experts for advisory council For Coinbase, the approval comes despite regulatory scrutiny it faced in July 2024, when the FCA investigated its business over onboarding high-risk customers, which violated earlier restrictions. At the time, the British regulator found that Coinbase Payments Ltd. broke the rules of its restrictions. Coinbase agreed to pay a fine of more than £3.5 million. The exchange claims it has since tightened compliance measures. Coinbase first launched in the U.K. back in 2015, bringing its crypto wallet and exchange services to British customers. At the time, CEO Brian Armstrong described U.K. interest in crypto as “off the charts.” The new registration means Coinbase can now communicate directly with the FCA instead of relying on third-party approval. It also positions the exchange to engage in regulatory discussions, including upcoming rules on staking and stablecoins.

This action was taken after suspending THORFi services on Jan. 23 due to financial uncertainties, as CoinDesk reported. TCY tokens will be distributed at a rate of 1 TCY per dollar of defaulted debt, turning lenders and savers into equity holders. THORChain plans to establish a RUNE/TCY liquidity pool with $500,000 starting at $0.1 per TCY, funded by $5 million from the treasury. Holders of TCY will receive 10% of THORChain's revenue indefinitely, providing a long-term incentive and recovery mechanism for those affected by the debt crisis — although the timeline for total financial recovery remains uncertain.

The question is whether the stock will remain a proxy for Bitcoin or fall like most stock prices. MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin ( BTC ), is down 5.85% in pre-market trading on the heels of a large crypto downturn. Pre-market trading offers insights into market sentiment ahead of official hours. MSTR stock prices fell, revealing fair value gaps (FVGs). Due to crypto market volatility, pre-market activity forecasts another decrease to $317.25. Sourced from TradingView by crypto.news Crypto market chaos On Saturday, Feb. 1, the White House put tariffs of 25% on Mexico and Canada and a 10% tariff on China. As a rebuttal to the tariffs imposed, Canada imposed a 25% tariff on U.S. products. This trade war has given rise to short-term inflations, according to analysts at Singapore-based crypto trading firm QCP Capital. However, on Feb. 3, CoinShares reported that digital asset investment products had inflows of $527 million, although this had mostly fluctuated on news headlines and general market concerns, including the news about DeepSeek . MSTR stocks New filings show MicroStrategy holds over 471,107 BTC, regularly buying more BTC. This technique links the company’s stock performance to BTC’s price. “MicroStrategy’s business is unique in its dual focus: traditional business intelligence (BI) software and Bitcoin investment,” say Oliver Rodzianko , an analyst on Seeking Alpha. In well-regulated markets like stock exchanges, MSTR provides a way for traditional investors to gain BTC’s price exposure without actually owning the asset.

Following this, the Bitcoin price plunged below $95,000 over the past 24 hours after declining nearly 6% in seven days. Considering the present market sentiments, is this a good time to invest in Bitcoin? Moreover, investors are concerned about another potential crypto crash this week! In this article, we have uncovered the market sentiments and possible short-term Bitcoin price analysis. BTC Price Breaks Its Important Support Trendline! The price of Bitcoin has dropped ~5% in 24 hours with a trading volume of $102.53 billion. Moreover, it has lost 6.71% in the last seven days and ~6% over the past month. Further, with a market capitalization of $1.889 Trillion, the Bitcoin price dominates at 60.84%. TradingView: BTC/USDT The Relative Strength Index (RSI) displays a sharp drop toward the oversold range in the daily time frame. Moreover, its average trendline acts as a resistance to the Bitcoin price chart. This suggests an increase in the selling pressure for the largest crypto token in the market. On the other hand, the SMA indicator witnesses a similar price trend in the price chart. This indicates that the price of Bitcoin may continue losing value in the coming time. Will BTC Price Recover This Week? If the bulls regain momentum, the Bitcoin price will retest its immediate resistance level of $98,000. Maintaining the price above that level could set the stage for it to head toward its milestone price of $100,000 this week. On the contrary, if the bears outrun the bulls, the BTC price will retest its important support level of $92,000. Furthermore, if the bearish sentiment intensifies, this could result in the largest crypto token plunging toward its lower support level of $90,000.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) moved into a technical correction, falling by over 16% from its highest level this year. Its drop was mainly due to potential stagflation risks in the United States and its impact on the Federal Reserve. Donald Trump has unveiled wide-ranging tariffs on American, Canadian, and Chinese goods. These tariffs will likely lead to higher inflation as companies are forced to hike prices. As such, the headline and core inflation will likely remain above the 2% target for longer. The tariffs may also impact consumer spending, which is the biggest part of the economy. Many consumers may wait to make big purchases until they have more clarity on the tariffs and the outcome of potential negotiations. The Federal Reserve may maintain higher interest rates for longer, affecting risky assets like Bitcoin and stocks. You might also like: Are Trump tariffs crashing crypto? Virtuals Protocol, Bittensor, Neo, Jasmycoin among top laggards Bitcoin’s crash led to a sharp increase in liquidations as exchanges closed leveraged bullish positions as it dropped. According to CoinGlass, the daily liquidations jumped to almost $400 million, the highest level in weeks. There are three main reasons why Bitcoin price may rebound after Monday’s crash. First, it tends to end the week positively in recent weeks when it falls on a Monday. Second, seasonality data shows that Bitcoin usually rises in February. It has risen in February of the last four consecutive years. The average returns in February since 2013 is about 14%, making it the second-best month after November. Bitcoin price monthly returns | Source: CoinGlass Third, Donald Trump is likely to use the threat of tariffs to negotiate a better deal than he did in his first term. As such, crypto and stocks may rebound when trade talks start, possibly this month. Bitcoin price forecast BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Bitcoin price has moved sideways in the past few months. It dropped to a low of $91,170, a key point where it has failed to drop below since November. This consolidation has led to the formation of a bullish flag pattern, comprising of a long vertical line and a rectangle pattern. Bitcoin price has also remained above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages. Therefore, it will likely have a strong bullish breakout later this month, with the initial target being the year-to-date high of $109,200.

Late Friday, the president imposed a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% on China, provoking retaliatory measures that have reignited a trade war reminiscent of 2018. The consensus on social media and among the analyst community is that this tariff-induced slide in the crypto market is temporary and that bitcoin (BTC) will quickly rebound. However, there are reasons to believe otherwise. Firstly, Trump has shattered the crypto market's belief that he is looking to pump markets and would use small tariffs merely as a negotiating tactic. In fact, he has threatened to increase tariffs if trading partners retaliate. Since Canada and Mexico responded with their own measures, the potential for further tariff hikes looms large. Geo Chen, a macro trader and author of the popular Substack-based newsletter, Fidenza Macro , shared his perspective in an email to subscribers: ""My view is that they will remain in place for several months with the risk of increasing, as Canada has pledged to retaliate and China has initiated a lawsuit against the U.S. in the World Trade Organization. These responses could escalate the situation. The best we can hope for is a partial rollback of tariffs once negotiations conclude."" Chen emphasized that the tariffs are driven by trade deficit concerns rather than the fentanyl crisis, as Trump likes to portray, adding that markets may take days or weeks to grasp this, leading to persistent volatility. Besides, the latest tariffs are on $1.3 trillion worth of goods that the U.S. imports from the three nations, which is seven times bigger in value than the first shot fired in 2018. All this makes the latest episode appear more destabilizing than back then, when the S&P 500 initially dropped 9% from its peak in March before quickly rebounding. In other words, the potential pain may be greater this time around, which poses a challenge for risk-on assets like BTC.

The decentralized exchange generated nearly $4 million in fees over the past 24 hours, and part of the revenue is being used to buy back HYPE, helping support its price amidst a bearish market. Elsewhere, prices of long-forgotten Jeo Boden (BODEN), a parody token mimicking Joe Biden that was worth $1 billion by market capitalization at peak, rose as much as 300% in the past 24 hours. It registered trading volumes of over $8 million, the highest since July 2024, for no immediately apparent reason, which swiftly shifted prices of the once-behemoth token that now has a tiny $3.5 million capitalization. Derivatives Positioning Major altcoins like ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA are seeing negative perpetual funding rates, a sign of dominance of short positions. OM and HYPE tokens stand out with flat open interest-adjusted cumulative volume delta, pointing to a neutral flow. Other tokens exhibit negative CVD, which imply net selling. BTC, ETH short-dated options show a bias for puts, with ETH reflecting greater downside fears relative to BTC.

Despite that, recent Ethereum price action has ETH falling below the $3,000 support. Shiba Inu (SHIB), one of the most popular meme coins based on the Ethereum network, is taking a hit as well. Ethereum Price Losses $3,000 Support The Ethereum price has been stagnant for a long time until now. At press time ETH is trading at around $2,900, falling over 9% in a day. As a result, this failure has led to a broader market downfall. Analysts warn that the future of the Ethereum price is weakened and will potentially continue to fall. Lately, ETH has been known as being a leading indicator of what’s to happen in the altcoin market. The fall in Ethereum price also led to most altcoins falling in price as well. Predictions place ETH to reclaim the $3,200 resistance level, once the Ethereum price consolidates. Shiba Inu Faces Uncertainty Amid Ethereum’s Weakness Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been hit by the ripple effect of the Ethereum price decline. SHIB has seen its bullish momentum recede with current trading price at $0.000015. A large part of SHIB’s potential rally is made possible through community efforts such as tokenization burning which has helped decrease supply and increase scarcity. SHIB’s price, however, still sees some analysts believe it has significant upside potential, suggesting a 5x price rise in the long term. This is because of the growing adoption of Shibarium (Shiba Inu’s Layer 2 blockchain) and other announced partnerships. Analysts claim that SHIB’s rally has been stunted by the Ethereum price. Once ETH rebounds, analysts project Shiba Inu to set a new all-time high. DTX Exchange Gains Traction Amid Ethereum Price Fall As ETH and SHIB struggle, some investors are turning their attention to ICOs with significant potential. As one of the largest $3.2 trillion global trade markets, DTX Exchange is trying to plant its flag as a major player in the space by providing seamless integration of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) with its proprietary hybrid Layer1 blockchain. DTX system is built to facilitate cross asset trading and means users could trade in cryptos, stocks, ETFs, forex and bonds within a single platform. In early funding, the project has raised over $13.4 million and remains a favorite amongst institutional and retail investors due to the potential of DTX token. Priced at $0.16, over 50% of the token supply has been sold. Analysts speculate that DTX tokens could surge up to 10x after being listed on major exchanges like Binance, Bybit, Coinbase and UniSwap. Conclusion: What’s Next for ETH, SHIB, and DTX? Ever since Ethereum’s (ETH) poor price action, the anticipated 2025 altcoin rally has been called into question. We have witnessed a lot of advancements in the SHIB ecosystem, which could set up a rally once ETH consolidates. DTX Exchange is becoming a formidable player with the hybrid trading model which combines the best of centralized and decentralized finance. Audited by SolidProof, Its huge upside potential and impressive fundraising success makes DTX one of the greatest investment opportunities of 2025.

The platform’s decision to restart staking follows recent regulatory changes introduced by the UK Treasury, which came into effect on January 31. UK Treasury Clears Legal Gray Area for Crypto Staking The move is a direct response to an amendment within the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) that clarified the legal standing of crypto staking. Uphold CEO Simon McLoughlin expressed relief over the updated framework, stating that the platform initially halted staking due to unclear regulations. On January 8, the UK Treasury revised financial policies concerning collective investment schemes, a category traditionally subject to strict regulatory scrutiny. The key amendment excluded “arrangements for qualifying crypto asset staking” from being categorized as collective investments, effectively freeing crypto staking from heavy oversight typically reserved for traditional assets like stocks and bonds. According to McLoughlin, the regulatory clarification now provides “welcome certainty” and opens avenues for Uphold and other regulated crypto service providers to reintroduce staking services in the UK . Staking, a process where participants lock up crypto assets to support blockchain operations and earn rewards, has long been a vital component of decentralized networks. With the new regulatory stance, Uphold hopes to enable more UK customers to engage in this activity without legal uncertainty. Global Expansion Plans on the Horizon While the return to staking in the UK is a positive development, Uphold’s services remain unavailable in several key markets, including the United States, Europe, Japan, and Canada. The company has indicated that it plans to relaunch staking in Europe and the US by mid-2025, pending favorable regulatory conditions. McLoughlin remains optimistic about global regulatory advancements, noting that “with a crypto-friendly administration in the US , 2025 looks like a year we could see great progress.” He further emphasized the significance of staking in blockchain ecosystems, stating that recent changes point toward a future where “financial assets stored and managed on blockchains become mainstream activities.” The post Uphold Resumes Crypto Staking in the UK After Regulatory Amendment appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Finance and Business News|Crypto staking UK|Uphold,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|ASIA|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Coin Rise', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecoinrise,2025-02-03 12:00:40

With its record-breaking presale raising $1 million in minutes, it has captured the attention of both experienced and new investors. Analysts agree: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has firmly established itself as a standout token, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) in their early days. How THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Outshines Its Rivals Ethereum (ETH): As a leader in DeFi, ETH remains strong but lacks the explosive appeal of this newly dominant token. Polygon (MATIC): While MATIC focuses on scaling Ethereum, it hasn’t achieved the same market enthusiasm or record-breaking performance. TRON (TRX): Known for its content-sharing applications, TRX’s growth has been steady but cannot compare to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s transformative impact. Arbitrum (ARB): Though a promising Layer-2 solution, ARB doesn’t command the same attention or investor trust. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is Ahead of the Pack 1. Unmatched Presale Success Few cryptocurrencies can claim the level of demand seen by THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . The presale’s $1 million milestone within minutes is a testament to its strong market position and widespread investor confidence. 2. Scarcity Drives Demand With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN ensures sustained demand through its deflationary model. Unlike ETH or MATIC, which face high token circulation, this scarcity gives investors a tangible advantage. 3. Exclusive Market Access Available only at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM , this token’s exclusivity gives early adopters an edge that other widely available cryptos like TRX and ARB can’t replicate. This controlled distribution solidifies its reputation as the go-to investment for those seeking proven opportunities. Are You In? THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven itself as the standout crypto of 2025, setting a new benchmark in the market with its record-breaking presale.

Most recently, Cardano has seen a wave of selling, especially by whales. This pushed its price down 15% from its recent high, hurting its relative position to other crypto assets. At the same time, Avalanche has seen significant developments and is set for major price increases. This puts it in a position to threaten Cardano for its spot among the top 10 in the near future. Cardano Sees Major Whale Selling Cardano (ADA) has seen significant volatility in the past week, as whales offloaded the token. After reaching a monthly high of $1.16 , Cardano experienced a major correction. Now, the token is trading at $0.9457, dropping 15% from the recent high. The likely reason for this correction was the recent increase in whale transactions. Over the past week, whales have sold a cumulative $200 million in ADA. In this context, whales are those traders who own between 1 million and 10 million tokens. Whales have sold more than 180 million #Cardano $ADA over the past week! pic.twitter.com/IMdo12bcgE — Ali (@ali_charts) January 24, 2025 Whale selling is usually a bad sign for the network, as these are typically sophisticated traders or insiders. Still, investors are not giving up on Cardano just yet. Weekly technicals remain bullish , especially the momentum indicators. The overall positive sentiment is likely due to the anticipated Plomin hard fork upgrade, which is boosting investor confidence. Set for January 29, the update will enhance Cardano’s governance, and make the blockchain more efficient. Avalanche Unveils Major Initiatives Like Cardano, Avalanche (AVAX) has experienced a significant correction. After reaching a monthly high of $44.98, Avalanche dropped 22% to $35.44 . The rally to the recent high came after a major network upgrade. The Avalanche9000 mainnet upgrade has generated significant excitement among traders. Notably, the upgrade significantly reduced deployment costs for smart contracts. At the same time, the fees on Avalanche’s C-Chain dropped more than 90%. What is more, Avalanche recently unveiled Avaissance, an NFT initiative supporting artists. The program will provide funding and mentorship for aspiring NFT artists. The blockchain hopes this will boost the network’s NFT space, by promoting quality projects. Still, the technical outlook for Avalanche is neutral. Weekly momentum indicators are mixed , with short-term moving averages turning bearish. Despite weakening momentum, Avalanche’s upgrades reveal strong fundamentals for the chain. Elluminex Set To Transform TON Another token that has recently become viral is Elluminex (ELX) . This DeFi hub for the TON blockchain is positioning itself to become a major DEX on the chain. So far, TON’s DeFi ecosystem has been relatively small, despite the rapid growth of the network. Notably, TON’s Total Value Locked peaked near $800 million last year, registering huge growth. Despite this, a lack of a strong DEX was a major hurdle, with network value seeing a significant correction. Elluminex is working to bridge this gap, by connecting TON to 40 major blockchains. By enabling token swaps across the biggest blockchains, the DEX is working on fixing liquidity issues that discourage traders from joining TON. What is more, its advanced AI features will appeal to all types of investors. Notably, Elluminex is building an AI portfolio tracker, giving real-time actionable insights for traders. These features could make the DEX one of the strongest players in DeFi.

So, how low can the ADA coin go in this broad-based crypto sell-off? Cardano Price Plunges As DeFi TVL Plunges DeFi Llama shows that the TVL in the DeFi industry has crashed to $330 million from the year-to-date high of $593 million. This drop means the network has lost about $263 million in locked assets from the highest level this year. This decline is partly because of the ongoing Cardano price crash. It has also dropped in ADA terms, moving to a low of 413 million ADA tokens, down from this year’s high of 618 million. Cardano DeFi TVL Further data shows that he amount of stablecoins in the network has continued falling. It has moved to about 23 million ADA tokens, down from this year’s high of 25 million tokens. To be clear: other blockchains have shed substantial assets as the crypto sell-off intensifies. For example, Ethereum’s TVL has dropped by over 21% in the last 30 days. Tron, BNB Chain, Base, and Arbitrum’s TVL have dropped by over 15% in the same period. ADA Liquidations Jumped to December Levels The ongoing ADA price crash has also led to a big increase in liquidations. The 24-hour liquidations jumped to almost $32 million, the highest increase since December 9 last year. Cardano liquidations The ongoing Cardano coin plunge is mostly because of the rising fear of inflation in the US after Donald Trump launched tariffs on key trade partners like Mexico, Canada, and China. These tariffs will likely lead to higher inflation and interest rates. ADA Price Analysis: How Low Can Cardano Go? The daily chart shows that the Cardano price has crashed from last year’s high of $1.3282 to a low of $0.5570 on Monday. It moved below the key support level at $0.8285, its lowest level on December 30, and the neckline of the double-top pattern at $1.1645. A double-top is a popular bearish chart pattern. Cardano has also dived below $0.8097, its highest swing in March 2024, while the 50-day and 100-day Weighted Moving Averages (WMA) crossed each other. Key Levels To Watch There are signs that Cardano will continue falling in the near term, with the next target being at $0.5570, its lowest level on Monday, which is about 22% below the current level. A drop below that level will point to more downside to $0.3100, its 2024 low, which is about 55% below the current level. Conversely, the bearish ADA price forecast will become invalid if it moves above the key resistance at $0.8285, the double-top’s neckline.

While Husky ($HUSKY) and Pitbull ($PIT) have their paws in the race, they just can’t seem to catch up with the momentum behind Doge Uprising. With rumors swirling of a Binance listing and whispers that the ex-Baby Doge team might be behind this project, Doge Uprising could be poised for an astronomical 1000x gain in the coming year. Why Doge Uprising is Outpacing Husky and Pitbull Let’s start by breaking down what makes Doge Uprising so special. Unlike Husky and Pitbull, which are essentially just more dogs in the meme coin pack, Doge Uprising offers something different, a compelling narrative, a robust staking system, and real utility that sets it apart from the rest. Staking Rewards: Husky and Pitbull offer staking options, but Doge Uprising takes it a step further by offering passive income opportunities through its unique staking model. Holders of $DUP can stake their tokens and earn rewards, providing incentives for long-term investment. Unlike many meme coins that rely on short-term pumps, Doge Uprising builds a stable ecosystem that ensures its investors are not just riding the hype but actively participating in its growth. Potential for Massive Returns: let’s talk about what really matters, the gains. Rumors are swirling that Doge Uprising could be on the verge of a Binance listing, a huge move that could skyrocket its value. If this happens, it could be the catalyst for the kind of 1000x return that most meme coins only dream about. While Husky and Pitbull have had their time in the spotlight, they lack the same level of intrigue and market buzz that Doge Uprising has built. The whispers of the ex-Baby Doge team being behind Doge Uprising only add to the excitement. Baby Doge was one of the most successful meme coins of the past few years and if the same masterminds are involved with Doge Uprising, investors have every reason to be excited for a potential moonshot. Don’t Miss Out on the 2025 Opportunity If you’re still hesitating about jumping into Doge Uprising, now is the time to act. The presale is rapidly filling up and $DUP tokens are still available at incredibly low prices. As soon as the Binance listing and staking rewards kick in, you could see the price of $DUP explode and by then, it will be too late to get in at these prices. Investing in Doge Uprising now could be your ticket to a massive ROI, especially when you consider how quickly the market is moving. If you’re looking to see a return on investment that could rival the gains of the best meme coins in the market, Doge Uprising is your best shot in 2025. Why You Should Fear Missing Out The meme coin market is notoriously volatile but Doge Uprising has the potential to outperform the likes of Husky and Pitbull, simply because it’s more than just another token with a dog picture. The combination of staking rewards, a compelling narrative, and whispers of insider moves like a Binance listing means that Doge Uprising is destined for massive success in 2025. Imagine watching it 1000x while you stand on the sidelines, regretting not getting in sooner. Don’t let that happen. Act now, and get your hands on $DUP before the next big rally. This coin has all the makings of the next breakout star, and you don’t want to miss it. Get in now, stake your $DUP and prepare for the revolution because Doge Uprising is about to lead the pack.

However, intraweek flows reflected volatile investor sentiment, heavily influenced by broader market concerns like the DeepSeek news.” Entries Have Decreased! When looking at individual crypto funds, it was seen that the majority of inflows were in Bitcoin. While BTC experienced an inflow of $486 million, Ethereum (ETH) experienced a small outflow of $0.3 million. When we look at other altcoins, XRP saw an inflow of $14.7 million, Chainlink (LINK) $3.1 million, and Solana (SOL) $4.5 million. “Bitcoin saw a total inflow of $486 million last week and short Bitcoin saw a total inflow of $3.7 million for the second week. Ethereum ended the week with net zero flows but struggled earlier in the week, likely due to greater exposure to the tech sector and the global growth outlook. XRP is currently the 2nd best performing altcoin and has seen $105 million in YTD inflows with around $15 million in the past week. When looking at regional fund inflows and outflows, it was seen that the USA ranked first with an inflow of 474 million dollars. After the US, Switzerland and Germany also experienced inflows of $57.9 million and $22.3 million respectively. Against these inflows, Canada and Sweden saw smaller outflows of $43 million and $3.6 million, respectively. *This is not investment advice.

Many investors are now wondering whether this is the beginning of a new bear market or a substantial short-term liquidation event. Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart As the daily chart suggests, the Ethereum price dropped all the way back to the $2,100 level before experiencing a rebound. The $3,000 level and 200-day moving average, located around the same price mark, has been broken to the downside yesterday. This has been one of the primary contributing factors to today’s crash, at least on the technical side of events, as the 200-day moving average is a key trend indicator, and if the market fails to climb back above it soon, a longer and even deeper correction could be expected. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour chart, it is evident that the price has recently tried to break above the large falling wedge pattern, but the breakout was a fake one. This bull trap has led to a considerable drop, as the $2,800 level is also lost and can now be seen as a resistance zone. Therefore, if a quick recovery does not occur, a consolidation between the $2,800 and $2,400 levels is likely for the upcoming weeks. Sentiment Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Ethereum Open Interest While Ethereum’s price action indicated some clues that were pointing to today’s market crash, more research has to be done on the underlying market dynamics. Analyzing the futures market metrics can provide a distinct picture of the current situation. This chart presents the ETH price and the 7-day exponential moving average of the open interest metric, which measures the total number of open perpetual futures contracts on centralized exchanges. As the chart demonstrates, while the asset has experienced a massive drop, the open interest is still not showing a significant decline. Therefore, if the crash is to be seen as a liquidation cascade, the futures market has not cooled down yet, and there could be more liquidations and drops in the short term in case the current selling pressure persists.

Trump’s tariff war triggers crypto selloff The cryptocurrency meltdown coincided with U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of new trade tariffs , imposing a 25% levy on Canadian and Mexican imports and a 10% tariff on Chinese goods. The move triggered widespread fears of a prolonged global trade war, sending financial markets into turmoil and prompting investors to offload risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. The fallout was immediate, with the global cryptocurrency market cap plunging to $3.25 trillion, down 8.8% in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin saw one of the steepest declines, dropping from highs above $105,000 on January 31 to $95,145 at press time, while Ethereum fell 16%, trading at $2,583 at press time.

Rexas Finance (RXS): A Rising Star with Massive Growth Potential Although Rexas Finance (RXS) is a recent addition to the scene, institutional investors and crypto aficionados have already examined it. In its last presale stage, RXS costs $0.20; its official launch date is June 19, 2025, at a listing price of $0.25. Selling 437.9 million tokens during its presale, the project has already generated over $43.5 million. Rexas Finance distinguishes itself with its environment driven by usefulness. With a token builder and launchpad on the platform, developers may quickly start and execute unique blockchain initiatives. Blockchain technology is more accessible and valuable for a broad spectrum of users since this capability meets a fundamental demand in the crypto scene. Furthermore, the Certik-audited security system of the platform guarantees a safe and reliable surrounding, therefore boosting investor trust. Whale activity fuels the frenzy around RXS even more since big investors are stockpiling tokens expecting its introduction. Rexas Finance is a good option for people looking for exponential returns since market analysts estimate it could show a significant price increase after introduction. RXS can turn a $400 investment into thousands in a few years thanks to its creative elements, robust presale performance, and growing demand. Solana(SOL): The Speed King of Blockchain Solana is known for its low costs, scalability, and fast transaction speed. Due to its thriving ecosystem and rising usage, distributed apps and non-fungible token projects are now preferred. Solana's price has grown from around $1 to over $250 at its peak in recent years. Driven by Solana's ongoing expansion and increasing use cases, analysts estimate that 2025 Solana might reach $500 to $700, but the present price is about $258. In view of these robust credentials, expanding user base, and increasing adoption, Solana continues to be an excellent choice for investments with an eye for long term expansion in the cryptocurrency world. Ethereum(ETH): The Undisputed DeFi Leader With a massive ecosystem of distributed apps, DeFi platforms, and NFTs, Ethereum is the frontrunner in the innovative contract scene. It now forms the basis for most innovation occurring in the blockchain realm. Over the years, Ethereum's price has also appreciated noticeably, reaching a high of over $4,800. Driven by significant institutional acceptance and ongoing innovation, economists estimate Ethereum might surge to $7,500 in 2025, but its current price is roughly $3,395. Ethereum is still a pillar of the crypto scene and a wise investment choice for anybody looking for long-term expansion, given its well-known position in the market, excellent community support, and continuous development.

The development comes as token investments continue to attract growing interest from investors, according to a recent report by the Bangkok Post. Jomkwan Kongsakul, deputy secretary-general of the Thailand SEC, highlighted the regulatory body’s efforts to modernize the capital market by leveraging advanced technologies. “The SEC is leveraging technology to enhance efficiency in the capital market by promoting an electronic securities ecosystem,” Kongsakul said. She added that the regulator is preparing new rules to support the issuance of electronic securities and facilitate online debenture purchases. Full Digitalization of Bond Trading The Thai SEC’s forthcoming DLT platform will encompass both primary and secondary bond markets, handling critical processes such as settlement, trading, payment systems, investor registration, and multiple blockchain support. Although the regulator did not specify the blockchain networks involved, Kongsakul hinted at interoperability, stating, “In the future, there may be multiple chains for trade. Trading through DLT on all systems is connected by a shared ledger, which is expected to be completed soon.” Two categories of securities are set to be launched under the new system: tokenized traditional securities and digital-native electronic securities. Four digital token projects have already received approval to operate on the SEC’s platform, with two additional projects — focusing on green tokens and investment-based initiatives — currently under review. Thailand Eyes Broader Crypto Developments Despite advancements in digital securities, Thailand maintains strict regulations on cryptocurrency usage for payments. Nevertheless, regulators are exploring new possibilities. A Bitcoin payment sandbox is set to launch later this year in Phuket, aimed at providing tourists with an alternative payment method while helping regulators assess associated risks in a controlled environment. Adding to the evolving crypto landscape, former Thailand Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra recently supported stablecoins and asset-backed digital tokens, asserting there was “no risk” in permitting their trade. Furthermore, reports from January suggest that the Thai government is considering launching a stablecoin backed by government bonds, although no official confirmation has been issued.

Introduces $AGNT Token Presale, Disrupts the AI Agent Hype Through Meme Culture appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News On February 1, the presale for $AGNT, Agent A.I.’s native token that fuses meme culture and AI, officially began . Starting at $0.003333, the presale is distributing 20% of the token supply across 28 rounds, leading up to a final listing price of $1. This means that first-round investors would make almost 300x their investment. The $AGNT presale marks an early opportunity to participate in a project that challenges the AI agent hype with humor and transparency. The $AGNT token is compatible with multiple blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Solana, Tron, and more, enabling direct purchases using $ETH, $BNB, $SOL, $POL, and $TRX, as well as stablecoins like $USDC and $USDT. Additionally, fiat purchases in $USD will be supported, eliminating the need for prior fiat-to-crypto conversion. Acquiring $AGNT is a simple process. Users will need to use MetaMask or Trust Wallet, select the appropriate network, link their wallet, specify the amount of $AGNT they wish to purchase, and confirm the transaction in just a few steps. $AGNT Roadmap and Tokenomics The $AGNT token has a total supply of five billion with one million tokens (20%) allocated to the presale. This distribution ensures that presale participants have a significant opportunity to benefit from their early-bird status while maintaining a balanced supply to avoid market flooding. Following the presale, the Token Generation Event (TGE) will take place, after which $AGNT is set to be listed on tier-1 exchanges to enhance liquidity and expand market availability. To facilitate smooth trading activity, 10% of the total supply will be reserved for liquidity, ensuring a steady and active market environment. Beyond liquidity provisions, the token allocation includes 25% for staking rewards, giving holders an additional way to earn within the ecosystem. Additionally, 5% of the supply is designated for community initiatives and airdrops, promoting engagement and wider adoption. Another 15% is set aside for Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) to support strategic partnerships and market expansion. The project follows a structured roadmap, beginning with recruitment and training, which focuses on the token launch, early ecosystem development, and building strategic partnerships. As the ecosystem grows, the next phase will introduce staking mechanisms and further network development to enhance participation and engagement. Finally, Agent A.I. is committed to a long-term plan, focusing on widespread adoption and continuous advancements in AI-driven solutions to ensure lasting growth and sustainability over time. A Meme-Driven Satire on AI Agents Aside from music, films and TikTok trends, investment trends are also going viral, particularly meme coins and crypto AI agents . Agent A.I. presents a unique concept that merges meme culture with AI advancements, creating a project that is both technologically driven and self-aware, but with a satirical take on the growing fascination with AI agents. Positioning itself as the world’s first Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Agent A.I. is designed to solve problems, master tasks, and adapt instantly. It excels in intelligence, creativity, and decision making across any domain. “We’re not here to sell the next big AI revolution – we’re here to expose the smoke and mirrors, have fun, and still bring something of substance,” the Agent A.I. team, with a history of launching high-cap tokens that are currently valued at over $100 million, stated in a Coinpedia commentary. With its spy-themed aesthetic, this project takes a realistic approach, openly recognizing the limitations of AI agents rather than making bold, exaggerated claims.

The ‘Inverse Cramer’ effect is a market theory that dictates that assets recommended by CNBC’s Jim Cramer on his Mad Money show often move in the opposite direction. On January 28, Cramer endorsed Bitcoin’s potential, calling it “a great thing to have in your portfolio.” At the time, the maiden digital currency was trading at $102,840. True to the ‘Inverse Cramer’ phenomenon, Bitcoin has since plunged about 7% as of press time, valued at $95,230, wiping out $50 billion from its market cap in the process. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold It’s worth noting that Cramer has not always been bullish on Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market. For instance, in January 2023, when BTC traded around $16,000, he called it a “phony scam,” claiming crypto prices were artificially inflated. Since then, Bitcoin has seen notable gains over the last two years, hitting a new all-time high above $100,000. Similarly, in January 2024, the TV host warned that Bitcoin was potentially nearing a new price top while advising investors to exit their positions. Interestingly, the maiden cryptocurrency has surged by over 100% since then. What next for Bitcoin’s price Bitcoin is experiencing increased volatility as markets react to uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump’s tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China. Indeed, investors are concerned about the possibility of a global trade war, with Bitcoin dropping to about $92,585 on February 3. These tensions have pushed investors away from risk assets such as BTC contributing to a $2.26 billion wipeout in the cryptocurrency market amid the uncertainties. Cryptocurrency market heatmap.

In this regard, data shared by the cryptocurrency on-chain analysis platform Santiment shows that chatter about “buying the dip” has slowed, indicating that buying pressure might weaken as Bitcoin faces the risk of dropping below $90,000 .

Source: Santiment From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin is showing short-term bearish sentiment, as its 50-day Simple Moving Average ( SMA ) sits at $99,189, while the 200-day SMA at $77,735 suggests a bullish long-term outlook with Bitcoin well above this key level. The Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) at 43.03 signals neutrality—neither overbought nor oversold—though prevailing bearish sentiment and a Fear & Greed Index of 44 suggest caution.

Backed by plans for a lending platform and an overcollateralized stablecoin, Mutuum aims to offer practical financial tools for crypto users. With its token presale set at a low entry price, it has already attracted investors looking for potential gains as the project rolls out more features. Meanwhile, XRP Ledger’s decentralized exchange (DEX) has surpassed $17 million in daily trading volume, according to Ripple’s CEO. This milestone highlights increasing activity around XRP, even as newer projects like Mutuum Finance gain attention in the DeFi space. With both XRP and MUTM making strides, investors are closely watching how these projects will shape the future of decentralized finance. XRP Ledger’s DEX Hits $17M in Daily Trading Volume XRP Ledger’s decentralized exchange (DEX) has recorded $17 million in daily trading volume, marking a significant milestone for the platform. Since its launch in 2024, the DEX has facilitated over $1 billion in total swaps, reflecting its growing adoption among traders. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse highlighted this achievement, emphasizing the steady rise in activity and interest surrounding XRP’s ecosystem. This increase in trading volume aligns with broader developments within Ripple, including the early traction of its stablecoin, RLUSD, and ongoing efforts to secure approval for spot XRP ETFs. With more institutions and retail investors engaging with XRP Ledger, its DEX could continue to see increased usage, reinforcing its role in decentralized finance. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending protocol that seeks to make borrowing and lending simpler for crypto users. Instead of relying on traditional intermediaries, the platform uses smart contracts to match lenders who supply their assets with borrowers who need liquidity. This model allows participants to earn interest or access funds in a more transparent setting. Mutuum’s team is also working on an overcollateralized stablecoin designed to provide greater stability within its ecosystem—each token will be backed by on-chain collateral, aiming to maintain a steady value for users. Mutuum Finance has launched the first stage of its presale at $0.01, the lowest entry point out of eleven phases in total. This early window offers investors an opportunity to acquire MUTM before the planned launch price of $0.06. The project is expected to grow further as it nears key milestones, including a beta version of the platform at launch, exchange listings, and a buy-and-distribute mechanism that fosters ongoing demand for the token. In simple terms, a portion of the fees generated by the platform through lending, borrowing, and other services is used to purchase MUTM tokens on the open market. These tokens are then distributed to stakers, creating ongoing buy pressure. As more users join the protocol and fees accumulate, the cycle intensifies, raising the value of MUTM. This approach provides stakers with consistent rewards while also encouraging users to remain engaged with the platform. Mutuum Finance uses “mtTokens” to represent deposits made into its lending pools. When a user deposits, for example, 2 ETH, the protocol mints 2 mtETH at a 1:1 ratio. Over time, each mtETH gradually becomes more valuable as interest accumulates, meaning depositors can redeem more ETH than they originally supplied. Mutuum Finance reviews each collateral option by considering factors such as asset volatility, liquidity, and overall risk, aiming to protect both depositors and the system. The platform assigns each token a Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, reflecting how much a user can borrow relative to the collateral’s worth. For instance, if the LTV for ETH is set at 70%, pledging $1,000 in ETH lets you borrow up to $700 in another asset. When borrowers use multiple types of collateral, Mutuum calculates a weighted LTV by converting each deposit into a shared reference value. This structure ensures that risk is managed effectively, while still giving users a degree of flexibility in how they secure their loans. Although XRP’s DEX continues to grow, Mutuum Finance stands out for its early-stage potential and clear utility. With a presale price at just $0.01, along with the promise of a lending platform, stablecoin, and buy-and-distribute mechanism, it offers a compelling opportunity for those looking to enter at a ground level. By joining now, investors may benefit from upcoming milestones that could increase both visibility and demand for the MUTM token.

At the same time, the decentralized exchange (DEX) on the XRP Ledger has achieved over $17 million in daily trading volume, as reported by Ripple's CEO. This achievement underscores growing engagement with XRP, even as fresh ventures like Mutuum Finance capture interest in the DeFi arena. With both XRP and MUTM advancing, investors are keenly observing how these entities will influence the evolution of decentralized finance. XRP Ledger’s DEX Reaches $17M in Daily Trade Volume XRP Ledger’s decentralized exchange (DEX) has hit a noteworthy $17 million in daily trading volume, marking an important milestone for the platform. Since its inception in 2024, the DEX has processed over $1 billion in total swaps, showcasing its rising popularity among traders. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse highlighted this accomplishment, pointing to the continuous increase in activity and interest within the XRP ecosystem. This surge in trading volume coincides with other developments at Ripple, including the initial success of its stablecoin, RLUSD, and ongoing efforts to gain approval for spot XRP ETFs. As more institutions and individual investors engage with XRP Ledger, the DEX is poised to see further growth in use, reinforcing its significance in decentralized finance. Understanding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending protocol designed to streamline borrowing and lending for cryptocurrency users. By leveraging smart contracts instead of traditional middlemen, the platform connects lenders with borrowers seeking liquidity. This setup allows participants to earn interest or obtain funds in a more transparent environment. The team at Mutuum is also developing an overcollateralized stablecoin to offer greater stability within its ecosystem—each token will be backed by on-chain collateral to maintain a stable value for users. Mutuum Finance has initiated the first phase of its presale at $0.01, the most accessible entry point among eleven planned stages. This initial opportunity allows investors to purchase MUTM ahead of the anticipated launch price of $0.06. The project is set to grow as it approaches key milestones, such as launching a beta version of the platform, securing exchange listings, and implementing a buy-and-distribute mechanism that sustains demand for the token. In essence, part of the fees generated from lending, borrowing, and other services is allocated to purchasing MUTM tokens on the open market. These tokens are then distributed to stakers, perpetuating buying pressure. As more participants join the protocol and fees increase, this cycle intensifies, boosting the value of MUTM. This strategy provides stakers with consistent rewards and encourages users to stay active on the platform. Mutuum Finance uses “mtTokens” to represent deposits in its lending pools. For example, when a user deposits 2 ETH, the protocol issues 2 mtETH at a 1:1 ratio. Over time, as interest accumulates, each mtETH becomes more valuable, allowing depositors to redeem more ETH than they initially deposited. Mutuum Finance evaluates each collateral option by assessing factors like asset volatility, liquidity, and overall risk to safeguard both depositors and the system. The platform assigns a Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio to each token, indicating how much a user can borrow relative to the collateral’s value. For example, if the LTV for ETH is set at 70%, pledging $1,000 in ETH allows you to borrow up to $700 in another asset. When borrowers use multiple types of collateral, Mutuum calculates a weighted LTV by converting each deposit into a common reference value. This structure ensures effective risk management while providing users with flexibility in securing their loans. While XRP’s DEX continues to expand, Mutuum Finance stands out for its early-stage potential and clear utility. With a presale price of just $0.01, along with the promise of a lending platform, stablecoin, and buy-and-distribute mechanism, it presents a compelling opportunity for those looking to enter early. By joining now, investors might benefit from upcoming milestones that could boost both visibility and demand for the MUTM token.

39870096,https://coinpedia.org/?p=414647,1738588657,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Why XRP Price is Down Today? How Low Can XRP Crash?,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-xrp-price-is-down-today-how-low-can-xrp-crash/,"The post Why XRP Price is Down Today? How Low Can XRP Crash? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The news of Trump’s Tariff war and Ripple’s 400 million XRP unlock, valued at around $1.136 billion has instantly shaken the market, sending XRP’s price plummeting by over 24.6% in just 24 hours. XRP has dropped over 15% amid the recent crypto market crash , with a top expert predicting a further drop to $1.90. This sudden free fall could be a sign that XRP is about to follow its usual trend in February, a month where it has historically underperformed. According to Cryptorank data, XRP has had an average return of -3.00% in February, only finishing in the green four times since 2014. The best performance came in 2022, with a 26.3% gain, but the pattern still suggests February could be a rough month for XRP. Despite this bearish outlook, experts remain optimistic about XRP’s future, citing key support levels and potential recovery. There is also a growing buzz about XRP ETF approval in 2025 , the closure of the Ripple vs SEC case, and IPO launch making its recovery still possible. Is Ripple (XRP) in a Bear Trap? Renowned analyst EGRAG CRYPTO warned that XRP’s vulnerability could lead to a drop to $2.30, with $1.90 acting as the last line of defense. The 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) has been identified as a crucial indicator in the current market downturn. While the outlook is bearish, the expert suggested that such a dip could create a buying opportunity for investors. Turning down the bull theory, crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, keeps his foot down over XRP, pointing to the TD Sequential indicator, which had signaled a sell-off a week ago. Martinez’s warning underscores the risk of further declines. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pro-XRP Lawyer Deaton Says ‘War Against Crypto Not Dead’, Here’s Why , What’s Next for XRP Price? XRP’s future price movement will depend on how it reacts to support zones. If XRP can hold above $2.30, a recovery may be possible. However, a break below $1.90 could lead to a deeper sell-off. Despite the recent 15% drop to $2.43 and rising trading volumes, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 34 which means a potential bullish momentum ahead. Yet the other factors like XRP Future Open Interest dropped by 35% reflecting bear sentiment to continue. Overall the global market is in a panic state as Trump is delaying the crypto regulations and his move to fix the tariffs is creating tension on a global scale. Experts remain divided on XRP’s immediate future, with some predicting a potential rally back to $4, while others anticipate a more prolonged downturn as the legal case is still not resolved. Despite the sell-off, XRP is still viewed as having long-term growth potential. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

With an increase in institutional interest, notable price movements, and significant developments anticipated, these digital assets are becoming increasingly appealing to those searching for lucrative opportunities. Litecoin (LTC) has experienced a 25% price increase after Grayscale’s filing for a Litecoin ETF, sparking renewed interest in this cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has risen 7.5% to reach $3,421, reclaiming a crucial support level as speculation about an Ethereum ETF continues to build. As Bitcoin surpassed $105,000, it has propelled gains across various altcoins, with Solana and XRP also seeing upward trends. Adding to the excitement, BlockDAG (BDAG) has made a significant impact with its presale, raising an impressive $191.5 million. Analysts forecast that BDAG could hit $1 within a year, positioning it as an attractive option for those seeking substantial returns. With planned price increases and upcoming exchange listings, BlockDAG’s potential for growth remains robust for 2025 and beyond. Litecoin Jumps 25% Following Grayscale’s ETF Application Litecoin (LTC) has seen a notable 25% price increase following Grayscale’s application for a Litecoin ETF, reigniting interest in its market potential. This uptick has been driven by strong support from long-term holders who have remained steadfast through various market fluctuations. The MVRV Long/Short Difference indicator indicates these holders are still profitable, highlighting Litecoin’s resilience and minimizing the risk of significant downturns. Additionally, the IOMAP metric reveals that over 2 million LTC were purchased between $128-$135. Breaking through $136 as a support level could propel gains to $147, while failure might result in a pullback to $117 or $105. With ongoing support from long-term holders and increasing institutional interest, the potential approval of a Litecoin ETF could further bolster market confidence. As demand rises, Litecoin remains an asset worth monitoring, especially with the buzz surrounding a potential Litecoin ETF. Ethereum Reaches $3,421 Amid Rising ETF Expectations Ethereum (ETH) has increased by 7.5%, climbing to $3,421 on January 24, as it reclaimed its position above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Analysts are anticipating further price growth, driven by positive sentiment and the growing possibility of an Ethereum ETF. This rise is part of a broader market recovery, with Bitcoin advancing 2.6% past $105,000, while altcoins like XRP and Solana saw gains of 1% and 6%, respectively. A recent executive order from former U.S. President Donald Trump has boosted market confidence by emphasizing the role of digital assets in economic innovation. The proposal suggests regulatory changes, including revisions to crypto accounting rules and exploring a digital asset reserve. Market observers view these developments as paving the way for a potential Ethereum ETF, strengthening Ethereum’s position and attracting institutional interest. With enthusiasm mounting, Ethereum ETF speculation remains a focal point for market participants. BlockDAG’s Presale Momentum: A Potential Success in 2025 BlockDAG’s presale has made a remarkable impact in the competitive crypto market, raising an impressive $191.5 million—setting it apart from many other projects. This outstanding achievement reflects growing interest in BDAG, with analysts predicting it could reach $1 within a year, offering significant returns for early investors. The structured price increments throughout the presale have not only sparked initial excitement but also provided a solid base for future growth. Moreover, BlockDAG’s commitment to delivering tangible benefits to its community has bolstered confidence among participants. Its presale strategy, aimed at increasing coin value for early adopters, has significantly boosted engagement. Additionally, projections of a 30,000% return by 2030 make BlockDAG an enticing opportunity for those seeking high-growth potential. With 10 upcoming CEX listings on the horizon, expectations for liquidity and market impact are on the rise. As BlockDAG gears up for exchange launches, its growing momentum positions it as a promising choice for 2025 and beyond. Key Takeaways With the crypto market experiencing renewed interest, discussions about a Litecoin ETF have propelled a 25% price increase for LTC, underscoring its growing significance. Ethereum has also gained momentum, climbing to $3,421 amidst rising expectations for an Ethereum ETF. These events reflect a shift in market sentiment, boosting confidence in major cryptocurrencies. Amidst these developments, BlockDAG (BDAG) has emerged as a standout presale, amassing $191.5 million and positioning itself for robust future growth. Analysts anticipate BDAG could reach $1 within a year, making it a promising option for those seeking high returns. With price increases and forthcoming exchange listings, BlockDAG is shaping up to be a key opportunity for 2025. For investors considering their next crypto move, the progress of the Litecoin ETF and speculation around an Ethereum ETF continue to attract attention, while BDAG presents a potential high-growth opportunity.

Table of Contents XYZ : The meme coin fighter punching through the crypto arena Kaspa: The high-speed crypto aiming to break barriers From collapse to comeback: Exploring the future of LUNC Conclusion February 2025 opens doors to new possibilities in digital currencies. Low-cost cryptocurrencies priced under one dollar are catching the eye for their immense growth potential. Exploring these affordable tokens could unearth the next big players in the market. XYZ : The meme coin fighter punching through the crypto arena Crowned “Best NEW Meme Project,” XYZ blends the electric energy of sports with meme culture, drawing in millions of fans who want to be part of something bigger. Every great story needs a hero. Not the biggest, not the strongest, just the one crazy enough to keep pushing forward. That’s XYZepe, the masked fighter, the die-hard believer, and the relentless holder of XYZ. His mission is to bring XYZVerse to the top of CoinMarketCap and carve XYZ into crypto history. In response, the CMC community is totally behind this future champ: 95% are super bullish on XYZ. But greatness isn’t handed out, it’s earned in the ring. XYZ has already passed through 9 out of 15 presale stages, and the thriving community helps it build momentum for a take off. Undervalued at $0.002, XYZ is aiming for huge wins. By the end of presale, it’s set to soar to $0.1. The fight isn’t over, but the path to glory is clear. In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors aren’t just spectators, they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who know this isn’t just another meme coin, it’s the start of something legendary.

Unlike other cryptocurrencies, Kaspa doesn’t waste blocks that are created at the same time. Instead, it lets them all exist together and puts them in order. This is possible because Kaspa uses a special method that makes its blockchain more like a web than a chain. With this approach, Kaspa can have many more blocks created every second, making transactions faster and more secure. Trading at $0.09753, and positioned at number 43 on CoinMarketCap’s list, KASPA is emerging as a strong contender in the current crypto market. From collapse to comeback: Exploring the future of LUNC Terra Classic (LUNC) is the original token of the Terra blockchain, a platform that aimed to combine the stability of traditional currencies with the flexibility of cryptocurrencies. Launched in 2019, Terra used fiat-pegged stablecoins to power global payment systems, offering quick and affordable transactions. It provided stablecoins tied to currencies like the US dollar and South Korean won. In May 2022, after facing significant challenges, the original chain was rebranded as Terra Classic, and the main token became LUNC. This move mirrors the Ethereum split in 2017, suggesting a commitment to learn and grow from past experiences. Today, this coin is aiming for a comeback with strong price movements. Conclusion While KAS and LUNC offer growth potential, XYZVerse stands out with its unique sports meme coin ecosystem, aiming for massive gains and community-driven innovation.

Ondo Finance is paving the way by offering tokenized U.S. Treasuries on the XRP Ledger, ensuring institutions have smooth access to tangible assets. Meanwhile, VeChain is enhancing the blockchain's application in supply chains with LETSTOP to encourage safer driving practices. In contrast, Web3Bay is transforming the online shopping experience. Web3Bay eliminates the need for middlemen, relinquishes control over its smart contracts, and secures transactions through decentralized storage, ensuring that user autonomy takes precedence over platform control. Unlike other blockchain initiatives that target niche sectors, Web3Bay offers a censorship-free marketplace where users can buy and sell without restrictions, presenting a compelling alternative to conventional e-commerce platforms. Web3Bay: A Pioneer in Secure and Unrestricted Online Shopping Online shopping should be secure, straightforward, and beyond corporate reach. Web3Bay fulfills this promise with smart contracts, escrow services, and decentralized storage, creating a trustworthy and independent marketplace. Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms that maintain complete control over transactions, Web3Bay uses self-executing smart contracts to prevent fraud and eliminate the necessity for third-party involvement. Additionally, escrow services add a layer of protection for both buyers and sellers by holding payments in a trustless system until all conditions are satisfied. This reduces dependence on centralized entities that might freeze accounts or withhold funds without justification. Furthermore, Web3Bay leverages decentralized storage networks for product data, making data breaches and censorship nearly impossible. Unlike Amazon, which can remove products arbitrarily, Web3Bay is entirely community-driven, ensuring transparency and openness in transactions. To further demonstrate its dedication to decentralization, Web3Bay relinquishes ownership of its smart contract once all non-team tokens are distributed. This ensures that no entity, including Web3Bay itself, can change the platform’s rules, granting users genuine autonomy. Amassing over $1 million through presale funding and selling 238.52 million tokens, Web3Bay's Stage 4 presale is progressing rapidly at $0.004562625 per 3BAY token. As more investors realize the advantages of a secure, censorship-free e-commerce model, Web3Bay is paving the way for a new era of online shopping—where control rests with the users, not corporations. Ondo Finance Offers Tokenized U.S. Treasuries on XRP Ledger Ondo Finance has introduced continuous access to tokenized U.S. Treasuries on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), providing institutional investors with a robust and efficient on-chain solution. The Ondo Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries (OUSG) fund, supported by the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), can be instantly minted and redeemed using the stablecoin Ripple USD (RLUSD). This integration guarantees that OUSG is backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries and managed with stringent compliance measures, including Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols. Moreover, XRPL's compliance tools, like Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), further bolster regulatory adherence. The platform provides high-quality, low-risk liquidity solutions, utilizing XRPL's high throughput, low fees, and reliability to facilitate seamless tokenization and trading of real-world assets. As stated by Markus Infanger, senior vice president at RippleX, the 24/7 intraday settlement enabled by tokenized assets like OUSG signifies a significant advancement in capital flow management, freeing it from conventional trading hours and slow settlements. Looking ahead, analysts forecast that the tokenized asset market could reach $16 trillion by 2030, with Ondo Finance already surpassing $600 million in total value locked. This accomplishment marks it as the first platform for tokenized U.S. Treasuries to gain such distinction. VeChain Introduces LETSTOP: A Blockchain Initiative for Safer Roads VeChain is poised to launch LETSTOP, the newest feature in its VeBetter application suite, on January 30, 2025, at 18:00 UTC. LETSTOP aims to encourage safer driving behaviors by rewarding users who adopt improved driving practices. This initiative exemplifies VeChain's dedication to using blockchain technology for real-world applications that foster positive societal effects. During the launch event, Jake will present the LETSTOP team and provide updates on VeChain's ecosystem applications. VeChain is well-known for improving supply chain transparency and employs a dual-token system comprising VET and VTHO. The VET token facilitates payments and transfers among users, while VTHO is used to cover transaction fees and enables interactions with smart contracts on the VeChain blockchain. Furthermore, the platform has forged partnerships with leading companies, including PwC and BMW, highlighting its suitability for industrial applications, particularly in supply chain management. Final Thoughts Decentralization is continuously reshaping online transactions, with Ondo Finance streamlining institutional access to tokenized U.S. Treasuries and VeChain utilizing blockchain to enhance real-world applications like supply chain transparency and road safety. However, Web3Bay goes beyond financial instruments and industry-specific solutions by offering a truly independent e-commerce experience. By enabling censorship-free transactions, providing escrow services, and using decentralized data storage, it removes corporate dominance and empowers users. As more individuals seek secure and unrestricted digital interactions, platforms like Web3Bay demonstrate the potential of blockchain to transform everyday commerce without the constraints of traditional intermediaries.

With a jaw-dropping 50,000% growth potential, this token has already raised $1 million in minutes during its presale. With Bitcoin (BTC) crossing $100,000 and XRP’s recent 500% surge might seem impressive, but none can rival the explosive potential and exclusivity driving THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN forward. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Outshines XRP and Others 1. Massive Growth Potential: XRP’s 500% returns pale in comparison to the staggering 50,000% potential of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Early investors are already seeing the impact of this token’s high demand and limited availability, making it the standout choice for transformative returns. 2. Exclusive Sale Creates High Demand: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN. This strategic exclusivity has heightened interest and secured its place as one of the most sought-after tokens. 3. Strong Community Support: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN thrives on a loyal and engaged community, driving organic growth and market demand. This strong backing amplifies its visibility and positions it as a top choice for long-term success. How It Stacks Up Against Other Cryptos Ethereum (ETH): A DeFi leader, but its growth has plateaued compared to early-stage tokens like THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Solana (SOL): Strong in scalability, but SOL can’t match the exclusivity and skyrocketing demand of this new token. Optimism (OP): A Layer-2 solution with promise, but its gains are modest compared to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s potential. Injective Protocol (INJ): A promising DeFi player, but it hasn’t generated the same overwhelming excitement. The Crypto Everyone’s Talking About THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already set new standards in the market.

A new crypto project has emerged, offering insane returns in 2025. While Ondo (ONDO) and Worldcoin (WLD) face challenges, the new competitor is redefining trading with AI-driven tools, social trading, and no-KYC access. With funded accounts, passive income programs, and a 20% APY as a staking reward, this platform is set to deliver massive returns in 2025. With all these features and growth prospects, the new altcoin is the best crypto to invest in today ahead of ONDO and WLD! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE ONDO Gains 15% Despite Massive Token Unlock, While FXGuys Steals the Spotlight Ondo Finance’s token surged 15% on January 29, 2025, despite a huge 1.94 billion token unlock, defying expectations of a price drop. The rally was fueled by strong market sentiment and technical factors, including a breakout from a descending wedge pattern. At $1.38, ONDO showed resilience, remaining above key Fibonacci levels. A short squeeze added buying pressure as traders covered positions. With over 66.63% of holders in profit, selling pressure remained low. ONDO was valued at $1.61 on January 30, up 25.08% in the past week. Supported by strong fundamentals and investor confidence, ONDO’s ability to absorb volatility highlights the potential for more gains in the coming weeks. The new crypto project outshines Ondo with AI-driven trading, social trading features, and a no-KYC model. It offers funded accounts, Trade2Earn rewards, and a 20% APY upon staking, ensuring profits regardless of market conditions. Brazil Bans Worldcoin’s Program Amid Ethical Concerns, as FXGuys Offers a Safer Alternative On January 24, 2025, Brazil’s National Data Protection Authority (ANPD) ordered Tools for Humanity (TFH) to stop offering crypto for iris scans. Authorities found that financial incentives influenced individuals’ decisions, raising ethical concerns. The suspension of Worldcoin took effect on January 25. Worldcoin, co-founded by OpenAI’s Sam Altman, collects biometric data via the “Orb” to verify identities. While aiming to enhance digital security and financial inclusivity, its data collection practices have drawn global criticism for the WLD token. Regulators worry that monetary rewards may compromise informed consent, sparking debates over privacy and ethical concerns. Meanwhile, WLD was valued at $1.79 on January 30, down 18.78% in the past week. The new contender surpasses Worldcoin with AI-driven trading, social trading, and no-KYC access. Unlike Worldcoin’s privacy concerns, the new crypto platform ensures security while offering funded accounts, passive income, and a 20% APY upon staking without biometric data risks.

The gang has been identified in a new cybersecurity threats report as the brains behind more than 10 sophisticated social media phishing scams that lure victims into downloading malware that steals their crypto. The scams reportedly make use of highly bespoke social engineering tactics to convince users to drop their guard and install malware such as Angel Drainer, Atomic mac OS Stealer, and StealC. Crazy Evil cyber threat analysis | Source: Insikt Group Providing an insight into the inner working of Crazy Evil, threat research outfit Insikt Group, which made the discovery, said in an announcement : Crazy Evil’s operation is both vast and meticulous. Its six subteams — AVLAND, TYPED, DELAND, ZOOMLAND, DEFI, and KEVLAND — run bespoke scams targeting specific victim profiles. From phishing lures aimed at cryptocurrency influencers to malware payloads designed for cross-platform infection, the group’s tactics reflect an advanced understanding of cybersecurity loopholes.

Insikt also revealed that in addition to its sophisticated social engineering capability and cross-platform abilities, what marks out Crazy Evil is its explicit targeting of crypto holders with malware specifically designed to steal wallet keys and extract other information that may be used to compromise wallet security. To mitigate for the sophistication of Crazy Evil malware attacks, users are encouraged to deploy endpoint detection and response solutions that actively scan for the presence of specific malware families linked to the gang, as well as web monitoring and filtering to block access to malicious domains controlled by Crazy Evil. On Dec. 28, on-chain investigator Taylor Manahan flagged the existence of similar bad actors that used social engineering tactics such as fake Web3 job interviews to install malware on the devices of victims with a view to ultimately stealing their crypto wallet keys.

This innovative DeFi project brings practical utilities, such as decentralized lending and a forthcoming stablecoin. With the presale tokens offered at an appealing price, Mutuum Finance is drawing attention from investors eager for high-growth opportunities within the decentralized finance sector. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's value has slipped below $100,000 for the first time during Trump's presidency, mirroring broader market trends affected by worldwide economic changes. As Bitcoin experiences fluctuations, opportunities like Mutuum Finance provide a fresh outlook for investors eager to diversify their portfolios and explore new avenues. Bitcoin Slips Under $100K in Trump's Presidency Bitcoin has fallen beneath the $100,000 threshold for the first time since Donald Trump became President, marking a time of uncertainty in the cryptocurrency sphere. This downturn, which saw Bitcoin plummet to $98,046, is occurring amid intensified global market volatility influenced by shifting trends and evolving monetary policies. This decrease has sparked discussions among analysts closely monitoring how external influences, such as competition in the tech and AI arenas, might be affecting investor confidence. A notable factor behind the recent volatility is the emergence of the AI app DeepSeek from China, which has swiftly captured global tech attention. The app's success, along with broader apprehensions about an AI arms race, has rippled through markets, encouraging investors to adopt a cautious approach. Additionally, with the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions looming, the market seems to be in a wait-and-see mode, anticipating clear policy directions that could influence Bitcoin's future trajectory. Despite this dip, Bitcoin's past resilience provides hope for its long-term supporters. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Gains Traction Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction among seasoned investors, thanks to its innovative approach to decentralized finance (DeFi). Currently in its first presale stage, the MUTM token is priced at just $0.01, making it an enticing option for those aiming to maximize returns. Analysts are optimistic, forecasting that the token’s initial price of $0.06 will significantly increase post-launch, potentially reaching $0.80 or more. This expected growth is driven by the platform’s strong utilities and the excitement it’s creating within the crypto community. Large-scale investors are acquiring substantial amounts of MUTM tokens during the first stage of Mutuum Finance’s presale, demonstrating strong confidence in the project’s prospects. Their actions are stirring excitement and urgency among other investors who are keen not to miss this early opportunity. As the first stage is anticipated to conclude swiftly, Mutuum Finance is proving to be a favored option for those seeking significant growth potential in the DeFi sector. A key aspect of Mutuum Finance is its dual-market system, which includes Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending services. P2C allows users to engage with automated liquidity pools, offering lenders passive income opportunities while providing borrowers easy access to funds. P2P, conversely, facilitates direct negotiations, granting access to niche assets such as memecoins or new tokens. This flexibility positions Mutuum Finance as a versatile platform catering to diverse user needs. For instance, a user might contribute $1,500 worth of USDT to a P2C liquidity pool. Over a year, the interest earned could transform their deposit into a fruitful investment, yielding steady passive income. Meanwhile, borrowers can secure loans with assets like ETH, maintaining control of their investments while accessing liquidity. Another notable feature of Mutuum Finance is its planned stablecoin, fully backed by on-chain assets and pegged to the U.S. Dollar. This stablecoin is designed to offer a secure and reliable transaction medium within the platform. Built on the Ethereum network, it dynamically adjusts its supply based on user activity, ensuring transparency and stability. As its usage becomes widespread, it is expected to bolster the platform’s ecosystem and increase demand for MUTM tokens, enhancing their value over time. The platform further incorporates a buy-and-distribute system, redirecting a portion of fees from lending and borrowing back into the ecosystem. These funds are used to purchase MUTM tokens, which are then distributed to mtTOKEN stakers as rewards. This strategy generates ongoing buy pressure, stabilizing the token’s value while rewarding committed participants. Mutuum Finance’s strategic planning and practical features are capturing the interest of seasoned investors who see its long-term potential. With a total supply of 4 billion tokens and a comprehensive roadmap, the project is paving the way for consistent growth. The upcoming launch of the beta platform alongside the token release is projected to significantly boost demand for MUTM, making this presale an opportunity worth exploring.

Meanwhile, the possibility of an Altseason also remains differed as the ETH price is down below the crucial range. However, a few altcoins, like Fartcoin & Hyperliquid, display strength. Here’s what you can expect from these altcoins amidst growing concerns about extended bearish scenarios. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Price May Turn Bearish Soon The Fartcoin price remained elevated while the global market conditions have been favoring the bears over the past couple of days. The price faced a huge 50% plunge during the past weekend, while the start of the fresh weekly trade turned out to be significantly bullish. Meanwhile, the bearish pressure over the token is expected to mount, which could cause the price to drop further below $0.5 in the coming days. The short-term price action of FARTCOIN suggests the bulls may get exhausted very soon as they have utilized all their strength in uplifting the levels from the local support zone between $0.55 and $0.59. Besides, the stochastic RSI has reached the overbought zone in the short term, which may trigger a healthy correction as the RSI levels have undergone a bearish crossover. Therefore, the FARTCOIN price is believed to drain hard in the next few days if it falls below the above-mentioned support and reaches levels below $0.5. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Price Primed for a 15% Rise The Hyperliquid price, being different from Fartcoin, appears to be primed for a bullish breakout as the token has reclaimed levels within the bullish range. However, the bearish influence may continue to prevail over the token but the bulls are expected to revive a strong rise, which may help the levels break above the resistance in the next few hours. Since its inception, the HYPE price has been trading within a decisive symmetrical triangle and has broken the upper resistance, aiming to reach $30. However, the bears restricted the rally to around $28 and triggered a massive pullback. Meanwhile, the price has entered within the bullish range and is expected to consolidate until it reaches the apex, followed by a breakout to the interim resistance at $25. If the rally sustains above the range, a further rise to $30 could be imminent.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-03 13:44:58

According to CoinGlass data , over $2 billion in digital liquidations in 24 hours on Monday, Feb. 3, marking the single largest liquidation event in crypto history. Several analysts estimated liquidations exceeded $2.2 billion, surpassing the COVID crash and FTX collapse, two of the most significant liquidation events ever recorded. Yet, Zhou said the numbers may be underreported due to API limits. According to Bybit’s co-founder, the crypto exchange limits how much data is pushed to aggregators like CoinGlass. Other platforms likely use a similar capped system, Zhou said via X.

By my estimation, it should be at least $8 billion to $10 billion,” Zhou said. Following Zhou’s comments, crypto community members debated the accuracy of the reported figures. Some speculated that previous liquidation events, such as the COVID crash and the FTX collapse, may have also been underreported. Looking ahead, Zhou pledged that Bybit would begin sharing all liquidation data with the public. “We believe in transparency,” he stated, as digital assets reeled from a massive leverage flush. need to dig out this data, but should be at least 4-6 times of what was reported basically. — Ben Zhou (@benbybit) February 3, 2025 Read more: Ethereum nosedives 23%, is a deeper correction coming?",News|Bitcoin|Bybit|Crypto Liquidations,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BTC|ETH|LUNA|MARKET,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-02-03 13:47:41

Meanwhile, Dogwifhat (WIF) organizers reassured its supporters that their long-awaited Sphere advertisement is still in progress, and promised refunds if it fails. A US court also recently delayed its ruling on whether Bitfinex should receive forfeited crypto linked to the 2016 hack. Prosecutors were given until Feb. 4 to clarify their position. Lawsuit Against Pump.fun Takes Unexpected Turn A meme coin that was supposedly launched by a law firm as part of a class-action lawsuit against Solana-based meme coin creator Pump.fun recently turned quite a few heads in the crypto community. The token is called Dog Shit Going NoWhere ( DOGSHIT2 ), and it recently surged to a market capitalization of $23 million before retracing. Pump.fun was recently hit with a proposed class-action lawsuit , with some investors alleging that every token it facilitated was an unregistered security from which it generated close to $500 million in fees. The lawsuit was filed by US law firms Burwick Law and Wolf Popper on behalf of affected investors. However, crypto community members quickly noticed that an address used in the court documents, specifically Exhibit C , matches the wallet address behind DOGSHIT2. This led many to speculate that the law firms themselves may be behind the token. The exhibit indicates that the token was launched on Oct. 31 last year, and its listing includes a warning stating, ”Don’t buy this coin.” Despite this, data from GeckoTerminal shows that the meme coin's value spiked dramatically after the lawsuit was filed and people connected it to the legal proceedings. At its peak on Jan. 31, DOGSHIT2 reached a $23 million market cap before dropping back to approximately $2.4 million. The token's price also hit an all-time high of $0.003968 on Feb. 2. At press time, DOGSHIT2 was trading hands at $0.003777 after its price climbed 18+% over the past 24 hours. DOGSHIT2 price action since launch (Source: CoinMarketCap ) This isn’t the first time Burwick Law has been involved in meme coin-related legal action . In fact, the firm previously looked for investors who lost money on Haliey Welch’s Hawk Tuah meme coin last December. The controversy surrounding DOGSHIT2 is happening at a time of a renewed frenzy in the meme coin market. Recently, Elon Musk’s father hinted at launching his own meme coin called Musk It (MUSKIT). Pump.fun has also seen a surge in activity, with the platform reaching a record high of $3.3 billion in weekly trading volume. This increase in volume was due to the launch of meme coins linked to the Trump family. Interest in meme coins has been on the rise over the past year. A CoinGecko study revealed that from Jan. 1 to Dec. 21 last year, meme coins and related categories accounted for almost 31% of investor interest. The trend was amplified by US President Donald Trump’s involvement in the meme coin space. WIF Organizers Promise Refunds if Sphere Ad Fails The official account of Dogwifhat (WIF), a Solana-based meme coin, recently addressed some of the concerns surrounding the “ Sphere Wif Hat ” initiative, which was a crowdfunding campaign that was launched almost a year ago with the goal of displaying the token’s logo on the Las Vegas Sphere. Despite raising $700,000 in days of its launch on March 10, the project has not delivered on its promise at all. Naturally, this caused a lot of concern in the community. In a post on Jan. 31, Dogwifhat reassured its supporters that the organizers of the campaign have been in ongoing negotiations with various parties to facilitate the Sphere advertisement. According to the team, since Dogwifhat is not a corporate entity, the organizers have partnered with an established brand to execute the plan. A statement also revealed that a timeline has now been agreed upon by the affiliated parties. However, should the plan not come to fruition, the contract will be voided, and all donors will receive refunds. The project’s organizers stated that there has been no plans to mislead anyone regarding the campaign. The uncertainty surrounding the initiative coincided with big price fluctuations for WIF . Three weeks after the crowdfunding campaign launched, the token hit an all-time high of $4.85. However, it has since dropped by more than 80%. WIF’s all-time price action (Source: CoinMarketCap ) In July of 2024, Mihir, one of the five organizers listed on the official campaign website, told reporters that he was ” 90% confident ” the initiative will proceed as planned. He also revealed that representatives from the Sphere introduced new crypto-specific terms in response to the campaign, and internal meetings were held to develop policies to tackle these terms. Court Delays Ruling on Bitfinex Hack Crypto Return A federal court has yet to rule on a motion from the US government requesting that crypto that was forfeited from a criminal case linked to the 2016 Bitfinex hack be returned to the exchange. In a filing on Jan. 28 in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly asked prosecutors to clarify certain issues related to their request to return the funds as part of proceedings against two convicted money launderers. The US government seized 94,643 Bitcoin, along with smaller amounts of Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Bitcoin Gold, from Ilya Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather Morgan, who were involved in laundering the stolen funds. Lichtenstein also admitted to being responsible for the original hack. According to the judge, returning the funds to Bitfinex could effectively reduce the forfeiture order, something that other courts have considered improper. Prosecutors were given until Feb. 4 to explain their position before the court makes a decision. The 2016 Bitfinex hack was one of the largest crypto thefts at the time as hackers stole approximately 119,754 BTC from the exchange. US authorities arrested Lichtenstein and Morgan in 2022 in connection with laundering the stolen funds and subsequently seized the cryptocurrency. Ilya Lichtenstein and his wife Heather Morgan The couple pleaded guilty in 2023 and were sentenced to prison. Lichtenstein received five years and Morgan 18 months. While Lichtenstein has been in US custody since 2022, Morgan was initially scheduled to report to prison on Jan. 24. After her sentencing in November of 2024, Morgan resumed posting on social media, promoting her creative projects, and even launching a Cameo channel branding herself as “crypto’s favorite felon.” Although many victims were affected by the Bitfinex hack, an October 2024 court filing suggested that the exchange may be the only entity eligible for reimbursement. The US government previously asked victims to submit impact statements, which may factor into the final decision on the forfeited funds.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|TRADING|WIF|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-03 13:49:16

This Telegram gaming sensation is making serious waves as the first ever Telegram ICO; never before have 950 million users of crypto’s favorite messaging app had an ICO fed directly to them. This kind of buy pressure will put close rival Catizen on edge. In fact, it was likely on edge ever since Telegram’s CEO made an explicit call for a project like Dogizen. Dogizen has strategically improved on everything Catizen did. So it seems like Dogizen’s current price of just $0.000085 will be the lowest we ever see it. Catizen is toast: Dogizen’s going in for the kill Catizen, like all the big players in the Telegram gaming space, ruined its token price potential by holding an airdrop to distribute free tokens. CATI tokens were given out far and wide. And since nobody had paid anything in return, recipients took whatever they could get and cashed in on them rapidly. The CATI price has never recovered. Dogizen, of course, knew this would happen and has been calmly growing its community and investor base with its ICO. When Dogizen launches, it’s primed to have an army of solid bag holders patiently supporting positive price action. Another massive screw-up that Catizen will be eternally paying for is its timing. CATI began trading in September, traditionally crypto’s worst month. It consequently met a wall of market-wide FUD. On the other hand, Dogizen is ending its presale just as the markets are turning really spicey. Right when the speculators, institutions, retail, the moms of retail, and everyone in between will open their wallets. Catizen doesn’t stand a chance. The wider dog coin narrative has cats running scared Dog meme coins DOGE and BONK have ETFs brewing. Regardless of whether they get approved, the simple fact they were applied for is an unquestionable sign of dog coin bullishness. Dog themed meme tokens are humiliating cat tokens right now, with over $70 billion in market cap vs. the mere handful of billion claimed by cat themed tokens. It’s official: the cryptosphere is made of dog people. And now that the White House has a government department named after the leading dog token, the canine advantage is only set to grow. Dogizen’s tokenomics are pure joy When Dogizen hits exchanges, its market cap will be well under $10 million. A deliberate tactic to let DOGIZ grow into itself. Considering all of Dogizen’s rivals, Catizen included, have seen market caps in the multiple hundreds of millions (and that was during the tepid markets of mid-2024), Dogizen could 20x at the very minimum. Throw in the raging party that this bull run is likely to throw, and the +$2.5 billion that Telegram gaming rival Notcoin did seems rather plausible. The scent of 100x is in the air. And until Friday, DOGIZ is only $0.000085. To buy Dogizen, visit the official website .

The Russian Ministry of Energy plans to implement a mandatory registration system for cryptocurrency mining equipment in order to prevent and detect unregistered mining operations, The Block reported, citing TASS news. The initiative, led by Deputy Minister Yevgeny Grabchak, aims to regulate local mining, especially in regions where mining is restricted. The Russian government recently approved a ban on cryptocurrency mining starting in 2025 and announced the regions where the bans will apply. Accordingly, cryptocurrency mining will be completely banned in 10 Russian regions for six years, starting January 1, 2025. The ban is planned to be valid until March 15, 2031. In addition to this mandatory registration system, the Federal Tax Service (FNS) also announced today that it has launched an online system that will allow miners to report their earnings, following a tax framework approved by President Vladimir Putin. Under the tax framework approved by Putin, miners earning up to 2.4 million rubles ($23,976) would face a 13% tax, while miners exceeding that threshold would face a 15% tax.

Recent amendments to the Income Tax Act impose a 70% penalty on undisclosed crypto gains, reinforcing India's historically cautious position. However, at the same time, officials have signaled a potential policy shift, acknowledging the growing adoption of digital assets worldwide. With the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) expanding its central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiatives and global crypto regulations tightening, India faces a critical decision on how to balance taxation, innovation, and financial oversight in the evolving digital economy. India’s New Crypto Tax Laws Could Hit Traders With 70% Penalty on Undisclosed Gains India’s cryptocurrency traders may face steep penalties under new amendments to the country’s tax laws, as the government tightens its grip on digital assets to curb tax evasion and increase transparency. The new regulation, announced by Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman as part of the Union Budget 2025, classifies cryptocurrency gains as part of undisclosed income under Section 158B of the Income Tax Act. The amendment , which is set to take effect retrospectively from Feb. 1, 2025, could result in severe tax penalties of up to 70% for traders who have failed to report their cryptocurrency profits in past assessment years. Under the revised law, crypto profits will now be treated similarly to traditional assets such as money, jewelry, and bullion in terms of tax assessments. The amendment places digital assets under the Virtual Digital Asset (VDA) category, reinforcing India's tough stance on cryptocurrency taxation. According to the amendment, “Crypto asset has been defined in Section 2(47A) of the Act under the existing definition of Virtual Digital Asset A reporting entity, as may be prescribed under Section 285BAA of the Act, will be required to furnish information of crypto asset.” This means that cryptocurrency transactions will now be under strict tax scrutiny, with exchanges and financial institutions required to report all crypto holdings and transactions to the Indian tax authorities. The latest tax crackdown comes amid rising concerns over unpaid crypto taxes in India. In December 2024, Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary revealed that the government had identified ₹824 crore ($97 million) in unpaid Goods and Services Tax (GST) from multiple crypto exchanges. This revelation follows an earlier enforcement action in August 2024, where Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, was hit with a tax demand of ₹722 crore ($85 million) by Indian authorities. These actions signal India’s determination to enforce tax compliance among cryptocurrency exchanges and traders. The inclusion of crypto in block assessments—a process used to reassess tax liabilities for undisclosed income—will significantly increase penalties for non-compliance. The most alarming aspect of the amendment is the potential for a 70% penalty on crypto gains that have remained undisclosed for up to four years after the relevant tax assessment year. According to the official document, “70% of the aggregate of tax and interest payable on additional income disclosed in the updated income tax return (ITR).” This means that traders who have not declared their crypto profits since 2021 may now face heavy fines and backdated tax payments. The government’s decision aligns with its broader strategy to tighten tax reporting and enforcement on digital assets, ensuring that cryptocurrency investments do not become a loophole for tax evasion. The impact of these stringent regulations is already being felt in the Indian crypto market. On Jan. 10, 2025, Bybit—a major global crypto exchange—announced the suspension of its services in India, citing regulatory pressure as a key reason. Bybit’s exit follows the government’s intensified scrutiny of foreign crypto platforms, particularly those operating without full regulatory approval from India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). Other exchanges, including Binance and KuCoin, have also faced regulatory actions, leading to increased uncertainty for Indian crypto traders. The new tax amendments may further accelerate this trend, discouraging foreign exchanges from operating in India without strict compliance with local tax laws. Global Trend of Crypto Tax Regulations India’s move to tighten crypto taxation is part of a global trend toward stricter regulations in the digital asset space. In June 2024, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) introduced a new crypto tax framework, requiring centralized crypto exchanges (CEXs) and brokers to report all sales and exchanges of digital assets starting in 2025. This has led to growing concerns within the crypto industry, with some experts predicting that more investors may turn to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to bypass stringent tax reporting requirements. Anndy Lian, an intergovernmental blockchain expert, highlighted the “paradoxical situation” in which overregulation might push traders toward harder-to-monitor decentralized platforms, ultimately making tax enforcement even more challenging. The US Blockchain Association has already challenged these new IRS rules in court, arguing that extending data collection requirements to decentralized exchanges violates constitutional rights. With the retrospective nature of the tax amendments, Indian crypto investors now face a critical decision: Declare past crypto gains before February 2025 to avoid steep penalties. Ensure compliance with new tax reporting rules to prevent further legal consequences. Consider shifting trading strategies, including exploring decentralized finance (DeFi) options, though these may still carry risks. The Indian government’s tax enforcement signals a growing global crackdown on crypto tax evasion, following similar moves in the US, Europe, and South Korea. As the Indian crypto market navigates these regulatory challenges, investors and exchanges alike will need to adapt to the country’s evolving tax landscape. India Reviews Crypto Regulations Amid Global Adoption and Rising Taxation In related news, India is now reassessing its regulatory stance as digital assets gain increasing global acceptance. According to Ajay Seth , India's economic affairs secretary, digital assets ”don’t believe in borders,” signaling a potential policy shift that could see India adapting to the international crypto landscape rather than resisting it. While the government has long positioned itself against private cryptocurrencies, the rapid adoption of Bitcoin and other digital assets by nation-states appears to be forcing a reconsideration of policy—confirming the game theory scenario that crypto analysts and Bitcoin maximalists have long predicted. India’s stance on crypto has traditionally been restrictive, with the government implementing harsh taxation policies and maintaining skepticism toward decentralized digital currencies. However, as more nations integrate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into their economies, India risks falling behind in the race to harness blockchain technology and digital finance. The theory that nation-state adoption of Bitcoin could trigger a domino effect among other countries is well known in pro-crypto circles. El Salvador’s move to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021 set off a wave of discussions, and more recently, US presidential candidates have hinted at making cryptocurrency a key component of their economic strategies. Even former US President Donald Trump commissioned a working group to explore the potential of digital assets in financial markets, signaling a shift toward regulatory acceptance in the West. India's economic policymakers appear to be taking these developments seriously, as evidenced by Ajay Seth’s comments, which suggest a growing recognition that crypto is here to stay and cannot be ignored. Despite the changing rhetoric, India’s current tax policies remain among the most restrictive in the world. The government levies a 30% capital gains tax on all crypto profits, with no distinction between short-term and long-term investments. This means traders and long-term holders alike are subject to the same high tax burden—a policy that has been widely criticized by industry experts and legal professionals. Amit Kumar Gupta, a Supreme Court legal practitioner, described India’s crypto tax regime as ”draconian”, arguing that the government is actively trying to disincentivize permissionless blockchain innovation. India’s CBDC Push: A Digital Rupee Over Crypto? Even as India maintains a hostile stance toward private cryptocurrencies, the country is aggressively pursuing the development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das has been one of the most vocal supporters of the CBDC initiative, calling digital rupees ”the future of currency”. In his December 2024 farewell speech, Das emphasized that India is actively shifting toward a CBDC-driven economy, viewing digital rupees as a more controlled and state-backed alternative to decentralized cryptocurrencies. Before Das stepped down, the RBI announced a major expansion of its cross-border payment system, with plans to integrate CBDCs into international settlements. The bank is seeking additional trading partners to develop a wholesale CBDC system, where digital rupees would be used for settlements between central banks and financial institutions. This aligns with the global trend of governments favoring state-backed digital currencies while imposing heavy restrictions on decentralized alternatives like Bitcoin and Ethereum. India's regulatory landscape for crypto remains uncertain. On one hand, policymakers are recognizing the growing importance of digital assets and do not want to fall behind as other countries embrace blockchain technology. On the other hand, India continues to push punitive tax measures and prioritize CBDCs over decentralized financial systems. The biggest challenge for India will be striking a balance between regulation and innovation. While heavy taxation and strict oversight could deter crypto businesses from operating in India, a complete ban on digital assets is increasingly unrealistic in a globally connected economy. For now, Indian traders and blockchain startups remain in regulatory limbo, awaiting further clarity on whether the government will ease restrictions or double down on its anti-crypto stance. If India does not adapt to the global shift toward digital assets, it may risk being left behind in the next evolution of financial markets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-03 14:00:00

Unsurprisingly, this sharp downturn has led to widespread liquidations among multiple assets within the past trading day. Notably, this wave of liquidations has led to over $2.22222 billion being wiped from cryptocurrencies in the past 24 hours. According to Coinglass data, Dogecoin traders have witnessed significant losses, with numbers placing the meme coin among the hardest-hit assets in this liquidation event. Dogecoin Traders Lose Over $82 Million In 24 Hours Data from Coinglass reveals that Dogecoin liquidations have been among the most severe in the market over the past 24 hours, as leveraged positions crumbled under the weight of rapid price swings. A closer look at the data shows that the vast majority of these liquidations stemmed from long positions, with bullish traders suffering losses amounting to $69.32 million. These traders, mostly expecting a rally this week or at least a stable market, were caught off guard as Dogecoin’s price took a sharp turn downward alongside the rest of the market, forcing liquidations and cascading losses. Related Reading: 70 Million DOGE Make Their Way To Binance Amid 10% Dogecoin Price Crash Interestingly, despite the broader trend leaning toward a price decline, short sellers were not spared from the liquidation frenzy. Data shows that $13.35 million worth of short positions were liquidated, suggesting that brief price spikes occurred during the general downtrend. These momentary surges may have triggered stop losses for some short traders, leading to forced liquidations even as the overall trajectory remained bearish. Market-Wide Liquidations Top $2.22 Billion Amid High Volatility The cryptocurrency market has kicked off the new week on a bearish note following a period of consolidation throughout the previous week. Bitcoin, which had maintained relative stability, saw a sharp decline as the weekend came to a close, breaking below the $100,000 mark on Sunday and continued to extend the downside move from there. Related Reading: Crypto Fear And Greed Index Barrels Toward Extreme Greed Again As Bitcoin Price Clears $101,000, Is This Good News? Bitcoin’s decline triggered a broader market sell-off, with several major cryptocurrencies following suit. At the time of writing, the global crypto market cap has dropped by approximately 11% over the past 24 hours and is now at $3 trillion, its lowest level since November 15, 2024. As such, the broader cryptocurrency market has experienced a brutal shakeout in the past 24 hours, with liquidations surpassing $2.22 billion. Bitcoin and Ethereum traders have taken the biggest hits in this liquidation spree. Bitcoin alone has recorded over $406.96 million in liquidated positions, with the majority being long trades of $341.36 million in the past 24 hours. However, Ethereum traders have experienced the heaviest liquidations, with $601 million in positions wiped out. With Dogecoin experiencing $82.67 million in liquidations, the aftermath of this sell-off could set the stage for increased volatility alongside other cryptocurrencies in the short term. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.235, down by 22.5% in the past 24 hours.

Buying before the crash,https://finbold.com/was-donald-trump-the-worst-insider-trader-ever-buying-before-the-crash/,"An analyst believes Donald Trump could have been the “worst insider trader ever,” as the cryptocurrency market crashes on Trump’s tariffs, after significant purchases. Donald Trump has been accumulating cryptocurrencies, especially via the World Liberty Financial (WLFI) project, with its activities increasing in January. Interestingly, all the accumulation happened before this recent crash, supposedly caused by Trump’s trade wars, with the US tariffs increase. In this context, the long-term stock and crypto investor Jelle said Trump is “the worst insider trader ever.” Specifically, Jelle was looking at Trump’s team recent Ethereum ( ETH ) purchases, which sums up to 59,403 ETH. Receive Signals on US Congress Members' Stock Trades Stocks Stay up-to-date on the trading activity of US Congress members. The signal triggers based on updates from the House disclosure reports, notifying you of their latest stock transactions. Enable signal As Finbold reported, Trump-backed WLFI bought 3,079 ETH for approximately $10 million, later adding up to the Ethereum position . Besides Ethereum, Trump also bought Bitcoin ( BTC ) and a few other cryptocurrencies, even launching his own memecoin (TRUMP) , which has now completely nuked, bringing significant losses to its holders . Usually, successful insider traders like the infamous Nancy Pelosi, use the privileged information or their power, ruling, to make financial decisions that benefit their positions, positioning accordingly before creating the news that move the markets. Donald Trump’s crypto portfolio down in contrarian insider trade In this recent case, however, Donal Trump’s trade wars with the increased tariffs had the opposite expected effect – at least while looking at Trump’s publicly disclosed crypto wallets. According to Arkham Intelligence, Trump’s crypto portfolio is now worth $2.95 million, down 32.25%. Meanwhile, the World Liberty Fi’s treasury is worth $361.25 million, down 12.07%. World Liberty Fi & Donald Trump crypto wallets and portfolio. Source: Arkham Intelligence / Finbold Notably, these values are already considering a 5% upward bounce. The losses were larger than what is currently reported during the crash. Overall, the cryptocurrency market saw more than $2.27 billion in liquidations, setting a new record. These liquidations were even higher than during the COVID-19 crash – with Ethereum being the biggest loser. The bullish case Nevertheless, many analysts believe the worst has already gone, and the cryptocurrencies could be ready for the long-awaited bull rally . One of these analysts, Michaël van de Poppe, compared the current “wipeout on Altcoins” with the COVID-19 crash. “We all know what happened after and I think that that’s the same thesis here,” he concluded. In another post , van de Popper explained that this is what a “capitulation” looks like, predicting a “quick bounce upwards, and rally after” for altcoins. Jelle also commented on something similar, warning that bull markets have “events like this to shake you out.” Therefore, it is possible that the current crash could have created a good buying opportunity for the ones who get ready for that. The next few days will provide even more insights if, for example, Donald Trump steps back on the tariffs. In the meantime, the market wonder if Trump could be “the worst insider trader ever,” or if he has something ready to move the markets again in his favor.

Hoskinson revealed that negotiations are still ongoing and that progress could be made in March, following the completion of the NYDFS project. He opened up about the strong possibility of reaching a deal, but said that the team was advised to wait until then. “We talked to David Schwartz and Brad Garlinghouse. Strong possibility we can negotiate (RLUSD). Ripple told us to wait till March as they just finished NYDFS. We’ll see if there’s a roadmap and how they’ll get that done,” he said in the AMA. In terms of market performance, Hoskinson acknowledged the current market downturn, saying that Cardano had seen a 19% drop over the past 24 hours and 23% for the week. Despite this, Cardano is outperforming some major cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, Solana, and BNB, which saw even bigger declines. He explained that the recent market excitement about Donald Trump’s presidency led to an overbought market, with unrealistic expectations about rapid growth in Bitcoin’s value. However, Hoskinson remained confident about the long-term trajectory, stating that the crypto market will remain strong, even with fluctuations. Looking to the future, Hoskinson also discussed the US government’s growing interest in blockchain technology. He predicted that over the next five years, blockchain integration will play a major role in government systems, including voting, procurement, and identity management. Additionally, he mentioned the possibility of a US government Bitcoin reserve.

The cryptocurrency market draws a varied audience of traders, investors, and fans. Three particularly notable tokens, Solana, Pepe Coin, and Rexas Finance (RXS), have attracted the interest of both crypto whales and regular investors in 2025. These three tokens are must-buys for this year, especially RXS, which has the potential to rise 11,900% before the end of 2025. Rexas Finance (RXS): Revolutionizing Real-World Asset Tokenization Among the most intriguing blockchain initiatives for 2025, Rexas Finance has taken center stage. Rexas is closing the distance between conventional banking and blockchain technologies by allowing the tokenization of actual assets, including real estate, goods, and art. Its strong network offers fractional ownership and worldwide liquidity, simplifying asset ownership via tokenization. The RXS presale has been a spectacle. In Stage 12, the token jumped from its September 2024 starting price of $0.030 to $0.20, a 570% gain. With 438,050,621 tokens sold already, investors have invested $43,610,582 in the presale thus far. As the presale end draws close, Rexas Finance is preparing to launch at $0.25 on June 19, 2025. Experts estimate an astounding increase to $24 in the next six months. Early adopters would receive a 120x return on investment (ROI) and an 11,900% increase. Certik has audited Rexas Finance, adding credibility to its strong ecosystem and guaranteeing security and openness for the platform. Additionally, listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, the project increases its profile and lets investors follow RXS in real-time, which is unique in that it approaches communities first. Unlike many initiatives that depend on venture capital financing, Rexas Finance has chosen to involve individual investors, enabling them to join this innovative adventure. Twenty winners are expected to receive $50,000 worth of RXS tokens each, and the ongoing $1 million RXS offer has strengthened community trust and involvement. Rexas Finance is a movement meant to democratize access to investments and transform our view and handling of assets, not only a token. RXS belongs to your portfolio if you want a token with unmatched real-world value and growth capacity. Pepe Coin: The Meme Token That Refuses to Fade Pepe Coin has shown endurance after a tumultuous beginning in 2025, establishing itself as a meme coin with great upward potential. Inspired by the venerable Pepe the Frog, PEPE has drawn a devoted community of crypto traders and meme enthusiasts. PEPE appears to be in the process of recovering from its last 17.1 % decrease. In the last 24 hours it has gained 5 % previously it was trading at 0.00001533. Driven by increased interest and the token's meme-culture appeal, investors hope PEPE can erase a zero in the coming months. Solana (SOL): Pioneering High-Speed Blockchain Innovation Thanks to its low-cost, fast blockchain system, Solana remains a leading competitor in the cryptocurrency scene. Driven by a spike in trading activity and the release of two political meme coins, Trump and MELANIA, the platform has reached a new all-time high of $293.31. Solana offers significant profits for those who act quickly; some estimate it may reach $500 in the next six months. Why RXS Stands Out Among the Must-Buys Although all three tokens—Rexas Finance, Pepe Coin, and Solana—have special benefits, Rexas Finance (RXS) seems to be the most likely investment for 2025. Unlike meme tokens and conventional blockchain initiatives, Rexas addresses a trillion-dollar industry in real estate, commodities, and collectibles by combining real-world utility with modern blockchain technologies. The token's promise is shown by the recent action of a crypto whale who moved $155,399 (47.96 ETH) into RXS during the presale. The last presale stage is a chance to lock in this high-growth asset before its price skyrockets to $24 or more as RXS prepares for its release at $0.25. Furthermore, the project's openness and dedication to creating a robust community are outlined in the Certik audit, CoinMarketCap listing, and $1 million giveaway. Having 1 billion RXS tokens, Rexas Finance has set the stage for long-term prosperity. Seize the Opportunity in 2025 Don't miss the opportunity to join Rexas Finance on its path. The moment to act is now, as the presale is ending soon, and a 120x ROI is only around the corner. Visit the Rexas Finance website to participate in the presale and investigate how RXS can change your portfolio. Join the presale and get ready to ride the crypto innovation tsunami in 2025!

Still, the AAVE coin has formed a hammer pattern, pointing to a 65% rebound as its founder cheers its resilience during the crypto sell-off. AAVE Price May Rebound Amid Strong Resilience AAVE price retreated to an intraday low of $195.85 on Monday, down by 50% from its highest level in November last year. This decline may be offset by the strong network performance, which Stani Kulechov, its founder, hailed in a social media post. He responded to a user who noted that AAVE had handled a $200 million liquidation in the last 24 hours. This was the biggest liquidation since August last year, and is a sign that the system was working. In an X post, Vivek Gupta, the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Okto, noted its resilience was due to AAVE’s strong governance, deep liquidity across the ecosystem, and proper liquidation mechanisms. He expects that the network will do much better in the next upgrades. AAVE handles $200m liquidations in 24 hours AAVE is the biggest player in the lending and borrowing subsegment in the DeFi industry with over $18 billion in assets. It has made almost $740 million in fees in the last twelve months, making it one of the top profitable players in the crypto industry. It is also one of the holdings of World Liberty Financial, which holds almost 20k tokens worth over $4 million. AAVE Coin Technical Analysis: Can It Rebound 65% The daily chart shows that the Cardano price crashed to a low of $195.85 on Monday as coins crashed. It moved briefly below the lower side of the bullish flag pattern. A bullish flag is made up of a long vertical line and some consolidation. As such, Monday’s crash may have been a false breakdown since the coin has formed a hammer candlestick. A hammer has a long lower shadow and a small body without an upper shadow. It is one of the most bullish patterns in technical analysis. AAVE coin has moved above the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). AAVE Target Prices The bullish flag pattern points to more AAVE price gains this month. If this happens, the value of AAVE may rebound by about 65% from the current level to a high of $398, its highest level in November last year. However, a drop below Monday’s low of $195 will signal that the crash was not a false breakdown. It will point to more drop to the ultimate support at $125, down by 47% from the current level.

Within this time, the company broke the record for the single largest purchase of BTC and strengthened its presence in the Bitcoin ecosystem by nearly doubling its holdings. BTC Buying on Pause The US presidential elections held in early November last year changed the complexity of the crypto game, especially for investors based in the States. MicroStrategy, which had already become a household name associated with BTC, was among those that intensified its accumulations starting on November 11 – the first Monday after the voting. After highlighting plans to raise over $40 billion within the next decade in late October, the NASDAQ-listed firm began acquiring large portions of BTC and made the announcements on the first business day of the following week. On November 11, the company announced a massive purchase of 27,200 BTC (valued at just over $2 billion at the time), which sent its stock prices to new peaks. Aside from price movements, MSTR became a highly-tradable stock in the US market and entered the so-called (by Michael Saylor) ‘Magnificent 8’ – a group of the biggest and most recognizable American companies. After breaking its own record once again in mid-November at over $470 per share, MSTR actually started to retrace and plunged below $290 at the end of December. Despite bouncing off alongside the crypto market in mid-January, it failed to reach uncharted territory and closed on Friday at $335. Its price is expected to drop today when the markets open due to the overall crash. Nevertheless, this volatility didn’t deter the company from raising more money and accumulating additional BTC. In fact, its streak continued for 12 consecutive weeks. The biggest single acquisition came on November 18 and was worth $4.6 billion at the time. It allowed MicroStrategy to purchase 51,780 BTC. Holding Over 470K BTC Crypto Twitter became accustomed to Saylor’s announcements on Monday (or Tuesday in one instance) about the large BTC purchases. This week, though, he made a different statement, saying his company didn’t sell any shares of class A common stock and did not buy any bitcoin. Thus, its holdings remain unchanged at 471,107 BTC, purchased for $30.4 billion at an average price of $64,511. Last week, MicroStrategy did not sell any shares of class A common stock under its at-the-market equity offering program, and did not purchase any bitcoin. As of 2/2/2025, we hodl 471,107 $BTC acquired for ~$30.4 billion at ~$64,511 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/QTBWl8KlNv — Michael Saylor (@saylor) February 3, 2025 It’s worth noting that MicroStrategy held 244,800 BTC in September, which means that it nearly doubled its stash within the past several months. Its pause now comes at a rather intriguing time, as bitcoin’s price tumbled during the weekend and on Monday by over $15,000 since Friday. The post End of an Era?

For those looking beyond XRP, five standout alternatives under $0.45 are set to skyrocket—turning a $400 investment into $32,000 in just 10 weeks. Leading the pack is Lightchain AI , an innovative project merging blockchain with artificial intelligence. Its presale has already raised $14.2 million, showcasing immense investor confidence. Joining it are ApeMax (APEMAX), BlastUP (BLAST), Solaxy (SLXY), and Retik Finance (RETIK), each poised for explosive growth. These tokens could be the best bets for major gains in 2025. Top 5 Promising XRP Alternatives Ready for Substantial Growth Investors seeking high-potential alternatives to XRP should consider Lightchain AI (LCAI) , ApeMax (APEMAX), BlastUP (BLAST), Solaxy (SLXY), and Retik Finance (RETIK). These emerging cryptocurrencies, currently priced under $0.45, offer significant growth prospects. Lightchain AI (LCAI) integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, aiming to enhance transaction efficiency and scalability. Its presale has garnered substantial attention, raising over $14.2 million at $0.005625 per token. ApeMax (APEMAX) is gaining traction for its innovative approach to decentralized finance, focusing on user-friendly interfaces and robust security features. BlastUP (BLAST) is currently trading at approximately $0.0056, with an intraday high of $0.0058 and a low of $0.0053. Solaxy (SLXY) aims to revolutionize the renewable energy sector by leveraging blockchain for transparent and efficient energy transactions. Retik Finance (RETIK) focuses on providing decentralized financial solutions, emphasizing low transaction fees and high-speed processing. Investing $400 across these five cryptocurrencies could potentially yield substantial returns, with some analysts predicting significant gains in the coming weeks. However, it's crucial to conduct thorough research and consider the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency investments. Lightchain AI's Path to Explosive Growth - A $400 Investment Could Surge to $32,000 in 10 Weeks While all five tokens exhibit strong growth potential, Lightchain AI distinguishes itself as a leader. Its innovative strategy of merging blockchain and artificial intelligence has attracted considerable interest from investors, resulting in a successful presale. Investing $400 in Lightchain AI at its current price of $0.005625 could potentially yield approximately 71,111 tokens. If the token reaches just $0.45, which is still significantly lower than its projected value in ten weeks, that initial investment would turn into over $32,000. Of course, investing in any cryptocurrency carries inherent risks and should be approached with caution. However, with the crypto market heating up and these emerging tokens showing strong growth potential, investing in these alternatives to XRP could lead to significant returns.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. A new $0.0033 cryptocurrency, Agent A.I., is gaining attention and could compete with SHIB and DOGE with its AI-driven technology and meme coin appeal. Table of Contents Agent A.I.: The fusion of AI and meme coin mania Shiba Inu coin plummets Dogecoin nosedives Conclusion A new under-the-radar cryptocurrency is capturing attention in the current bull market. At just $0.0033, it has the potential to compete with famous tokens like SHIB and DOGE. Crypto enthusiasts are buzzing about its promising prospects and hinting at its ability to be a game changer. Agent A.I.: The fusion of AI and meme coin mania Agent A.I. is shaking up the crypto world by merging true AI-driven technology with the viral charm of meme coins, two of the most explosive trends in the market today. AI-based crypto projects are flooding the space, but many fall short of delivering actual utility. Instead, they rely on AI as a buzzword to attract investors. Agent A.I. takes a different approach, it doesn’t just ride the hype wave; it calls out the pretenders while proving its own technological edge. Unlike projects that merely claim AI integration, Agent A.I. is built to be an intelligent, adaptive ecosystem. Its advanced framework enables: Lightning-fast data processing for smarter decision-making Scalable AI power rivaling top cloud platforms Continuous learning and adaptation for long-term efficiency Backed by a team committed to both AI advancement and blockchain innovation, Agent A.I. is designed to evolve with the crypto market. Agent A.I. is launching with a community-first presale, giving early adopters a chance to secure AGNT tokens at the best possible entry points. The presale follows a tiered pricing model: Stage 1 price: $0.0033 per AGNT Final stage price: $0.1515 Early investor bonus: A massive 98% discount for first-stage buyers Agent A.I. delivers the best of both worlds, real AI innovation and meme coin virality, while ensuring a solid foundation for long-term growth. With a limited presale supply and an escalating price structure, early investors could see exponential gains as demand surges. Shiba Inu coin plummets Shiba Inu is a cryptocurrency that started as a playful meme, drawing inspiration from Dogecoin’s popularity. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous creator known as Ryoshi, SHIB differentiates itself by operating on the Ethereum blockchain. Currently priced at $0.00001537, SHIB has seen a drop of 9% over the past 24 hours and 17% over the past week. With a market cap of $9.05b billion and a trading volume of $1.72b, the coin shows moderate market activity, indicating investor volatility. The broader bullish market sentiment can be blamed for this slow performance. Analysts are keeping an eye on any trends that may influence its price movement. Dogecoin nosedives Dogecoin started in 2013 as a fun twist on cryptocurrencies. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it featured the popular Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin was designed to be plentiful. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined, and there’s no maximum limit. As of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.2665, reflecting an 8% fall in the last 24 hours and a 18% drop in the past week. With a market cap of $39.53b and daily trading volume reaching $12.09b, the coin remains volatile, driven by market developments. The coin’s current performance suggests potential for risk of further declines. Conclusion In conclusion, while SHIB and DOGE may have less short-term potential, Agent A.I. stands out as an exciting new memecoin. It aims to expose fake AI agents in the crypto space, offering real value and humor. Modeled after PEPE, which saw massive gains, Agent A.I. has similar ambitions fueled by its community. With a limited-time presale offering a 98% discount, early supporters can secure the AGENT token at a low entry price. To learn more about Agent A.I., visit the website , Telegram , and X .

From their quirky names to their vibrant communities, these coins have captured investors’ imaginations (and wallets) worldwide. The allure lies in their meme-worthy appeal and their staggering potential for returns. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Peanut the Squirrel, Goatseus Maximus, and Cat in a Dog’s World are four standout contenders in this wild frontier of meme coins. While all offer unique opportunities, Arctic Pablo is blazing a trail with its innovative features and high-growth potential. Arctic Pablo is emerging as a strong contender with red-hot potential. It sets itself apart from other meme coins with enticing staking rewards, community-driven incentives, and a presale journey that feels like an epic treasure hunt. Let’s dive deeper into why Arctic Pablo is becoming the frontrunner among the top new meme coins to invest in this year. Arctic Pablo: Stake, Earn, and Join the Arctic Adventure Arctic Pablo doesn’t just aim to ride the meme coin hype train—it’s building an empire. With an impressive APY of 66% during its presale, APC allows investors to stake their tokens and earn significant rewards once it’s live. But that’s not all. It offers referral incentives, rewarding users who spread the word with tokens or even cash payouts. Arctic Pablo’s sense of community is unmatched, with competitions that let participants earn rewards in APC tokens or USD. These features make it far more than just a meme coin; it’s a thriving ecosystem designed to maximize returns for its investors. Now, let’s talk about the presale. Arctic Pablo is in its most exciting phase yet—Shangri-La. Having raced through seven earlier phases, including Glacier Groves, in record time, APC is priced at just $0.000047 in its 8th phase. This means an astronomical ROI of over 16,900% from now to its listing price of $0.008. The project has already raised over $800,000 in just days, showcasing investor confidence. Every passing moment brings a price increase as APC ventures into new “locations,” so getting in now means securing the best possible entry price.

Its playful branding and community-driven ecosystem make it a favorite among young investors. Peanut the Squirrel’s tokenomics are cleverly designed to reward holders with reflection bonuses, encouraging long-term investment. With its lighthearted appeal and emphasis on saving for the future, Peanut the Squirrel makes a solid case for why meme coins can be both fun and profitable. That’s why it’s earned its spot on the list of top new meme coins to invest this year. Goatseus Maximus: The Majestic Meme Coin Goatseus Maximus combines ancient mythology with modern meme culture, creating a unique narrative that investors can’t resist. This crypto embraces its goat-themed deity’s strength, wisdom, and mystique while delivering robust features like deflationary tokenomics. Each transaction burns a small percentage of the tokens, increasing scarcity and value over time. Its growing community worships the coin like a true deity, organizing events, memes, and campaigns to bolster its reach. Goatseus Maximus isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a movement. That’s why it deserves its place among the top new meme coins to invest in this year. Cat in a Dog’s World: The Underdog (or Undercat?) of Meme Coins Breaking all stereotypes, Cat in a Dog’s World is the meme coin for those who embrace individuality. Its quirky premise—of a lone cat navigating a dog-dominated world—resonates with crypto enthusiasts who root for the underdog. This token brings utility to the meme coin space by funding animal welfare initiatives and donating a portion of every transaction to shelters. The coin’s unique charm, paired with its charitable mission, has captured the hearts of many. It proves that meme coins can have style and substance, solidifying its place on this list of top new meme coins to invest in this year.

Speaking to CNBC, Tom Lee said he predicts Bitcoin will be weak in the short term and strong in the long term. The legendary figure said that Bitcoin is set to be one of the best-performing assets this year but faces short-term challenges. Noting that every dip in Bitcoin presents a buying opportunity, Lee warned that Bitcoin could fall to as low as $70,000 in February before recovering, and that if this scenario plays out, it could present a strong buying opportunity. “I still think Bitcoin will be one of the best performing asset classes this year. However, I think there is still an argument that BTC is a risky asset in the short term. I think the recent decline in Bitcoin was due to the market liquidation that occurred over the weekend. So I would say February doesn't look good for Bitcoin in the near term and it could drop to $70,000.” *This is not investment advice.

This innovative project, combining blockchain with artificial intelligence, is rapidly gaining traction. With its presale already raising $14.2 million, Lightchain AI is proving to be a standout investment for 2025. As market excitement builds, analysts see significant upside for both projects, but Lightchain AI’s cutting-edge technology could make it the bigger winner in the next bull run. How Ripple’s (XRP) Trump Boost Impacts Crypto Market The recent surge in Ripple's XRP price, reaching $3.11, is influenced by President Donald Trump's pro-cryptocurrency stance. His administration's favorable policies have bolstered investor confidence, leading to increased institutional interest in XRP. Notably, the launch of the $TRUMP coin has sparked optimism among investors, with some speculating that XRP could reach $7, driven by the administration's support for digital assets. However, the crypto market remains volatile, and the long-term impact of these developments on XRP's price is uncertain. Investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. Why Lightchain AI Is Set for Breakout Year in 2025 Lightchain AI is poised for a breakout year in 2025, driven by its innovative integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence. Currently in its presale phase at $0.005625 per token, the project has already raised over $14.2 million, reflecting strong investor confidence. The platform's unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism incentivizes nodes for valuable AI computations, enhancing network security and efficiency. Additionally, the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) enables seamless execution of AI-specific tasks on the blockchain, attracting developers and businesses seeking scalable solutions. With a strategic roadmap targeting ecosystem growth, cross-chain integration, and global adoption by mid-2025, Lightchain AI is well-positioned to become a leading player in the crypto space. Analysts predict significant appreciation in its token value, with some forecasts suggesting a 5,000% increase by 2025. This combination of technological innovation, robust tokenomics, and a clear growth strategy positions Lightchain AI for substantial success in the coming year. Don't Miss Out—Invest in Lightchain AI Today Both Ripple's XRP and Lightchain AI offer exciting investment opportunities in 2025. While XRP's Trump-fueled boost has captured headlines, it remains to be seen how sustainable its growth will be. Investors looking for long-term potential and cutting-edge technology should consider adding Lightchain AI to their portfolio. With its impressive presale performance, strong fundamentals, and promising future prospects, this project is poised for significant growth in the next bull run.

The approval to operate in the UK has confirmed Coinbase’s status as the country’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange. The FCA approval gives the Nasdaq-listed firm authority to serve both retail and institutional clients. Coinbase could also offer crypto-to-fiat services in the progressive UK markets. The United Kingdom is the second largest Coinbase market, only trailing the United States, where it has its headquarters. Coinbase approval process took less than a year Coinbase has had a presence in the UK through subsidiary firms since 2018. CB Payments Limited has consistently provided money services in the UK over this period. However, it didn’t provide crypto service directly; it offered a freeway for users to trade crypto on entities within the Coinbase group. The regulatory approval that allows the platform to operate as an exchange is significant. Importantly, the registration process happened faster after the FCA completed its investigation into Coinbase Payments for what the company described as “unintentional breaches” of a 2020 voluntary agreement. The platform was fined almost $4.3 million for bringing on some high-risk clients. Coinbase is the first crypto asset company to be approved by the FCA to operate in the UK in 2025. Its approval follows that of trading firm GSR Markets, which was allowed to operate from December 2024. The FCA plans to generate a cryptocurrency framework that will attract most crypto players to the UK economy. UK’s population continues to adopt cryptocurrency, signaling a growing market In 2024, the FCA surveyed cryptocurrency and discovered that digital asset adoption is on the rise. A year earlier, only 10% of adults held cryptocurrencies. Yet, the adoption rose to 12% in November 2024. Besides, the average holdings per investor also grew from $1,964 to $2,268. Coinbase has been aggressively fulfilling its expansion strategies in Europe . Its latest entry in the UK comes after the company acquired approvals in Ireland and Germany. Besides, its Irish entity is registered as a crypto service provider in the Netherlands and Italy. The crypto exchange platform still aspires to increase its presence across several continents. At the latest World Economic Forum in Davos, Coinbase leadership explored the possibilities of working in Southeast Asia. Its CEO, Brain Armstrong, discussed this with the Filipino finance secretary Ralph Recto. According to the Philippines Department of Finance, Coinbase initiated the meeting to find a smooth entry into the Southeast Asian nation, where the platform has been stepping up its engagement. The crypto exchange has supported developer programs in the Philippines and Thailand to launch local stablecoins. Also, Coinbase released a report that highlighted citizens’ perceptions of cryptos in five countries, including the Philippines, on how crypto is critical to improving financial systems. The platform already operates in Singapore, having secured regulatory approval in October 2023.

Unlike previous spikes driven by strong buying demand, this rise appears linked to broader market instability and currency shifts. Bitcoin Price Down, Kimchi Premium Up Over the weekend, the crypto market experienced a massive downturn that wiped over $400 billion from its overall value. This was in reaction to U.S. President Donald Trump’s slapping a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, including energy products like oil and natural gas. He also imposed a 10% tax on various Chinese-made goods ostensibly to address trade imbalances and intellectual property theft. His action prompted a response from the affected countries, which introduced levies of their own on U.S. products. Naturally, the crypto market reacted to this simmering trade war, tanking 12% at the last count and causing more than $2.2 billion in liquidations . Interestingly, while BTC’s price dropped, the Kimchi premium rose, signaling a potential shift in trading behavior. This premium is fueled by the imbalance created by South Korea’s strict capital controls, which limit arbitrage opportunities, making it nearly impossible for crypto bought outside the country to be resold within its borders. Historically, when it was high, it indicated strong demand from Korean investors looking to buy Bitcoin. However, analysts suggest the current uptick is not due to local purchases but rather a reaction to external factors, with the rising U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) fingered as the main culprit. Korean Investors Selling Off BTC Holdings Blockchain researcher and CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju noted that the premium went up at BTC’s local bottom, not because Korean traders were buying the dip but because the cryptocurrency was being converted into U.S. dollars. This suggests that investors were offloading their holdings in response to broader market pressures rather than accumulating Bitcoin. The U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly in recent times, adding downward pressure on the price of BTC. As a result, many traders in South Korea have responded by shifting their coins into USD rather than the Korean won, inadvertently contributing to the growing gap in Bitcoin’s price between Korean and global exchanges. “Few Koreans are converting BTC into KRW,” Ju tweeted. “Other countries are likely seeing a similar trend.” The post South Korea’s Kimchi Premium Reaches 3-Year High Amid Market Turmoil appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Kimchi Premium|South Korea,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|ASIA|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-02-03 15:51:56

As they wait, they are looking for hidden gems in the market that could significantly boost their portfolios. This is even more true now that most top altcoins, especially Toncoin (TON) and Ripple (XRP), are experiencing a dip. However, FXGuys (FXG) is positioning itself to become the best crypto to buy now. The crypto project offers a 150% ROI in its presale and a further 100x profit potential when it is listed on major crypto exchanges. Read on to learn why Toncoin and XRP’s holders are betting big on $FXG for a massive ROI! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Top Altcoins Prediction: Ripple’s XRP Risks Falling to $2 Ripple’s XRP has shown a mere 0.60% token price rise in the past week to trade at $3.15. Moreover, many experts predict a potential dip to $2 if XRP fails to gain traction, which has further fueled speculation in the market. In a recent analysis posted on the microblogging platform X, the top market expert EGRAG CRYPTO has highlighted key support zones for Ripple’s XRP. According to him, Ripple’s XRP might retrace to $2, citing it as an “Equilibrium” level. However, it is worth noting that the recent correction in Ripple’s XRP also came amid a broader crypto market crash, which also wiped off gains from XRP and other top altcoins . Consequently, many XRP holdings are moving to FX Guys’ token presale with high hopes of making better profits. Toncoin’s TON Suffers a Crash Toncoin’s TON experienced a 5.09% price decline over the past seven days, falling to $4.90 in the process. These sluggish recent price movements have raised concerns amongst holders as they underscore the uncertainty in the market and, specifically, Toncoin’s TON struggles over the past few weeks. On the broader timeframes, TON has equally been unimpressive, failing to break above the $6 mark successfully in the past month. For example, Toncoin’s TON has declined by 14.92% over the past month . Analysts say this might be due to the general market correction. This is why TON holders are moving funds to the FX Guys presale to recoup their losses.

39874859,https://finbold.com/?p=234570,1738598136,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,$65M reportedly stolen from Coinbase users in past two months,https://finbold.com/65m-reportedly-stolen-from-coinbase-users-in-past-two-months/,"Pseudonymous on-chain cryptocurrency analyst ZachXBT is one of the most respected voices in the crypto space — but surprisingly enough, he doesn’t offer investment advice. Instead, the ‘crypto sleuth’ has taken to unveiling and publicizing the many scams running rampant in the world of digital assets. The blockchain detective has also exposed several high-profile hacks — most recently, a $112 million XRP breach on January 31 and a $35 million Atomic Wallet hack in June of 2023 . Unfortunately, it appears that ZachXBT won’t be left without work any time soon — as the crypto investigator reported that users have had roughly $65 million stolen from Coinbase over the past couple of months, per a February 3 post made on social media platform X . Safe wallet scam and social engineering lead to millions stolen from Coinbase In the aforementioned X threat, the investigator revealed that they had collaborated with fellow reacher tanuki42 to review Coinbase withdrawals cross-referenced with data gathered via direct messaging. With an admittedly limited dataset, and relying only on high-confidence instances when it comes to direct messages, the duo identified roughly $65 million in digital assets stolen from Coinbase from December 2024 to January 2025. 1/ Over the past few months I imagine you have seen many Coinbase users complain on X about their accounts suddenly being restricted. This is the result of aggressive risk models and Coinbase’s failure to stop its users losing $300M+ per year to social engineering scams. pic.twitter.com/PjtX7vmjqc — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) February 3, 2025 Readers should note that, as stated by ZachXBT, the actual amount stolen over this timeframe is likely to be much higher. So, how did this happen? Apparently, a combination of social engineering attacks was used. Crypto scammers would call victims from spoofed phone numbers and use personal information gathered from private databases to gain their trust. Following this, the cybercriminals would tell Coinbase users that their accounts had multiple unauthorized login attempts. Once that was done, victims would receive a spoofed email that appeared to be from Coinbase — one that included a fake case ID and instructed users to transfer funds to a specific wallet and whitelist a certain address while support verified the security of their account. In addition, the scammers possess the capability to clone Coinbase’s site to near-perfection — allowing them to send different prompts to their targets. Per the researcher, the attacks originate from two main groups — skids from the Com and threat actors located in India. Reportedly, both primarily target US customers.

After reaching a record high in January, Solana's price has now dropped to $200. In just under a week, the SOL ecosystem has been shaken by a 19% decline, prompting heavy selling from traders. The market instability is further exacerbated as meme coin BONK also sees a daily decrease of 12.02%. Solana's Price Drop: Brief Setback or Start of a Bearish Trend? Solana (SOL) has been among the top performers in the crypto market over the past year, often demonstrating strong gains. However, its current price reflects a notable downturn. Today's 8% drop in Solana's price mirrors the wider market trend. Experts suggest this decline may be linked to Trump's tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico. Source: CoinMarketCap Some market analysts believe that SOL could rebound and rise above $250 in the coming months, though its current volatility is a concern for many traders. Others worry this might signal the beginning of a bearish trend for Solana and the broader market. Traders Exit BONK Amid Decline BONK, a prominent meme coin utilizing the SOL network, experienced rapid growth, reaching a high of $0.000059 in November 2024. However, like Solana, BONK has faced a steep correction. It has tumbled over 67% from its peak to its current price of $0.000019. Source: CoinMarketCap BONK's price closed 12.02% lower in a single day, aligning with the broader market trend. Analysts suggest that the approval of a BONK ETF might trigger a price recovery. In the near term, however, analysts warn that BONK’s price might decline further. As many investors grow anxious, attention is shifting towards more practical projects like DTX Exchange. DTX's Surge: Why Traders Are Switching to This $0.16 Altcoin With uncertainty looming over BONK and Solana, traders are seeking undervalued tokens with strong growth potential. DTX Exchange is gaining real traction, currently trading at $0.16, having raised over $13.3 million in its presale. DTX Exchange is a hybrid Layer 1 blockchain designed to connect the worlds of traditional and decentralized finance.

Conclusion: A Strategic Shift in the Crypto Market With Solana prices declining and interest in BONK waning, the crypto market is undergoing a strategic shift. Although some predict a recovery for SOL, many traders are eagerly eyeing the next big growth opportunity: DTX. DTX Exchange presents itself as an attractive option, boasting strong fundamentals, an advanced trading platform, and significant community growth.

The Solana price has fallen to $200 after reaching a new all time high in January. In less than 7 days, the SOL ecosystem has been rocked with a 19% loss, which has caused traders to sell heavily. The turbulence only compounds as meme coin BONK itself experiences a drop of 12.02% for the day. Solana Price Decline: A Temporary Correction or the Start of a Downtrend? Among the leading performers in the crypto market over the last year, Solana (SOL) has frequently shown to be one of the strongest performers in the market. Yet, the Solana price reflects a significant decline. The decline of 8% in the Solana price today alone reflects the broader market trend. Analysts speculate that this decrease is a result of Trump’s tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico. Source: CoinMarketCap Some analysts claim that SOL could rise again and surpass $250 in the next few months, but it is currently too volatile for many traders. Others fear that this is the start of a bearish phase for the market and the Solana price. BONK Suffers as Traders Flee BONK is a leading meme coin that leverages the SOL network. It had one of the fastest rises, hitting a peak of $0.000059 in November of 2024. However, BONK has experienced a steep correction, similar to the Solana price decline. BONK has fallen more than 67% from its all-time high to its current price of $0.000019. Source: CoinMarketCap BONK closed 12.02% lower in one day, following the broader market shift. Analysts claim that the approval of the BONK ETF could result in a comeback for its price. In the short term, however, analysts claim that BONK’s price could fall even further. With many investors in panic, the market is turning its attention to more utility based projects like DTX Exchange. The Rise of DTX: Why Traders Are Moving to This $0.16 Altcoin Traders are on the hunt for undervalued tokens with the potential for high growth, as uncertainty hangs over BONK and Solana prices. DTX Exchange is one such project seen in real traction with its trading price of $0.16 and raised more than $13.3 million in its presale. DTX Exchange is a hybrid Layer 1 blockchain built to bridge the traditional and the decentralized finance worlds. DTX is quickly gaining traction with the adoption of its exchange that facilitates traditional financial instruments trading along with Web3 products offering investors an ease of trading. Deep liquidity, fast transactions and security that non custodial trading gives traders — DTX provides users a smooth trading experience. DTX is presenting itself as the go to platform for next generation traders with the ability to trade multiple asset classes including cryptocurrencies, stocks, forex, ETFs and commodities. DTX is a fundamentally strong project that has real world use cases. As more traders start to realize its potential in 2025, DTX tokens may have a big price hike making it one of the top altcoins to watch out for. Conclusion: A Strategic Shift in the Crypto Market As the Solana price plummets and the investor interest wanes for BONK, the crypto market is on a strategic change. Although SOL is predicted to experience a rebound, many traders have been unwilling to ignore the next high growth opportunity in the market: DTX. DTX Exchange proves itself as a compelling option with strong fundamentals, cutting edge trading platform and very explosive community growth. If you are looking for an investment with significant upside before the market’s next rally, DTX is a token you cannot miss.

While Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) dominate the market, this new token offers a rare chance to experience exponential returns. A Strong Start for THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Within minutes of its presale launch, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN raised over $1 million, solidifying its position as a standout in 2025.

Exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM , early investors have a unique opportunity to secure this high-potential token before prices climb further. How THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Stands Against Major Cryptos Cardano (ADA, $0.30): Cardano has built a reputation for steady development but lacks the momentum seen in new projects like THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN, which promises faster adoption and potentially higher value growth. SEI ($0.12): SEI shows promise in the DeFi space but has struggled with slower adoption rates. THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers a faster trajectory, making it an appealing choice for investors seeking transformative opportunities. Polkadot (DOT, $4.22): Polkadot was once a symbol of early-stage explosive growth, but its momentum has slowed. THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN reflects the early potential that once made DOT a hit, presenting a new opportunity for substantial rewards. Why You Should Act Now Analysts predict that THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN could deliver exponential value, with returns reaching up to 100,000%. Its limited availability, deflationary model, and strong early performance set it apart as a top investment for 2025.

This dip marked one of the biggest market crashes that caused $2.25 billion in liquidations. According to market analyst Michael Van de Poppe, this liquidation event was worse than what happened after the collapse of FTX and Terra LUNA. The liquidations impacted more than 736,000 traders per Coinglass . Moreover, $1.87 billion were long liquidations that caused forced selling. This, in turn, fuelled a steep downtrend. Ethereum Sees Worst Drop Since 2021 On 3rd February, the largest altcoin, Ethereum (ETH), fell from above $3,000 to $2,150, marking its biggest single-day loss since 2021. At press time, ETH had recouped some of these losses to trade at $2,584. Other top ten altcoins also traded lower during the Asian trading session. Ripple’s XRP was down by 17% to trade at $2.27, while Solana dropped below $200 after a 7% loss. BNB Coin (BNB) and Cardano (ADA) also shed 12% and 20, respectively. The largest meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE) had also dropped by 17% to its lowest level in three months. Other meme coins also registered similar losses, with the total meme coin market cap falling by 14% to $11 billion. Bitcoin (BTC) registered a 4% to trade at around $95,000. However, the king coin’s losses were mild compared to altcoins. This saw Bitcoin’s dominance surge to 64%, its highest level since February 2021. However, the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index has dropped from “greed” to “neutral,” pointing towards waning bullish sentiment. Trump Tariffs Attributed to the Recent Dip According to Bloomberg , the risk assets selloff follows the tariffs US President Donald Trump announced. Once these tariffs come into effect, they could affect billions of dollars in imports from Canada and Mexico. The ongoing tariff war could cascade into a trade war that could impact global financial markets. There are also other concerns about stagflation and recession, which is, in turn, forcing traders to sell risk assets. Trump’s election was instrumental to the rally in late 2024. While he has signed an executive order favoring the cryptocurrency industry, the ongoing tariff discussions have caused the steepest decline in history. These losses have not just been limited to the crypto industry. At press time, Nasdaq futures were down by 390 points, while the S&P 500 futures were down by 1.46% per Google Finance.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|BNB|Cardano|Cryptocurrency News|Ethereum News|Solana|XRP News,EN,0,0,MARKET|ADA|BNB|BTC|ETH,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-03 16:02:08

While these established tokens remain investor favorites, attention is now turning toward emerging altcoins with high-growth potential. One such standout is Lightchain AI , a next-generation blockchain and artificial intelligence platform. With its presale raising over $14.2 million at a price of $0.005, Lightchain AI is gaining momentum as a top investment opportunity, with projections suggesting a higher ROI than SOL and XRP in the coming years. Solana and Ripple - Crypto Powerhouses with Strong Fundamentals Solana (SOL) has earned its place as a leader in high-speed blockchain technology, boasting low fees and fast transactions. Despite periodic network issues, Solana’s ecosystem continues to thrive, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Many investors anticipate SOL reaching new highs by 2025. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) continues to expand its influence in global payments. With major financial partnerships and recent regulatory victories, XRP has cemented its position as a trusted cross-border transaction solution. Its adoption rate and real-world utility make it a long-term contender in the crypto sector. Why Lightchain AI Is the Next Big Altcoin While SOL and XRP rely on their existing ecosystems, Lightchain AI is bringing a new and transformative approach to blockchain technology. By merging AI and decentralized systems, Lightchain AI tackles efficiency, transparency, and scalability challenges, positioning itself as a major disruptor in the crypto space. What sets Lightchain AI apart is its community-driven development model, allowing developers to actively shape its growth. This open-source approach ensures the platform evolves alongside user needs, creating a constantly improving ecosystem. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s advanced computing framework makes it ideal for real-time AI applications, including predictive analytics and autonomous systems.

While these well-established tokens continue to be popular among investors, the spotlight is now turning towards new altcoins that show great promise for growth. A notable contender in this space is Lightchain AI , an innovative platform that combines blockchain technology with artificial intelligence. Having raised over $14.2 million during its presale at a price of $0.005, Lightchain AI is gaining traction as a prime investment choice, with expectations of delivering higher returns than SOL and XRP in the years to come. Solana and Ripple - Leading Cryptos with Robust Foundations Solana (SOL) stands out as a pioneer in high-speed blockchain solutions, offering minimal fees and rapid transactions. Even though it faces occasional network challenges, Solana’s ecosystem continues to expand, especially in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Many investors are optimistic about SOL reaching new peaks by 2025. On the other hand, Ripple (XRP) is solidifying its global payment network. With significant partnerships in the financial sector and recent wins on the regulatory front, XRP has established itself as a reliable tool for cross-border transactions. Its widespread adoption and practical usage make it a strong long-term player in the crypto market. Reasons Lightchain AI Could Be the Next Major Altcoin While SOL and XRP benefit from their established ecosystems, Lightchain AI is introducing a groundbreaking approach to blockchain technology. By integrating AI with decentralized systems, Lightchain AI addresses issues of efficiency, transparency, and scalability, positioning itself as a key disruptor in the cryptocurrency realm. The unique aspect of Lightchain AI is its community-focused development strategy, which empowers developers to actively contribute to its evolution. This open-source methodology ensures the platform advances in line with user requirements, fostering a dynamic and continuously improving ecosystem. Moreover, Lightchain AI’s cutting-edge computing framework makes it perfect for real-time AI applications, such as predictive analytics and autonomous systems. With its emphasis on making a tangible impact, investors are closely monitoring its progress. Projected ROI for Lightchain AI Priced at $0.005 in its presale, Lightchain AI offers a promising entry point for early investors seeking significant returns. Experts anticipate that its emphasis on AI-driven decentralized applications (dApps) and secure data processing has the potential to yield returns that greatly surpass those of SOL and XRP by 2025. Thanks to its scalable infrastructure and modular development strategy, it can meet increasing demand without sacrificing performance. This approach ensures that Lightchain AI is well-positioned as a high-growth investment in both the blockchain and AI sectors. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",More News,EN,0,0,SOL|XRP|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-02-03 16:03:32

This starkly contrasts with the widely cited $2 billion liquidation, which Zhou suggests is a conservative estimate due to API limitations across multiple exchanges . Real liquidations could be four-fold than reported The downturn, spurred by U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest tariff announcement , triggered widespread fears of a prolonged global trade war, sending financial markets into turmoil and prompting investors to offload risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Early reports from CoinGlass showed that total liquidations across all assets stood at roughly $2.4 billion, with Ethereum ( ETH ) taking the hardest hit , leading the liquidation spree with $617.35 million, followed by Bitcoin ( BTC ) at $441.8 million. However, Zhou highlights that these figures significantly underrepresent real liquidation volumes due to exchange-level API restrictions. He estimates that actual liquidations across the crypto market stand ‘at least around $8 to 10 billion,’ far exceeding initial reports. According to Zhou, Bybit alone recorded $2.1 billion in 24-hour liquidations, yet CoinGlass only reported $333 million due to technical limitations on how much data feeds are pushed out per second. I am afraid that today real total liquidation is a lot more than $2B, by my estimation it should be at least around $8-10b. FYI, Bybit 24hr liquidation alone was $2.1B, As you can see in below screenshot, Bybit 24hr liquidations recorded on Coinglass was around $333m, however,… https://t.co/4WLkPxTYF4 pic.twitter.com/woTOHQvNkt — Ben Zhou (@benbybit) February 3, 2025 This discrepancy, according to him, exists across all major crypto exchanges, meaning the reported $2 billion liquidation is likely just a fraction of the actual liquidation data. The Bigger picture: How severe is the crypto sell-off? While reported figures suggest a $2 billion liquidation, Zhou’s comments imply that the real market damage may be four times larger. According to crypto analyst CrypNuevo , if Zhou’s estimate of $8 billion to $10 billion in liquidations holds, the recent wipeout would surpass the combined liquidations from the COVID-19 market crash, the Terra ( LUNA ) collapse, and the FTX implosion. “To see this with perspective… that would literally be more than COVID, Luna and FTX liquidations combined together, in just 24 hours.” – CrypNuevo With liquidity concerns rising and volatility spiking, traders remain on edge, questioning whether the market can stabilize or if another wave of liquidations is on the horizon.

Last year, the crypto market leader pulled over a 15% margin on other top assets, widening the gap between altcoins. However, the next level for most bulls remains hitting the $150K mark in this cycle. Last year, BTC’s price hit multiple all-time highs, from the initial Q1 spike to $73K to $107K after the United States Presidential elections. Analyst Projects $3 Trillion Market Cap For Next Phase A digital asset analyst, Percival, hinted that for Bitcoin price to tap $150K, the asset’s market cap must soar to $3 trillion. BTC’s market cap currently sits above $2 trillion while its price trades at $98,039. On the other hand, the broader crypto market cap dropped 5% to $3.48 trillion, marking another flash correction. According to the report, with Bitcoin improving structural dynamics, upward spikes remain in the mix coupled with wider acceptance among centralized finance players. A 2021 bull run cycle chart is needed to hit the mark as bulls ramp up pressure. In 2021, the market cap soared 470% to a new all-time high, while this cycle has recorded only 111% growth. This leaves a pathway for more growth in addition to sentiments backing a $150K price with an expected $1 trillion market cap top. “ By tracing a Fibonacci Expansion from the bottom in November 2022 ($15,450K) to our consolidation in 2024 ($48,934K), we demarcate a target between $136K and $150K, converging with the Realized Price Bands metric, which shows us the same picture regarding the money that was invested in Bitcoin (ex: I have 1 BTC bought at $50K and I will sell at $100K, means a gain and net inflow of $100K in Bitcoin), it becomes a good gauge for the next resistance in Bitcoin,” Percival added. Bitcoin ETF Still A Lifeline Percival explained that spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States remain possible impulses to retail and institutional investors. So far, $40 billion in inflows to these funds represent 4.7% of the realized market cap, and with traditional investors’ appetite on the rise, holders expect more inflows. Bitcoin ETFs introduced new players to the market, diversifying their portfolios and ushering in another layer of legitimacy.

However, crypto analyst “Coosh” Alemzadeh (@AlemzadehC) maintains a bullish long-term outlook, sharing a weekly chart of DOGE/USD and remarking, “DOGE: Looking really good here,” despite the recent turmoil. Why Dogecoin Is Still Looking Bullish The unexpected news of new tariffs by the Trump administration on major trading partners like China, Mexico, and Canada on Friday has sent shockwaves across financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. The news has led to a broad sell-off in risk assets, with Dogecoin, known for its high volatility, being particularly affected. The fear of an escalating trade war has dampened investor confidence, pushing many to liquidate their positions in cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Dogecoin May Face An ‘Ugly’ Drop Before The Weekend, Analyst Warns Following the tariff announcement, Dogecoin saw an immediate and significant drop, within hours of the news breaking. Over the weekend, the crypto market crash extended as part of a larger market reaction, where major altcoins like XRP and Cardano also experienced double-digit percentage losses. The entire crypto market wiped over $2.2 billion in crypto liquidations. Alemzadeh chart, drawn on the weekly timeframe, shows DOGE’s price initially breaking above a descending red trendline in October. That line has acted as a key resistance zone stretching back to previous local highs, and the ensuing retreat has brought the market right below the trendline again. In parallel, Dogecoin is still positioned above its 30-week moving average (30w), which is plotted as a pink-dotted curve and currently sits around the $0.20–$0.22 range. Analysts often regard weekly closes above this average as a sign of underlying strength, suggesting that DOGE may yet hold onto its bullish structure if the market steadies above that threshold. The chart also highlights a series of Fibonacci retracement and extension levels, each offering insight into potential support and resistance. At the forefront is the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement around $0.2667, a critical region that the price now hovers around. This level often draws the attention of traders looking to identify whether the market is in a standard pullback or has begun a deeper correction. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Plunges to $0.20: Is This the Bottom or More Pain Ahead? Next up sits the 0.786 retracement near $0.3467. Beyond that, full retracement around $0.4843 marks a more distant objective should DOGE reclaim its bullish momentum. Even loftier extensions, indicated on Alemzadeh’s chart at $1.27 (1.618) and $2.30 (2.0), serve as hypothetical targets if the token achieves a major breakout. An additional element is the Elliott Wave labeling, depicting what appears to be waves “1, 2, 3,” followed by the current dip marked as wave “4” near $0.26. In traditional Elliott Wave theory, wave four commonly retraces into the 0.236–0.618 zone of the previous wave, so the present price action touching the 0.618 Fibonacci point fits well with that pattern. Should DOGE confirm wave four support, the next phase—wave five—could drive the market back above former highs with the main targets being $1.27 and $2.30 if bullish sentiment returns. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.25.

The new regulated status will expand the derivative products available to Euro-area clients. Kraken has secured a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) license to offer financial solutions in the Euro area. The license was obtained through the acquisition of a MiFID-accredited firm from Cyprus, recently gaining a license from the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC). Along with the new license, Kraken will remain MiCA compliant by removing Tether (USDT) and other stablecoins with no bank-based reserves. Until recently, Kraken was one of the few carriers of fiat pairings for USDT . Kraken to offer advanced derivative products The new compliant status means Kraken can offer more derivative products to tap the growing demand of European traders. Selected EU markets will gain access to regulated derivative products, suitable for advanced crypto traders. ‘ As we continue to expand our services across the globe, our focus on the European market remains a top priority ,’ said Shannon Kurtas, Kraken Co-GM of Pro & Exchange. Kraken has always provided services for the EU market, striving to remain compliant by only offering regulated products. For that reason, Kraken’s pairs are one of the fiat off-ramps for crypto traders. Kraken remains an important hub for spot trading but has been building its capacity to offer advanced trading opportunities. The exchange has previously acquired a UK-based FCA-regulated company, Crypto Facilities, which later transformed into one of the first licensed crypto futures platforms in the UK. Kraken already offers over 300 trading pairs in its derivative market, preserving the more complex and riskier products for its Pro version. Kraken’s website takes more than 10% of its traffic from Germany and France, two of the largest Eurozone markets. Nearly 40% of the exchange’s traffic comes from the USA, where the exchange is also one of the go-to markets to trade between stablecoins and fiat. Kraken moves to quarterly reporting Kraken remains one of the top 20 centralized exchanges, aiming to grow its influence in the new year. In 2024, the bull market expanded Kraken’s earnings to a total of $1.5B, an increase of 128% year-on-year. The platform carries more than $42.8B in assets after expanding its influence over the years. Kraken started with just $27M in primary capital, soon becoming a staple in the crypto space. Due to its reliability, Kraken was chosen as one of the distributors for FTX claims and is expected to handle fund distribution by March. Due to its growing influence and exposure, Kraken will start posting quarterly results and publish a regular Proof of Reserves in a bid to present itself as one of the most secure and reliable crypto exchanges. Enhanced transparency and reporting are also part of the EU package for MiFID-regulated companies. Kraken still carries $4.2B in daily trading volumes through a mix of blue-chip assets and rapid listing of newly launched tokens. The exchange carries 2.5M funded accounts for its spot market. Kraken is also among the exchanges with a detailed anti-scam policy, though often creating complaints about locking and scrutinizing user accounts. Kraken grows its L2 chain Alongside the regulated and centralized activities, Kraken is also building its presence as a decentralized hub. The Ink chain is a L2 network, which has already caught up with Arbitrum and Optimism in becoming Stage 1 based on decentralization criteria. The Kraken chain has been more active in the past month, and it is already paying higher blob fees to Ethereum as activity picks up. Ink acquired Stage 1 status in the last week of January, meaning it can work as a censorship-free network. The chain will continue to carry USDT in its new cross-chain form, USDT0, available for decentralized trading only. The Ink L2 chain carries $4.27M in total value locked, while still growing its collection of DeFi apps. Ink relies on Velodrome and InkySwap for most of its DEX activity.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/a-200-million-move-from-the-project-that-experienced-a-huge-price-drop-due-to-the-debt-crisis-here-are-the-details/,"THORChain’s governing body has approved a landmark proposal that converts defaulted debt into equity tokens as part of its restructuring efforts to resolve its debt crisis. THORChain Plans to Overcome $200 Million Debt Crisis by Issuing TCY Stock Tokens The majority of THORChain’s validators have accepted governance proposal 6, demonstrating community consensus on how to deal with the nearly $200 million debt crisis that has arisen in the protocol. THORChain has suspended THORFi services, including its “Savings and Lending” programs, due to financial uncertainties. A 90-day restructuring plan is in place to address and mitigate issues resulting from unserviceable debts accumulating in these programs. The plan, approved by the community, is to convert debt into equity, specifically a new token called TCY (Thorchain Yield) with a supply of 200 million. This means that instead of repaying loans in bitcoin or ether, lenders and savers will receive TCY tokens, effectively converting their loan requests into equity within the Thorchain ecosystem. TCY holders will be entitled to receive 10% of Thorchain’s revenue forever. “THORChain will convert $200 million worth of debt into equity through a new token that will receive 10% of the network revenue in perpetuity,” the THORChain team said. The proposal involves minting 200 million TCY tokens, distributed at a rate of 1 TCY for every dollar of defaulted debt. The core team is expected to create a RUNE/TCY liquidity pool with $500,000 in liquidity at $0.1 per TCY, funded by $5 million from the treasury. This means that for those with money in Thorchain’s lending and savings programs (ThorFi), their assets will be converted to TCY rather than being paid back in the original asset, although it remains unclear how long the recovery will take. *This is not investment advice.

The latest drop has invalidated XRP’s recent push to hold its price above the $3 mark in pursuit of a new all-time high. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $2.50, reflecting daily losses of over 15%, while on the weekly chart, XRP is down almost 20%. At one point on February 3, XRP saw a sharp decline of about 40% within 13 hours before recovering slightly. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Massive capital outflows have accompanied this price plunge. In this case, XRP’s market cap currently stands at $138.09 billion, a total drop of $23.97 billion in the last 24 hours. On a weekly timeframe, the asset has wiped out $32.96 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data. XRP one-week market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Whales dumping XRP Amid this trend, whale investors have also been on a selling spree as XRP showed increasing signs of weakness. Specifically, data shared by prominent on-chain cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez in an X post on February 3 indicated that whales sold off more than 130 million XRP within 24 hours. XRP whale transaction chart. Source: Santiment/Ali_charts It remains to be seen whether the full impact of this offloading has been realized, given the potential for increased volatility following Ripple’s release of another 1 billion XRP from escrow. Despite the current bearish movement, sentiment around XRP remains bullish in the long term, particularly from a regulatory standpoint. There is anticipation that the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) will soon decide on the Ripple case, potentially terminating the legal suit or reaching a settlement in favor of the blockchain company. Indeed, the resolution of this case could be monumental for the asset, especially since XRP’s recent price breakout was partly driven by speculation of friendly regulation under the Trump administration. Similarly, the regulator is set to decide on an XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) application. If approved, the product could drive institutional capital into the asset, with chances of approval appearing stronger amid perceptions of a more favorable SEC stance. XRP’s technical outlook From a technical perspective, analysis by pseudonymous cryptocurrency trading expert The Great Mattsby in an X post on February 3 identified key price levels for XRP to watch. The expert observed that XRP successfully backtested the conversion line at $1.98 and the baseline at $1.87 during the monthly timeframe, which serve as crucial support zones. These levels, part of the Ichimoku system, define momentum and trend direction. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Currently trading above the $2 level, XRP has pulled back from its recent $3.26 high. If support holds, a renewed push toward resistance is possible. However, a breakdown below $1.87 could trigger a deeper retracement toward the $1.30 to $1.50 range. Generally, market sentiment for XRP remains bearish, as reflected by the Fear & Greed Index at 44, signaling fear. The 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $2.58 indicates that XRP is below its short-term average, signaling a possible extension of the bearish outlook. However, the 200-day SMA at $1.25 reflects long-term growth potential. The 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 40.02, indicating a neutral position with room for movement, though a short-term downside appears more likely in the immediate future.

Blockchains operate in silos, which deepen tribalism instead of encouraging meaningful collaboration. The explosion of L2 solutions on Ethereum has deepened fragmentation, with each blockchain actually competing against Ethereum. Some analysts cite this fact as the reason for ether’s stagnant price. Others take this view even further – that the price of ether can only go down. They argue that Ethereum’s scalability results in fewer users relying on the L1 blockchain, opting to leverage L2 solutions instead. These solutions pay very low fees, and Ethereum’s revenues are correspondingly lower. The end result could be a divergence between the price of ether, dropping due to lower fees, and Ethereum’s L1 utility (increasing by the number of L2 users). A third argument is that some successful L2 solutions might end up detaching from Ethereum in the long term, taking their user base with them. Bitcoin and Ethereum should cooperate, not compete Bitcoin boasts a solid security model based on UTXO or Unspent Transaction Output – an output that hasn’t been used as an input in a transaction (transferring Bitcoin from one address to another). On the other hand, Ethereum is renowned for its flourishing dApp ecosystem. Both blockchains focus on decentralization but fulfill different purposes. Ethereum’s rich functionality enables the execution of smart contracts and applications, while Bitcoin is mainly a store of value. Despite their differences, Bitcoin and Ethereum shouldn’t compete. Bitcoin should be used as a stable asset and a store of value, while Ethereum interacts with the dApps running on it. An investor could use Ethereum to access DeFi services in a portfolio and Bitcoin – to preserve value. Apex Fusion bridges the best of Ethereum and Bitcoin, building on the concept of uniting Web3 and moving beyond competition to create a scalable and collaborative blockchain ecosystem. The platform promotes a unified ecosystem that is inclusive, neutral, and designed with interoperability in mind. It provides a platform where existing projects and developer communities can innovate, integrate, and deploy. Apex Fusion’s ecosystem is comprised of three layers designed to optimize security, scalability, and decentralization from the start. These three interconnected networks – Prime, Vector, and Nexus – each serve a unique purpose. Prime Network, an L1 blockchain based on UTXO, is the foundational Apex Fusion ecosystem layer that provides security and decentralization. Vector Network, an L2 on UTXO, is a secondary layer that enhances performance and scalability and is designed for high-throughput services and applications. Finally, the EVM L2 solution Nexus Network focuses on speed and cost-efficiency, handling complex transactions and smart contract execution. The three chains are connected through the Reactor Bridge, enabling interoperability and efficient interaction throughout the ecosystem. This unique architecture offers users more flexibility by making dedicated blockchains available, which are optimized for a specific use case. The Prime layer ensures a predictable, decentralized, and secure environment. Traditional L1 blockchains compete for execution, but unlike them, Prime emphasizes liquid staking, giving developers a neutral foundation on which to build. The ecosystem’s core is interoperability. It’s designed with seamless cross-chain interaction, allowing projects to use multiple blockchain technologies frictionlessly. Ethereum developers can use dedicated chains with full EVM compatibility and don’t have to compete with L1 solutions. Apex Fusion is entering an exciting development stage, namely the Prime Mainnet launch. Stake pool operator (SPO) onboarding is underway, guaranteeing a fully decentralized network from the start. The platform is finalizing cross-chain interoperability tools, enabling frictionless interactions between its three layers. Early adopters will receive participation rewards and engagement incentives. More than 80 SPOs are operational on the testnet, ensuring resilience and stability. We’re all paying a high price for fragmentation The problems caused by Web3 fragmentation are evident . Monetary incentives are the primary driver of end-user and project activity at the moment. Estimates suggest that there are at least 1,000 blockchains, and most of them replicate a small number of successful use cases without end and without innovation. Ultimately, users are unable to take advantage of the ecosystem in its entirety, which discourages adoption and reinforces the bias that Web3 is complex. This bias misleads people into believing that the complexity is purposeful and conceals illicit activities. These misconceptions compromise exploration and experimentation. The transition from fragmentation to collaboration holds immense potential. Simplifying onboarding will lead biases surrounding Web3 to dissipate. Partnerships with reputable projects can enhance Web3 platforms’ trustworthiness and credibility. For example, Apex Fusion’s Reputation System quantifies and validates contributions, ensuring trust and transparency in decentralized environments. This development has given rise to the concept of “trust through reputation.” A blockchain project that specializes in developing smart contracts can cooperate with a decentralized oracle platform to improve its apps’ reliability and security. Such a partnership would allow the blockchain to tap into the oracle’s expertise. The oracle would, in turn, refine its technology by gaining access to more real-world use cases. Blockchain projects can collaborate on decentralized identity solutions, cross-chain communication protocols, or other interoperability standards. Such collaboration enhances user experience by enabling interactions. Partnerships within Web3 can enhance resilience and mitigate risks. By diversifying partnerships, projects can reduce reliance on a single service provider or technology. What’s more, collaborations frequently involve due diligence on future partners, helping identify potential weaknesses or risks early on. Teams can address issues promptly, minimizing the likelihood of project failure. Web3 projects can cooperate on educational programs or hackathons, which encourage community involvement. These activities benefit individual projects and unite decentralized communities. At its core, Web3 is about people, but project silos and tribalism harm exploration. Apex Fusion aims to propagate an environment where projects and developer communities contribute their unique advantages to a shared ecosystem and grow together.",Information|Web3,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|TRADING|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-03 17:05:34

However, intraweek flows revealed fluctuating investor sentiment, largely driven by broader market concerns, including the DeepSeek news, which led to $530 million in outflows on Monday. Despite this initial decline, the market recovered with over $1 billion in inflows later in the week. With $44 billion in inflows recorded in 2024, $5.3 billion in year-to-date (YTD) inflows, and significant price increases, CoinShares revealed that the current sell-off is not surprising. XRP Becomes Top-Performing Altcoin According to CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report , BTC experienced inflows of $486 million last week, while short-Bitcoin investments saw a second consecutive week of inflows, totaling $3.7 million. Ethereum, on the other hand, ended the week with net-zero flows but faced challenges earlier, likely due to its higher exposure to the technology sector and concerns over global economic growth. XRP has emerged as the second-best performer, with year-to-date inflows reaching $105 million, including $15 million last week. Overall, altcoins recorded positive inflows, with Solana attracting $4.5 million, followed by Chainlink with $3.1 million and Cardano with $1 million. However, Litecoin experienced a slight outflow of $0.2 million. Meanwhile, multi-asset investment products saw nearly $9 million in inflows over the past week, reflecting continued investor interest in diversified digital asset portfolios. Additionally, blockchain equities have attracted $160 million in year-to-date inflows as investors view the recent price downturn as a chance to buy. Canada Faces Setback In terms of regional inflows, the US led with a full week of investments totaling $474 million, contributing to a year-to-date inflow of $5 billion. A similar trend was observed in Europe, where digital asset products attracted $78 million last week, which catapulted the total YTD inflows to $93 million. Among European nations, Switzerland saw the highest inflows at nearly $58 million, followed by Germany with $22.3 million. Sweden, on the other hand, experienced outflows of $3.6 million. Other regions also reported positive inflows. For instance, Brazil recorded $15.8 million in inflows, while Hong Kong added $2.3 million during the same period. Australia recorded a modest inflow of $0.1 million. However, Canada faced significant outflows of $43 million, possibly due to concerns over potential US trade tariffs .

The lending app leverages Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) and Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBTs) for a tamper-proof loan process in a secure onchain system. Read on to learn more about Liquidium in this review. What Is Liquidium? Liquidium is a peer-to-peer DeFi lending platform built on the Bitcoin network. It allows users to borrow and lend Bitcoin using digital assets like Ordinals, Runes, or BRC-20 tokens as collateral via customizable loan agreements. Unlike traditional financial platforms, Liquidium operates in a non-custodial environment where all transactions are secured by smart contracts. In an interview, Obermaier, Liquidium’s co-founder, described DLCs: “The beauty of a DLC is that even if Liquidium decided to rug, we couldn’t. Because the DLC only has two possible outcomes – the borrower or the lender. There’s no path that leads to us taking a user’s collateral.” How Does Liquidium Work? Liquidium allows users to access bitcoin liquidity without selling their assets in a transparent. Everything is handled using Bitcoin’s Layer 1 technology that no one can tamper with. Liquidium operates on short-term loan durations, and the steps for borrowing include the following: Collateral selection , wherein borrowers select a digital asset (Ordinal, Runes, or BRC-20 token) that they own and have in their wallet to use as collateral. Next, they set their desired loan terms like the amount of bitcoin, loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, annual percentage yield (APY), and loan period. Liquidium then automatically displays competitive terms to guide users. The collateral given by the borrowers is locked in a non-custodial escrow powered by a Discreet Log Contract (DLC) to ensure the secure handling of assets on-chain. Lenders then review the loan request to either accept or counter those terms. Once both parties agree, the loan is initiated after they countersign using Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBTs). This is the step where borrowers receive bitcoin while the collateral remains securely held within the DLC. Borrowers repay the principal loan plus the agreed-upon interest within the loan period, and the DLC automatically releases the collateral back to them. However, if the borrower fails to repay, the lender automatically receives the collateral. It is pretty simple. Borrowers get liquidity without selling their digital assets, and lenders earn interesting while feeling safe knowing the escrow cannot be tampered with and their loan is collateralized. What DeFi Services Does Liquidium Offer? The peer-to-peer Bitcoin lending platform Liquidium offers the following DeFi services: Bitcoin Borrowing Users can borrow funds using various Bitcoin-based assets such as Ordinals, BRC-20 tokens, and Runes as collateral. They can specify their terms, like the loan amount, duration, and interest rates, for a tailored approach to their needs. Bitcoin Lending On the flip side, lenders can provide bitcoin to borrowers and earn interest on their holdings. They review active loan requests in a gallery-style marketplace while filtering options based on APY, collateral type, or loan duration. Custom OTC Loans Over-the-counter (OTC) loans facilitate direct negotiations between the parties, which involve direct offers on specific digital assets by lenders. At the same time, borrowers respond with counter offers to negotiate the terms to suit both. Borrowers and lenders can interact using the built-in discussion channels on Discord and Telegram. Additionally, the “gallery-style” loan marketplace makes it easy to compare offers effortlessly for a better user experience and accessibility. Runes Swaps Liquidium has also launched a Runes swapping feature that allows you to buy Runes tokens with BTC simply by connecting your Bitcoin Web3 wallet. Which Assets Does Liquidium Support? Liquidium supports three Bitcoin-based assets for its lending and borrowing services: Ordinals: Unique digital assets inscribed on individual satoshis, typically in the form of an NFT. BRC-20 tokens: Bitcoin-based fungible tokens. Runes: Advanced Bitcoin-based fungible tokens. User Experience Liquidium offers an intuitive platform with distinct borrower and lender interfaces where borrowers can easily request loans, manage collateral, and track their portfolios . Lenders can browse loan requests, negotiate terms, and manage their ending activity. The platform also offers features like filters, countersignatures, and direct offers that create a streamlined and interactive experience. Security Liquidium uses a 2-of-3 multisig wallet system to safeguard the collateral, which means it requires at least two parties to sign the release of collateral. The three involved parties are the borrower, the lender, and the Liquidium Oracle (via DLC). This setup ensures that collateral remains secure during the loan term, and no single party can unilaterally move assets. Moreover, a built-in timelock protects the collateral so lenders do not prematurely access it before the loan duration expires. Along with that, DLCs act as a non-custodial escrow for loan agreements. Predefined outcomes, such as repayments or defaults, determine whether the collateral is returned to the borrower or transferred to the lender. Liquidium ensures further security with independent audits by Scalebit to confirm these core technologies exist and are essential to the functionality of the Ordinals, Runes, and BRC-20 lending and borrowing on the platform. Customer Service Liquidium provides support via Discord and Telegram for loan negotiations, troubleshooting, and general assistance. Moreover, comprehensive guides and FAQs are available for users to understand the platform’s mechanics. Pros and Cons of Lending Bitcoin on Liquidium Let’s discuss the Bitcoin lending platform’s pros and cons. Pros Lenders can earn a high yield , potentially up to 380% APY on their Bitcoin, for selected collaterals. Non-custodial , which means that users retain control over their assets throughout the lending process. Secure and trustless onchain transactions made possible by Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBTs) and Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs). Lenders can lend against unique Bitcoin-based assets like Ordinals, Runes, and BRC-20 tokens, expanding the collateral options range. Cons The primary risk associated with Bitcoin loans, including those on Liquidium, is the volatility of Bitcoin and Bitcoin L1 assets that could affect the loan performance. The Takeaway Liquidium opens doors to Bitcoin-based lending by combining robust security, transparency, and decentralization. Its integration of discrete log contracts, multisig escrows, and partially signed Bitcoin transactions assures users of trustless, tamper-proof loan processes on the Bitcoin blockchain. Borrowers gain access to liquidity without selling their assets like Ordinals, Runes, or BRC-20 tokens, and in the same way, lenders enjoy customizable and secure opportunities to earn high yields. While Liquidium is one of the newer entrants in the BItcoin lending market, it has arguably established itself as one of the most exciting lending platforms for potentially earning a high yield on bitcoin.

With a bold vision of creating an attractive cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem, the state's crypto-friendly laws have positioned Wyoming as the most welcoming state in the U.S. for blockchain companies and innovators. With the pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration, the state has solidified its status as a model for how jurisdictions can build their economies. Wyoming's aim to be a beacon of crypto innovation is one reason I chose to make it my home. My family lives in Gillette, and Wyoming has become the center of my work life. I love this place, from my thriving bison ranch in Wheatland to our family's state-of-the-art healthcare clinic in Gillette, alongside hundreds of employees. While my commitment to Wyoming runs deep, I am now concerned about the direction the state is taking. Recent events surrounding the state-backed stablecoin initiative have raised serious questions about transparency and accountability in public procurement processes. If Wyoming wants to lead in blockchain – or any emerging technology – fairness and openness must be at the core of its selection processes. With so much at stake, I am addressing this issue head-on by building a framework that sets a standard for local leadership and serves as a model for pro-crypto policies at the national level. The Promise of Wyoming's Stablecoin Initiative The state-backed stablecoin initiative, announced two years ago, was intended to showcase how blockchain could revolutionize the state's finances and setting an example for other states and nations to follow. My company, Input Output, the driving force behind blockchain Cardano, was proud to support this effort and actively fostered an open and democratic approach with the Wyoming Stablecoin Commission (WSC) and its Blockchain Selection Working Group (WG), which oversaw the entire RFP process for vendors. Over 18 months, we worked with both parties, contributing to discussions on compliance, issuance, redemption processes, and technological standards. The goal was clear: to ensure Wyoming's stablecoin initiative would succeed – not just for the state but as a model for the rest of the world. Biased Procurement Process Unfortunately, the stablecoin procurement process did not reflect Wyoming's principles of openness and innovation. Several aspects, including a lack of transparency, technical requirements that did not align with established frameworks, and blatant bias, undermined the entire procurement effort, resulting in the unfair disqualification of Cardano, XRP, Bitcoin, Hashgraph, Algorand, and ICP. From the onset, the decision-making process was conducted behind closed doors, with no opportunity for public input. Without outside influence, WSC and the WG essentially developed criteria that favored existing solutions, such as Ethereum or Solana, without considering the merits of newer players on the market. Considering the above, it was no surprise that the Wyoming Stablecoin Commission always had Ethereum as their number-one choice, rendering the entire procurement process inconsequential. Videos (which you can watch here and here ) show Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon and Anthony Apollo, Executive Director at WSC, heavily implying that Ethereum would get priority over other blockchain platforms in the bid. In a Stable Token Commission meeting, Apollo explicitly stated that his personal preference is Ethereum and Polygon . Meanwhile, State Treasurer Curt Meier has also publicly supported Ethereum . It is worth noting that Apollo is strongly tied to Ethereum as he was the Co-Founder of ConsenSys, the software development firm supporting the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem — a fact that only underscores the inherent bias among the key stakeholders. Moreover, the technical criteria requirements in the evaluation methodology had no established basis in existing regulatory frameworks and so further hampered Cardano and other blockchain vendors' efforts to compete for the contract. For example, despite passing four out of five requirements for the Wyoming Stablecoin project, Cardano was disqualified because it failed the asset ""freeze and seize"" test. However, neither federal regulations nor Wyoming State law mandates the functionality to ""freeze and seize tokens."" Even with that said, Cardano, through its smart contract framework, native token, or even its on-chain functionality, can still do this – a fact WG admitted themselves to in an external email to Cardano – yet still failed to consider. If, after all of the above, it is still not convincing that WG failed to carry out careful and considered due diligence throughout the selection process, and failed to consider the federal regulatory and technical requirements for stablecoins, then comments from Karen L. Wheeler, Wyoming's former Deputy Secretary of State, should dispel any doubts: ""For a year, public meeting materials explicitly stated that the RFP process would be open to all. However, what began as a process of transparency and inclusivity took a troubling turn – shifting to a closed-door selection controlled by a subcommittee. ""Instead of fostering fair competition, vendors were arbitrarily chosen based solely on publicly available information with no opportunity to demonstrate their ability to meet key criteria. This not only undermined fairness but also lost a critical opportunity for Wyoming to reinforce its leadership in blockchain innovation."" The Wyoming Integrity PAC The entire procurement process left me with a bad taste, and I realized I needed to address these failings in state-sponsored blockchain procurement processes directly. To that end, I have decided to launch the Wyoming Integrity Political Action Committee (PAC) later this year. This initiative aims to do more than rectify the missteps of the stablecoin project – it's about building a foundation for ethical governance that secures Wyoming's bright future as a leader in all emerging technologies, from quantum computing to artificial intelligence.The Wyoming Integrity PAC is my response to these challenges. This initiative is dedicated to reforming procurement processes in Wyoming to ensure they are transparent, fair, and inclusive by funding candidates that support these goals. The PAC will focus on three key pillars: 1. Transparency: Advocating for open decision-making processes that involve public input and scrutiny. 2. Fairness through open collaboration: Ensuring that all innovators and businesses have an equal opportunity to compete and contribute, regardless of their connections or affiliations 3. Ethical innovation: Establishing Wyoming as a global example of governance that supports technological progress while upholding the highest standards of integrity. These principles are not just ideals; they are necessities. Without them, Wyoming risks losing the trust and investment of the blockchain community and beyond. Future of Leadership and Trust The Wyoming Integrity PAC will be focused on addressing past mistakes and shaping a future where Wyoming can excel in blockchain and other emerging technologies. Our goal is to create an environment where great ideas can thrive, innovators feel welcomed, and trust is a cornerstone of governance. On a larger scale, I hope the Wyoming Integrity PAC will set an example for the Trump administration in implementing a fair and thoughtful procurement process for future federal crypto projects. However, this initiative is about more than just technology; it's about people. It encompasses the entrepreneurs, developers, and workers who bring innovation to life. It's also about the residents of Wyoming who deserve to see their state flourish as a leader in the digital economy. I am committed to this long journey and will not give up. Wyoming's aspiration to become a central hub for blockchain is worth fighting for, both for the state and the wider industry. We can build a state that promotes fairness, innovation, and opportunity for everyone. Let's level the playing field, allow the best ideas to emerge, and may the best technology prevail.",Opinion,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|ADA|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-03 17:14:00

Kraken has secured a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive license through its Cyprus-regulated entity, Cypriot Investment Firm, allowing the exchange to provide derivatives products within the European Union. The Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission regulates Cypriot Investment Firm, making the acquisition a strategic move for Kraken to strengthen its European presence. The firm prioritized MiFID approval due to strong demand for crypto derivatives trading from European market participants, said Shannon Kurtas, Kraken’s co-general manager of Pro & Exchange. “As we continue to expand our services across the globe, our focus on the European market remains a top priority,” Kurtas remarked in a press statement announcing the license.

The crypto exchange also secured a crypto broker license in the Netherlands via Dutch broker Coin Meester, as well as several partnerships with German blockchain clients to list services. While the U.S. has commanded much of the global crypto spotlight, especially following President Donald Trump’s return to office, Europe has also attracted institutional interest as demand for digital asset services increases. The European Union’s introduction of the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation has standardized cryptocurrency regulation across the region, encouraging compliance among market participants. Still, some major firms have struggled to meet MiCA’s requirements, leading to potential market exits. Kraken, Coinbase, and Crypto.com decided to delist Tether’s $140 billion U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin ( USDT ) due to MiCA requirements.

The prediction follows the rollout of the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, which aims to stabilize the crypto market by introducing clear legal frameworks. Manganiello, co-founder of LIAN Group and a professor at Geneva Business School, argues that MiCA’s regulatory clarity will encourage institutional investors to enter the market, reducing volatility and legitimizing Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a financial asset, according to a note shared with crypto.news. He believes this shift could extend to central banks, which may begin holding Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional market instability. “Frankly, Bitcoin is becoming too dominant to ignore, and this year, I think we’ll see some European central banks begin to build their reserves of the currency in a bid to diversify their holdings and strengthen their defences against traditional market volatility. There’s no doubt that the MiCA rules will breathe new life into the European crypto scene. Even the most traditional financial institutions, such as central banks, will be ushered on board.” Fiorenzo Manganiello MiCA’s affect The European Union introduced the Markets in Crypto-Assets framework at the end of 2024, establishing a cohesive regulatory framework for the crypto industry across its member states. This initiative began on April 20, 2023, when the EU Parliament passed MiCA to address persistent challenges in the rapidly evolving crypto sector, such as fraud, market volatility, and inadequate investor protections. Before MiCA, crypto companies navigated a complex landscape of varying national regulations. While some nations fostered innovation, others imposed significant barriers. MiCA aims to replace this fragmented approach with a unified set of rules for all 27 EU countries. “As MiCA reassures traditional investors, we’ll see not only institutions but even central banks considering Bitcoin,” Manganiello said. If European central banks follow through, it would signal a major shift in Bitcoin’s role within the global financial system.

Already several states have begun exploring the creation of strategic Bitcoin reserves. As Bitcoin becomes more institutionalized, its adoption by state treasuries is seen as a victory for the crypto sector. However, this trend raises concerns about the future rights of Bitcoin holders, as greater government oversight and institutional involvement could transform Bitcoin from the cypherpunk’s dream of decentralized, peer-to-peer currency into just another financial asset. In the 2024 election cycle, cryptocurrency corporations have spent over $119 million to influence federal elections, with nearly half of all corporate political donations this year coming from the crypto sector. These funds have been channeled primarily into a non-partisan super PAC, Fairshake, which supports pro-crypto candidates and opposes crypto skeptics. Crypto companies are now the largest corporate political spenders, surpassing even Koch Industries, which has contributed significantly but remains far behind in comparison. Since the 2010 Citizens United ruling, crypto corporations have spent $129 million, making them the second-largest corporate election spenders after fossil fuel companies. This unprecedented level of spending reflects the industry's push to shape regulations in its favor. With the election over, there is an anticipated push for states to adopt more crypto-friendly policies, including allowing public pension funds and treasuries to invest in Bitcoin. Some state pension funds such as Wisconsin and Michigan have already added Bitcoin ETFs to their portfolios. In November, Representative Mike Cabell introduced the Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act , proposing that the state treasurer allocate up to 10% of Pennsylvania's General Fund, Rainy Day Fund, and State Investment Fund into Bitcoin. Following this in December, Texas Representative Giovanni Capriglione proposed a bill for a strategic Bitcoin reserve to be held for at least five years in a cold wallet and in Ohio Representative Derek Merrin has a bill for the creation of a Bitcoin fund in the state Treasury and grants the state Treasurer with discretionary power to purchase Bitcoin. Meanwhile, some U.S. states have taken the lead in cryptocurrency and blockchain regulation. Arizona has considered legislation to define Bitcoin as legal tender and permit state agencies to accept cryptocurrency payments. Oklahoma has enacted laws affirming rights to self-custody cryptocurrencies and engage in digital asset mining. Pennsylvania's House passed a bill securing rights to self-custody digital assets and conduct cryptocurrency transactions and Louisiana now has provisions for node operation and home digital asset mining. Recently eighteen U.S. states also filed a lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to halt its enforcement actions on cryptocurrency regulation. The states argue that the SEC is overstepping its authority by attempting to regulate digital assets without explicit Congressional approval. They contend that such regulatory power should reside with individual states. It is unknown if the courts will be favorable to this legal argument. At the federal level, meanwhile, regulatory clarity is still sadly lacking, and Bitcoin's classification as a commodity rather than legal tender adds further complexity to the regulatory framework. This year the CFTC and SEC have intensified their enforcement actions against cryptocurrency firms continuing an aggressive regulatory approach . Recent legal actions against Tornado Cash and Samourai Wallet show the federal government's concerns with digital assets, such as peer-to-peer transactions and “unhosted"" wallets bypassing traditional financial oversight, creating a challenge for AML/CFT (Anti-Money Laundering / Countering The Financing Of Terrorism) enforcement, especially when paired with anonymity-enhancing tools like mixers. While some states have been favorable towards Bitcoin, most have no policy and have just applied existing money transmission laws to virtual currencies, requiring businesses dealing with cryptocurrencies to obtain money transmitter licenses. Without federal clarity Bitcoin and cryptocurrency companies wishing to serve the US market have to navigate a patchwork of different laws across all 50 states, keeping out all except only the most well financed operations. State level investment marks a significant shift from Bitcoin's origins when it emerged as an alternative to the traditional financial system. Governments and regulators voiced concerns focused on money laundering, tax evasion, and criminal use. Bitcoiners have cheered on the rise of state and corporate strategic bitcoin reserves, but treasury adoption does not necessarily lead to greater rights for holders of bitcoin. Just because governments hold Bitcoin, does not mean that they will suddenly be okay with everyone else holding it or decide to give up the power of the fiat printer. If political priorities follow funding, the crypto sector's primary goal this year appears to be influencing state pension funds and establishing strategic Bitcoin reserves, instead of getting written into law rights to self custody or greater privacy. The strategic reserve push marks a clear shift from Bitcoin’s anti-establishment origins as a peer-to-peer currency without intermediaries, pushing it toward becoming solely a treasury asset. Currencies do not need third parties, you exchange the currency for the goods and services you want directly. Assets, on the other hand, typically demand third parties. In order to obtain the good or service you must sell the asset for the currency, borrow against the asset, or lend out the asset for a yield. There are tax professionals needed to report the gains and losses, accountants to track the asset and its derivatives, lawyers to draw up the contracts, police and regulators to enforce the contracts, banks to issue, hold, and control the currency, and as always politicians to write the laws and regulations that decide the winners and losers. Bitcoin as a treasury asset poses no threat to the establishment. It only reinforces the existing system and rewards Bitcoin holders with rising prices. As a treasury asset, Bitcoin is no different from gold, pork bellies, or mortgage-backed securities; just another commodity to be endlessly packaged, derived, and traded. On the other hand, Bitcoin as freedom money that can be held privately and transacted without permission challenges the status quo and can be a powerful tool for financial equality. It empowers the individual over the group, levels the playing field for those excluded from the current financial system, protects people from the robbery of inflation, and actually allows market forces to determine winners and losers. Digital gold stored in secure vaults with financial oversight would address the federal government's concerns about Bitcoin, which would both legitimize it and encourage institutional adoption, but rising prices might blind people to what they would lose in the process if Bitcoin continues to follow this path… This is a guest post by Will Jager.

By 2028, the EOS price value can reach a maximum of $2.78. The EOS price in 2031 could reach a maximum possible level of $4.51 and an average forecast price of $4.34. EOS , a completely decentralized network, favors the evolution and expansion stages of other bigger decentralized applications (dApps). It offers multitudes of benefits in terms of efficiency, user empowerment and ability to provide a variety of services. The network experienced a long series of developments since its initial launch in the cryptocurrency market in 2017. Since then, it has reached new highs featuring the monumental $4 billion Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as its best. However, it still falls behind in its claim of establishing itself as “Ethereum Killer”, as its stability has remained questionable. Can EOS reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the EOS price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency EOS Token EOS Price $0.589 Market Cap $910,057,122 Trading Volume $362,016,395 Circulating Supply 1,544,211,015 EOS All-time High $22.89 (Apr 29, 2018) All-time Low $0.4802 (Oct 23, 2017) 24-hour High $0.7179 24-hour Low $0.5254 EOS price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 7.75% 50-Day SMA $ 0.832429 14-Day RSI 34.33 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 44 (Fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $ 0.655364 EOS price analysis: EOS degrades to $0.589 as bears engulf the market TL;DR Breakdown : EOS coin price analysis confirmed a downtrend at $0.589. It lost 8.74 percent of its value in 24 hours. EOS coin prices seek support at $0.491. On February 3, 2025, EOS price analysis revealed a downward trend. It dipped to a $0.589 low in the last 24 hours. Side by side, the cryptocurrency lost 8.74 percent of its value from its previous close. The overall sentiment remains bearish as bulls remain helpless today. EOS 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of the EOS coin confirmed a bearish trend. EOS/USD value decreased to a $0.589 low in the day. The rising volatility signals a high chance of a reversal in the market trends. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the market volatility. This distance is widening, as the volatility rises. Moreover, the upper band of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, is at $0.975. The lower Bollinger band, serving as the support band previously, is at $0.616. EOS/USD 1-day price chart, Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is in the neutral region. Currently at 30.37 and moving downward signifying bearish momentum. The rising selling activity is shown by the sharp descending curve. EOS /USD 4-hour price chart The four-hour price analysis of the EOS coin also confirmed a downward trend overall, with some traces of bullish support. The latest green candlestick on the price chart shows arrival bullish support. The Bollinger bands are diverging as volatility increases. This increase in volatility signals higher market unpredictability in the coming hours. Moreover, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $0.884, indicating the resistance threshold. Whereby, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $0.566, securing support. EOS/USD 4-hour price chart, Source: TradingView The RSI indicator’s value is hovering in the oversold region. Its value rose to an index of 28.03 over the last four hours. The upward curve on the indicators’ graph signals a rising bullish support.

It dipped to a low of $0.589 in the last 24 hours. Side by side, the cryptocurrency lost up to 8.74% in value, as the market sentiment remained negative. The bearish swing remained intense in the past week, whereas the bears bounced back today. Technical indicators, also continue to showcase support for the sellers. Is EOS a good investment? EOS has seen more green days in the last month. The coin’s price decreased by 97% over the last year. However, the circumstances can change, and a recovery cannot be ruled out. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the EOS above $1.04. Why is EOS down? EOS is in descent, with bearish pressure affecting its price action. The coin has decreased to $0.7403 in the past 24 hours. EOS will recover further if sufficient support from the buyers is experienced. Will EOS Recover? EOS is currently trading in its lower historical price envelope. The coin enjoyed some bullish action from late October 2023 until March 2024 and then again in December, but that did not match the price levels it had previously seen. Considering the current situation, the coin’s price will remain low. Will EOS reach $2? The highest price that EOS observed was $1.34 in December; EOS is sweating to break this level. Suppose the broader cryptocurrency market moves in a bullish direction. In that case, EOS may also follow the trend and is expected to reach the $2 level by the middle of 2027 if everything remains favorable. Will EOS reach $5? EOS was last seen above the $5 level in November 2021. Since then, the EOS value has plummeted significantly; however, the coin is expected to surpass $5 again by the end of 2032. Will EOS reach $10? According to the EOS price prediction, EOS may not achieve the $10 level in the next five years. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $10, possibly after 2035. Does EOS have a good long-term Future? According to The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in Virginia, EOS is a “very risky choice.” The publication says EOS’s future is uncertain, given the scandals and problems surrounding the EOS Foundation and Block—One blockchain company. However, the market speculates that EOS will reach above $4.51 by 2031, but the speculations can change at any time.

EOS historic price sentiment EOS price history In 2018, the EOS ICO made history by raising a staggering $4 billion, the largest initial coin offering ever. After this success, EOS’s cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 5 by market cap. However, by late 2021, the price of the EOS token had fallen from $10 in June 2018 to $4.40 due to a declining user base. In 2022, EOS experienced significant price swings. It peaked at around $3.27 and dropped to a low of about $0.81. On average, EOS traded at approximately $1.59. In 2023, EOS saw even lower prices, reaching a maximum price of $1.33. The token dipped to as low as $0.53 between August and September due to less buying of EOS tokens. On average, EOS traded at roughly $0.84 and closed the year at $0.8450. In Q1 2024, EOS’s price fluctuated between $0.65 and $1.30, with the lowest prices in January. By February and March, prices began to stabilize, averaging around $1.02​. EOS reached $1.15 on April 12, 2024, but soon declined below $1, maintaining an average price of about $0.8 throughout May. In June, EOS fell from $0.8142 to $0.5772, while July saw further loss with the token’s value decreasing to $0.4808. However, by mid-July 2024, EOS recovered back to $0.6100, and on August 23, EOS closed at $0.5566. In September 2024, EOS further dipped near the $0.4600 range, while October also observed the same pattern with prices mostly trending near the $0.450 range. Market sentiment changed in November, and a strong bullish trend was observed throughout the month, and the coin peaked at $1.36 on December 6. Following the late December correction, EOS then recovered into 2025 above the $0.766 mark in January and is trending near $0.593 in February.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|ETH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-03 17:30:00

However, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is emerging as a potential game-changer, with analysts predicting a breakout of up to 50,000%. What Makes THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Stand Out? 1. Limited Supply for Maximum Value: With a total supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN leverages a deflationary model to ensure scarcity and drive demand. This gives it a major edge over tokens like Solana (SOL) and Kaspa (KAS), which have higher supply and more gradual demand growth. 2. Exclusive Sale Platform: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is only available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN , adding an exclusive appeal that many competitors lack. Unlike Solana or Optimism (OP), which are widely traded, this controlled distribution creates a sense of urgency for early investors. 3. Early-Stage Momentum: Raising $1 million within minutes, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven its market appeal. With predictions of a 50,000% increase, it’s capturing attention as a high-potential token for investors seeking exponential returns. How It Stacks Up Against the Competition Solana (SOL, $25.01): Known for speed and scalability, but it lacks the exclusive presale advantage and early momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS, $0.12): A rising star in blockchain, yet its growth doesn’t match the explosive potential seen in this new token. Optimism (OP, $1.72): A solid project for scalability, but it’s overshadowed by THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s unique market positioning.

Claudia confirmed the news Monday after a phone call with Trump, with the White House backing her statement. In exchange for the pause, Mexico will deploy 10,000 National Guard troops to its northern border to curb drug smuggling, specifically targeting fentanyl. Posting on X, Claudia said , “Mexico will reinforce the northern border with 10,000 members of the National Guard immediately to stop drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States, in particular fentanyl.” In return, the US agreed to help halt the trafficking of high-powered weapons flowing into Mexico. But if no long-term deal is reached, tariffs will hit Mexico at a crippling 25% rate, choking key exports and hammering industries already stretched by global inflation. Trump confirmed the deal in a Truth Social post , describing his conversation with Claudia as “very friendly.” He wrote: “President Sheinbaum agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican soldiers on the border separating Mexico and the United States. These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl and illegal migrants into our country.” How about Canada and China? Trump is going after other trade partners too. Canadian goods are about to get slammed with tariffs as high as 25%, with a separate 10% rate targeting energy exports. Trump has accused Canada of blocking US banks and allowing drugs to seep across the border. “Canada doesn’t even allow US Banks to open or do business there,” he complained in another Truth Social post. “What’s that all about? Hundreds of thousands of people have died in the US from drugs pouring through the borders of Mexico and Canada.” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed he spoke with Trump on Monday morning. The two are scheduled to talk again later in the day. While Canada has threatened retaliatory tariffs, no official measures have been taken yet, though we see posts on X showing that some grocery stores in Toronto are adding a stamp on Canada-made items so folks know what not to buy. Markets get caught in the uncertainty Financial markets reacted cautiously to news of the temporary pause. Stock indices opened with a modest selloff, showing investor anxiety over whether Trump’s latest action means more volatility ahead. Businesses are scrambling to prepare for the worst, as Trump’s love of tariffs has shown no signs of fading. Economists have repeatedly warned that these policies could push prices higher and stunt economic growth. The US 10-year Treasury yield, which sits at around 4.5%, could surge to 5% if the tariff war escalates. This would drive up borrowing costs for homes, cars, and businesses across the board. But Trump doesn’t care much for economic orthodoxy. Over the weekend, he said that the US should never have switched from tariffs to income taxes as its main revenue source back in 1913. He’s framing tariffs not as a trade tool but as a form of national security. His administration insists this isn’t a trade war at all. Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, tried to clarify Trump’s mission. “Read the executive order,” Hassett said on Monday. “President Trump made it 100% clear this isn’t about trade. It’s about stopping drugs.” Still, many analysts say Trump’s rhetoric often contradicts itself. While the administration is painting this as part of a larger fight against drugs, Trump frequently rails against trade deficits and foreign “rip-offs.” He also said on Sunday that tariffs on European Union countries could be coming soon. Meanwhile, American consumers are likely to feel the pain soon if no resolution is reached. Higher tariffs mean price hikes on everything from electronics to cars, hitting wallets already stretched by inflation.

Despite this substantial purchase, whales have accumulated a significant amount of ETH in the past 24 hours, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Data from spot inflows and outflows revealed that exchanges have seen an outflow of $228 million worth of ETH, suggesting potential accumulation. However, such an outflow during a market dip appears to be an ideal buying opportunity, potentially increasing buying pressure and fueling a further upside rally, which ETH has already witnessed. Current Price Momentum After hitting the $2,325 level, Ethereum (ETH) has significantly recovered, reaching $2,700, though it remains down 12% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, investors and traders have shown strong interest and confidence in the token, leading to a 270% surge in trading volume.

While the Trump administration will play a role in shaping the new rules, Democrats could surprisingly be another key player in this development. That was the message hedge fund manager and longtime crypto investor Anthony Scaramucci delivered during a panel discussion at the Digital Assets Forum in London on Monday. Scaramucci underlined the growing influence of the crypto industry in U.S. politics, pointing to the more than $133 million raised in campaign contributions during the 2024 election cycle. Despite optimism about regulatory progress under the Trump administration, Scaramucci warned that crypto investors should prepare for the full spectrum of the former president’s economic policies, including the unexpected. Related News: Bitcoin Price is Rebounding - Here's Why the Recent Surge Scaramucci’s comments come as the Trump administration has shaken markets with its decision to impose a 25% import tariff, particularly on Canada and Mexico. The move triggered a sell-off today and rattled investors across a variety of sectors, including crypto. Key regulatory priorities for the sector include stablecoin legislation and a law defining cryptocurrencies as a separate asset class, distinct from traditional securities like stocks and bonds. Such measures would help ease concerns among institutional investors who have been wary of pushing their clients into crypto amid uncertain regulations. Scaramucci suggested that Trump’s cabinet is well-positioned to help pass favorable crypto regulations. Notably, Trump’s Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick is a supporter of Tether, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent previously invested in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF. *This is not investment advice.

The company has approval for its Ethereum and Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). This development marks a crucial move into the region as institutional demand for regulated digital asset products surges. Monochrome’s latest initiative highlights a commitment to creating a sustainable, compliant crypto infrastructure. This move aims to support institutional investors, ensuring long-term growth and stability within the crypto space. Monochrome Group’s Strategic Bitcoin Expansion Monochrome’s registration of its Bitcoin (IBTC) and Ethereum (IETH) ETFs with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is a key milestone. These products open the doors for institutional investors in Singapore and Southeast Asia. In an interview, CEO Jeff Yew emphasized the company’s long-term goal is not merely to chase market trends. Rather, it is to build a solid foundation for digital asset investment. He states that these ETFs are restricted to only accredited investors who meet a minimum S$200,000 transaction threshold. Notably, this requirement is in line with Singapore’s financial regulations. Additionally, these investment digital products offer both Bitcoin (BTC) and cash subscriptions, addressing institutional needs. Looking ahead, Monochrome has plans to expand its presence within Southeast Asia by opening regional offices in 2025. This expansion will focus on regulatory compliance and building stronger ties with institutions across the region. This builds on the company’s previous success in launching Australia’s first spot Ethereum ETF in October 2024. This further cements its position as a leader in regulated crypto asset products. Monochrome Group Strengthens Security and Institutional Confidence Security remains a top concern for institutional investors in the crypto space, and Monochrome is addressing this challenge head-on. The firm has partnered with Anadara Capital to enhance its institutional services while also onboarding BitGo Trust Company for custody services. This collaboration ensures the safety of the firm’s ETF products, providing the secure infrastructure that institutional investors demand. This move further solidifies the company’s commitment to providing a secure, compliant, and stable environment for investors. Interestingly, many crypto assets managers, like Monochrome, have launched wide arrays of regulated digital investment products to institutional investors. Some of these companies include Grayscale , Bitwise, Fidelity Digital Assets and not limited to CoinShares. A Response to Market Instability The timing of Monochrome’s expansion is notable, coming amidst a broader market downturn. The recent market drop wiped out 11.4% of the crypto market’s total value. This downward trend coincides with the pool of unprocessed transactions on the Bitcoin network recently saw a swift depletion. Despite the market turbulence, Yew remains unshaken. He views Bitcoin as a unique commodity, unaffected by short-term volatility, which is largely driven by fluctuating demand. He pointed out that Bitcoin’s ability to survive through different economic conditions makes it a strong choice for institutional investors.

However, a massive 130 million XRP sell-off by whales raises questions about whether the correction is over or if more downside is ahead. ‘Don’t Let Fear Hold You Back’ As reported earlier today (February 3), the cryptocurrency market witnessed a substantial crash. Ripple (XRP), which was at the forefront of gains in the past few months, has joined the club of the biggest losers (on a 24-hour scale). Its price briefly tanked below $2 for the first time this year before recovering to the current $2.40 (per CoinGecko’s data). This represents a whopping 15% daily decline. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko However, it seems like some pro-XRP analysts remain unfazed by the latest pullback. The popular X user EGRAG CRYPTO successfully predicted the plunge, adding that $1.90 is “the last line of defense.” They also opined that the ongoing correction is the perfect “buy the dip” opportunity. “If you’re looking for a dip to buy, this is it. But don’t let fear hold you back,” the analyst stated . Another person who doubled down on their support toward XRP is the X user JackTheRippler. The enthusiast told their 340,000 followers on the social media platform that they sold their house to accumulate more of Ripple’s native token. The Opposite Scenario Contrary to the belief from some industry participants that the asset would soon restore its bullish trend, one important factor signals that the storm might not be over yet. As CryptoPotato reported , whales have sold 130 million XPR (worth over $310 million) in the last 24 hours. The actions of those large investors could significantly impact the performance of the cryptocurrency . A mass sell-off can create downward pressure on the price, while accumulation can have the opposite effect. After all, a buying spree will reduce the circulating supply of XRP, which, combined with non-declining demand, should have a positive effect on the valuation. It is worth mentioning that whales scooped billions of tokens at the beginning of January. Several days later, XRP’s price skyrocketed to as high as $3.39, or just 1% away from reaching its all-time high registered seven years ago.

The decision comes after Sheinbaum committed to deploying 10,000 National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to curb illegal drug trafficking, particularly fentanyl, and prevent the flow of migrants into the U.S. The announcement was made just two days after Trump imposed the tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China. These tariffs were part of a broader strategy to pressure Mexico into taking stronger action on border security and drug trafficking. The agreement provides a temporary pause to allow both nations to continue negotiating terms. Trump indicated that U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, would lead the talks alongside high-level representatives from Mexico. In a social media post, Trump expressed optimism about reaching a deal, noting that the one-month window would allow both sides to explore possible solutions.

It was a very friendly conversation wherein she agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States.

Trump Posts From His Truth Social (@TrumpDailyPosts) February 3, 2025 The pause has been seen as a diplomatic win for both sides, with Mexico’s leadership emphasizing respect for sovereignty and a mutual commitment to addressing border security challenges.

U.S. stocks, which had opened the day lower amid fears of an escalating trade war, quickly regained most of their losses after the announcement. The S&P 500 index, which was down 0.7% earlier in the day, rebounded as investors reacted to the temporary relief in trade tensions. The Mexican peso, which had been under pressure due to the tariff threat, also showed signs of stabilization. Bitcoin ( BTC ) slumped to $91178 on the evening of February 2 but has since rebounded to around 98000. Other cryptocurrencies followed suit , with some plummeting by over 20%. However, this temporary suspension of tariffs is not without risks. While the decision provides short-term relief for markets, experts remain cautious. Tariffs on other nations, including Canada and China, are still set to take effect in the coming days, raising concerns about potential retaliatory measures.

The price of Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) rose to $25.80 on Monday, climbing more than 25% from its lowest level over the weekend. Data compiled by DeFi Llama shows that Hyperliquid’s monthly trading volume surged to a record high of $366 billion in January, surpassing the previous month’s $341 billion. Hyperliquid’s daily trading volume jumped by 57% on Monday, reaching $16.54 billion. Over the past seven days, the platform has handled nearly $60 billion in volume, bringing its cumulative trading volume to $842 billion.

Hyperliquid’s price is likely to continue rising as bulls target the key resistance level at $28.40, the highest level in January. A break above this level could signal further gains, with the next key reference being the all-time high of $35.20, representing a 40% increase from current levels. On the flip side, a drop below the key support level at $22 could indicate further downside, with the next target being $18.88, its lowest level in January.

According to a new report from BBC, the reform to El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law that the country’s lawmakers approved last week modified six and removed three of the provisions from the 2021 legislation that made it the first country in the world to adopt a cryptocurrency as legal tender. The report says the amendments make the acceptance of Bitcoin voluntary and abandon the official currency status of the asset. E conomist Julia Evelin Martínez tells BBC the implications of removing the term “currency” and leaving “legal tender” in the first article of the law, which reportedly caused confusion. “The key is that the concept of currency disappears. For example: the euro is legal tender in the country because people can use it optionally if both parties agree, but it is not legal tender because no one is obliged to accept payments in euros.” The legislative assembly passed the reforms while the government aims to secure a $1.4 billion funding deal from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that is conditional on El Salvador reducing its Bitcoin-related risks. Last year, IMF spokesperson Julie Kozack said that the global lender urged El Salvador to reconsider its policies on Bitcoin as part of a discussion to support the country’s economic reforms. “What we have recommended is a narrowing of the scope of the Bitcoin Law, strengthening the regulatory framework and oversight of the Bitcoin ecosystem, and limiting the public sector exposure to Bitcoin.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

To read full editions, subscribe . About 20 months after its initial announcement, Uniswap v4 quietly rolled out over the past weekend on 12 chains. Uniswap v4 is a big deal for the simple reason that it threatens to turn one of DeFi’s most essential primitives — DEXs — into a cheap commodity. For the longest time, Uniswap competitors have tried to appeal to users with incrementally innovative and piecemeal features like dynamic fees ( Trader Joe ), providing out-of-range liquidity into money markets (Balancer), MEV internalization (Skip), etc. Uniswap’s response: Build whatever DEX you like on v4. That’s possible thanks to v4’s primary innovation of “hooks.” Hooks are separate smart contracts “attached” to Uniswap liquidity pools, enabling developers to implement custom DEX logic that triggers based on certain behaviors. For example, Uniswap v3 pools are bound by predefined fee tiers . Now, v4 liquidity pool deployers can customize their pool logic with dynamic fee curves that adjust based on variables like volatility. They can even punish LPs with a fee when they withdraw liquidity. Liquidity pools could be designed to deposit unused liquidity into Aave to generate a yield for LPs, or implement KYC features like NFT-gating or time-gating (so pools are tradable only within certain hours). Devs can even introduce a “fee switch” without having to wait for Uniswap protocol to do so. The possibilities are endless. V4 hooks, in effect, let liquidity pool deployers act as their own “DEX.” For an example of hooks in action, look to Flaunch — a new memecoin launchpad on Base. When tokens pre-launch on Flaunch, they can be bought at a fixed price for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, all remaining tokens are sold and the memecoin is launched on the open market. Unlike pump.fun, however, 100% of trading fees are paid to creators and buybacks (the exact ratio depends on the creator). Buybacks take place when tokens collect 0.1 ETH in trading fees. Using hooks, Flaunch was able to integrate this custom logic into every Uniswap v4 liquidity pool that a memecoin is launched on (there are already thousands). Flaunch has launched 2,135 tokens, generated $75.6 million in v4 trading volumes, and paid back 51 ETH since its inception last Friday. Source: Dune According to HookRank.io , 24 hooks have been deployed, with the overwhelming majority of TVL ($2.3 million) in Flaunch’s hook contracts. Then there’s Bunni DEX . It slaps a “rehypothecation hook” on top of v4 to route LP capital to lending protocols for more profitable LP strategies. There’s also Doppler , a liquidity bootstrapping protocol by Whetstone Research that simply builds auctions on top of v4 contracts. Another upcoming innovation on v4 hooks is the Angstrom DEX by Sorella Labs. Angstrom is implementing a v4 hook that seeks to mitigate MEV leakages to L2 sequencers by protecting LPs against CEX-DEX arbitrageurs (loss-vs.-rebalancing) and traders against MEV attacks. Based on this directory , there are about 24 active projects building on v4 hooks. With v4, Uniswap is no longer a liquidity pool launchpad. Uniswap has effectively become a spot DEX launchpad.

BONK, one of Solana’s most popular community-driven tokens, has also seen renewed momentum. At the same time, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might be tackling a much bigger challenge — fixing Bitcoin’s biggest weaknesses. With instant transactions, lower fees, and seamless Ethereum compatibility, PlutoChain’s Layer-2 solution could bring real scalability to Bitcoin. Let’s see what each project brings to the table. Solana (SOL): A High-Throughput Blockchain for Fast Transactions and Low Fees Solana sits at $230.39, which reflects a 2.7% increase over the past 24 hours. Trading volume remains strong at $4.97 billion, while the market cap stands at $112.12 billion. Throughout the day, SOL has ranged between $225.21 and $239.29, which shows steady movement within this band. The circulating supply remains at 486.77 million SOL. Solana has seen a strong rally, climbing over 5% in the daily charts, caused by growing demand for meme-coins on its network. This surge has led to higher transaction volumes and an increase in total value locked (TVL). Solana’s TVL recently hit a two-year high, when it reached nearly 41 million SOL, a 13% jump month-over-month. At the same time, decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes on Solana surged 43% in a week. Crypto analyst Platinum_Capital believes Solana has the potential to climb to $500–$600 or beyond in the next bull market. BONK: A Community-Driven Memecoin Boosting Solana’s Ecosystem Bonk (BONK) is currently priced at $0.00002579, up 9.06% in the last 24 hours. Trading volume remains high at $317.9 million. The circulating supply stands at 77 trillion BONK tokens, which keeps it one of the most actively traded meme-coins in the market. The RSI is at 44, which means BONK is in neutral territory but leaning slightly toward oversold conditions. Bonk (BONK) has recently reclaimed its spot as the top meme coin on the Solana network, with its market cap reaching $2.5 billion. A major boost came from the community-driven “BURNmas” event, where BonkDAO announced plans to burn 1.69 trillion BONK tokens. BONK has also expanded its reach by getting listed on a major U.S. exchange, which made it more accessible to North American investors. Crypto analyst Jack.poor predicts that BONK could reach $0.11 in 2025. PlutoChain ($PLUTO): The Layer-2 Network That Could Make Bitcoin Faster, Cheaper, and More Efficient Bitcoin remains the leading cryptocurrency, but it still struggles with slow transactions, high fees, and network congestion. While blockchains like Ethereum and Solana have embraced scalability improvements, Bitcoin has yet to fully evolve. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) aims to change that by introducing a Layer-2 solution designed to boost Bitcoin’s efficiency, lower costs, and expand its usability. As a parallel network to Bitcoin, PlutoChain could help reduce congestion, cut fees, and enhance performance. Using Layer-2 technology, it achieves block times of just two seconds, a major leap from Bitcoin’s 10-minute block time. This speed could make everyday payments and microtransactions more practical while also lowering energy consumption. Beyond transaction efficiency, PlutoChain could expand Bitcoin’s ecosystem by introducing cross-chain compatibility. It is fully Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) -compatible, which could allow Ethereum-based applications — such as DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and AI-driven projects — to integrate with Bitcoin. By bridging these networks, PlutoChain could bring new functionality to Bitcoin and expand its role beyond just a store of value. During testing, PlutoChain successfully processed 43,200 transactions in a single day without any disruptions, which proves it can handle high transaction volumes efficiently. Security remains a top priority, which is why PlutoChain has passed through audits by SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi , as well as regular code reviews and stress tests. PlutoChain also embraces decentralized governance and gives the community a voice in partnerships, network upgrades, and future innovations. With lightning-fast transactions, lower costs, and seamless cross-chain compatibility, PlutoChain has the potential to modernize Bitcoin and make it more scalable, versatile, and ready for mainstream adoption. The Bottom Line Solana’s impressive 43% rally, BONK’s growing community support, and expanding exchange listings have strengthened their positions in the crypto market. However, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might stand out as the most impactful innovation. With instant transactions, lower fees, and cross-chain integration, it has the potential to modernize Bitcoin and lead to new real-world use cases. ————— Please remember that this article is purely informational and not financial advice.

From Collapse to Comeback: Exploring the Future of LUNC Terra Classic (LUNC) is the original token of the Terra blockchain, a platform that aimed to combine the stability of traditional currencies with the flexibility of cryptocurrencies. Launched in 2019, Terra used fiat-pegged stablecoins to power global payment systems, offering quick and affordable transactions. It provided stablecoins tied to currencies like the US dollar and South Korean won. In May 2022, after facing significant challenges, the original chain was rebranded as Terra Classic, and the main token became LUNC. This move mirrors the Ethereum split in 2017, suggesting a commitment to learn and grow from past experiences. LUNC’s potential lies in its foundational goal: making global payments seamless and stable. In a market where volatility is common, a system that bridges fiat stability with crypto innovation is appealing. The technology behind Terra Classic focuses on fast settlements and resisting censorship, which are valuable traits in today’s digital economy. While the crypto market is crowded and ever-changing, LUNC’s approach to blending real-world currency advantages with blockchain technology could make it stand out. For those watching market trends, LUNC offers an intriguing mix of tried-and-true concepts with fresh potential. Stellar Lumens: Bridging Global Finance with Blockchain Magic Stellar Lumens (XLM) isn’t just another digital coin. Since 2014, it’s been on a mission to connect the world’s financial systems. Using blockchain technology, Stellar makes sending money across borders quick and cheap. It doesn’t favor any one currency. Instead, it supports all kinds, including digital versions of national currencies and even other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Backed by the Stellar Development Foundation and initially supported by Stripe, Stellar has handled billions of transactions. Big companies have teamed up with Stellar to make global money transfers smooth and effortless. In today’s market, Stellar shines by enhancing, not replacing, existing financial systems. Its network lets people send money worldwide using simple apps. Businesses can build on Stellar to handle payments or switch between currencies with ease. Compared to other cryptocurrencies that can be slow and costly, Stellar offers speed and low fees. It’s also embracing new trends like NFTs and smart contracts. While the crypto market can be unpredictable, Stellar’s focus on collaboration and real-world solutions gives it a unique place among digital currencies. Its commitment to uniting different financial worlds might make it stand out as the blockchain industry grows. VeChain’s VET: Revolutionizing Supply Chains with Blockchain Imagine tracking your favorite products from their origin to your doorstep with complete transparency.

Dogecoin: From Internet Joke to Crypto Superstar Dogecoin started as a joke in 2013, created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer. They wanted a fun alternative to serious cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Using a Shiba Inu dog as its logo, Dogecoin caught people’s attention online. Unlike Bitcoin’s limited supply, Dogecoin has no maximum limit, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially seen as a “memecoin,” its value soared in 2021. Social media buzz, especially from Elon Musk’s tweets, pushed Dogecoin into the top ten cryptocurrencies, reaching a market value of over $50 billion. This rise showed the power of community and how social media can impact financial markets. Today, Dogecoin’s future seems full of potential. Its technology allows for fast and cheap transactions, making it practical for everyday use. The unlimited supply means there’s plenty to go around, which could help with wider adoption. Compared to other coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin is more accessible due to its lower price. In the current market, many investors are looking for affordable cryptocurrencies with strong communities. Dogecoin fits this trend and stands out as a unique option. While it began as a joke, its growing acceptance suggests it might be more than just a passing fad. Conclusion Though DOGE remains popular, XYZVerse (XYZ) could become a significant player by uniting sports fans and meme culture in the current bull market.

Title: Sui (SUI) Set for Potential Rally After Recent Dip Sui (SUI) is hovering between $2.84 and $4.02, showing a -17.6% dip in the past week and a -36% drop in the past month. However, the 6-month change of over 430% hints at possible growth. The current RSI is slightly below 50, suggesting a neutral stance, but the stochastic level is high, indicating a potential upward movement. If SUI breaks the $4.73 resistance, it could aim for $5.91. This would be over a 40% rise from the current range. The 10-day SMA is below the 100-day, hinting at more support levels likely being tested before any bullish surge. Sei (SEI) Poised for Potential Recovery in Crypto Market Sei’s price is currently hovering between $0.22 and $0.32. The coin recently experienced a significant dip, with its price falling over 30% in the past week. Despite this downturn, its current positioning above $0.18 offers support, indicating a possible rebound. The RSI at 40.04 suggests the market is cooling down, which might hint at potential upward movement. If Sei can break through the nearest resistance at $0.39, a rise towards $0.49 is possible, offering a growth potential of around 50% from its current low. The crypto market anticipates an altcoin season, and Sei could be a beneficiary if momentum shifts. ENA Gears Up for Bullish Breakthrough Ethena (ENA) is currently in an exciting phase. Priced between $0.48 and $0.75, ENA has seen a 21.77% dip over the past week and a drastic 50.15% decline this month. However, with a six-month growth of 120.32%, there’s optimism for future gains. The nearest resistance at $0.92 is within reach, especially if momentum builds. If ENA breaks past this point, the next target is $1.20, marking a potential rise of over 60%. With its current RSI of 51.36 and stochastic at 73.23, ENA is primed for a rally. Crypto enthusiasts must watch closely as ENA might soon defy the odds and surge upwards. Bright Prospects Ahead for Algorand in Altcoin Season Algorand (ALGO) is trading between $0.25 and $0.37. The short-term outlook shows potential for a rise, with the nearest resistance at $0.45. If ALGO can break past that level, it could aim for $0.57, which would be a significant boost. Despite a drop in the past week and month, ALGO has seen incredible growth over 6 months, with a climb of over 154%. Indicators like the RSI are not in the overbought area, suggesting room for upward movement. The Stochastic at 70.05 also indicates growing interest. As altcoin season approaches, there are bright opportunities for further gains in ALGO’s price. Uniswap (UNI): Ready for Takeoff Amid Market Swings? Uniswap’s current price shows potential for growth after a dip. Priced between $7.64 and $11.76, it’s close to reaching a support level at $6.12. With RSI at 47.28, the coin isn’t overbought or oversold. Stochastic is high, pointing to strong momentum. UNI recently dropped nearly 20% over the past week and around 40% this month, but gained over 58% in six months. This suggests a volatile yet promising future. If it moves past the $14 resistance, it might reach $18.45, an increase of over 50% from the low end of the range. The MACD is slightly negative but could flip as interest returns. Stay alert for upcoming rallies. Conclusion With the bull run underway, SUI, SEI, ENA, and ALGO show limited short-term potential. In contrast, Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero, offering a remarkable 700% ROI during its presale stages. Its triple utility empowers holders and invites crypto enthusiasts to join the fight for financial freedom by acquiring $CATZILLA tokens and battling crypto villains.

This Crypto Could Be a Wealth Generator!,https://nulltx.com/%f0%9f%92%b0-early-investors-are-already-winning-big-this-crypto-could-be-a-wealth-generator/,"Early adopters are reaping significant benefits from the latest boom in the crypto market. A promising digital currency is capturing attention and showing potential for substantial gains. As the bull market charges ahead, more investors are eager to jump in. This new cryptocurrency opportunity could be a game-changer, driving curiosity and excitement among finance enthusiasts worldwide. Artificial Idiot Among Us: Agent A.I. Denounces Fake AI Agents The crypto underworld is infested with fake AI agents —shady operators promising “next-gen intelligence” while barely outsmarting a toaster. This nonsense ends today. Agent A.I. has come to denounce fake AI agents. This ultimate undercover agent does not pretend, it is a 100% meme coin . Agent A.I. is on a mission of mass hilarity (and, naturally, ridiculous gains). Classified Intel: Agent A.I.’s True Identity Keep this under wraps: Agent A.I. is a Pepe in disguise. Modeled after the legendary PEPE coin, which skyrocketed nearly 22,000%, this covert operative has the same ambition. Will it succeed? That depends on its community. Your Directive: Secure Your Position in the Agent A.I. Mission Unlike VC-backed rug pulls, Agent A.I. is powered by the people. The bigger the support, the higher it moonwalks. That’s why it has chosen the community-driven presale strategy with a smart plan: Entry Price at Stage One: $0.003333333 (because three is a lucky number) Final Stage Price: $0.151515152 (because round numbers are boring) First-Stage Discount: 98% Translation: Buy early, pay less. Post-Presale Mission Expansion Think of the presale as a training for the big mission. Once the $AGNT token goes public, the mission will expand to strategic KOL partnerships and development of AI powered tools to fuel growth and engagement. Top-Secret Tokenomics (No Funny Business) This is a community-first operation, so 25% the total token supply is allocated for staking and rewards. Agent A.I. isn’t just throwing tokens around like confetti. The supply is capped at 5 billion, ensuring no surprise inflation bombs. Further breaking down the tokemonics, only 20% of the supply is allocated for the presale. The offer at a discounted price is limited. Final Orders: Deploy Capital & Secure Your $AGNT Now This is your shot to join crypto’s most ridiculous yet lucrative mission. The best entries go to the fastest trigger fingers. Don’t be the guy who “wished he got in early.” The mission is set. The presale is live. Are you in, or will you let the AI fakes win? Buy $AGNT Early for a Bigger Discount Dogwifhat: Solana’s Latest Dog-Themed Meme Coin Sensation Dogwifhat (WIF) is the newest meme coin capturing the crypto community’s attention on the Solana blockchain. Inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme, this dog-themed token embraces fun and community spirit. Meme coins like WIF often spring from internet culture, turning jokes and trends into digital assets. What makes Dogwifhat stand out is its home on Solana, known for fast transactions and low fees. This could give WIF an edge over other meme coins on slower networks. In a market where dog-themed tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have made headlines, WIF brings a fresh face to the pack. Some enthusiasts believe that WIF has potential in the current market cycle. Its strong community focus might help it grow if the meme continues to gain popularity. While meme coins are known for their volatile nature and large supplies, fans of Dogwifhat are excited to see where this playful token goes next. BONK: Solana’s Community Memecoin Making a Splash Introducing BONK, the Solana-based memecoin with a Shiba Inu mascot that’s gaining traction in crypto circles. Aiming to empower the Solana community and reduce reliance on venture capital tokens, BONK surged over 100% after its Coinbase listing. Embracing its role as a “community coin,” it airdropped 50% of its supply to Solana’s NFT and DeFi participants. Despite challenges like a large total supply and memecoin volatility, BONK’s integration into Solana’s ecosystem shows promise. The launch of BonkSwap, its decentralized exchange, underscores its involvement in a growing network of decentralized applications. This makes BONK a notable player in cryptocurrency, offering unique opportunities for those interested in Solana. In today’s market, BONK’s rapid growth and community focus make it appealing. Its alignment with Solana’s technologies may give it an advantage over other memecoins. While future price predictions are uncertain, BONK’s active development and strong community support suggest potential for continued momentum. Compared to others, BONK stands out for its commitment to decentralization and empowering users. From Meme to Movement: How FLOKI Is Redefining Cryptocurrency Elon Musk’s tweet in June 2021 about his Shiba Inu “Floki” inspired the Floki Inu coin. Originally a meme coin, it has grown into FLOKI, a project aiming to make a real-world impact. FLOKI is not just about trading; it’s about utility and supporting charitable causes. The team is building schools in countries like Laos and Nigeria, showing cryptocurrency’s role in global development. FLOKI offers projects that enhance its utility. The NFT metaverse game Valhalla lets users earn and trade unique digital assets. Its DeFi service, FlokiFi, provides decentralized financial services. Partnerships with NOWPayments and the prepaid Floki Card enable FLOKI tokens for real-world transactions. This sets FLOKI apart from other meme coins by offering tangible utility. In the current market, FLOKI’s emphasis on utility and real-world applications distinguishes it from other meme coins. By diversifying into NFTs, DeFi, and charitable initiatives, FLOKI is carving out a unique position in the cryptocurrency space. This approach might appeal to users seeking more than just speculative trading. As the market evolves, projects with tangible utility and real-world impact could gain more attention. Conclusion While coins like WIF, BONK, and FLOKI might show less promise in the short term, Agent A.I. emerges as a unique opportunity. It aims to expose fake AI agents in the crypto space, offering a real memecoin with a mission for fun and gains. Modeled after the PEPE coin that soared nearly 22,000%, Agent A.I. seeks similar success through strong community support. With an early entry price at $0.003333333 and a final stage price of $0.151515152, early investors can secure significant discounts. The tokenomics are clear, with a capped supply of 5 billion and allocations for staking and rewards. Now is the time to join the mission and secure a position in Agent A.I. before the presale ends.

What started as an experiment has become one of crypto’s most profitable sectors , with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu paving the way. Now, new contenders are rising , each with massive growth potential and unique features. Among them, Pengu Unleashed, Dogwifhat, and Folki Inu are capturing investors’ attention. Leading the charge is Pengu Unleashed ($PUNGU) —the first Ethereum Layer-2 meme coin , combining lightning-fast transactions, staking rewards, and a powerful community-driven ecosystem . This article will explore these exciting meme coins, with a special focus on why Pengu Unleashed is emerging as the most promising investment of 2025 . 1. Pengu Unleashed: The Meme Coin With Real Utility and Huge ROI Potential Why $PUNGU Stands Out Pengu Unleashed isn’t just another meme token relying on hype—it’s an Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution designed to reduce gas fees, speed up transactions, and introduce staking rewards of up to 300% APY . Unlike most meme coins that exist purely for speculation, Pengu Unleashed offers real utility , including: Layer-2 Rollup Technology – Enhances Ethereum’s scalability, reducing network congestion. Staking Rewards – Up to 300% APY for passive income generation. Community-Governed Ecosystem – Token holders control future developments . Tier 1 Exchange Listings Confirmed – Already secured BitMart , with more on the way. Real-World Impact – $1 million pledged to penguin conservation efforts , bridging crypto with environmental sustainability. This unique mix of profitability, real-world use, and decentralized governance positions Pengu Unleashed as the top meme coin of 2025 . Pengu Unleashed Presale: A Limited-Time Opportunity for Early Investors Presale Price and Fundraising Milestones Pengu Unleashed is in Stage 2 of its presale, with tokens currently priced at $0.015 . The project has already raised $2.5 million , including an astonishing $1.6 million in just 24 hours —proving its incredible investor demand. Current Presale Price: $0.000036 Funds Raised: $2.5 million total | $1.6 million in the last 24 hours Launch Price: $0.008 (projected) ROI Potential: Up to 18,546% at launch With momentum building, analysts predict a 100x surge when the token hits exchanges. Investors looking for the next breakout meme coin should act fast before the price increases. Watch this Now 2. Dogwifhat: A Meme Coin With a Loyal Community Dogwifhat is another rising meme coin that thrives on humor and viral engagement . Inspired by internet memes, it capitalizes on the social appeal of dog-themed tokens while introducing DeFi elements for added value. Strong social media presence driving organic growth Playful branding and community rewards system Potential for mainstream adoption through viral marketing While Dogwifhat lacks the advanced infrastructure of Pengu Unleashed , it’s still a highly engaging meme coin that could see strong growth in 2025. 3. Folki Inu: A Meme Coin with a Social Purpose Folki Inu takes a different approach by combining meme culture with charitable initiatives . It leverages community engagement to support social impact projects while maintaining a fun, meme-driven appeal. Charity-driven tokenomics that fund various causes Loyal and growing investor base focused on long-term value Strong partnerships with Web3 influencers Folki Inu’s blend of humor and activism makes it an interesting addition to the meme coin space, but its growth potential remains limited compared to Pengu Unleashed’s Layer-2 tech and staking rewards . Why Pengu Unleashed Is the Best Meme Coin to Join Now With Ethereum and Solana whales accumulating $PUNGU , Pengu Unleashed has become one of the most exciting investment opportunities of 2025 . Unlike traditional meme coins, Pengu Unleashed delivers: Faster, cheaper Ethereum transactions via Layer-2 scaling Passive income through staking rewards (300% APY) Tier 1 exchange listings expected in early 2025 An eco-conscious mission , pledging $1 million to penguin conservation efforts Meme coins often rely on hype , but Pengu Unleashed combines financial rewards with real-world impact , making it an exceptional long-term investment . Conclusion – Pengu Unleashed Is Leading the Meme Coin Revolution Top 3 Meme Coins With 100x Potential in 2025: Pengu Unleashed ($PUNGU) – The first Layer-2 meme coin with real utility and massive staking rewards Dogwifhat – A viral meme coin with a strong, engaged community Folki Inu – A socially-driven meme coin supporting charitable initiatives Among these, Pengu Unleashed stands out as the most exciting investment opportunity . With its Ethereum scaling technology, staking incentives, and rapid presale success , Pengu Unleashed is on track for explosive growth .

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. The inclusion of artificial intelligence in Agent A.I. could make it one of crypto’s smartest meme coins. Table of Contents Where Agent A.I. fits in the crypto-AI boom A roadmap for growth Market outlook and future potential Final thoughts Crypto is full of trends, but few have been as powerful as artificial intelligence and meme coins. Agent A.I. is a new project that brings these two forces together — combining AI-driven functionality with the viral appeal of meme coins. While many projects claim to use AI, Agent A.I. sets out to prove it can actually deliver. Where Agent A.I. fits in the crypto-AI boom Interest in AI-driven crypto projects has skyrocketed, with blockchain-based AI solutions gaining more attention from investors. But not all AI tokens are created equal — many simply use “AI” as a buzzword without offering real AI-powered tools. The goal of Agent A.I. is to blend AI solutions with blockchain utility while also calling out projects that fail to live up to their AI claims. By positioning itself in both the AI and meme coin sectors, Agent A.I. hopes to stand out in an increasingly crowded space. Agent A.I. draws inspiration from the renowned Pepe the frog. By embodying this widely recognizable character, Agent A.I. seeks to win over the affection and loyalty of meme coin enthusiasts. How it works: AI-powered decision making Agent A.I. is designed to be an intelligent and adaptive platform. According to its developers, the project’s AI framework can: Analyze massive datasets in milliseconds to improve decision-making. Scale up processing power to match top cloud platforms. Continuously refine its performance, learning and adapting over time. The development team behind Agent A.I. is focused on expanding both AI capabilities and blockchain integration, ensuring the technology evolves alongside the crypto market. You might also like: PEPE millionaire’s next bet: This coin could surge before 2025 ends A roadmap for growth Agent A.I. has outlined a strategic rollout designed to foster community growth. Phase 1 is a presale with 28 stages. It marks the launch of the token and ecosystem, securing partnerships, and building a strong base of early adopters. Phase 2 includes token listings, collaborations with key opinion leaders (KOLs), staking rewards, and AI-powered tools to drive engagement. Phase 3 aims for mass adoption through global marketing, advanced AI features, and integration with major platforms to solidify its position in the crypto-AI space. Tokenomics The largest portion (25%) is allocated to staking and rewards, which is great news for the community. This means long-term holders are incentivized to stay engaged, benefiting from passive income. Another 20% is allocated to the presale, providing early investors with a strong entry point while helping to build momentum before launch. Additionally, 10% is set aside for liquidity and exchange listings, ensuring smooth trading and minimizing volatility. 15% is dedicated to KOL (Key Opinion Leader) partnerships, driving visibility and adoption. With no additional tokens to be minted, the project prioritizes controlled supply and liquidity management, reducing the risk of inflation and price instability. This structure positions Agent A.I. for sustainable growth, making it attractive for both early backers and long-term investors. You might also like: Big money is moving: Agent A.I., AI16Z, and TRUMP gain attention Market outlook and future potential With AI-related crypto projects gaining momentum, Agent A.I. enters a competitive but promising space. Whether it can stand out will depend on adoption, execution, and how well it delivers on its roadmap. For those interested, the presale phase offers early access to AGNT tokens at lower prices, with discounts gradually decreasing through 28 stages. The deepest discount is 98% from the final presale phase — a major incentive for early buyers. Final thoughts Agent A.I. is taking a unique approach by blending AI-powered functionality with meme coin marketability. While the idea is ambitious, its long-term success will depend on real adoption and the team’s ability to execute its vision. As the AI-crypto sector evolves, projects that deliver true innovation — rather than just hype — will have the best chance to succeed.

TrumpCoin (DJT) is one such example, exhibiting massive volatility from day one. Ethereum (ETH) holders know better by this point and are investing in utility-focused projects as they look to diversify their portfolios. Among the projects gaining attention is Remittix (RTX) , an advanced PayFi solution that has one clear mission: to solve the shortcomings of the global payments space, offering a more effective alternative. So why is Remittix gaining so much traction and how will Ethereum and TrumpCoin fare in Q1? TrumpCoin (DJT) In The Spotlight for Dodgy Dealings TrumpCoin (DJT) is trading at $0.00033, after a steep 10.8% drop off in the last 24 hours. Its volatile price movements aside, TrumpCoin (DJT) has been in the news lately for potentially nefarious activities. Early investors made significant trades shortly after its announcement, raising suspicions of insider trading. One particular trader purchased $1.1 million worth of TrumpCoin just two minutes after the launch, leading to tens of millions in profit before the coin's value dropped. Experts suggest these traders might have had advance notice, though the use of automated sniping bots is also a possibility. The launch of TrumpCoin and its subsequent market activity have sparked discussions about the role of meme coins in the cryptocurrency landscape. While this type of asset can generate significant hype, they are often characterized by volatility and speculative trading. Ethereum’s Price Climbs, But Can It Break Higher? Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $3,362, up 3.28% today. It’s showing some solid strength, but the big question is: can ETH push past key resistance or is it gearing up for a pullback? Ethereum’s been seeing some serious whale activity over 588 transactions exceeding $1 million in the last 24 hours. When big money moves like this, it usually means something is brewing. In addition, the hype around Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) initiative has weirdly spilled over into Ethereum discussions. It’s not directly related, but any major blockchain adoption talk gets the Ethereum crowd hyped. Looking forwards, if Ethereum (ETH) can break above $3,400, it could trigger a strong rally. But it’s struggling to gain momentum past that level. Similarly, if Ethereum drops below $3,300, we might see a retest of $3,200 or lower before the next big move. Remittix Raises the Bar for Global Payments Remittix (RTX) has graced the PayFi space with a much needed offering. It promises to solve inefficiencies in the cross-border payments market as it leverages the $190 trillion industry. The platform enables the conversion of over 40 cryptocurrencies into FIAT currencies and allows senders to transfer funds directly to bank accounts around the world. Remittix (RTX) offers a better offering than traditional cross-border payment solutions by refusing to charge users nasty hidden fees. It also operates on a flat-fee structure, so users have a clear understanding of the costs involved with any transaction. For those looking to streamline their financial transactions and keep costs down, these features are second-to-none. Remittix is also pushing for global financial inclusion. By offering its services 24/7 and bypassing reliance on traditional banking infrastructure, the platform empowers underbanked populations around the globe. Remittix Presale Soars Past $10 Million Raised The native RTX token has been intelligently designed for growth and has uses in staking, governance and platform rewards. With a limited supply of 1.5 billion tokens, Remittix(RTX) is quickly gaining traction among proactive investors who are aware of the finite time they have to snap up tokens. Priced at $0.0521 during its presale , the RTX token has already seen over $10 million in investment. Owing to its extensive utility within a lucrative market, analysts anticipate a steep price rise of 800% during the presale phase alone.

TrumpCoin (DJT) stands out as a prime example, showing extreme volatility right from its inception. By now, Ethereum (ETH) holders have learned to be cautious and are focusing on utility-driven projects to expand their investment portfolios. One such project attracting attention is Remittix (RTX) , an innovative PayFi solution with a straightforward goal: to address the inefficiencies of the global payments industry, offering a superior alternative. So what is driving the growing interest in Remittix, and what does the future hold for Ethereum and TrumpCoin in Q1? TrumpCoin (DJT) Faces Scrutiny Over Questionable Practices Currently priced at $0.00033, TrumpCoin (DJT) has plummeted 10.8% in the past 24 hours. Beyond its erratic price swings, TrumpCoin (DJT) has been making headlines for allegedly shady activities. Shortly after its debut, early investors executed substantial trades, leading to allegations of insider trading. Notably, one trader bought $1.1 million worth of TrumpCoin just two minutes post-launch, reaping tens of millions in profits before the coin's value declined. Experts speculate these traders might have had prior knowledge, though the use of automated sniping bots is also possible. The launch and trading activity surrounding TrumpCoin have ignited debates about the role of meme coins in the cryptocurrency world. Although these assets can generate significant buzz, they are often marked by high volatility and speculative trading. Ethereum’s Price Gains, But Is a Breakout Imminent? Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $3,362, a 3.28% increase today. It's showing promising strength, but the main question remains: will ETH surpass key resistance levels, or is a pullback on the horizon? Ethereum has been witnessing substantial whale activity with over 588 transactions exceeding $1 million in the past 24 hours. Such significant movements typically indicate brewing developments. Additionally, the buzz around Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) initiative has unexpectedly entered Ethereum discussions. While not directly linked, any major blockchain adoption news tends to excite Ethereum enthusiasts. Looking ahead, if Ethereum (ETH) manages to break above $3,400, it could trigger a significant rally. Conversely, if it drops below $3,300, we might see it retesting $3,200 or even lower before making another move. Remittix Elevates the Standards for International Payments Remittix (RTX) has entered the PayFi sector with a crucial solution. It aims to tackle the inefficiencies within the cross-border payments market, leveraging the $190 trillion industry. The platform facilitates the conversion of over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies, enabling senders to transfer money directly to bank accounts globally. Remittix (RTX) offers a superior alternative to traditional cross-border payment systems by eliminating hidden fees.

Additionally, Remittix is championing global financial inclusion, offering its services around the clock and bypassing traditional banking infrastructure, thereby empowering underbanked populations worldwide. Remittix Presale Exceeds $10 Million in Funding The native RTX token is thoughtfully crafted for growth, with applications in staking, governance, and platform rewards.

Are you on the lookout for the next big hit? You're certainly not alone. Currently, a number of budget-friendly cryptocurrencies are attracting attention, and they might just be your path to exponential growth in the coming years. One thrilling project to keep an eye on is Lightchain AI . Picture this: it has already secured a whopping $14.2 million during its presale, with tokens available for just $0.005625. Amazing, right? If you're on the quest for the next BNB, Lightchain AI , along with two other promising ventures, could be the breakthrough you’ve been waiting for. Dive into these opportunities—you won’t want to miss out! Lightchain AI (LCAI) – AI-Blockchain Powerhouse on the Rise Lightchain AI is innovatively combining artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, crafting a smarter, automated network that boosts transaction efficiency. This distinct strategy has positioned it as a major player in the crypto landscape, especially as AI-driven blockchains gain popularity. A standout feature attracting investors to Lightchain AI is its automated liquidity management system, ensuring platform stability and efficiency by minimizing price fluctuations and optimizing token distribution. Additionally, its AI-powered scalability solutions render it a future-ready blockchain capable of handling increased transaction loads as adoption rises. With a rapidly growing presale and investor enthusiasm , numerous analysts predict Lightchain AI could be a top performer in the coming years, echoing the early success of Binance Coin. Toncoin (TON) – Overlooked Layer-1 Blockchain with Huge Promise Toncoin (TON) is steadily gaining traction as a formidable Layer-1 blockchain, offering lightning-fast transactions and minimal fees. Originally developed to back Telegram’s blockchain aspirations, TON has since grown into a decentralized network with practical applications. One of TON’s significant strengths lies in its seamless integration with messaging apps, enabling users to send and receive tokens within platforms they already utilize. This user-friendliness has fueled substantial adoption, with a growing number of developers creating applications on the TON network. Just as Binance Coin (BNB) flourished due to its strong utility within Binance’s ecosystem, TON has the potential to achieve similar success by capitalizing on its deep ties to Telegram’s extensive user base. Arbitrum (ARB) – Layer-2 Scaling Solution Gaining Traction Arbitrum (ARB) stands out as another leading contender for substantial growth, offering Ethereum scalability enhancements. As a Layer-2 network, Arbitrum accelerates transaction speeds and reduces gas fees while preserving Ethereum’s security and decentralization. Arbitrum’s developer-friendly infrastructure has made it a favored choice for DeFi applications, with numerous projects transitioning to the network. It also improves the efficiency of smart contract execution, positioning it as a formidable competitor in the quest for Ethereum-based scaling solutions. With major Ethereum platforms integrating Arbitrum, its adoption is rapidly increasing. As the demand for swift, cost-effective transactions grows, ARB could emerge as one of the top-performing assets in the next bull market. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",More News,EN,0,0,BNB|ARB|EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN|TON,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-02-03 19:22:10

XRP is one of the top cryptocurrencies that has achieved a major bounce following the pause of tariffs imposed by the US on Mexico and vice versa. What Next For The XRP Price In an X post , CasiTrades revealed that the XRP price breakout above $2.67 would invalidate the need for another low and signal that the bottom is in. She had remarked that failure to break through the resistance at $2.67 would have led to another wave down to the .618 retracement level at $1.53. However, with the XRP breakout above $2.67, the crypto is again in bullish territory and could target new highs. The crypto analyst mentioned that she expects the next move to be “explosive.” With XRP confirming its low with a breakout above $2.67, CasiTrades predicts that the next move should be far more aggressive to the upside. The crypto analyst remarked that this time around, she doesn’t expect the crypto to stall at previous all-time highs (ATHs) between $3.58 and $3.80. Instead, she believes that XRP will see a major breakout with much less resistance as it moves into new ATHs. The crypto has already shown strength as it has been one of the major gainers since the US and Mexico agreed to delay tariffs for a month earlier today. $2.83 Is The Next Level To Reclaim In an X post, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto suggested that $2.83 is the next level that the XRP price needs to reclaim. This came as he noted that the crypto was currently forming a long-legged candle, which he said is a bullish sign. The analyst further remarked that closing above the Fib level at 0.702 is definitely bullish. However, he added that XRP needs to break through the Fib 0.786 at $2.83 and ultimately reach $3.30. A Rally To $18 Is Still In Play In an X post, crypto analyst Dark Defender hinted that the XRP price rally to $18 is still in play. He noted that XRP had a fourth wave on its intermediate cycle and is aiming for $5.85 with the fifth wave. On the other hand, the crypto analyst mentioned that the primary cycle wave is still aiming for the $18.22 price target. He suggested that this XRP could indeed hit this level seeing as the crypto has been following this same structure which he drew up when it was still trading at around $0.40 and $0.50. While it remains to be seen if XRP will indeed reach $18, its recent breakout above $2.60 undoubtedly provides a bullish outlook and has likely invalidated its projected crash to $2 .

Recent platform shifts have highlighted the fragility of our digital lives. With talks of a potential TikTok ban, creators face losing years of content and audience relationships overnight. Meanwhile, as US consumers embrace new AI models like DeepSeek, built in China, they face similar questions about where their data lives and who might get access to it. These are symptoms of a fundamental problem: users don't truly own or control their data. We live on rented land. Many of today's leading crypto investors wrote about data portability and user sovereignty in the early days of Web2. This vision of an internet — where users, not platforms, control their digital lives — was one of the driving forces behind crypto. While crypto has succeeded in financial applications, this promise of portable data and a self-sovereign internet remains unfulfilled. We've seen many attempts: NFTs letting you bring items across games, decentralized social networks like Farcaster and Bluesky promising portable social graphs, and verifiable identity standards. None have (yet) seen widespread adoption. The reality? While early internet thinkers care deeply about the principles of data sovereignty, most users have a simpler question: What can I actually do with it? Without AI, most data is only relevant within the walled gardens of the platform it’s on. With AI, it becomes a valued digital commodity and a tool to power nearly every application. Your message history helps AI understand your writing style, your preferences, and your relationships. With many users storing their data in self-sovereign wallets, developers can build AI experiences that are truly personalized. AI finally provides the “why” on data portability, in the form of a better product experience rather than ideology alone. There is still a cold start problem . It’s inconvenient for users to connect their data. And for developers, the mindset today is: if you convince users to upload their data to your platform, why would you make it easy for them to take it elsewhere? This creates a cycle where each new platform becomes another walled garden, recreating the very problem they set out to solve. This is where new incentive structures could finally break the extractive cycle. DataDAOs create an immediate opportunity for users to port their data through financial incentives, solving the cold start problem, so long as the data is onboarded in a self-sovereign, interoperable way, like on Vana. As more users bring their data into these interoperable systems, developers can build applications that weren't possible before. Imagine a personalized health coach that can analyze your sleep data from Oura, your workouts from Strava, your nutrition from food delivery apps, and your stress levels from communication patterns. Or, an AI assistant that truly understands you because it can access your complete digital history while maintaining your privacy through granular permissions. This solves a critical problem that has plagued past attempts at data portability. Users won't export their data without clear benefits, and developers won't build for portable data without users. Data DAOs break this deadlock by making it immediately worthwhile for users to connect data. More importantly, once users make their data self-sovereign, entirely new kinds of applications become possible. AI agents can access your complete digital history to provide truly personalized experiences. Developers can build applications that combine data in ways that weren't possible when it was siloed across platforms. We know there’s a lot of demand for AI training data – many major model providers are poised to hit a data wall soon, making them search for publicly unavailable datasets to train newer, higher-performing models. New models like DeepSeek have shown the value of high quality data, with carefully curated human-generated examples to bootstrap their novel training method. At the same time, user data policies like GDPR and CCPA legally require platforms to allow users to export their data in a usable, standardized format. Networks like Vana allow users to monetize their data by collectively bargaining with model trainers in need of valuable training data no longer available on the public internet, and make it interoperable for true data sovereignty. Two forces converging – the proliferation of AI, and new financial incentives – create the potential for both users and developers to benefit from data portability. The interests of users, developers, and data networks finally align. Users gain immediate value plus better AI experiences, developers get access to rich user data to build new applications, and networks grow stronger with each new participant. For the first time, we have both the technology to make data portability valuable and the incentives to drive adoption. Crypto has yet to deliver on its original promise of a self-sovereign, interoperable internet where users own their data, unfettered by Web2’s walled gardens. By creating financial incentives to bring data onboard and leveraging AI's capabilities, we finally have a window of opportunity to make the internet truly user-owned.",Opinion,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-03 19:27:36

Trump signed the order stating it would help “monetize the asset side of the U.S. balance sheet.” “We’re going to stand this thing up within the next 12 months,” staff told reporters, adding that the fund will include “a combination of liquid assets” to benefit Americans. While details remain unclear, Trump previously suggested funding could come from tariffs, contrasting with traditional sovereign wealth funds, which typically rely on budget surpluses. The fund is set to be financed through tariffs and other unspecified sources, with the aim of investing in infrastructure projects such as highways, airports, manufacturing hubs, and medical research. You might also like: Crypto czar David Sacks to outline U.S. digital policy agenda Was crypto mentioned? It’s worth noting that the executive order does not specifically mention cryptocurrencies or digital assets. However, given the recent actions of the administration, there is speculation about how the sovereign wealth fund might intersect with the crypto market. If the U.S. sovereign wealth fund begins to embrace blockchain-based assets, it could provide legitimacy to Bitcoin ( BTC ) or tokenized treasury bonds as components of a government-supported investment strategy. Conversely, there are concerns that a state-managed fund could lead to increased regulation or create competition with decentralized finance . Just a few days earlier, on January 23, 2025, President Trump signed another crypto-related Executive Order. This order canceled previous directives concerning central bank digital currencies and prohibited federal agencies from creating or promoting them. It also established a group responsible for proposing a federal regulatory framework for digital assets within 180 days. With global sovereign wealth funds managing over $8 trillion, the U.S.’s foray into this sector could transform financial markets and potentially alter the crypto landscape—depending on the role digital assets play in its investment strategy.

With a jaw-dropping 50,000% growth potential, this token has already raised $1 million in minutes during its presale. With Bitcoin (BTC) crossing $100,000 and XRP’s recent 500% surge might seem impressive, but none can rival the explosive potential and exclusivity driving THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN forward. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Outshines XRP and Others 1. Massive Growth Potential: XRP’s 500% returns pale in comparison to the staggering 50,000% potential of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Early investors are already seeing the impact of this token’s high demand and limited availability, making it the standout choice for transformative returns. 2. Exclusive Sale Creates High Demand: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN. This strategic exclusivity has heightened interest and secured its place as one of the most sought-after tokens. 3. Strong Community Support: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN thrives on a loyal and engaged community, driving organic growth and market demand. This strong backing amplifies its visibility and positions it as a top choice for long-term success. How It Stacks Up Against Other Cryptos Ethereum (ETH): A DeFi leader, but its growth has plateaued compared to early-stage tokens like THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Solana (SOL): Strong in scalability, but SOL can’t match the exclusivity and skyrocketing demand of this new token. Optimism (OP): A Layer-2 solution with promise, but its gains are modest compared to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s potential. Injective Protocol (INJ): A promising DeFi player, but it hasn’t generated the same overwhelming excitement.

39881614,https://nulltx.com/?p=143585,1738611025,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Pepe Coin Price Prediction — How Far Can $PEPE Go Amid the Meme Market Slump,https://nulltx.com/pepe-coin-price-prediction-how-far-can-pepe-go-amid-the-meme-market-slump/,"Pepe Coin (PEPE) has shown impressive potential as a top meme coin, but recent volatility and whale sell-offs have added uncertainty to its future. While some investors see a possible recovery, the meme coin market remains unpredictable. Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is taking a different approach by potentially addressing Bitcoin’s biggest limitations—slow transactions, high fees, and scalability issues. As a Layer-2 solution, it offers instant transactions, lower costs, and seamless Ethereum compatibility. Let’s dive in and see what makes these projects stand out. Can Pepe Coin ($PEPE) Defy the Meme Market Slump and Reach New Highs? At the time of writing, Pepe Coin (PEPE) is trading at $0.00001237, showing a 2.5% increase in the last 24 hours. Its market cap stands at $5.28 billion, backed by a 24-hour trading volume of $1.05 billion, which highlights steady market activity. The RSI sits at 40, which places PEPE in the lower neutral zone. A big factor behind its decline has been large-scale sell-offs by whales. One notable whale turned a $3,000 investment into $51.25 million, then offloaded 500 billion PEPE tokens. Crypto analyst DEFI OMEGA believes Pepe is on the verge of a major breakout, eyeing a move beyond the $0.000023 resistance level. He expects strong bullish momentum soon, with $0.00003 as a potential short-term target. PlutoChain ($PLUTO): The Layer-2 Solution That Could Make Bitcoin Faster, Cheaper, and More Versatile Bitcoin remains the most dominant cryptocurrency, but it still faces major challenges — slow transactions, high fees, and network congestion. While Ethereum and Solana have introduced faster and more scalable solutions, Bitcoin has struggled to keep up. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could change that by providing a Layer-2 network designed to enhance Bitcoin’s efficiency, lower costs, and expand its real-world usability. Operating as a parallel network to Bitcoin, PlutoChain could help reduce congestion, cut transaction fees, and improve overall performance. By leveraging Layer-2 technology, it offers block time of just two seconds, a massive improvement over Bitcoin’s 10-minute block time. This speed could make everyday payments and microtransactions more practical while also lowering energy consumption. Beyond improving transaction efficiency, PlutoChain could enhance Bitcoin’s ecosystem by introducing seamless cross-chain compatibility. Since it is fully Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) -compatible, it could allow Ethereum-based applications — including DeFi platforms, NFTs, and AI-driven projects — to integrate with Bitcoin. This bridge between networks could bring new use cases to Bitcoin and expand its role beyond just a store of value. During testing, PlutoChain processed 43,200 transactions in a single day without any disruptions, which demonstrates its ability to handle large-scale activity efficiently. Security is also a top priority. PlutoChain has undergone audits from SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi to ensure its resilience against vulnerabilities. It also performs regular code reviews and stress tests and stays compliant with international standards. The platform also embraces decentralized governance. It empowers and encourages the community to participate in decision-making for partnerships, upgrades, and future developments. With its fast transactions, lower fees, and cross-chain functionality, PlutoChain could be the key to modernizing Bitcoin, by making it more scalable, versatile, and competitive. The Bottom Line While Pepe Coin (PEPE) remains one of the most actively traded meme coins, its future depends on market sentiment and broader trends in the meme coin sector. Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is focused on potentially solving real-world blockchain inefficiencies. By offering faster transactions, lower costs, and seamless Ethereum compatibility, it could redefine Bitcoin’s scalability and unlock new possibilities for adoption. ———— This article is purely informational and should not be interpreted as financial advice.

As Dogecoin hints at an ascending triangle formation, RCO Finance, a new alternative, eyes a rally following its presale. Table of Contents Dogecoin shows positive signs despite decline RCO Finance: The AI altcoin with a predicted rally Conclusion Dogecoin (DOGE) is flashing signals of a comeback as it forms an ascending triangle — a pattern often linked to breakout potential. As traders anticipate a price surge, another alternative cryptocurrency is also gaining momentum, positioning itself for a strong rally. This new AI altcoin offers a financial platform that aims to make advanced investing strategies accessible to everyone. It looks to simplify cryptocurrency trading using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Dogecoin shows positive signs despite decline Recent research shows that Dogecoin could be forming an ascending triangle pattern on its 4-hour chart. The ascending triangle pattern indicates that bulls might be getting stronger despite DOGE’s recent decline. If the meme coin breaks above the support level, it could be on a path to rising. The bottom of the chart also shows that Dogecoin’s RSI indicator recently fell below 30%, indicating it is oversold. The RSI has bounced back and is gaining strength. It looks like it may rise further into the overbought range. This trend shows that more people are buying Dogecoin, which could lead to higher prices. You might also like: Crypto analysts: RCO Finance’s growth mirrors Solana’s 2021 breakout RCO Finance: The AI altcoin with a predicted rally ROI-minded investors have decided to expand their portfolio and add RCO Finance to DOGE and other crypto coins. The RCOF project is an advanced AI-crypto project that seeks to breach the gap traders have faced in crypto trading. This AI trading platform will help crypto investors make decisions and raise their profit margin. One of RCOF’s features is the AI Robo Advisor. This tool will create custom investment plans for each user based on their financial goals, risk tolerance, and market interests. It doesn’t matter whether the user is new to trading or has experience, the Robo Advisor will look at market data and quickly update the investment accounts. For example, XRP recently broke through the $3 mark for the first time in months. In this case, the Robo Advisor would have predicted the rise and advised accordingly to make sure users are on top of the market. Notably, RCO Finance recently launched its beta platform , which allows users to test the platform’s features before its official launch. This move sets RCO Finance apart because most platforms hardly launch their beta phase before an official launch. In a bid to ensure a consistent flow of profit, the RCOF team is constantly working and reviewing the Robo Advisor to ensure it operates at its best. RCOF investors can also use their tokens to earn prizes and make money passively. The platform offers high yearly interest rates for holding RCOF tokens, motivating users to keep their tokens for an extended period. Conclusion RCOF tokens will enable crypto traders to improve their trading portfolios. The RCOF public presale is currently in Stage 5, with each token priced at $0.10000, expected to hit $0.13000 in the next presale stage. Early investors are predicted to see 12,000% gains when the RCOF coin is launched at a price of around $0.4 to $0.6. The RCOF presale has raised more than $12.7 million, indicating high interest from investors. It’s also exciting to see that over 15.66% of the tokens available in this presale have been sold in a very short time. SolidProof , a well-known security company, is responsible for auditing the RCOF smart contract to ensure the safety of the project.

His bearish prediction for the Dogecoin pricemovement comes when DOGE faces a new challenger, Remittix (RTX) , for the $1 target in 2025. The analyst chart depicts an ascending wedge pattern running into a confluence of resistance within the $0.338 and $0.343 ranges. Contrary to Dogecoin's bearish prediction, Remittix's price movement has already recorded a 232% rally to sell at $0.0521, with the potential for 100x gains in 2025. While the DeepSeekprediction for the $1 race between Remittix and Dogecoin favors the DOGE token, this new DeFi hybrid project also has a perfect chance. Dogecoin Faces A Major Dip Before The Weekend Carlos Garcia's chart showcases a notable support level in the $0.31 region as the DOGE token hovers above the $0.32 level . It also points at higher lows forming within the lower boundary of an ascending wedge as the overhead resistance repeatedly caps upward price movements. This wedge appears to be compressing Dogecoin’s price action, often a significant breakdown or breakout setup. A horizontal resistance zone within the $0.34 area stands out. The price of Dogecoin has attempted multiple short-term rallies above this level but failed to secure a confirmed breakout, suggesting sellers are firmly holding this zone. On the dip side, a green box spanning roughly $0.310 marks is where buying interest for Dogecoin has historically picked up. If the wedge pattern breaks down decisively, Dogecoin price could seek support at the $0.262 level. The analyst also pointed to the upcoming weekend as the wildcard. Historically, lower trading volumes on Saturdays or Sundays can exacerbate volatility. If the price of Dogecoin fails to hold the rising trendline near the $0.328 or $0.330, the DOGE token could retest lower support around the $0.310 or potentially dip further to the $0.262 level as technical indicators also support a bearish momentum. Remittix Welcomes Dogecoin Investors As It Prepares For 100x Returns The advent of digital currencies brings a new challenge to the current financial industry landscape, especially cross-border payments. At its core, Remittix seeks to integrate fiat with cryptos. The project will support over 40 cryptos, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin. Remittix also provides an avenue for seamless conversion of digital currencies into major traditional currencies, including EUR, USD, and GBP. Apart from the conversion, the converted amount can be transferred directly into the recipient’s bank account. This is a significant step up from the standard blockchain payment gateway. As Remittix operates past the everyday challenges of conventional institutions, where service charges are exorbitant and processes are lengthy and tiresome, the project is setting the pace while revolutionizing the remittance market. The Remittix Pay API is also the perfect feature for businesses owing to its efficiency when it comes to international payroll. It offers a reliable means of converting crypto payments into fiat. Moreover, API helps companies deposit money into employees' bank accounts worldwide, a service that will streamline global operations and reduce costs. Remittix provides user security and autonomy for transparency, eliminating third-party involvement in all transactions. The platform has also undergone audits by BlockSAFU and SolidProof, ensuring reliability while making Remittix a trusted infrastructure. Backed by such unique features, Remittix has already seen a 232% rally to hit the $0.0498 mark with presale funding of over $10 million. This places the RTX token in a better position to record a 100x gain, targeting the $1 mark. Can Remittix Hit $1 Before Dogecoin? Dogecoin price movement could face a bearish weekend. Failure to hold above the $0.328 or $0.330 will see the DOGE token retest support level around the $0.31 and $0.262 levels, reducing its chance of hitting $1. On the other hand, Renittiux’s 3-year team lock will ensure that it eliminates the possibility of insider sell-offs, which could help the RTX token value rise, backed by its unique DeFi capabilities, in 2025.

Although DeepSeek's prediction for the $1 race between Remittix and Dogecoin leans toward DOGE, this emerging DeFi hybrid project also stands a strong chance. Dogecoin Could Experience A Significant Drop Before the Weekend Carlos Garcia's chart highlights a key support area around $0.31 as the DOGE token remains above the $0.32 level .

The platform has also been audited by BlockSAFU and SolidProof, ensuring reliability and positioning Remittix as a trusted infrastructure. Supported by such exceptional features, Remittix has already achieved a 232% surge to reach the $0.0498 mark, with presale funding exceeding $10 million. This places the RTX token in a stronger position to achieve a 100x gain, aiming for the $1 milestone. Will Remittix Reach $1 Before Dogecoin? Dogecoin's price movement might face a bearish weekend. If it fails to stay above the $0.328 or $0.330 levels, the DOGE token may test support areas around $0.31 and $0.262, diminishing its chances of reaching $1. Conversely, Remittix’s 3-year team lock will help prevent insider sell-offs, which could boost the RTX token's value, supported by its unique DeFi capabilities, by 2025.

The downturn follows significant liquidations, pushing Bitcoin below $100k. Despite the drop, LINK remains above the $20 support level. Investors are assessing whether this presents a buying opportunity or signals further downside amid ongoing volatility in early 2025’s crypto landscape. Chainlink Price Falls 15%; Is This a Buying Opportunity? Chainlink price has fallen by 15%, sparking discussions about a potential buying opportunity. The cryptocurrency started 2025 with sluggish momentum, which has led to mixed price predictions. Despite the recent dip, analysts remain largely optimistic about LINK’s long-term prospects, pointing to potential bullish signals. January ended positively for Chainlink, with the token climbing 15% after a weak start to the month. However, the past 24 hours have seen significant corrections across the crypto market. Many investors have faced liquidations as prices dropped sharply, contributing to uncertainty. LINK Price Could Surge as Stablecoin Issuer Adopts Key Services Chainlink price sees a boost as a major stablecoin issuer with $1.2 billion in assets integrates its infrastructure. Usually, the issuer of USD0 and USD0++ now utilizes Chainlink’s Price Feeds, Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), and Proof of Reserve. This move enhances security and transparency in Usual’s ecosystem. Co-founder Adli Takkal Bataille emphasized the integration’s role in driving stablecoin adoption and enabling safe cross-chain transactions. The partnership highlights Chainlink’s growing influence in tokenized real-world assets and institutional finance. Chainlink Price Analysis LINK price hovered at $20.93, showing a decrease in the past 24 hours, with the cryptocurrency attempting to recover from recent losses. Technical indicators suggest a mixed outlook for Chainlink in the short term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 47, indicating that LINK is in a neutral zone. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a bearish trend, with the MACD line at -0.98 below the signal line at -1.23. Key Levels To Watch Key resistance levels are identified at $25 and $30. If the Chainlink price prediction breaks above the $25 resistance, it could target the $30 mark. Conversely, significant support lies at $15. A decline below this level could trigger further downside towards $12. Chainlink Price Chart: TradingView Chainlink price drop raises questions about its next move. While technical indicators signal caution, long-term adoption trends and key partnerships could support a recovery, making LINK a potential opportunity for investors.

This happened when Trump introduced new tariffs, including a 25% tax on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tax on Chinese products. This caused threats of retaliation from these countries and upset global markets. As Cardano now sees a decline in its DeFi activities, there’s an increase in negative pressures. This could keep the price of ADA within a limited range. Cardano’s Total Value Locked Drops The price of Cardano (ADA) has dropped by 15% over the past week as the cryptocurrency market faces tough conditions. According to Coinglass, Cardano saw more than $33 million in total liquidations, with around $27.7 million of that coming from investors closing their long positions in the last 24 hours. The recent market crash has plunged Cardano’s defi activity. DeFiLlama reports that the total value locked (TVL) in the Cardano network has plummeted to $355 million from a high of $593 million earlier this year. This means the network has seen a loss of about $238 million in assets. This drop is partly due to the ongoing decline in Cardano’s price. The value has also fallen in terms of ADA tokens, dropping to 445 million from a peak of 585 million this year. This declining activity could fuel Cardano’s bearish trend. However, traders need to watch out for an uptick in DeFi activity, as that could coincide with a rally. Also read: Cardano Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will ADA Price Hit $2? Last week’s launch of the Plomin hard fork has Cardano supporters excited about its potential effects on ADA accumulation and price trends. Additionally, the activity of large ADA holders is crucial, as their significant purchases could boost market sentiment. Also, the correlation between ADA and Bitcoin could positively influence ADA in the mid-to-long term. With Bitcoin stabilizing around $100K after its recent sell-off, there’s hope that Cardano will do the same soon. Is ADA Price Flashing ‘Buy the Dip’ Opportunity? As the ADA price finally made a downward correction after its strong upswing for over the last few weeks, investors are preparing to hop in. As ADA forms a dip in the price chart, whales find it an opportunity to accumulate more. The daily price chart shows that ADA price witnessed an upward correction after dropping to the low of $0.5. As of writing, ADA price trades at $0.79, dropping over 0.8% in the last 24 hours. Buyers are attempting to hold the price at the $0.80 level, but sellers might drive the price down, resulting in the ADA/USDT pair retesting the $0.50. It is expected that ADA price might face strong resistance around $0.8. If surpassed, we might see its price back above $1. If the price drops from $0.8 again, it could fall back to around $0.50 and might fluctuate between these two levels for some days.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|TRADING|BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-03 19:35:21

The registry will help the state enforce crypto operations registration and tax reporting. TASS , a state-owned news agency, announced the government plans, highlighting that crypto mining without registered equipment would be a toll order in the country. Deputy Minister of Energy Evgeny Grabchak is leading these calls as a part of proposed legal changes on mining policies. The registry will help to identify domestic mining activities, especially in regions where mining is prohibited. In November 2024, the Russian government banned crypto mining in several regions, including some parts of Ukraine, where it had invaded. The ban, which commenced in December 2024, will be in effect for several years, up to March 2031. Russia said the ban was meant to address power shortages in those regions. Russia crypto mining and transactions tax framework to begin working Russia developed a tax frame that was approved in November 2024. Today, Russia’s Federal Taxation Service announced that the digital platform for reporting digital currency earnings is active. The platform will help miners seamlessly and directly report their crypto earnings on their online FNS accounts. The new platform will allow users to submit an authentic electronic signature, which will trigger the platform’s tax-complying function. The FNS online platform exposes users to several tax reporting forms for individuals, legal entities, and business enterprises. President Vladimir Putin approved a tax framework for crypto mining and transactions to take effect at the beginning of this year. The framework states that miners who earn up to $23,976 from crypto must submit 13% as a tax, and anyone earning beyond that threshold must pay 15% of the income. Moreover, the framework directs miners to fulfill their monthly reporting requirements for their mined cryptocurrency, with a deadline of the 20th of the following month. Russia’s tax move on crypto might improve their budget, or will it follow Kyrgyzstan’s uncertain path? Russia’s move to enforce a tax on crypto mining might improve its revenue and ease budget pressure. However, it might also turn out like Kyrgyzstan, which at one point boosted its revenue stream with mining taxes but failed to sustain the tempo. In 2024, Kyrgyzstan received only $4,083.40 in cryptocurrency mining tax. This was a meager collection, falling 43% short of 2023’s revenues of $7,219.14 Crypto tax revenue is not guaranteed to be consistent, as fluctuations are expected over the coming months, similar to Kyrgyzstan’s experience. The country saw a decline in revenues for most of the year, but in December, the cryptocurrency mining tax increased by $493.09. Russia’s monthly online tax filing strategy may be critical to ensuring that most crypto traders cannot bypass the process. Besides, the registry will play an important role in ensuring that all equipment is entered into the database for easy tracking.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Chainlink’s path to resurgence may lie in embracing meme coin launches like Panshibi, which is growing significantly. Table of Contents What 2025 holds for Chainlink amid struggles The undeniable assistance of meme coins like Panshib Conclusion When cryptocurrency debuted with Bitcoin in 2009, it took a while for investors to catch on, which was understandable considering the novelty of the idea. Today, the cryptocurrency market is worth well over $3.5 trillion. However, the growth hasn’t stopped market stalwarts like Chainlink from falling behind due to market volatility. This week alone, Chainlink hit a 13.7% decline. However, analysts think focusing on transformative meme coins like Panshibi could help LINK regain its footing, just like it did with Solana. Panshibi has been raising dust in its ongoing presale, which sold out a stage within two days. What 2025 holds for Chainlink amid struggles In 2023, Chainlink emerged alongside Solana as a market leader with bullish runs that thrilled investors worldwide. However, LINK suffered a painful nosedive for the better part of 2024 and lost a chunk of its momentum. In a dramatic twist of fate, it managed a surprising upsurge of 200% in November and then reverted to record lows in December. Many experts described the December debacle as a wipeout of its short-lived gains and a complete antithesis to its 2023 run. Nonetheless, LINK started 2025 with a somewhat bullish run, and experts are optimistic about a possible return to form. Some inconsistencies in the past few weeks have, however, dampened investor confidence, with many unsure about the direction of the troubled token. Chainlink currently trades at $20.46, and while there have been improvements, it’s still a far cry from its peak. The Chainlink team, as expected, is devising optimal strategies to help guarantee stability and keep it on an upward trend for 2025. You might also like: Shiba Inu’s future in December as Panshibi draws big investments in presale The undeniable assistance of meme coins like Panshib Meme coins were initially dismissed as fake crypto with no real utility but now boast a market valued at around $115 billion. The market’s capitalization skyrocketed by over 500% in 2024, constituting 10% of the entire crypto market. Like Chainlink, Solana also suffered price mishaps in the past year, although the latter’s decline isn’t remotely as bad. One of the few ways Solana forced a much-needed price resurgence was by testing meme coins and unleashing a bunch of tokens. This proved successful, pushing Solana to an all-time high of $294 and a massive TVL of $12 billion in January 2025. It almost goes without saying that the Chainlink team needs to take advantage of the pervasive wave of meme coins by testing a bunch of them like Solana did. This will undoubtedly propel the LINK price to record highs and expand its network, among other gains. You might also like: Dogecoin may see competition as new meme coin Panshibi gains attention Panshibi is a perfect example of a meme coin’s endless advantages when done rightly. Currently, a 60-day presale is ongoing, and myriads of pundits already tip SHIBi to be among 2025’s leading meme coins. It keeps its token holders happy by promoting a community of like-minded enthusiasts and incorporating quests that allow the holders to compete and earn prizes. Token holders also get to stake their tokens, standing the chance to earn up to 1,200% in annual percentage yield. To further sweeten the pot, token ownership will be renounced at the end of the presale — a move that essentially yields governance to holders and the community in general. What’s more, the liquidity pool will be locked for 10 years, guaranteeing price stability, impressive growth, and a refulgent future. Conclusion The Panshibi meme coin is taking the market by storm and could debut strongly once listed. Its smart contract audit by Coinsult takes care of any misgivings about its security, and the SHIBI community remains as engaged as ever. As such, cryptos like Chainlink, itching for a comeback, should take a cue. For more information on Panshibi, visit their website , Telegram , or Twitter .

Mobile wallet usage reached 36 million users in January, which indicates the mainstream acceptance of digital assets. Among the standout performers, several cryptocurrencies MANTRA (OM), REMITTIX (RTX), TRUMP MEME ($TRUMP), XRP, and the CARDANO price (ADA) are capturing attention through innovative features and developments. The rise in institutional investments, increasing stablecoin dominance, and the expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi) have pushed these cryptocurrencies into the spotlight. Let's find out why. MANTRA (OM): Real-World Asset Tokenization Gains Momentum MANTRA is making strides as a Layer 1 blockchain focused on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Built on the Cosmos SDK, MANTRA’s price surged reaching $5.52, following its $1 billion partnership with DAMAC Group in Dubai’s real estate sector. This positions it as a leader in DeFi applications. With the tokenization of real-world assets gaining traction, MANTRA remains a top pick for investors. TRUMP MEME ($TRUMP): A Meme Coin with Political Influence The TRUMP MEME coin has shaken up the meme coin sector, quickly entering the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. With a price of $26.34 , TRUMP meme gained significant attention due to Donald Trump’s direct association and his executive order positioning the U.S. as a crypto-friendly nation. However, its political significance and media exposure keep it a high-volatility asset. Ripple Price: Institutional Expansion and Regulatory Wins XRP saw a 50% surge in January, outpacing Bitcoin’s 13% increase. Currently priced at $3.10 , XRP’s growth is driven by Ripple Labs securing key financial licenses, including New York’s approval for RLUSD stablecoin. Ripple price is a key focus for investors, as the Ripple price movements remain bullish. Backed by strong institutional support and bullish technical indicators, Market analysts forecast XRP breaking past $4 soon. As one of the most reliable solutions for cross-border payments, XRP continues to dominate blockchain finance. Cardano (ADA): Decentralized Governance Reshaping Blockchain Cardano’s (ADA) Plomin hard fork is a game-changer, introducing community-driven governance. ADA holders now have direct voting rights through Delegated Representatives (DReps), reducing reliance on centralized entities. With 78% of network nodes upgraded, the Plomin hard fork ensures Cardano’s seamless governance transition. Additionally, Charles Hoskinson’s active policy advocacy in Washington may further solidify ADA’s institutional appeal. Cardano price has shown resilience to market trends and is expected to surge with further network developments. With the DeFi coin currently valued at $0.977 , Cardano price fluctuations continue to be of interest to investors. The ADA token is up 13% on the monthly charts, and has also lost 2.7% on the weekly trends. Remittix (RTX): The Future of Cross-Border Crypto Payments Unlike MANTRA, XRP, or Cardano, which focus on DeFi and blockchain tokenization, Remittix (RTX) is leading a PayFi revolution. The PayFi solution allows users to send FIAT to bank accounts using crypto, eliminating hidden fees and unfair conversion rates. Remittix ensures seamless global payments, for businesses and individuals, offering a Defi-backed payment system that surpasses traditional systems like Coinbase, Stripe, and Wise. While Remittix is a DeFi project, it stands at the intersection between traditional finance and decentralized finance, and with traction from both sides of the divide, experts expect Remittixto generate enough traction to power its RTX token to a 100x pump. RTX Presale Gains Acceptance The RTX public presale is aiming for $36m, and the presale token is already closing in on the $10.4 million mark. With such impressive presale success, it is clear that the crypto market is open-armed to the project, as investors continue to buy into its ideals. The RTX token is selling at $0.0521 per token, and you might want to take advantage of the low entry point now before the price spikes.

According to a new Coinbase announcement , the exchange has received approval from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to act as a VASP in the United Kingdom. “Coinbase has obtained its VASP registration in the United Kingdom issued by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This registration will allow Coinbase to offer a better suite of retail, institutional, and ecosystem products and services to users across the UK as the largest registered VASP.” According to the announcement, the VASP registration has helped Coinbase surpass Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world, as the biggest digital asset service provider in the region. “This VASP registration makes Coinbase the largest registered digital assets player in the UK. The UK Government and the FCA are developing welcome regulation for the crypto sector, hopefully joining the growing trend of countries embracing economic freedom and free markets. Governments around the world are waking up to the fact that crypto fuels economic prosperity. We believe that crypto is the most important technology that can generate growth in the world, and the UK is poised to benefit from this.” Just last week, Coinbase received approval to operate as a VASP in Argentina.

Mobile wallet usage reached 36 million users in January, which indicates the mainstream acceptance of digital assets. Among the standout performers, several cryptocurrencies MANTRA (OM), REMITTIX (RTX), TRUMP MEME ($TRUMP), XRP, and the CARDANO price (ADA) are capturing attention through innovative features and developments. The rise in institutional investments, increasing stablecoin dominance, and the expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi) have pushed these cryptocurrencies into the spotlight. Let's find out why. MANTRA (OM): Pioneering Real-World Asset Tokenization MANTRA is advancing as a Layer 1 blockchain with a focus on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Developed using the Cosmos SDK, MANTRA’s value soared to $5.52, following its impressive $1 billion collaboration with DAMAC Group in Dubai’s real estate market. This development strengthens its position as a leader in DeFi applications. As the tokenization of real-world assets gains momentum, MANTRA remains a popular choice for investors. TRUMP MEME ($TRUMP): A Meme Coin with Political Clout The TRUMP MEME coin has stirred up the meme coin market, swiftly becoming one of the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Priced at $26.34 , TRUMP meme has garnered substantial attention due to Donald Trump’s direct involvement and his executive order fostering a crypto-friendly environment in the U.S. Despite its political weight and media presence, it remains a highly volatile asset. Ripple Price: Growth from Institutional Backing and Regulatory Successes XRP experienced a 50% increase in January, surpassing Bitcoin’s 13% rise. Currently valued at $3.10 , XRP’s upward trend is fueled by Ripple Labs' acquisition of vital financial licenses, including New York’s approval for the RLUSD stablecoin. Ripple price is a key focus for investors, as the Ripple price movements remain bullish. Backed by strong institutional support and bullish technical indicators, Market analysts forecast XRP breaking past $4 soon. As one of the most reliable solutions for cross-border payments, XRP continues to dominate blockchain finance. Cardano (ADA): Transforming Blockchain with Decentralized Governance Cardano’s (ADA) Plomin hard fork is a significant development, introducing a governance model driven by the community. ADA holders now have the power to vote directly through Delegated Representatives (DReps), reducing dependence on centralized authorities. With 78% of network nodes upgraded, the Plomin hard fork ensures Cardano’s seamless governance transition. Additionally, Charles Hoskinson’s active policy advocacy in Washington may further solidify ADA’s institutional appeal. Cardano price has shown resilience to market trends and is expected to surge with further network developments. With the DeFi coin currently valued at $0.977 , Cardano price fluctuations continue to be of interest to investors. The ADA token is up 13% on the monthly charts, and has also lost 2.7% on the weekly trends. Remittix (RTX): Innovating Cross-Border Crypto Transactions Unlike MANTRA, XRP, or Cardano, which focus on DeFi and blockchain tokenization, Remittix (RTX) is leading a PayFi revolution.

Hoskinson revealed that there have been discussions with Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz and CEO Brad Garlinghouse regarding the implementation of Ripple’s new stablecoin, RLUSD. While the talks are still in the early stages, Hoskinson said the collaboration is a “strong possibility.” “They told us to wait until March because they had just finished the NYDFS [New York Department of Financial Services] process and that was a very intense thing,” Hoskinson said. “So we’ll start again in a month and a half and see if there’s a roadmap and how they’re going to do it.” Related News: Beware: Tomorrow Could Be An Important Day, Critical Cryptocurrency Meeting to be Held in the US - Here is the Event Time The ADA founder also touched on the possibility of working with DFINITY, the team behind Internet Computer (ICP). He admitted that ICP was one of the “top blockchain candidates” for Wyoming’s blockchain initiatives but was unfairly singled out. “It’s potentially possible,” Hoskinson said of the collaboration with DFINITY founder and chief scientist Dominic Williams. “ICP was very unhappy that they were left out. They were one of the best blockchain candidates for what Wyoming wanted to do, and they were left out for no reason.” “There are a lot of good people in this ecosystem, there are great scientists as well,” he said, adding that he appreciated ICP’s contributions to blockchain technology. *This is not investment advice.

According to a new blog post , Coinbase says it has acquired Spindl to blow up the popularity of crypto developers. “As we talk with builders every day, a consistent theme stands out: builders want to go viral and we want to help them do that. As we’ve said before, there’s a natural flywheel here: we support developers who build on-chain apps, those apps attract users on-chain, and having more users incentivizes more developers to build on-chain. And the faster we spin this flywheel, the easier it will be to bring more and more people on-chain. Builder virality is the thing that spins that flywheel faster.” Coinbase says that Spindl – which was founded three years ago by an ex-Facebook advertising employee – will help improve the problem of on-chain discovery for builders and will operate directly on Base, the firm’s proprietary blockchain. According to Coinbase, builders currently have issues finding quality users and distribution, a problem that can be solved by going viral via targeted advertising. “The Spindl team brings unmatched expertise in on-chain advertising, helping builders accelerate their reach while bringing more users on-chain by connecting builders with both Coinbase users and users across the on-chain economy. Their work will be crucial to expanding the ways we elevate and support builders, and we’re excited for them to hit the ground running.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

What the author of the article doesn’t share, though, is that bitcoin’s price is going to go down, and up, much more so than traditional assets, because it’s incredibly liquid, and it’s easy to buy and sell. But Bitcoin is a distributed network made up of miners, nodes, developers, and users — on a technical level, it is quite different from other assets like stocks, as it has no central party controlling it. Because of this, bitcoin has been a safe haven for those trying to navigate geopolitical fears. No one can just print more bitcoin out of thin air and inflate the supply, enforce any unwanted network changes overnight, or overthrow and stop the network from running. But don’t just take my word for it, take Larry Fink’s, the CEO of the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock. Just a couple of weeks ago, Fink said that he is a true believer in Bitcoin’s value proposition and that if you’re frightened of the geopolitical fears in your country, you can now have an international-based asset that operates completely independently from those tensions. JUST IN: $11.5 trillion BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says Bitcoin could go up to $700,000 if there is more fear of currency debasement and economic instability. pic.twitter.com/WOXclAsjDP — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) January 22, 2025 Sure, Bitcoin’s price will respond to news and events happening in the short term, causing large price actions to the upside or downside, but cherrypicking data in an attempt to make bitcoin look like it’s a bad investment is just bad reporting and misleading. Bitcoin has been the best performing asset of the last 15 years, and will likely continue to perform well due to its value proposition. The important point to understand here is that while Bitcoin is a volatile asset reacting to daily events, over the long term, bitcoin’s value proposition is what takes its price higher and higher. For the first time in history, we have money that can not be hyperinflated. Bitcoin also allows people to transact across borders freely, without permission, giving users an escape hatch for anyone whose country is attempting to control them financially. Forget short term price when it comes to bitcoin as a tool to help navigate geopolitical tensions. Over the long term, Bitcoin’s supply and demand will take the price higher than it is today. Mainstream media articles on Bitcoin have always missed the bigger picture and end up misleading the people who read them. As geopolitical tensions increase, bitcoin is the safest asset you can own.

In separate updates shared on ZachXBT’s Telegram channel and X social media account, he revealed the results of his investigation into Coinbase and scams that the exchange’s customers have suffered. He also offered the company insights on how to protect its users. Coinbase customers are often targeted in fraud schemes According to ZachXBT’s thread, it’s difficult to determine the exact figure that Coinbase users lose per year to social engineering scams. However, he estimates it could be up to $300 million. ZachXBT and another sleuth identified as @tanuki42_ spent time reviewing Coinbase withdrawals and gathering data from his DMs for high-confidence thefts on various chains. They created a table that showed $65 million was stolen from Coinbase users between December 2024 and January 2025. “Our number is likely much lower than the actual amount stolen as our data was limited to my DMs and thefts we discovered on-chain which does not account for Coinbase support tickets and police reports we do not have access to,” Zach added for clarity. How the Coinbase social engineering scams work After a victim who lost $850,000 reached out to him last month, Zach graphed out thefts that affected 25+ other victims, which led him to the discovery of an address named ‘coinbase-hold.eth’. The scammers reportedly call victims from a spoofed phone number and then use personal information obtained from private channels to gain their trust. Afterward, they would inform the victims that they noticed multiple unauthorized login attempts on their accounts. What followed was a spoofed email drafted to appear as if it came from Coinbase, with a fake Case ID to further look convincing. Next, they will instruct the victim to transfer funds to a Coinbase wallet and whitelist an address while “support” verifies their account’s security. These scammers go as far as cloning the Coinbase site almost perfectly, according to ZachXBT, which allows them to send different prompts to the target via spoofed emails using panels. Scammers can buy these tools via Telegram channels, and they can repeat the process over and over with only minor tweaks. In essence, users continue to lose money to the same scheme every year. Last year, Zach also made a post about Coinbase scams and how they have cost users millions of dollars. He revealed back then that the two main groups behind these scams are “skids from the Com and threat actors located in India both primarily targeting US customers.” ZachXBT believes Coinbase is a part of the problem ZachXBT raised different issues with Coinbase’s handling of customer protection, but one he always repeats is the company’s failure to diagnose the actual problem and fix it. He mentioned a December 2024 post when a Coinbase employee urged users to stop using VPNs to avoid being flagged as suspicious. This inadvertently works in favor of threat actors, who explicitly block VPNs from their phishing sites. ZachXBT also highlighted how Coinbase has quietly experienced related security incidents they refused to publicly address. Some of them include how a number of Coinbase users with old API keys used for tax software were hacked. He also mentioned the discovery of bugs, like one that allowed users to send a verification code to any email even if the address is not linked to any account. There was also the $15.9M Coinbase Commerce theft last year when the threat actor laundered $38M from the BTCTurk hack via Coinbase over a few hours. ZachXBT wants Coinbase to do better ZachXBT says Coinbase does not usually report the addresses linked to thefts in popular compliance tools even after the thefts have gone on for weeks. Besides that, affected victims have complained of getting stuck with less than optimal customer support agents who never report back. And when they try to reach the Coinbase team, things get even more complicated because they can be hard to reach outside US office hours, even though the company operates in a 24/7 market. ZachXBT also believes some of the threat actors are US-based, and Coinbase could easily make an example out of them if they wanted. So, the inaction raises eyebrows. He recommended steps for the Coinbase leadership team to protect their users from bad actors in the space. The on-chain sleuth wants to make phone numbers optional for advanced users with authenticator apps or security keys added for fully KYC-verified users. He also wants to add a beginner/elderly user account type that doesn’t allow withdrawals. He wants Coinbase to improve community outreach to educate its users about potential threats before they get out of hand. As far as ZachXBT is concerned, the first three recommendations are the bare minimum expected of an exchange of Coinbase’s caliber. He added two more if Coinbase is serious about going the extra milestone for its users. He recommended legal action against TLOxp/TransUnion for negligence on behalf of users because it’s the favorite tool of these cyber criminals. He also said they could Initiate legal action against the US-based threat actors running these scams to make them scapegoats.

They’re autonomous, digital entities capable of commerce, collaboration, and creativity — all without human intervention. By 2026, they’ll be everywhere, handling tasks most businesses haven’t even begun to think about automating. And when paired with blockchain technology, they’re poised to become the backbone of a new digital economy. Ignoring this trend is like ignoring the early days of the internet. If you haven’t paid attention, you should start now. The Trillion Dollar Opportunity With AI driving rapid content generation, by 2025, the world will generate 181 zettabytes of data annually. For businesses and consumers, this tsunami of data presents a critical challenge: How do we cut through the noise, filter what matters, and act on it? How do we make faster, smarter decisions — both online and offline — to stay competitive and informed? This is where AI agents step in. They mark a significant leap from traditional AI tools, which are largely reactive, require explicit prompts, and operate within narrow parameters. AI agents, however, are proactive. They learn, reason, and act autonomously. They can break down complex tasks, prioritize them, and adapt strategies in real-time. AI agents are a product of our time – poised to become the next digital interface driving productivity and revenue, ready to work 24/7. Take Auto-GPT , an early prototype that autonomously creates marketing campaigns, or JPMorgan’s COiN, which reviews thousands of legal contracts daily—a task that once required 300,000 labor hours annually. Sales: AI agents are transforming sales processes by automating lead generation, qualifying prospects, personalizing customer interactions, and even closing deals (cf. Artisan, 11x, etc.) Marketing & Customer service: AI agents are automating content creation, personalizing customer experiences, optimizing campaigns, and providing data-driven insights (cf. Aisera, Intercom, Sierra, etc.) Coding & Software development: AI agents are rapidly transforming software development, with code copilots leading the charge in adoption (cf. Cursor, Codeium, etc.) Ops, Workflow Automation & BI: AI agents transform knowledge management by accessing data silos, enabling unified semantic search across emails, messengers, and documents (cf. Glean, Beam AI, etc.) These agents aren’t just enhancing workflows; they’re redefining them. Big tech and big AI have launched AI agents or announced plans to do so. Platforms emerge to build AI agent workforces such as coding assistants, researchers, marketers, or services agents: Salesforce recently announced version 2 of “Agentforce” with agents that remember, collaborate, and deliver with short/long-term memory, seamless handoffs, and secure teamwork. Google launched its “ Vertex AI ” platform in 2021, an enterprise development platform for building and using generative AI and agents, counting 300+ corporate use cases already. OpenAI just released ChatGPT “ Operator ”, an agent capable of executing tasks such as booking a holiday and assisting users autonomously. At CES in January, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang didn’t mince words: “AI agents are a multi-trillion dollar opportunity.” Crypto and AI: The Perfect Marriage? In Web3, frameworks, launchpads, payment rails, and applications are emerging, accumulating billions in value: Virtuals Protocol , one of the leading marketplaces for on-chain agents, launched over 15,000+ AI agents in six months, generating $45M in fees and engaging 670,000 token holders. ElizaOS , a crypto-compatible agent framework developed by ai16z , has exploded in popularity on Github, accumulating more than 13,500 stars. It’s now the most popular open source project in the world. Crypto-powered AI agents are already making waves: Truth Termina l: This memetic AI agent grew the $GOAT token to a 1 billion market cap by gamifying participation and fostering belief systems on social media. AIxBT : A crypto data aggregator with over 450,000 X followers, leveraging AI to provide market intelligence and investment insights. These agents are built on open-source frameworks or closed-sourced “launchpads” that allow users to easily create “tokenized” agents. Why tokens? Tokens in many AI-agent frameworks serve as technical infrastructure and economic ecosystem, incentivizing development, fund ongoing operations, and align stakeholder interests within a decentralized framework. These early experiments will look primitive to what’s yet to come as blockchain and AI continue to converge. Maja Vujinovic , an early investor in blockchain and AI, and CEO of OGroup , says: ""AI and crypto: A ‘couple’ that simply works better together. Crypto enables seamless payments for the computing power AI needs and supports decentralized model training, while AI enhances crypto’s usability and efficiency. Both are set to transform our financial system.” Blockchain is poised to become the fundamental infrastructure for an agentic economy, functioning as an API layer that enables seamless interaction and transactions among AI agents via programmable money and smart contracts. What’s Next? The next two years will see exponential growth in AI agent adoption. Businesses must prepare for this shift by investing in AI training and centers of excellence, strategically deploying AI agents in high-impact areas like customer service or sales, and establishing strong data governance frameworks to ensure security, privacy, and compliance. The question isn’t whether businesses will adopt this technology. It’s whether they’ll do it fast enough to stay competitive.",Opinion,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|MARKET|FIAT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-03 19:53:53

The company recently received a license from MiCA to operate in the E.U., and also in December voluntarily withdrew the lawsuit it filed against the SEC after receiving a Wells notice from the agency last summer (the withdrawal happened just a day after Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek met with then President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago). Not long after that meeting, the exchange announced it would re-enter the U.S. institutional exchange business after abandoning it in mid-2023 due to “limited demand.” Crypto.com also said in January it would allow its U.S. customers to trade stocks and ETFs in addition to crypto, and acquired several brokerage firms to further build out its offerings. And Crypto.com continued to be very active on the sports naming rights front, announcing deals with Formula 1 and the UEFA Champions League to further build on its monumental $700 million deal to rename the Los Angeles Lakers’ stadium back in 2021.

Here, Crypto.com president Eric Anziani, who will be a speaker at Consensus Hong Kong, discusses his company’s latest plans, and the importance of Asia to Crypto.com’s future. This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. What are Crypto.com’s plans for the EU now that it’s received a MiCA license? We were extremely proud to have been the first major global crypto asset service provider to receive a MiCA license, which means we can provide our market-leading range of crypto services across the EU under a streamlined and robust framework bringing a significantly improved degree of transparency to the sector. We have always been supportive of MiCA and believe it will build trust and establish a more uniformed sentiment towards the regulation of our industry across the EU, while also safeguarding consumers and helping advance innovation. The EU is a growing and vital hub for crypto investment, and we look forward to offering more of our products and services to our millions of EU users. What can you say about Crypto.com’s withdrawal of its lawsuit against the SEC? We withdrew our action against the SEC given our intent to work with the incoming administration on a regulatory framework for the industry. What are your major near- and long-term goals for Crypto.com? We’ve got an exciting and busy year ahead as we push forward with our vision to offer users the most comprehensive platform for a broad range of financial investment services. Key to our success is our focus on product development. We released our 2025 Roadmap late last year detailing our goals and product strategy for the year ahead, most of which revolve around broadening our product and service portfolio by integrating offerings that were once confined to traditional financial services, like stocks, banking and card programs, into Crypto.com. We also recently announced the acquisition of several brokerages such as Watchdog Capital and Orion Principals , which will allow us to expand these services even further. And we also recently launched stock and ETF trading in the U.S . We see a significant opportunity to not just continue to serve and lead the crypto market, but to be a driving force in effectively bridging traditional and digital finance. What is Crypto.com’s latest strategy with respect to sports naming rights deals? Our signature sports partnerships have played a pivotal role in making Crypto.com one of the most well-known and trusted brands globally. We have many long-standing sports partnerships with brands that we are honored to work with, and in the past few months we have announced the renewal of our F1 partnership until 2030, as well as becoming the first and exclusive global cryptocurrency platform partner of the UEFA Champions League . What role do you see Asia playing in the global crypto economy? Asia has always been a major market for us. We’re proudly headquartered in Singapore and licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore — a global leader in effective crypto regulation. The number of “digitally native” people in the Asia Pacific region, particularly among younger generations, is growing all the time, meaning there is an ever-growing pool of users who are supporting this growth in digital consumption and that’s only going to continue expanding and contributing to the crypto industry’s development. There’s also a huge talent pool of young tech-savvy entrepreneurs, which is why we chose to set up our global innovation lab in Singapore, making it our designated R&D hub. The lab team is experimenting with frontier technologies and identifying novel applications for blockchain, Web3 and AI. What are the biggest challenges to Web3’s development in Asia? The Asia region has a complex financial demographic that includes a significant underbanked or unbanked population, alongside a digitally-savvy population with high mobile internet connectivity and smartphone penetration. So for us it’s also about how we reach those who have been historically underserved and offer them the financial tools and opportunities they need. A lot of this expansion will come down to regulatory environments — for example places like Singapore have implemented clear, robust and innovation-friendly regulations, enabling the establishment of secure and trusted platforms. But other regional jurisdictions are still lagging behind on clear regulatory frameworks for exchanges and digital assets. You’re deeply involved in the blockchain and start-up world in Singapore through various organizations. What are your main priorities there for 2025? Singapore is our global headquarters, and we are very proud to be part of Singapore’s flourishing digital asset and fintech community. We work with both regulators and industry players with the aim of building an innovative and responsible Web3 ecosystem, by balancing the needs of industry for regulatory clarity and fit-for-purpose policies, as well as market integrity and consumer protection. Going into 2025, we continue to play a leading role in supporting local players and industry associations to constructively engage with the authorities on topics such as consumer protection, scams, staking and responsible advertising through workshops, focus groups and industry papers. Talent development is also an important focus for us. For example, we were an industry partner for GFTN (Global Financial Technology Network, formerly Elevandi, and organizer of the Singapore Fintech Festival) for their inaugural Blockchain Guardians Program in 2024. This intensive ten-week program for pre-university students aimed to develop the next generation of fintech leaders with the dual skill sets of digital asset savviness and a robust compliance mindset. What are you most excited to discuss on stage at Consensus Hong Kong? We go into 2025 with a really positive mindset. The industry has turned a corner in the last year, coming through the bear market and proving its resilience once again. I am looking forward to discussing all the incredible innovations and products that are going to be introduced into the digital assets space this year, what that means for cryptocurrency adoption and how we continue mainstreaming crypto and bridging financial technologies. Is there anything else you think is important to mention? More jurisdictions globally are focused on designing effective regulation which will further responsible innovation and enhance consumer and institutional trust in our industry. This will be vital for boosting adoption and further encouraging traditional financial institutions to engage with blockchain and digital asset technologies — an exciting trend we’re going to see a lot more of in 2025.",Consensus Hong Kong 2025 Coverage|Crypto.com|Crypto Exchange|MiCA|Singapore|chk2025,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-03 19:59:03

Here's What to Anticipate from the Trending ETH-Based Token,https://bitzo.com/2025/02/ethereum-price-forecast-can-eths-value-double-heres-what-to-anticipate-from-the-trending-eth-based-token,"Following the U.S. elections, the crypto market is set for a wave of optimism, with major corporations leaning towards blockchain technology, improved regulations under President Trump’s crypto-friendly administration, and ongoing research and development. Ethereum, which remains the leading platform for smart contracts, is currently priced at $2,667.33 on Coinmarketcap. It shows resilience despite recent fluctuations. Meanwhile, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) , an Ethereum-based token that allows players to earn through gaming (P2E), is capturing interest with its highly successful presale. Ethereum (ETH): Technical Breakouts Have Bulls Targeting $7,500 The path of Ethereum prices continues to be favorable against the dollar. According to reports from Mittrade , analysts have identified a reverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the weekly chart, which is often indicative of a trend reversal. Source: Tradingview (ETH to USD) If this pattern holds, Ethereum's price could surge to $7,500 by the end of 2025, more than doubling its current value. Key factors for this projection include: Institutional Buy-In: Trump’s World Liberty Financial has invested millions in ETH, reflecting confidence in the cryptocurrency. Technological Upgrades: The forthcoming Pectra upgrade in March 2025 aims to enhance speed and efficiency, while the full implementation of Ethereum 2.0 will reduce fees and boost DeFi expansion. Market Dynamics: Should ETH surpass $3,650, it might see a 35–50% increase, linked to Bitcoin-driven rallies post-halving. Are there no hurdles? Indeed, there are a few. Concerns about Ethereum's security and internal rifts among Ethereum Foundation leaders could impede progress. Key Metrics ETH (2025) Current Price $2,267.33 Predicted Range $2.6k – $12k Reasons Institutional inflows, Pectra upgrade Yeti Ouro (YETIO): The ETH Token Transforming P2E Gaming While Ethereum navigates some economic hurdles, Yeti Ouro emerges as a surprising player. Built on Ethereum, YETIO combines entertaining meme culture with real-world utility through its flagship game, Yeti Go. What Makes YETIO Unique: Play-to-Earn Revolution: Yeti Go, developed using Unreal Engine 5, delivers thrilling racing action. Gamers earn YETIO tokens by participating in races and competitions. Talented developers from Call of Duty, Spiderman, Dead Space, and The Witcher ensure captivating gameplay. Deflationary Strategy: YETIO tokens have a limited supply of 1 billion, with a 5% burn rate, leading to increased scarcity and value over time. Presale Momentum: With Stage 2 of YETIO's presale priced at $0.017, it has already reached 55% of its goal. The tokenomics allocate 50% for presale and 15% for P2E and rewards. YETIO Highlights Details Total YETIO Supply 1 billion (5% burned) Presale Progress 155M tokens sold Audit SolidProof Verified By focusing on utility and carefully structured tokenomics, Yeti Ouro has attracted investors looking for tangible value and promising development prospects. The project's rapid presale success highlights the strong demand from investors. Investment Perspective: ETH's Reliability vs. YETIO's High-Return Potential Ethereum remains a cornerstone for major institutional portfolios, but its growth might be gradual. Analysts from Investing Haven , such as Julian Hosp, predict Ethereum could reach $11,111 by 2030, though a more probable peak for 2025 might be around $6,000. For those seeking practical profit returns, YETIO offers an intriguing, future-oriented opportunity. Additionally, as a token on Ethereum’s blockchain, YETIO benefits from its security and scalability, and ETH’s price rise could enhance YETIO’s visibility. ETH vs. YETIO: The Final Verdict Ethereum’s potential to double hinges on surpassing critical price levels and tapping into technological advancements. Conversely, Yeti Ouro aligns with the rapidly expanding Play-to-Earn (P2E) sector—a $10 billion industry by 2025 —offering a distinctive blend of gaming and tokenomics that curbs supply. While ETH provides stability, YETIO offers a future-enhanced opportunity through its purpose-driven utility. Yeti Ouro presents a compelling option for investors. With a clear roadmap, exceptional development, and practical applications, YETIO is well-positioned to become a leading force in both the crypto and gaming sectors.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Amid the shift toward tokens with real-world utility, Lightchain AI and three other tokens under $0.50 are gaining investor attention. Table of Contents Why 2025 could be the year of strategic investments The tokens to watch in 2025 Conclusion The crypto market is constantly evolving, and while meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) have had their moments in the spotlight, investors are increasingly shifting toward tokens with real-world utility and long-term potential. On that note, Lightchain AI and three other tokens, all priced under $0.50, are gaining attention for the potential for massive growth. Why 2025 could be the year of strategic investments While the crypto market is known for its volatility, experts predict that 2025 could be a turning point for strategic investments. As blockchain technology continues to gain mainstream acceptance and more companies adopt cryptocurrencies, investors who make smart moves could reap huge rewards in the future. One key trend to watch is the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi). This sector has already seen incredible growth in recent years and is expected to continue expanding as it disrupts traditional financial systems. By investing in DeFi projects early on, investors can position themselves for significant gains as the industry takes off. The cryptocurrency market is becoming more stable and attractive to investors with increased regulations and institutional adoption. As major players like PayPal and Visa enter the crypto space, it’s clear that digital currencies are here to stay.

The token is currently valued at around $0.1841. Stellar is dedicated to facilitating fast, low-cost cross-border payments, aiming to connect global financial systems. With a focus on providing financial services to underbanked regions, XLM is trading at approximately $0.3526. These tokens exemplify the diverse applications of blockchain technology, from AI integration and supply chain optimization to digital advertising and global payments. Conclusion While traditional investment strategies may suggest playing it safe, the crypto world rewards those who are willing to take risks and bet on emerging technologies.

39882477,https://nulltx.com/?p=143592,1738612803,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Ripple Price Prediction: Will XRP 10X After SEC Meeting While Plutochain Attracts Whales?,https://nulltx.com/ripple-price-prediction-will-xrp-10x-after-sec-meeting-while-plutochain-attracts-whales/,"The SEC’s closed-door meeting seems to be hinting at a possible resolution to Ripple’s long-running lawsuit. Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could gain attention from whales with its potential to transform Bitcoin. With near-instant transactions, lower fees, and Ethereum compatibility, this Layer-2 solution could solve Bitcoin’s biggest challenges and bring scalability to the network. Here’s a closer look at both projects. Ripple Price Prediction: Can Ripple (XRP) Skyrocket After the SEC Meeting Triggers a Market Shake-Up? As of January 31, 2025, XRP is trading at approximately $3.07, which is a 1.1% increase over the past 24 hours. The RSI is at 47, which puts XRP in neutral territory. The SEC’s closed-door meeting today, January 31, 2025, has caused speculation that Ripple’s long-running legal battle could be nearing a resolution. The meeting’s agenda includes discussions on litigation claims and enforcement actions, which has led many to believe that the case against Ripple might be a key topic. The SEC recently removed references to the Ripple case from its website, meaning a decision could be on the horizon. Steph Is Crypto predicts that XRP has successfully retested its breakout point and could rise to $5 conservatively, with a bullish target of $14. How PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Could Take Bitcoin to the Next Level With Lightning-Fast Transactions, Lower Fees, and Seamless Ethereum Integration Bitcoin remains the most well-known cryptocurrency, but it struggles with slow transactions, high fees, and network congestion. While blockchains like Ethereum and Solana have evolved with scalability solutions, Bitcoin has yet to fully adapt to meet growing demands. As a Layer-2 solution, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is designed to potentially make Bitcoin faster, cheaper, and more versatile. PlutoChain could operate alongside Bitcoin to help ease congestion and improve transaction processing without changing Bitcoin’s core infrastructure. Instead of the standard 10-minute block confirmation time, PlutoChain’s Layer-2 technology may finalize transactions in just two seconds. This dramatic improvement could make Bitcoin a more practical option for everyday purchases, international payments, and microtransactions. Beyond just speed, PlutoChain could significantly reduce transaction fees, which could make Bitcoin more accessible to both individual users and businesses. Lower costs could encourage greater adoption and remove the financial barriers that have historically limited Bitcoin’s use in smaller transactions. Another major advantage of PlutoChain is its interoperability. It is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) , which means Ethereum-based applications —such as DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and AI-driven projects—could seamlessly connect to Bitcoin’s network. This could expand Bitcoin’s role beyond just being a store of value, which could open up new possibilities in decentralized finance and Web3. PlutoChain has already proven its efficiency during testing, successfully processing 43,200 transactions in a single day without any disruptions. Security is also a top priority, with audits conducted by SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi , alongside ongoing code reviews and stress tests to ensure network integrity. Its decentralized governance model gives users the power to propose and vote on key decisions, from protocol upgrades to strategic partnerships. This way the platform remains adaptable and aligned with the needs of its users. With its combination of speed, low costs, cross-chain compatibility, and decentralized governance, PlutoChain could be the solution that finally brings Bitcoin into a more scalable and efficient future. The Takeaway XRP’s future remains tied to the outcome of the SEC’s ongoing legal battle, and today’s closed-door meeting could be a major turning point. Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might generate substantial buzz and draw whale attention as a solution to BTC’s issues. With instant transactions, reduced fees, and cross-chain compatibility, it could redefine Bitcoin’s scalability and usability. – – – This article is not financial advice.

The Chainlink ecosystem has expanded with the launch of Data Streams on Scroll, bringing low-latency market data and making DeFi apps faster and more efficient. Meanwhile, Web3 users are gaining more financial autonomy with LQUID PAY’s non-custodial payment card, which allows crypto spending directly from self-custody wallets. However, the biggest financial opportunities lie in Web3 commerce, and Web3Bay (3BAY) is leading the way. At $0.004562625 per 3BAY in presale stage 4, investors today are looking at a projected 4,200% ROI by launch. Beyond price growth, Web3Bay is built for long-term rewards as the holders earn passive income and users paying with 3BAY token get 5% off every purchase. Chainlink Ecosystem Expands as Data Streams Go Live on Scroll The Chainlink ecosystem just took another step forward with the launch of Chainlink Data Streams on the Scroll mainnet. Scroll, an Ethereum-based zero-knowledge rollup, now gives developers access to the Chainlink ecosystem’s low-latency market data, making DeFi applications faster and more efficient. Scroll has been growing rapidly since its mainnet launch in October 2023, partnering with Ether.fi, Alchemy Pay, and Nansen to strengthen its network. Now, with Chainlink’s oracle infrastructure in place, DeFi apps built on Scroll can offer a user experience rivaling traditional finance, pushing the boundaries of blockchain-powered markets. Web3 Users Gain Financial Freedom with LQUID PAY’s New Card Traditional banking has long struggled to meet the needs of Web3 users, but LQUID PAY is closing that gap with its new non-custodial payment card. Unlike conventional cards that rely on centralized institutions, this Visa-powered solution allows users to spend digital assets directly from self-custody wallets while merchants receive fiat instantly. By eliminating high fees, slow transactions, and crypto compatibility issues, LQUID PAY offers a seamless bridge between blockchain and everyday payments. This is especially crucial in regions where crypto adoption is widespread, yet financial infrastructure lags behind. Huge ROIs & Staking Rewards: Why Web3Bay Is a Passive Income Powerhouse Web3Bay is best known in the crypto market for its role in decentralizing how we sell and buy digital assets. In mere weeks, its presale raised over $1 million with over 257.7 million tokens sold. Three of its presale stages are gone, and stage 4, priced at $0.004562625 per 3BAY token, is nearly sold out—yet those getting in now still have a shot at a 4,200% ROI by launch, with post-launch forecasts aiming even higher. Aside from being an ROI powerhouse, Web3Bay is also built to be a long-term income generator. Web3Bay’s native 3BAY token does more than just help users sell and buy digital assets; it offers transaction discounts, staking rewards, and governance power. For starters, anyone paying with 3BAY gets a 5% discount on purchases—an instant advantage over traditional fiat payments. But the real value comes from staking. Users can lock up their tokens and earn passive income, turning their holdings into a revenue stream while supporting Web3Bay’s ecosystem. Then there’s governance. Unlike centralized platforms where corporations control how we sell and buy digital assets, Web3Bay is fully community-driven. Token holders can vote on decisions that shape the platform’s future—whether it’s adjusting transaction fees, adding new features, or forging strategic partnerships. Ultimately, the more a user participates, the more they earn—and that’s a model traditional marketplaces simply can’t compete with. Key Takeaways Chainlink ecosystem’s latest integration with Scroll proves that DeFi applications can rival traditional finance in speed and efficiency, setting the stage for a more fluid, data-driven blockchain adoption. Meanwhile, LQUID PAY is breaking down barriers between crypto and everyday spending, allowing users to make purchases without relying on centralized intermediaries. But if there’s one project turning blockchain into a wealth-building tool, it’s Web3Bay—a decentralized e-commerce giant redefining how we buy digital assets while maximizing user profits. Beyond its potential 4,200% ROI at launch, Web3Bay offers long-term value through staking rewards, transaction discounts, and community governance. But remember, as with any blockchain project, timing is everything—getting in early on Web3Bay means securing the best prices, the highest ROIs, and the biggest rewards before this opportunity slips away.

The price plummeted over 19% in less than 24 hours, wiping out weeks of gains and sending shockwaves through the crypto market. Investors are now bracing for more volatility, as the bearish momentum could extend into the week ahead. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Must Hold Above $97K To Sustain Momentum – Metrics Top analyst Jelle shared a price chart on X, highlighting that Solana has completely retraced the TRUMP meme coin pump. The rapid decline saw SOL drop as low as $175, marking one of its steepest single-day corrections in recent months. This level is now a critical zone for bulls, as further weakness could expose Solana to deeper losses. With market sentiment shifting drastically from bullish to fearful in just hours, traders wonder if Solana can recover or if another leg down is imminent. The coming days will be crucial as SOL attempts to stabilize and reclaim key support levels to prevent further downside. Solana FacesSelling Pressure But Remains Strong After yesterday’s brutal market selloff, Solana (SOL) has become a focal point for investors seeking strong plays amid the chaos. The entire crypto market plummeted as U.S. trade war fears triggered widespread panic selling. Solana was no exception, dropping over 19% in less than 24 hours. However, despite the negative environment and extreme volatility, long-term price action remains intact, suggesting that Solana could recover faster than most assets once the market stabilizes. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Solana has completely retraced the TRUMP meme coin pump, falling as low as $175 before finding support. Jelle remains optimistic about Solana’s future, stating that its structure is still sound. He highlights that a close above M&W support would confirm another push higher, setting the stage for a strong recovery. According to his analysis, it’s only a matter of time before SOL revisits the $300 level, as long as it holds key structural levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Trades At Discount For The Past Month Signaling Selling Pressure – What This Means With the entire market facing heightened volatility due to macroeconomic uncertainty, this week will be crucial for Solana’s next move. If SOL can reclaim major support levels and break through immediate resistance, a strong recovery could be on the horizon. However, if selling pressure persists, the market could see further downside before a new accumulation phase begins. SOL Holding Above Key Levels Solana is trading at $199 after a small recovery from the $175 low, surging over 13% in the past few hours. Despite the recent bounce, market sentiment remains fearful, and selling pressure could persist throughout the week. Bulls must reclaim key levels quickly to regain momentum and prevent further downside. If SOL wants to confirm a bullish reversal, it must push above the $220 mark in the coming days. This level acted as strong support before the recent breakdown, and flipping it back into support would signal strength. However, given the current market uncertainty, a recovery may take time, and SOL could see more choppy price action before making its next move. The key level to watch on the downside is $189, where the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) currently sits. If SOL loses this level, a deeper correction could follow, potentially leading to a retest of lower support zones. Bulls need to hold this mark to prevent a more extended decline. Related Reading: Chainlink Could Target $30 Once It Breaks Bullish Pattern – Top Analyst For now, all eyes are on SOL’s ability to reclaim critical resistance levels. If the price stabilizes and demand picks up, Solana could be primed for a strong rebound. However, further weakness could extend the correction phase.
