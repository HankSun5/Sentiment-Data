The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyzing five cryptos that could turn $500 to $50,000 with 10,000% growth potential. Table of Contents Catzilla: Dominating meme coins with high potential Raydium: Solana liquidity integrated with Serum DEX Neiro Coin Uniswap’s UNI: Empowering governance in DeFi Jupiter Conclusion In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, certain digital assets are generating buzz for their potential to deliver staggering returns by 2025. These five carefully selected cryptocurrencies could soar, potentially turning $500 into $50,000. Catzilla: Dominating meme coins with high potential In the wild and unpredictable world of meme coins, few newcomers manage to roar as loudly as Catzilla. Inspired by the cultural juggernauts of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE, Catzilla combines viral meme appeal with the promise of unprecedented returns. What truly sets it apart is its creative backbone — a Godzilla-like feline tearing through a Japanese kaiju-inspired storyline. This narrative not only electrifies gamers and anime fans but also captivates investors searching for the next big crypto phenomenon. With a 700% ROI already on the radar, Catzilla’s carefully structured 14-stage presale allows investors to secure early positions as the token price ascends with each stage. Beyond the numbers, Catzilla will deliver on its triple value promise: Epic gameplay: A thrilling game infused with anime and kaiju mayhem, offering players rewards for their engagement. A mission that matters: Rallying the crypto community around fairness and decentralization, Catzilla will channel a rebellious spirit to combat greed and manipulation. An engaged community: Crypto enthusiasts, cat lovers, and anime fans to unite and fuel Catzilla’s meteoric rise. Catzilla is here to disrupt. By embracing its monstrous persona, the token symbolizes a return to the playful, community-driven essence of meme coins. The meme coin will also go further to offer a transparent and equitable ecosystem where every participant has a shot at success. Interested investors can join the Catzilla craze through its presale.

Unlike other automated market makers, Raydium provides on-chain liquidity to a central order book. This means that funds deposited into Raydium are turned into limit orders on Serum’s order books. This allows Raydium’s liquidity providers to access all of Serum’s trading flow and existing liquidity. The native token, RAY, is used for staking to earn fees, receiving allocations in initial token offerings, and participating in governance votes. With its integration into Solana and Serum, Raydium has potential in decentralized finance. Neiro Coin Neiro Coin is a new cryptocurrency that honors Neiro, a Shiba Inu adopted by the woman who owned Kabosu, the famous dog behind the Doge meme. Neiro Coin is entirely owned and managed by its community. The project aims to build on the popularity of the Doge meme and the community spirit. The Neiro Coin has potential for growth. In the current market cycle, its appeal lies in the connection to a well-loved meme and its community-driven approach.

Launched in September 2020, it allows holders to vote on aspects like fee structures and token distribution. Uniswap is a decentralized exchange on the Ethereum blockchain that uses an automated liquidity protocol, enabling trading without an order book and giving users full control of their funds. Its open-source nature and free token listing make it accessible and secure. Currently, Uniswap stands as the fourth-largest DeFi platform with over $3 billion in assets. The UNI token’s potential lies in its governance utility and the platform’s continued growth, making it attractive in the current market cycle. Jupiter Jupiter is a prominent DeFi platform on the Solana blockchain, recognized as the most popular DEX aggregator globally. It pools resources to enable efficient token swaps, futures trading, and decentralized stablecoin management. While originally focused on liquidity aggregation, Jupiter has expanded to include GMX-style perpetual futures and is launching its own decentralized stablecoin to mitigate custodial and regulatory risks. These developments position Jupiter for potential growth within Solana’s ecosystem, indicating that the JUP coin may see significant gains in the current market cycle. Conclusion While RAY, NEIRO, UNI, and JUP each hold unique promise in their respective domains, Catzilla rises as the standout choice for those chasing massive gains. Combining an ambitious 700% ROI presale, a captivating narrative, and a community-driven mission, Catzilla is more than a meme coin — it’s a symbol of financial rebellion and creative ingenuity. With its unique blend of gameplay, fairness, and a bold persona, it offers an opportunity to be part of something bigger.

He criticized Biden’s regulations, credited his father for Bitcoin’s rise past $100,000, and highlighted Bitcoin’s advantages over traditional finance. He promised the Trump family’s continued support for digital assets. Eric Trump, the vice president of the Trump Organization, delivered a powerful speech at the Bitcoin MENA 2024 conference in Abu Dhabi on December 9, after Trump’s victory. Today, @EricTrump shared his views on the significance of #Bitcoin and the role that he and @realDonaldTrump expect it to play in the future. The speech is extraordinary and I highly recommend watching it in full. pic.twitter.com/0WJooTcOvW — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) December 10, 2024 Eric Trump Predicts Bitcoin Eric predicted that Bitcoin would soon surpass the $1 million mark and called it the “cornerstone of a financial revolution.” In his address, Eric described Bitcoin as a “global asset” and stressed its importance in a world increasingly threatened by inflation, political instability, and natural disasters. “Bitcoin is the future of finance,” he proclaimed, emphasizing that its decentralized nature and fixed supply of 21 million coins make it a powerful hedge against the traditional financial system’s inefficiencies. “Bitcoin eliminates the need for tens of thousands of bankers pushing paperwork for exorbitant fees,” Eric added, making a strong argument for how cryptocurrency can simplify global transactions. He also took the opportunity to criticize the Biden administration’s stance on cryptocurrency, accusing it of waging a “war” on the sector through aggressive regulatory measures, particularly the lawsuits filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Eric highlighted the collapse of FTX as a turning point for the industry, noting that the previous administration’s actions had these uncertainties. Trump’s role in Bitcoin “Under my father’s leadership, America will lead the digital revolution,” he declared, receiving loud applause many of whom were sporting “Make Bitcoin Great Again” caps. He credited President-elect Donald Trump with driving Bitcoin’s recent surge past the $100,000 mark, stating, “When Bitcoin hit $100,000, I immediately called my father to share the good news.” He further argued that those who embrace Bitcoin now, including governments and institutions, will be the biggest winners in the digital revolution. “Bitcoin is instantly liquid, borderless, and a global currency,” he said. “It doesn’t rely on traditional banking systems. It’s not subject to corrupt governments.” He added that Bitcoin’s price would continue to climb, eventually reaching $1 million per coin. “A lot more eyes will be open when Bitcoin hits $1 million, and I’m confident it’s going to hit $1 million.” “It’s a shift in how companies like ours receive money,” he explained, referring to the Trump Organization’s involvement in cryptocurrency. Eric promised that the Trump family would remain steadfast supporters of digital assets, ensuring they continue to play a significant role in the global financial landscape.

Once a leader in Bitcoin mining, China banned the practice in 2021 but still contributes around 10% of global mining activity. At the Bitcoin MENA 2024 conference in Abu Dhabi, Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital made a prediction that China will return to Bitcoin mining and likely integrate the digital currency into its reserve assets by the end of 2025. China’s Re-entry into Bitcoin China’s relationship with Bitcoin has been complicated. In the past, the country was the global leader in Bitcoin mining, contributing to over 65% of the global hash power. However, in 2021, the Chinese government-imposed a ban on cryptocurrency mining and trading to limit financial risks and promote its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan. Since then, the ban has majorly impacted Bitcoin’s mining operations, with many miners relocating to more crypto-friendly regions. Though there is a ban, Scaramucci pointed out that around 10% of global mining continues within China’s borders. Scaramucci believes that the U.S.’s increasing approach towards Bitcoin will push other nations, including China, to reconsider their positions on the digital asset. He predicts that by next year, China will not only restart Bitcoin mining but may also add it to its reserves that signaling a potential shift in the country’s approach to digital currency. “By this time next year, the Chinese will be back in the Bitcoin game,” Scaramucci stated confidently at MENA, adding that China’s re-entry with Bitcoin would be strengthen its global economic position. Bitcoin Adoption Trump has promised to create a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve, that the country is stabling for financial stability and resilience. This has encouraged other countries, including Russia and Brazil, where lawmakers are proposing the integration of Bitcoin into their financial reserves as national assets. Scaramucci compares the global adoption of Bitcoin to a “match-selling race,” that no country can afford to ignore the growing trend. “You’re not going to be in a position in the world, in developing economies, where the U.S. is moving towards Bitcoin, and you are not moving towards Bitcoin,” he stated. The concept of strategic Bitcoin reserves has got attention in 2024. Countries like Russia, Brazil are actively considering Bitcoin into its treasury. Even within the U.S., with lawmakers such as Senator Cynthia Lummis advocating for the acquisition of Bitcoin holdings over a multi-year period. Other U.S. states, like Pennsylvania, have also shown interest in allocating Bitcoin. This shows Bitcoin is no longer seen as a speculative asset but a strategic financial tool. S caramucci believes this trend will only accelerate, with Bitcoin becoming an increasingly important asset in global financial portfolios. As the U.S. and other nations explore Bitcoin reserves, China’s re-engagement with Bitcoin could solidify the digital asset’s place in the global financial system. According to Scaramucci Bitcoin reserves and mining, China would regain its role as a major player in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Litecoin Has Continued To Witness Significant Activity Recently In a new post on X, IntoTheBlock has discussed what the various key on-chain indicators have been like for the Litecoin network recently. Below is the infographic shared by the analytics firm. According to the data, there are currently around 370,000 daily active addresses on the Litecoin blockchain. An address is said to be ‘active’ when it participates in some kind of transaction activity on the network, whether as a receiver or sender. Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLing Rewards: Long-Term Holders Selling At 326% Profit The metric’s value basically tells us about the amount of users that are using the cryptocurrency. Another indicator, the daily transactions, provides information about the exact measure of activity that these users are taking part in. At present, LTC users are making 200,000 transactions every day. IntoTheBlock has pointed out that this level of user activity is higher than on other networks like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA). “Much of this activity stems from Litecoin being one of the few cryptocurrencies actively used for payments,” notes the analytics firm. LTC offers cheap and fast transactions, so it has always been a network preferred as a mode of payments. The activity-related metrics continuing to be high (in fact, further growing over the past month) implies this selling point of the chain is still attracting users. Another metric in the infographic that correlates to activity is transaction volume, which keeps track of the daily total amount of USD value that’s being transferred to the network. Impressively, this indicator currently stands at $10.27 billion, which is higher than the coin’s total market cap. While Litecoin is continuing to do well in terms of activity-related metrics, the cryptocurrency has remained stagnant in terms of price growth. A result of this is that just 72% of the addresses on the network are sitting in some unrealized gain. Of course, this still means the majority are above water, but other networks like Bitcoin (BTC) have it close to the 100% mark right now due to the bull run. That said, another way to look at this could perhaps be that Litecoin has more relative room to run, since the risk of a mass selloff goes up the more investors get into profits. Related Reading: Analyst Sets $4.40 XRP Target As 3rd-Straight Bull Pennant Forms It seems that a strong majority of the Litecoin userbase also thinks similarly, as 78% of the 7.94 million Litecoin holders have been HODLing since more than a year. “As one of the older Layer 1 networks still seeing significant usage, Litecoin shouldn’t be overlooked,” says IntoTheBlock. It only remains to be seen, however, whether LTC can finally translate its positive on-chain metrics into price appreciation or not. LTC Price Litecoin has suffered a plunge of around 8% over the last 24 hours, which has taken its price to $113.

Crying Kamala (CRYKAMA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CRYKAMA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Crying Kamala can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crying Kamala could become the next viral memecoin. Crying Kamala launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crying Kamala on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crying Kamala by entering its contract address – 5eCJhSGBUN4YwJHLU9ZcWjrjmoufVznjzNBHfo4TN1P7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRYKAMA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-10 23:06:00

Per Chosun Ilbo , the National Assembly voted in favor of a legal amendment that will delay the launch of crypto tax until January 2027. However, both major parties agreed on the details of this amendment prior to President Yoon Seok-yul’s ill-fated decision to declare martial law on December 3. South Korean opposition leader Lee Jae-myung sought to force through a highly contested budget Tuesday in a show of political clout as he seeks to build momentum for another impeachment bid against President Yoon Suk Yeol https://t.co/g2kIskvpFx — Bloomberg (@business) December 10, 2024 Martial Law Chaos Derails Crypto Progress The media outlet reported that the National Assembly, which is now under heightened pressure to approve next year’s budget, has “moved into full-blown impeachment mode.” The crypto industry is still “waiting for legislative clarity.” But firms are now “braces for another sluggish wait” for change, Chosun wrote. The crypto tax law passed in the very nick of time, gaining approval on the very last day of the current plenary session. The bill had been slated for debate on December 4. Had the Assembly failed to vote on December 10, crypto tax would have launched as scheduled on Janaury 1, 2025. An All-stop Order The media outlet wrote that all “virtual asset-related” issues have now been pushed back in priority. It added that parliamentarians have agreed to an “all-stop” on all crypto-related matters. This means that a number of pressing crypto-related matters will likely remain in limbo until mid-2025. These include: South Korea’s long-standing initial coin offering (ICO) ban, which Yoon promised to “review” prior to his election A decision on whether domestic companies can buy crypto with their balance sheets A decision on securities token offering (STO) legalization, another Yoon manifesto promise A ruling on the legality of Bitcoin spot ETFs The newspaper wrote that all these issues and more “have been buried under the impeachment issue, making it impossible to expect a vote” on any of them. Instead, the National Assembly is “focusing on issues such as martial law, impeachment, and the next presidential election.” LIVE: Thousands of protesters are expected to gather in front of the parliament in Seoul, South Korea https://t.co/p4HiW6AeAs — Reuters (@Reuters) December 10, 2024 A Lifeline for Corporate Crypto Investors? The situation is not completely hopeless for crypto firms, however. The Financial Services Commission has recently “finalized step-by-step guidelines ” for corporate crypto accounts. In theory, it could implement most of these steps without relying on the National Assembly’s help. The newspaper wrote that STO-related discussions would “not progress until the first half of next year,” despite the fact that both parties broadly agree on the matter. Some officers, soldiers resisted martial law orders in their own ways https://t.co/yspytERgLT — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) December 10, 2024 Moving Overseas? An unnamed National Assembly “insider” was quoted as stating: “The martial law crisis has taken all of the National Assembly’s attention. So it is hard to justify dealing with virtual assets now, even though there are many outstanding bills that need work. We should view this as an indefinite postponement. It will last at least until the impeachment situation is resolved.” However, the outlet noted that there are now “concerns” that more domestic “blockchain and virtual asset companies and investors” will “relocate overseas due to the martial law situation.” Dealing with the aftermath of the short-lived martial law in South Korea appears much more complicated that it may seem. #MartialLaw #SouthKorea https://t.co/xZp3Iu5JRB — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) December 10, 2024 Crypto players have urged Seoul to roll out clearer guidelines. But it seems they will be left waiting until mid-2025 for answers. “There is a lot to discuss in the cryptoasset sector. But the current situation is regrettable. In the US, President-elect Donald Trump is looking to appoint people to handle virtual asset policies before he even takes office.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum are grappling with price dips, altcoins like Tron and Celestia are making steady gains, standing out for their innovation and resilience. Tron recently faced a slight dip, but its network activity is off the charts, showcasing its utility in DeFi and NFTs. Meanwhile, Celestia, the modular blockchain pioneer, is riding high on growing adoption and fresh partnerships that signal strong potential for long-term growth. Amid this excitement, Qubetics is carving out its place as the go-to crypto for savvy investors. Qubetics ($TICS) is redefining how crypto can solve real-world problems. Unlike older projects that struggled with usability and accessibility, Qubetics is simplifying crypto for everyday users. With its non-custodial multi-chain wallet, integrations with major financial systems, and an ROI potential of 900% post-presale, Qubetics is poised to revolutionize digital payments. Let’s break down why $TICS, Tron, and Celestia are the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): A Wallet for Everyone Imagine a world where paying with crypto is as easy as swiping your phone for Apple Pay. That’s the promise of Qubetics. Its non-custodial multi-chain wallet eliminates the hassle of traditional crypto transactions. No KYC requirements? Check. Smart contract conversion that turns crypto into fiat at the point of sale? Double-check. Whether you’re shopping online or running a business, this wallet is designed to make life simpler. Take small business owners, for instance. With Qubetics’ wallet, they can accept crypto without worrying about market volatility. The built-in smart contract conversion ensures stable payments, protecting them from sudden dips in value. On the flip side, imagine an everyday user like Sarah, who’s tired of juggling different wallets and platforms. With Qubetics, all her assets are in one place, and she can pay just like she would with a debit card. Currently in its 12th presale phase , Qubetics has already raised over $5.4M, sold more than 303M tokens, and attracted over 8,300 holders. At $0.031 per token, it’s a steal for early investors, especially with a 10% price increase coming next week. Post-presale, the price is set to skyrocket to $0.25, offering massive returns for those who get in now. With its unique features and community-first approach, Qubetics is a no-brainer for anyone looking to invest in the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Tron (TRX): The DeFi and NFT Powerhouse Tron has been around for a while, but it’s not just sitting back and resting on its laurels. The network is bustling with activity, particularly in the DeFi and NFT spaces. Recent data shows a slight dip in TRX prices, but its on-chain metrics paint a different picture. Active wallet addresses are hitting new highs, and transaction volumes are through the roof. Tron’s low transaction fees and lightning-fast processing times make it a favorite for developers and users alike. One of Tron’s standout achievements this year has been its expansion into decentralized storage solutions. Partnering with major platforms, Tron is aiming to be more than just another blockchain. It’s becoming an ecosystem. This focus on utility is why TRX is one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. For investors, Tron offers stability and long-term potential. Analysts predict TRX could break through resistance levels and hit new highs by early 2025. If you’re looking for a reliable altcoin with real-world use cases, Tron deserves a spot in your portfolio alongside Qubetics. Celestia (TIA): The Modular Blockchain Trailblazer Celestia is shaking things up with its modular blockchain architecture. Unlike traditional monolithic chains, Celestia separates consensus from execution, making it highly scalable and efficient. This unique approach has caught the attention of developers and enterprises alike, pushing TIA into the spotlight. Recent developments have bolstered Celestia’s position as a top contender in the crypto world. Strategic partnerships and increased adoption among developers have fueled steady gains in TIA’s price. And while it hasn’t experienced the wild price swings of other cryptos, its consistent growth signals strong investor confidence. Imagine a future where developers can build custom blockchains without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. That’s what Celestia offers. It’s not just a blockchain; it’s the foundation for a whole new way of thinking about decentralized applications. With its focus on scalability and innovation, Celestia is undoubtedly one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 for those seeking cutting-edge tech with long-term potential. Top Cryptos for December 2024 Choosing the right crypto to invest in can be overwhelming, but focusing on projects with strong fundamentals and real-world applications makes it easier. Qubetics ($TICS) stands out for its innovative wallet and massive presale success. Tron (TRX) continues to dominate in DeFi and NFTs, offering stability and growth. And Celestia (TIA) is pioneering modular blockchain technology, making it a top pick for tech enthusiasts and long-term investors. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS), Tron (TRX), and Celestia (TIA) as the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 . Don’t wait too long—these opportunities won’t last forever!

Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) commissioner Hester Pierce calls for the next government to reform the crypto industry, one of them by stopping the bottleneck of government regulations . She noted that the digital asset industry faces obstacles to accessing the services they need. Therefore, she urges the government to stop preventing the crypto industry and start to move forward. The newly-elected government also needs to provide a clear framework for the commission to supervise this emerging industry. Clarity of framework is required to make a clear stance for the regulator and the market. As a regulator, she mentioned that the government should jointly work with the industry to evaluate the existing rules and provide any modifications that are needed. “Work with entities involved in crypto to try to figure out how the existing rules apply and where adjustments need to be made. And that needs to be a group exercise. It needs to be done in the public so that everyone can participate in it. And I think we can get to a good place to do that relatively quickly,” Pierce says on the interview with Fox Business Read more: Why Paul Atkins, Trump’s SEC chair pick, gives crypto a reason to hope again SEC under Atkins’s leadership Pierce, at the same interview, stated that the newly-picked chairman for next year, Paul Atkins, “is very good at thinking about how to use the government efficiently and effectively to solve problems”. She was also not shocked by Gary Gensler’s decision to step down from his position due to the change in the head of government. On Ripple’s lawsuit, Pierce has not replied with any comment yet, but this long process of legal actions, which was already taken by 2020, is the most expensive and inefficient way to regulate.

The partnership will improve the management of tokenized assets and facilitate the exchange between public and private blockchains. It will ensure improved data communication between various blockchain networks. Chainlink and Coinbase Partner To Accelerate Institutional Adoption of Tokenized Assets In a recent statement , Coinbase has stated that it will incorporate Chainlink’s CCIP into its Project Diamond. The integration is targeting to improve the compatibility between different chains in regards to tokenized assets. With CCIP, Coinbase will be able to bridge assets between the public and the private blockchain. Hence, the partnership will make it possible for tokenized assets to be usable across many blockchain networks. Project Diamond, which operates under the regulatory framework of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), is designed to serve institutional investors and asset managers. With this integration, institutions access secure and compliant solutions for their financial transactions. Additionally, the oracle network’s robust data and interoperability infrastructure will address the rising demand for secure on-chain data. This includes market prices, reference data, and key compliance information such as anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) details. Deputy Chief Investment Officer at Coinbase Asset Management, Marcel Kasumovich, commented, “By integrating the Chainlink standard natively into the Project Diamond platform, powered by Coinbase’s tech stack on Base, we’re paving the way for widespread institutional adoption of digital assets.” Enhancing Cross-Chain Functionality The adoption of the oracle network CCIP in Project Diamond is a significant move to ensure that digital assets are not confined to a single blockchain. This protocol enables the transfer and communication of assets across different networks. Johann Eid, Chief Business Officer at Chainlink Labs emphasized, “ “Coinbase’s adoption of the Chainlink standard for the Project Diamond platform underscores the critical importance of solving the end-to-end lifecycle management of tokenized assets.” The recent rumors of the possible collaboration of Chainlink with BlackRock have boosted LINK token price . As institutional investors start experimenting with the integration of blockchain with conventional finance, the prospects of growth have soared. This has boosted the LINK price as investors have increased their faith in the project’s future. Thus, the cooperation with Coinbase further proves that Chainlink aims to become a crucial provider of services for the digital asset market. As more institutions adopt blockchain and more so in the MENA region, the Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) becomes more valuable.

On December 10 the government dispatched 502 Bitcoin , or around $49.42 million, to two platforms, Binance and QCP Capital. Blockchain tracking service Arkham Intelligence says that this is the most current of a scheduled sell-off meant to maximize earnings by leveraging changes in the market. Bhutan sent 402 Bitcoin, which is worth $39.56 million, to Singapore-based QCP Capital in four separate transfers. A short time later, Binance got an extra 100 coins, which were worth $9.81 million. This is the latest in a series of deals like this that started in October. In that time, Bhutan sold a total of 1,696 BTC and made $139 million, with each crypto unit selling for an average of $81,999. A Record November Bitcoin Sale On November 14, 2024, Bhutan made a big sell through Binance, offloading 367 BTC for about $33.5 million. At the same time, the alpha coin hit an intraday high of more than $90,000. This transaction was one of the Bhutanese government’s more lucrative decisions, according to Arkham Intelligence, demonstrating its skill at market timing. Bhutan still holds a sizable amount of Bitcoin—11,688 BTC, or over $1.15 billion—despite these recent sell-offs. Along with the US, China, UK, and Ukraine, the Himalayan monarchy is now one among the top five countries in the world in terms of crypto ownership. Leveraging The Bull Market The current bull market has made it possible for countries like Bhutan and El Salvador to use cryptocurrency for business. El Salvador, for example, has taken advantage of the rise in Bitcoin price to pay for building projects like its ambitious Bitcoin City and to get rid of its debt. Even though it’s not as well known, Bhutan’s approach also focuses on using cryptocurrency as part of bigger economic plans. Market Dynamics And Future Outlook Bhutan’s trades coincide with a more general market downturn in terms of timing. Bitcoin just dropped below the psychological $100,000 mark, falling as low as $94,350 before rising to about $97,000. Analysts believe that after Bitcoin’s significant gain, this decline is a normal correction. The way Bhutan approaches the management of reserves emphasizes how governments may deliberately leverage market developments. Bhutan shows how nations may include digital assets into its economic plans by matching their sales with times of great demand and peak pricing. This calculated use of bitcoin reserves not only generates significant income but also emphasizes the growing importance of digital assets in world financial institutions. Bhutan’s measures could be a model for other governments trying to negotiate this erratic yet profitable environment as the crypto market develops.

Dogecoin (DOGE) is still the meme coin king and Dogwifhat (WIF) is establishing itself in the Solana ecosystem. However, a shift is happening with DTX Exchange (DTX), a hybrid utility token breaking records and hitting $9.99 million in presale, and it is looking good for the crypto space. Dogwifhat (WIF) Stays Strong Despite Market Volatility Dogwifhat (WIF) on the Solana blockchain is a serious meme coin contender. Despite a $5 million liquidation event that spooked the market, WIF is up 39% in the last month and getting a lot of attention from investors. WIF has gotten attention because of the price, the community, and marketing. The WIF community has been promoting the token through viral memes and grassroots campaigns on Twitter and Reddit and getting more engagement and visibility. WIF being on the Solana blockchain makes it a low-fee high-speed alternative to other meme coins for traders frustrated with Ethereum-based networks’ congestion. With community events and potential partnerships teased by the devs, WIF’s ecosystem can grow more and WIF will be a serious player in the memecoin space. The chart shows a descending triangle with mixed short-term momentum. But the $3 support has been getting bought in. If it breaks above $4.83, it could be a bullish breakout, and WIF could go to new all-time highs. Source: CoinMarketCap Dogecoin (DOGE) Still Rules the Crypto World The crypto community still loves Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme coin. Global brands accept DOGE as a payment method, and Elon Musk supports it. In the last month, DOGE has doubled, 391%, since the beginning of the year. On the technical side, an ascending triangle pattern suggests DOGE could rise 18% in the next few weeks to $0.58. Also, whale activity has increased, and big investors recently bought $276 million worth of DOGE, which indicates that they believe in its growth. Source: CoinMarketCap DTX Exchange (DTX): A New Era in Utility Token Investments While meme coins like DOGE and WIF are making headlines, DTX Exchange is changing the game with crypto utility and adoption. Unlike meme coins, DTX is focused on utility-driven innovation, a platform that combines crypto, forex, and stock trading all in one user-friendly ecosystem. DTX Exchange has raised a whopping $9,99 million in presale, and it’s above 50% of the 6th stage. The current token price is $0.12, 7th stage will increase to $0.14. So DTX is not only a proof of demand but also a game changer in the blockchain space. DTX token success is driven by its robust features, Phoenix Wallet for decentralized asset custody, and VulcanX blockchain for high-leverage trading on 100,000+ financial instruments. These features create a unified trading experience for retail and institutional investors. DTX Exchange has an active community of over 160,000 members who are part of the development process. Through governance rights and profit sharing DTX creates a collaborative environment. Also, SolidProof audited the project to give investors more confidence. Memecoins and Utility-Driven Tokens The crypto space is changing, and meme coins like DOGE and WIF are doing well, along with utility tokens like DTX. Memecoins rely on community and market hype, while hybrid tokens like DTX are carving out space by offering real use cases and sustainable growth. DTX Exchange (DTX) is an example of this with its record-breaking presale and solutions; for investors looking for the next big thing in crypto, DTX is positioning itself to be the leader.

The statement came in response to ongoing debates about the role of burns in driving demand for the token. Community Divided Over Token Burns The discussion was raised when the 1 Cent Dream project announced the completion of its second burn campaign of 250 million SHIB tokens. This initiative aimed to decrease the circulating supply and urged the community to participate in future burn events. While some praised the effort, others criticized Kusama and the team for not implementing more significant burns. A notable comment came from a community member, Gunz0369 , who argued that increased burns are essential for attracting new investors and ensuring the asset’s future growth. Kusama’s Response Kusama countered these claims, arguing that Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) recent success proves its performance is not solely reliant on burns. He noted that despite limited burn activity, the token has achieved a remarkable 192% price increase year-to-date, currently trading at $0.00002986. According to Kusama, focusing exclusively on burns overshadows the broader factors contributing to the token’s growth. He emphasized that the token’s ecosystem, including utility, governance, and strategic partnerships, has been instrumental in driving success. Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Layer 2 blockchain, is a key part of this ecosystem and has boosted sentiment and adoption. Kusama also pointed out that expanding the asset’s use cases and completing ecosystem projects will naturally lead to more burn opportunities. By attracting new users and increasing utility, the token’s circulating supply can be reduced effectively over time. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Shibarium’s Role in the Ecosystem Shibarium has sparked debate within the community regarding its impact on token burns. While some users highlighted its contribution to Shiba Inu’s growth, others questioned its effectiveness in reducing supply. Critics argued that Shibarium relies on the token’s success rather than the other way around. Kusama addressed these concerns by explaining that Shibarium is part of a comprehensive strategy to strengthen the ecosystem. Since its launch, Shibarium has facilitated the burning of over 56 billion SHIB through gas fee allocations. Additionally, the burn portal introduced as part of Shibarium has automatically removed more than 300 million SHIB from circulation. Despite these contributions, Kusama emphasized that no single factor, including Shibarium, can be credited for the asset’s overall success. He reiterated that growth stems from the combined marketing, partnerships, and community engagement efforts. SHIB Burn Statistics Since SHIB’s inception in August 2020, over 410.74 trillion tokens have been burned, significantly reducing its initial supply. However, Kusama and other developers focus on long-term strategies rather than relying solely on token incineration. The lead developer encouraged the community to adopt a balanced perspective, recognizing the importance of innovation, utility, and partnerships in driving the token’s value. While token burns remain a topic of interest for supporters, Kusama’s statement underscores the importance of a multifaceted approach to achieving long-term success. By focusing on utility, strategic partnerships, and ecosystem expansion, the asset claims to sustain its growth and enhance its position in the cryptocurrency market.

From Dogecoin’s meteoric rise to Shiba Inu’s staggering community growth, these tokens have proven they’re more than just punchlines—they’re opportunities. Now, the next wave of meme coins is gearing up to dominate in 2025, and one name, BTFD Coin , is already stealing the spotlight. Why? With its P2E (play-to-earn) game, staking rewards, and a rapidly expanding community, BTFD isn’t just another meme coin. It’s here to redefine the space. The buzz surrounding BTFD Coin is off the charts, especially after its presale went live on November 26, 2024. Investors flocked to grab a piece of this rising star, pushing the project through 25% of its presale stages in just 24 hours. Now in Stage 10 and priced at $0.0001, BTFD Coin has already raised over $2.8 million, with 4,200 holders and more than 45 billion tokens sold. Analysts are predicting explosive growth, making this presale one of the most talked-about events in crypto right now. But what makes BTFD Coin one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025? And how do Popcat and Turbo fit into this evolving meme coin narrative? Let’s break it down, starting with the hottest meme token of the year— BTFD Coin. BTFD Coin: The Future King of Meme Coins BTFD Coin (short for “Buy The Freakin’ Dip”) has taken the crypto scene by storm. Unlike most meme coins, which rely heavily on hype and community buzz, BTFD brings real utility to the table. Its play-to-earn (P2E) game is designed to keep users engaged while earning rewards in $BTFD tokens, creating a sustainable ecosystem. Plus, with staking rewards on offer, holders have every reason to HODL their tokens and watch their investments grow. Let’s talk numbers. BTFD Coin’s presale began at $0.000004 per token, and once it’s listed at $0.0006, early investors could see a jaw-dropping 15,000% return. For example, if you had invested $8,000 in Stage 5, where $BTFD was priced at $0.00005, you would’ve snagged 160 million tokens. At the listing price, those tokens would be worth $96,000. That’s a life-changing gain right there. The presale performance alone speaks volumes about the project’s potential. Within just 14 days, it smashed through the $2.5 million mark, and it’s now sitting comfortably at over $2.8 million. The community? Over 4,200 strong and growing daily. With only six stages left in the presale, FOMO (fear of missing out) is real, and for good reason. Analysts are already predicting a surge in $BTFD’s price post-listing, with some speculating it could hit $0.002 or higher by mid-2025. If you’re looking for one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025, this is it. The presale is your golden ticket. Don’t sleep on it. Popcat: The Internet Sensation Turned Crypto Star Popcat, inspired by the viral internet meme of a cat “popping” its mouth, is another meme coin making waves. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Popcat combines meme culture with innovative tokenomics to reward its holders. What sets Popcat apart is its community-driven approach. Every time a user interacts with the Popcat game or spreads the meme online, they earn $POP tokens. It’s like mining, but with memes. Popcat has also been gaining traction for its charitable initiatives. A portion of every transaction fee goes towards animal welfare organisations, which has endeared it to socially conscious investors. And let’s face it—who doesn’t love a good cause? From an investment perspective, Popcat has shown steady growth since its launch. Its initial price of $0.00001 has risen to $0.00008, with analysts forecasting it could hit $0.0005 by the end of 2025. While it doesn’t boast the same explosive presale performance as BTFD Coin, its loyal community and unique use case make it a solid contender. So, should you add Popcat to your portfolio? If you’re all about supporting projects with heart and believe in the power of internet culture, then yes. It’s one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025, especially if you’re in it for the long haul. Turbo: The Speed Demon of Meme Coins Turbo is all about speed—both in its transactions and its rise to fame. Launched as a decentralised meme coin on the Binance Smart Chain, Turbo aims to be the go-to token for quick and cheap transactions. Its ultra-fast blockchain technology and near-zero gas fees make it an attractive option for traders looking to move funds without breaking the bank. What makes Turbo one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025? It’s all in the branding. Turbo has managed to build a reputation as the “speedy meme coin,” and it’s doubling down with strategic partnerships in the gaming and eSports sectors. Gamers can now use $TURBO tokens to purchase in-game assets or participate in tournaments, further integrating the coin into a massive and lucrative market. Since its launch, Turbo has grown its market cap to over $15 million, and its token price has climbed from $0.00002 to $0.00015. While it’s still early days, Turbo’s focus on real-world utility and its thriving gaming partnerships make it a strong contender in the meme coin space. If you’re someone who loves the thrill of fast-paced investments, Turbo might just be your jam. It’s got the potential for big gains, especially as its use case expands in the gaming industry. Conclusion: Secure Your Spot in the Meme Coin Revolution Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that the meme coin space is evolving faster than ever. BTFD Coin, with its presale performance and groundbreaking features, is leading the charge, while Popcat and Turbo bring their own unique strengths to the table. If you’re serious about future-proofing your portfolio, now’s the time to act. The BTFD Coin presale is still ongoing, but it’s already in Stage 10, with prices set to rise as it approaches its final stages. Don’t miss your chance to get in early and ride the wave of one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and be part of the next big thing in crypto. Opportunities like this don’t come around every day. Are you ready to secure your spot?

Crypto King Musk (MUSKKING), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKKING is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Crypto King Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crypto King Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Crypto King Musk launched with over $7,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crypto King Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Crypto King Musk by entering its contract address – v2jWiNpR1m8gHARdM39GosZ8muaxZpowpBgWgWTSCev – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKKING. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-11 00:02:00

At press time, DOGE price was trading at $0.3934, a 6.15% decline from the 24-hour high. Amid this dip, whales have been actively transferring large amounts of DOGE, fueling speculation about a potential price rally. Dogecoin Whale Activity Triggers Rally Speculation In the past few hours, large transfers of Dogecoin have caught the attention of market participants. According to Whale Alert, over 61 million DOGE, worth approximately $23.5 million, were transferred from an unknown wallet to the Robinhood platform. This was followed by another transfer of nearly 85.4 million DOGE, valued at around $32.9 million. These large transactions come amid heightened market interest and could signal significant developments for the price of Dogecoin. Whale movements are often viewed as indicators of potential market shifts, particularly when such large sums are moved to exchanges. Traders and investors may be watching these transfers closely, speculating whether they signal the beginning of a price rally. As larger market participants move their positions, volatility in Dogecoin’s price could increase, leading to potential price swings in the coming days. Will DOGE Price Surge to $3? Several analysts are keeping a close eye on Dogecoin’s price action amid these large whale transactions. Ali Martinez, a crypto analyst, recently stated that Dogecoin is still in the early stages of its bullish cycle. He points to a potential price rise to $3 during the current bull run, with long-term projections suggesting a rise to as high as $18. Martinez bases his prediction on the weekly chart’s regression channel, which suggests that DOGE still has room for upward momentum. However, he acknowledges that the market could face some fluctuations before these price levels are reached. Despite the recent decline in Dogecoin’s price, analysts are optimistic about its medium-to-long-term prospects. Source: Coinglass However, DOGE’s open interest dipped by 12%, and its derivatives trading volume decreased by 10%, signaling a slight reduction in market activi Technical Breakout Sparks Renewed Optimism Technical analysis has also been pointing to a potential breakout for Dogecoin. Trader Tardigrade, another crypto analyst, notes that DOGE price has recently broken out of a Symmetrical Triangle pattern, which often signals a bullish trend. Following this breakout, the price of Dogecoin has not experienced a significant pullback, suggesting that the upward momentum may continue. If Dogecoin retraces to the upper boundary of the triangle at around $0.44, like it has done today, it could present a buying opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the next leg of the rally. Tardigrade suggests that the price could eventually reach $0.65, marking a potential 50% rallyfrom the current levels. Further, he predicts that DOGE might peak within the range of $8 to $10 before a possible retracement, which could provide another entry point for long-term investors. Moreover, from its current price of around $0.39, a rally to $3 would represent a significant increase of 630%, making it an enticing prospect for investors looking to capitalize on Dogecoin’s growth potential.

It’s a little like turning a meme into a serious investment strategy—a perfect combination of internet culture, community vibes, and lucrative returns. The beauty of meme coins lies in their volatility, their cultural relevance, and the potential for sky-high returns if you get in early. Today, we’re focusing on some of the hottest options in the meme coin world: BTFD Coin, Notcoin, and Book of Meme. These are the names driving buzz, excitement, and opportunities for massive returns as we step into the upcoming year. But what’s especially exciting is BTFD Coin’s presale performance , which has been nothing short of phenomenal. The project recently raised a staggering $2.8 million in record time, proving its appeal among retail investors and crypto enthusiasts. Since its presale launch, over 45 billion BTFD Coins have already been sold, and its community—dubbed the Bulls Squad—continues to grow rapidly with more than 4,200 members already invested. With this kind of momentum, BTFD Coin could very well lead the pack when it comes to the best meme coins for significant returns. Ready to explore these meme coin powerhouses? Let’s dive into each one and discover their unique charm, potential growth opportunities, and why they could soon make you the next crypto success story. BTFD Coin: The Presale Phenomenon with Serious Momentum BTFD Coin is undoubtedly riding the wave with its incredibly strong presale numbers and loyal community backing. With its ethos based on “Buy The Dip” (BTFD) and the belief in embracing market opportunities at their lowest points, this meme coin is as much a movement as it is a token. The energy behind BTFD Coin is electric. This isn’t just another meme coin floating in the wind—it has a roadmap, a community-focused ethos, and massive utility potential. From staking rewards (offering up to 90% APY) to its exciting P2E game features , BTFD Coin is setting itself up for long-term sustainability and profitability. Now let’s talk about strategy. If you were to invest $40,000 into BTFD Coin during this presale, your returns could potentially be astronomical. Here’s how: Tokens purchased at the current price: 400,000,000 BTFD tokens (based on $0.0001 per token) Expected price in 2025 (predictions suggest $0.0006): 400,000,000 tokens x $0.0006 = $240,000 Imagine turning $40,000 into $240,000. That’s the kind of ROI that would make even the most seasoned investors sit up and take notice. With this kind of growth trajectory and strong backing, BTFD Coin deserves your attention as one of the best meme coins for significant returns. The bottom line? This presale has the hype, the stats, and the community behind it. If you’re looking to position yourself in a rising meme economy, BTFD Coin is your best bet. Notcoin: Poised for Growth in the Meme Space Next up is Notcoin, a rising star that has steadily gained traction thanks to its unique position and investor support. Notcoin has proven to be a fascinating blend of meme culture, utility, and investor enthusiasm. It’s all about leveraging engagement in a way that’s entirely community-driven and innovative. Currently priced at $0.007744, Notcoin has been steadily climbing, with analysts projecting that it will maintain this bullish trend through early 2025. Some estimates place its potential price at $0.020672 by the end of 2025, signalling massive upside potential for long-term holders. What’s exciting about Notcoin is its approach to decentralised finance through gamified user interaction. You can think of Notcoin as the currency that merges meme appeal with utility, gamification, and community-driven projects—a perfect reflection of today’s DeFi trends. Book of Meme: Meme Culture Meets Binance for a Bright Future Let’s not overlook Book of Meme, another strong contender for the best meme coins for significant returns. This unique project combines meme culture with blockchain innovation by capturing the essence of internet humour and decentralised finance. Its recent debut on Binance only highlights its legitimacy and the growing demand for meme-based tokens that bridge online culture and crypto utility. Book of Meme operates as a way to reward the memes that drive virality and engagement online. Investors, meme lovers, and DeFi enthusiasts are already flocking to its ecosystem, thanks to its clever design, its adaptability, and its goal of incentivising meme creation and sharing. Since being listed on Binance, it’s been going up and down, reaching $0.020672 today. What’s more, it’s expected to rise to $0.022737 by next year’s end. But if that isn’t satisfactory, long-term holders can expect greater returns by 2030, with the price reaching an estimated $0.033332. Final Thoughts: These Meme Coins Are the Real Deal The meme coin market is electric, filled with volatility but offering exciting opportunities. If you’re aiming for best meme coins for significant returns, BTFD Coin, Notcoin, and Book of Meme represent the top contenders. BTFD Coin continues to show remarkable presale numbers with over $2.8 million raised, while Notcoin is innovating with gamification and meme-driven utility. On the other hand, Book of Meme’s Binance debut further solidifies its position in the meme economy. With opportunities like these, it’s all about timing, strategy, and FOMO.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Altcoins, including DOGEN, could be primed for massive growth, with predictions of up to 5,000% gains by Christmas. Table of Contents DOGEN: An alpha meme token capturing the crypto scene Cardano to soar as altseason approaches Avalanche eyes $62 resistance Polkadot on the brink of major breakout Kaspa: Potential surge above $0.22 resistance Conclusion While Bitcoin and Ethereum grab most of the spotlight, some overlooked cryptocurrencies are showing immense potential. These five select altcoins are poised for massive growth, with predictions of high values by Christmas. DOGEN: An alpha meme token capturing the crypto scene DOGE, SHIB, and FLOKI — the real alpha is here, DOGEN. Built for the strongest, boldest, and most fearless holders, DOGEN is the ultimate meme token for taking over the market. It’s not for the faint-hearted — it’s for those with the guts to chase greatness and the drive to win big. Frogs can leap away because DOGEN is here with the intention to rule. This Solana-powered beast has advanced from day one, with a 700% surge expected in the coming months. DOGEN also aims for thousand-fold gains that will redefine what meme tokens can achieve. Notably, DOGEN rewards its hardcore believers with an exclusive airdrop. Joining in is simple: Flex social media game, grab tokens during the presale, and recruit new members to the DOGEN army with a referral link. Every recruit earns their recruiter 20% of the golden points from the token buys. DOGEN’s referral system is as alpha as it gets. Investors also earn 7% from every token their direct recruits (1st level) buy using their referral code. As such, the more recruits, the bigger the rewards. As the altseason approaches, DOGEN holders could be among the ones leading the charge. DOGE is set to be a ticket to an exclusive community of winners to will enjoy luxurious campaigns, killer perks, and the best deals in the game. DOGEN is more than a token — it’s a lifestyle. Posh cars, stacks of cash, and unforgettable experiences are just the beginning for DOGEN holders who refuse to settle for less. Interested investors can join the DOGEN presale to flex hard and potentially earn big . Cardano to soar as altseason approaches Cardano currently trades between $1.06 and $1.33, showing stability despite a slight 0.43% drop over the past week. Impressively, it has surged over 157% in the last month and more than 171% over six months, reflecting strong upward momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 34, nearing oversold territory, which hints at a possible upward swing. If ADA breaks past the nearest resistance at $1.46, it could aim for the next target at $1.73, marking a substantial increase from current levels. With the altcoin season on the horizon and bullish market sentiments rising, ADA has significant potential to climb higher. Avalanche eyes $62 resistance Avalanche is moving within the $47-$58 range, with a 76% gain over the past month. The token’s price is nearing the resistance level at $62. A break above this could see it reach the next resistance at $73, representing a significant increase from current prices. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are both around $52, indicating a period of consolidation. The RSI is below 40, suggesting the coin is not overbought. With a low stochastic value, there is potential for further upside movement. The MACD is nearly flat, hinting at a possible trend reversal. AVAX may be set for a breakout as the altcoin market gains strength. You might also like: Dogen poised to overtake Dogecoin: 5,000% rally anticipated as whales join the frenzy Polkadot on the brink of major breakout The Polkadot price has shown impressive growth over the past month, surging by over 125%. The coin is currently trading in the range of $8.66 to $11.90, with strong potential to test the nearest resistance level at $13.40. Polkadot’s RSI and Stochastic indicators are in oversold regions, suggesting a bullish reversal soon. If the token breaks through this resistance, it could aim for the next level at $16.64, marking significant gains from current prices. With the anticipation of an altcoin season and a global crypto bull run, Polkadot stands poised for substantial growth in the near future. Kaspa: Potential surge above $0.22 resistance Kaspa is showing strong signs of growth. In the past month, its price has increased by over 61%. The current price range hovers between $0.16 and $0.20, sitting above the 100-day simple moving average of $0.17. The RSI at 44.86 suggests the coin is not overbought. With the nearest resistance level at $0.22, a breakout above this could see the price target the next resistance at $0.26. This would represent a potential gain of over 30% from current levels, with the bullish momentum supported by a 6.8% rise over the past week.. Conclusion Although ADA, AVAX, DOT, and KAS may have limited short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as a standout, designed for those who seek the best in life. Inspired by successful predecessors, it aims to build a community of leaders and offer real benefits, including exclusive campaigns and perks for early adopters.

This decision follows a plea agreement between former CEO Alex Mashinsky and United States prosecutors. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams requested the Southern District of New York’s District Court to delay Cohen-Pavon’s sentencing until after Mashinsky’s, which is set for April 2025. Williams highlighted that Cohen-Pavon’s testimony and shared information could significantly determine Mashinsky’s sentence. Judge John Koeltl approved the request, officially postponing the sentencing hearing. While granting the request, Judge Koeltl ordered both parties to report to the court on April 18 for an update. This will be ten days after Mashinky’s sentencing. The judge will likely make a sentencing to Cohen-Pavon on this date. Cohen-Pavon had earlier pleaded guilty to four counts of felony charges. Mashinsky’s agreement to plead guilty changed the proceedings While everything seemed to have fallen into place for Cohen-Pavon, Mashinsky’s agreement to plead guilty has altered the flow. On December 3, Mashinsky agreed to plead guilty to two charges as part of a deal with prosecutors. If the Judge gives a maximum sentence to the two charges, Mashinsky could spend up to 30 years in prison on both charges served consecutively. Cohen-Pavon and Mashinsky were indicted in July 2023. They were accused of misleading Celsius users to maximize profits by manipulating prices. When the two were indicted, Cohen-Pavon was not in the US, and he had pleaded not guilty by then. However, when he was finally arrested in September 2023, he pleaded guilty to several charges. Among the listed charges were conspiracy to commit price manipulation, wire fraud, manipulation of security prices, and securities fraud. Despite pleading guilty to these charges, Cohen-Pavon had never been sentenced, as he was scheduled for sentencing on December 11. Cohen-Pavon might Influence Mashinky’s sentencing Most people following the case wonder how Cohen-Pavon’s information to the court could sway the Judge’s consideration during Mashinsky’s sentencing. The former CEO pleaded guilty to misinforming users about Celsius’s approval from US regulators and not selling his CEL token holdings. As part of his plea deal, he was open to forfeiting $48 million in proceeds from the scheme. While awaiting his sentencing, Cohen-Pavon has been enjoying foreign travels freely. He was allowed to return to Israel from New York after posting a bond worth $500,000. Judge Koeltl also allowed him to travel to Singapore in September. The period coincided with the Token 2049 crypto conference in Singapore, leading to speculations of his attendance. Celsius went bankrupt in 2022. By then, it was a top crypto platform that had collapsed due to a market downturn. Most users lost their money locked in their accounts, leaving them in anguish. The investors were relieved in November when a Bankruptcy judge approved a reorganization plan for Celsius, making it possible for debtors to distribute about $2 billion to the platform’s creditors. The company indicated that they will begin repaying customers by next year. While the Celsius case is still active, these executives won’t be the first to face jail time in the crypto space. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried went through the legal process and was jailed. Besides, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao served his term in prison. The two were facing different charges.

Amid this correction, bearish tendencies among investors on Binance have surfaced. A recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost highlights a significant trend where Binance’s taker buy-sell ratio for Ethereum turned “sharply negative” at the $4,000 mark. This suggests that traders on the exchange have predominantly adopted a selling stance. Related Reading: Sell Pressure Rises As Ethereum Tests $4,000 Resistance—What’s Next For ETH? Ethereum Tug of War According to Darkfost, the bearish sentiment on Binance has persisted since the start of November, coinciding with Ethereum’s approach to this critical resistance level. The analyst pointed out that while this bearish sentiment could typically signal a potential reversal, Ethereum’s price movement has defied seeing high bearish inclination, driven by other influential factors. Notably, demand for Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) has surged, showcasing a growing institutional interest that continues to support Ethereum’s price action. The surge in demand for Ethereum ETFs signals a shift in market stance where institutional players increasingly influence price movements. Institutional interest, evidenced by consistent inflows into Ethereum-focused investment products seems to have been pivotal in offsetting the selling pressure observed among retail traders on Binance. ETH Market Performance And Outlook So far, Ethereum has seen a significant correction in its price decreasing to as low as $3,616 as of today. At the time of writing, the asset currently trades at a price of $3,621 down by nearly 6% in the past day. Notably, this price performance has unsurprisingly dropped the asset’s market cap by over $40 billion, falling from over $490 billion seen last week Friday to $434 billion today. Interestingly, despite this price decrease, Ethereum’s daily trading volume has seen an opposite trend rising from below $60 billion on December 6 to now at $72 billion. Given the current market condition, it is likely that the increase in ETH’s volume is coming from sell-offs.

According to data from Coinglass, in the past 24 hours , 526,828 traders were liquidated with the total liquidations coming in at $1.58 billion. Out of this total liquidations, ETH accounts for roughly $234.72 million. Long liquidations dominates reaching $208.83 million. Short traders also had their share losses registering $25.89 million worth of ETH liquidations. Regardless of this, analysts are still optimistic about Ethereum, suggesting that the current price dip is quite “healthy” for ETH’s market. $ETH remains strong in HTF!#Ethereum weekly healthy correction will be left behind as a RETEST and pumped hard! https://t.co/o78x8eBucf pic.twitter.com/YSixFqjuLQ — EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL 💹🧲📈 (@EtherNasyonaL) December 10, 2024 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",Ethereum|altcoin|crypto|crypto market|ETH|ethereum|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-11 00:30:16

Here’s What Is Next",https://timestabloid.com/rlusd-wins-regulatory-approval-ripple-ceo-confirms-heres-what-is-next/,"Ripple has achieved a significant milestone as the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) granted final approval for its stablecoin RLUSD. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the development via Twitter, confirming that exchange and partner listings for RLUSD would soon be available. He further emphasized that updates regarding the stablecoin’s launch will be communicated directly through Ripple’s official channels. The approval marks a pivotal step for Ripple. It positions RLUSD to make a meaningful impact in the growing stablecoin market. Stablecoins, digital assets pegged to stable financial instruments such as fiat currencies, are gaining traction as a transformative force in the payments sector. Ripple’s RLUSD aims to capitalize on this trend by offering a secure, regulated, and scalable solution for businesses and consumers. Ripple’s Vision for RLUSD In a recent interview with CNBC, Ripple President Monica Long highlighted the company’s ambitions for RLUSD . Long described the stablecoin market as a high-growth sector with significant potential. Currently valued at approximately $1 billion, the global stablecoin market is projected to exceed $3 trillion in the coming years. Long attributed this anticipated expansion to the increasing adoption of stablecoins for payments and cross-border transactions. Long also emphasized the critical role of regulatory compliance in ensuring the success and stability of RLUSD. Ripple’s collaboration with the NYDFS to finalize its trust application underscores its commitment to adhering to regulatory standards. According to Long, regulatory clarity is essential for fostering trust and broader adoption of stablecoins in the financial ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Reaction and Implications The announcement of NYDFS approval for RLUSD has generated significant market excitement. Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, XRP, saw a 6.72% increase in value, trading at $2.37 within the last 24 hours. This uptick reflects growing investor confidence in Ripple’s ability to innovate and expand its influence in the digital payments space. RLUSD’s launch is expected to enhance Ripple’s product offerings, particularly in its enterprise-focused payment solutions. By providing a stable and regulated digital asset, Ripple aims to streamline cross-border transactions, reduce costs, and improve efficiency for businesses worldwide. Additionally, the RLUSD launch could bolster Ripple’s competitive edge against other stablecoins, such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), by leveraging its regulatory approval and reputation for transparency. Broader Industry Impact The approval of RLUSD by a stringent regulatory authority like the NYDFS sets a benchmark for the stablecoin industry. It demonstrates the importance of proactive engagement with regulators and adherence to compliance requirements in launching digital financial products. Ripple’s approach could be a model for other blockchain companies aiming to integrate stablecoins into the broader financial system.

There are already projections that the XRP price could spike to $100, and when this happens, Dogecoin (DOGE) will settle at $7. However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , a new AI-based crypto token, is sparking higher FOMO as it is slated for a 30,000% rally to $5.2. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Raises Investors’ Anticipation As It Sets Itself For A 30,000% Pump Even with the positivity around XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE), WallitIQ (WLTQ) is gaining more attention for its revolutionary crypto wallet that maximizes the strength of artificial intelligence (AI) to the fullest. Additionally, the way this platform uses AI and machine learning (ML) tools to ease crypto management and support smart investment is definitely a significant draw. It’s no wonder speculations are pointing to a possible 30,000% pump for its WLTQ token to $5.2. Currently, the WLTQ token is selling for $0.0243 after completing its initial presale stage, where it rose by 42% from $0.0171 and garnered over $2 million. Now, WallitIQ ( WLTQ ) is undergoing its newly commenced Stage 2 presale but is already nearing a $500,000 revenue milestone, indicating its potential for fast-paced growth in the DeFi and AI crypto market. Besides its presale performance, WallitIQ’s unique features are another reason analysts are optimistic that the WLTQ will surge 30,000% to $5.2. For starters, WallitIQ (WLTQ) boasts an automated portfolio rebalancing — a feature that enables optimal asset relocation in real-time, thereby mitigating risks and enhancing ROI. The platform also offers a Scan QR to Pay feature while using AI to effectively detect anomalies and provide predictive analysis, helping its users make smart investment decisions. Furthermore, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers top-notch security, user-convenient interface and multilingual AI chatbots. According to analysts, this innovation is one of the vital catalysts that will spark a 30,000% rally for WallitIQ’s token, potentially outperforming XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE). WallitIQ (WLTQ) is already listed on CoinMarketCap, with a few DEX listings awaiting its token when its presale elapses. This is poised to attract significant attention to its wallet-based platform which has top security features like an advanced Escrow Connect and biometric authentication systems to ensure close security on users’ assets. XRP Price May Hit $100 And Spark A $7 Rise For Dogecoin (DOGE) The XRP price has been on one of the most shocking, yet impressive journeys in the past month. Despite its legal issue, the XRP price pulled out of its sluggish phase as it priced above its long-standing $0.5 range to hit $2 a few days back. Now, the XRP price is held in a weekly range of $1.46 – $2.82, and it is showing potential to hit $100 in due time. With the XRP possibly approaching the $100 price mark, Dogecoin (DOGE) is also expected to settle around $7, aligning with the momentum of the XRP price. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price has shown over 150% pump in the past week while receiving positive momentum. Should the XRP price hit $100, it wouldn’t be surprising for Dogecoin (DOGE) to also take a leap to $7 from its current $0.4 price mark. Either way, investors are closely watching the XRP price as it maintains bullishness. Conclusion While XRP appears to be on a bullish run, its projected price target of $100 seems highly improbable compared to WallitIQ (WLTQ) , reaching $5.20. For XRP to hit $100, its market capitalization would need to soar to an unrealistic $5.2 trillion. In contrast, WallitIQ’s strategic positioning in the AI market and its SolidProof- audited smart contract will attract significant traction, potentially rallying its price by 30,000%. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) token is currently going for a low price of $0.0243. However, it won’t stay at this price for long. The platform is set for another price shift to $0.0420 in stage 3, giving investors a remarkable 72% profit. So, Invest in WallitIQ (WLTQ) now while it’s still in presale. According to analysts, with its one-of-a-kind features and immense growth potential, the value of WLTQ tokens is sure to surge by an impressive 30,000% and hit $5.2.

In a new strategy session, Cowen takes a look at the MVRV Z-score, which compares the market cap of BTC to the value of each coin the last time it was moved to gauge whether Bitcoin is undervalued, overvalued, or at fair value. Cowen notes that in the past, market cycle tops have occurred when the MVRV Z-Score hits a certain range. “Historically, market cycle tops for Bitcoin have corresponded to an MVRV Z-Score somewhere between seven to 10, at around seven to 10. In fact, the first cycle top, the MVRV Z-Score topped out at around 7.68. The last one topped out at around 7.15. And you can see the ones in between went even higher. Again, right now, the MVRV Z-Score high for this cycle is 3.29, but this is another metric that certainly could be useful in helping to confirm whether a high corresponds to a market cycle top or if that true euphoric sentiment is there, or if we just think it’s there. That’s kind of the thing about back in March 2024, it felt like the market was overheated, and it was, we got a mid-cycle top. But, a look at this chart would have helped to suggest that it was not in fact, a market cycle top. So I do think this is another chart that we can put in our toolkit to help us better navigate Bitcoin.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube At time of writing, BTC is trading at $96,253.

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address – C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-11 01:24:09

Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, in his X post on Dec. 11, stated that MicroStrategy (MSTR) would like to be added to the Nasdaq 100 index on Dec. 23, the announcement set to be on Thursday. This development came after the company issued more financial bonds and senior notes to institutional investors in the United States in order to acquire more Bitcoin ( BTC ) in the future. He also expects the company to enter the S&P 500 index by next year, which is considered difficult by some analysts to achieve in the near future. “$MSTR is likely to be added to $QQQ on 12/23 (w/ announcement coming 12/13). Moderna likely to get boot (symbolic). Below is best guess of adds/drops. Likely a 0.47% weight (40th biggest holding). There’s $550b of ETFs tracking the index. S&P 500 add next yr prob,” Balchunas says James Seyffart, another Bloomberg ETF analyst, also stated that the odds for MicroStrategy to enter the S&P 500 are rising after the Nasdaq 100. He projects that this move could bring net buying of at least $2.1 billion, or equal to one-fourth of daily trading volume, in shares by ETF to follow.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. NVIDIA millionaire bets on Solana rebound as DTX Exchange eyes 55,000% gains with a $10M presale. Table of Contents Solana price consolidates as volume drops DTX Exchange stuns with $10 million presale performance Conclusion November’s surging volumes and prices made many people rich. However, at the end of the month, the market corrected as Bitcoin and XRP holders adjusted their holdings, leading to many coins stumbling. Every upcycle has proven that the highest gains are in projects with strong community support and high user utility. One such project that is picking up community support is DTX Exchange (DTX). DTX Exchange has a promising ICO with huge growth potential. In addition to its growth prospects, DTX’s expected impact on the crypto trading scene has made it a solid altcoin to watch out for. Solana price consolidates as volume drops Solana’s price dropped 4% in the daily charts, currently trading around the $214 region. This fall has been attributed to increased selling pressure as investors look for profit realization. The SOL market cap is down by 1.43% to $102.3 billion, and its market volume is also down by 7.5% to $8.916 billion. However, Solana’s long-term prospects remain strong. With its strong ecosystem and developer support, the Solana price correction will probably end in the next crypto market rally. While the negative news about SOL ETFs being rejected may have lowered Solana’s price, many investors are waiting for the incoming SEC Chair, Paul Atkins, before they give up on Solana ETFs. Nonetheless, astute investors are consolidating their holdings. DTX Exchange stuns with $10 million presale performance The DTX Exchange brings a new perspective to trading with a platform that will allow users to trade cryptos, forex, equities, and contract-for-differences (CFDs). While the basic processes might be similar to other exchanges, DTX seeks to redefine crypto trading with its sophisticated infrastructure and trading features. DTX Exchange’s presale is selling out faster than many other altcoins in their pre-sales, raising $10 million in Round 6. The platform has also successfully launched its signature products, such as Phoenix Wallet and VulcanX blockchain. DTX’s current selling price of $0.12 will increase to $0.14 in the next round, suggesting high returns for early investors. Conclusion Solana has undoubtedly been among the most successful DeFi projects with its high blockchain utility and a vibrant ecosystem. However, the recent ETF news has caused some pessimism for SOL holders, shown by their interest in exploring Layer-1 alternatives that crack into top rankings. DTX’s core appeal lies in its hybrid platform, which can link traditional and digital finance. The exchange will enable multi-asset trading across equities, cryptocurrencies, and forex, with strict compliance standards. The presale value of $10 million has left experts in shock, crowning DTX Exchange an emerging DeFi giant as it moves towards stage 7.

The St. Kitts and Nevis national from America told Carlson his arrest wasn’t about tax fraud charges, but political persecution, noting of the Department of Justice: “They can get you if they want you.” Early bitcoin startup investor and passionate freedom advocate Roger Ver, also known as “Bitcoin Jesus,” could face 109 years in prison if extradited from Spain to face trial in the U.S. As Ver noted in his recent interview with political commentator Tucker Carlson, that would probably mean dying in prison. And for what? He feels the charges are politically motivated , having nothing to do with alleged tax fraud the state says Ver committed both before and after he was a U.S. citizen. “More than a decade after I had already renounced my U.S. citizenship, and just a couple of weeks after I had published a book on the hijacking of bitcoin, how it no longer works as peer-to-peer cash for the world … right after my book gets published that exposes how people claiming to work for intelligence agencies hijacked bitcoin to do that … suddenly I get arrested and tossed in jail in Spain,” Ver told Carlson early in the video interview. Roger Ver sat down with American political commentator Tucker Carlson to talk about his ongoing battle with the U.S. legal system. Ver renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2014, after an earlier run-in with the American justice system and the ATF (ostensibly for selling firecrackers online) landed him in prison for 10 months. Ver believes that this event was also politically motivated, after he made cutting criticism of the U.S. government while running for office in California in 2000. In the interview Ver is on the verge of tears as he brings up the tragic murder of innocent Americans in Waco, Texas in 1993: “Even if the parents were religious nuts, the ATF and the FBI literally burnt to death everybody in their home there and then posed for photos on top of the corpses of little kids. That sort of thing is not okay,” Ver stated. “In the debate with the republican and democratic candidates, I called the ATF a bunch of murderers that they are for having done that, and boy did they not like that,” Ver emphasized to Carlson. He then became the only person in the world to be prosecuted for selling the particular brand of firecracker he was shipping on Ebay, even though major retailers and others were also selling it. Ver was arrested in Spain shortly after the release of his book, Hijacking Bitcoin. BTC hijacked, Zano and Monero may sustain economic freedom Roger’s new book, Hijacking Bitcoin: The Hidden History of BTC, details how the blocksize wars (disagreement on how and whether to scale BTC amongst developers and community members), potential infiltration by state intelligence agencies, and outright propaganda have rendered what is currently known as Bitcoin as an impotent, merely speculative asset. This is in stark opposition to what Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto wanted, as the bitcoin whitepaper states it was designed to be a permissionless, electronic cash. “And in the early days everybody knew bitcoin was supposed to be money for the world, bitcoin was supposed to be used for payments as peer-to-peer cash for the world, and that’s how people were using it,” Ver told Carlson, before explaining how advocates for small blocks began creating propaganda to sway opinion, the CIA took interest, and forums on Reddit and elsewhere were blatantly censored and shut down via DDoS attacks. Throughout the exchange, Carlson repeatedly hammered home the idea that bitcoin is not private (almost as if there was an agenda to turn people away from crypto), and then asked Ver his thoughts on the matter, and whether Bitcoin can be made private. Interestingly Ver did not mention the CashFusion privacy protocol on Bitcoin Cash , which he views as the original and “real” bitcoin, but did bring up privacy coins and networks like Zano and Monero. Zano was one privacy coin Roger Ver mentioned in the interview. “It sounds like your ideological commitment is overriding your financial interests,” Carlson said at one point in the interview. Ver responded: “It’s not even close for me.” Ver described how certain protocols are much better for economic freedom than BTC held on centralized exchanges, which is worse privacy-wise than even a normal bank account. “Luckily there’s other cryptocurrencies out there that do give people more privacy, so there’s things like Monero which most people are now using if they want some privacy … There’s another one called Zano that allows anybody to create their own privacy token in which nobody can see what’s going on,” Ver explained, continuing: “And if you really want to get the three-letter agencies upset, or governments upset, there’s a project called Confidential Layer, which is creating a bridge from Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum onto Zano.” In Ver’s view, with people using money the state cannot control, permissionlessly, the government won’t be able to fund wars, or massacres like at Waco, nearly as easily. “It’s a wonderful thing when government loses the ability to control people’s lives,” Ver noted. And while Bitcoin Jesus did lament at one point that “they can get you if they want you” by cooking up bogus tax charges, the first bitcoin startup investor doesn’t seem to be backing down in the face of their violent threats.

37486587,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51859,1733882303,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,The Rise of Web 3.0: A New Era of the Internet,https://timestabloid.com/the-rise-of-web-3-0-a-new-era-of-the-internet/,"The internet has evolved dramatically since its inception. From the early days of static web pages in Web 1.0 to the interactive and social platform era of Web 2.0, we are now entering the era of Web 3.0 . This transformation is revolutionizing how we interact with digital content, services, and communities, promising greater autonomy, security, and personalization for users. What is Web 3.0? Web 3.0, often referred to as the decentralized web, is built on blockchain technology and aims to create a more user-centric internet. Unlike Web 2.0, which is dominated by centralized platforms like social media giants and cloud service providers, Web 3.0 focuses on decentralization, transparency, and user control. Imagine an internet where you own your data and digital identity without relying on intermediaries. Whether it’s financial transactions, gaming, or content creation, Web 3.0 allows for peer-to-peer interactions secured through blockchain. For example, users engaging in online entertainment, such as kazino online , benefit from enhanced privacy, secure payments, and provably fair systems—a fundamental shift from traditional centralized platforms. Key Features of Web 3.0 Decentralization Unlike its predecessors, Web 3.0 relies on decentralized networks. Data is stored across multiple nodes instead of centralized servers, reducing vulnerabilities like hacking and censorship. This ensures a more secure and resilient system where no single entity has complete control. Blockchain Technology The backbone of Web 3.0, blockchain technology provides a transparent, immutable ledger for transactions and data exchanges. Whether for cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, or tokenized assets, blockchain ensures trust and accountability among users. AI and Machine Learning Web 3.0 integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to provide personalized experiences. For instance, AI can analyze user behavior to suggest tailored content, products, or services without violating privacy, as the data remains decentralized and encrypted. Semantic Web The semantic web enables machines to understand the meaning of data, facilitating more accurate searches and interactions. This enhancement creates a seamless digital experience, whether you’re looking for a specific product or exploring complex topics. Ownership of Digital Identity With Web 3.0, users have complete control over their digital identities. This is made possible through decentralized identifiers (DIDs), which allow individuals to authenticate themselves securely across platforms without sharing sensitive information. Web 3.0 in Everyday Life The practical applications of Web 3.0 are already shaping various industries, and its potential seems limitless. Here are some examples of how Web 3.0 impacts everyday life: Finance and Banking Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms are at the forefront of Web 3.0 innovations. They allow users to trade, lend, or borrow assets without traditional banking intermediaries. This accessibility opens financial opportunities to people worldwide, even in underbanked regions. Gaming and Entertainment Blockchain-based games and online entertainment platforms are redefining the gaming experience. Players can own in-game assets, trade them as NFTs (non-fungible tokens), and engage in fair, transparent gameplay. Similarly, platforms for online casinos ensure users’ funds and transactions remain secure and transparent. Content Creation Web 3.0 empowers creators by enabling them to monetize their content directly. Platforms like decentralized streaming services or NFT marketplaces ensure artists and writers retain ownership of their work while receiving fair compensation. Supply Chain Management Blockchain technology brings transparency and efficiency to supply chains. Companies can track products from origin to delivery, ensuring ethical sourcing and minimizing fraud. Healthcare Decentralized health records give patients control over their medical history. They can share access with healthcare providers as needed, ensuring privacy and eliminating duplicate records. The Challenges Ahead While the promise of Web 3.0 is exciting, there are challenges to overcome before it becomes mainstream. Scalability Blockchain networks currently face scalability issues, with slower transaction speeds and higher costs compared to traditional systems. User Adoption The transition to Web 3.0 requires users to adapt to new technologies like crypto wallets and decentralized applications (dApps). This learning curve may delay widespread adoption. Regulatory Uncertainty Governments and regulatory bodies are still figuring out how to govern blockchain-based systems. Striking a balance between innovation and regulation will be crucial for Web 3.0’s success. Energy Consumption Blockchain networks, especially those using proof-of-work consensus mechanisms, consume significant energy. The move towards more sustainable models like proof-of-stake is critical for minimizing environmental impact. The Future of Web 3.0 Web 3.0 holds the potential to redefine the digital landscape, transforming the way we interact with technology. As blockchain technology evolves and becomes more efficient, its adoption across various industries is expected to accelerate. For users, this decentralized web promises greater empowerment—whether through enhanced financial freedom, secure interactions, or full ownership of their digital presence. For businesses, adapting to this paradigm shift will require embracing decentralized models and prioritizing transparency to stay relevant. In the next decade, Web 3.0 could become as integral to our lives as Web 2.0 is today. From decentralized finance and personalized AI-driven platforms to innovations like the metaverse, the future of Web 3.0 is shaping a digital world where users regain control of their online interactions. With providers like Wordscloud crafting insightful and accessible content , the journey to understanding and adopting Web 3.0 becomes clearer for businesses and individuals alike.

The analyst further explained why XRP could hit double digits in this market cycle following this development. Weekly Bull Flag Appears On XRP Price Chart In an X post, Dark Defender stated that a weekly bull flag has now appeared on the weekly XRP price chart. He noted that this bull flag had earlier appeared on the daily chart when XRP was at $0.70, as the crypto targetted the $1.88 price level, which it eventually rallied to. With this bull flag on the weekly, the crypto analyst predicted that XRP could rally to double digits. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bull Run: Analyst Reveals Why BTC Will Hit Its Top A Month From Now Below $150,000 His accompanying chart showed that the XRP price could rally to as high as $11 as it breaks out from this bull flag. XRP is expected to hit this price target in early 2025, between January and March. Dark Defender cautioned market participants that there will surely be some sideways price movement. However, the crypto analyst expects the ultimate targets to stay the same. Based on Dark Defender’s previous analysis, the $11 target is unlikely to be the market top for the XRP price, as the crypto analyst predicted that the crypto could rally as high as $18 in this bull run. For now, XRP continues to trade sideways, just as he warned that the crypto would do. The crypto had recorded a parabolic rally last month, recording a price gain of 281%. However, the XRP price has cooled off this month as it consolidates for its next leg up. Dark Defender previously highlighted $2.13 and $2.27 as key support levels to watch out for as XRP ranges. Meanwhile, the analyst mentioned $3.9 and $5.5 as the next targets XRP could reach on its next leg up. An “Optimistic” Target For XRP In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez stated that $48.12 is an “optimistic” target for the XRP price. Meanwhile, he highlighted the $8.40 price level as a conservative target for XRP. These predictions came as the crypto analyst remarked that the crypto looks undervalued after breaking out of a massive multi-year symmetrical triangle, which he highlighted on the chart. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Prediction: Here’s What The 91-Day Pattern Says Could Happen Next Meanwhile, in another X post, he revealed that the XRP price has formed three consecutive bull pennants on its 4-hour chart. Based on this, Martinez stated that market participants should hope for a retest of $2.25 so they can buy the dip, with XRP targeting $4.40 on its next leg up. A rally to $4.40 will mark a new all-time high (ATH) for XRP. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.18, down over 11% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Unlike its predecessors, Qubetics bridges the gap between crypto and everyday life with a focus on solving real-world problems. Currently in Presale Phase 12, with strong community support and significant growth potential, Qubetics is shaping up to be a game-changer.

Post-presale, $TICS is expected to hit $0.25, offering a massive ROI of 900%. For those seeking the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, Qubetics is a no-brainer.

That’s Chainlink in action, and it’s why LINK remains one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Chainlink’s recent partnerships are also worth noting. By collaborating with traditional financial institutions, LINK is cementing its role as a critical component in the future of blockchain technology.

As the DeFi space continues to grow, so will the demand for Chainlink’s oracle solutions.

From DeFi to NFTs, SEI is branching out into every corner of the space, offering a flexible and efficient platform for decentralized applications.

This Best Crypto to Buy in December 2024 Can Make You Rich,https://timestabloid.com/failed-to-join-the-solana-train-to-wealth-this-best-crypto-to-buy/,"The crypto market never sleeps, and December 2024 is proving to be a pivotal month for investors. Solana (SOL), often hailed as Ethereum’s faster and cheaper competitor, has made headlines with its rapid growth and adoption over the past few years. From NFTs to DeFi, Solana has been at the forefront of blockchain innovation. But if you feel like you’ve missed out on Solana’s meteoric rise, you’re not alone. Its early investors have already cashed in big, leaving many wondering, “What’s next?” Enter Qubetics ($TICS), a groundbreaking Web3 aggregator designed to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and real-world usability. Unlike earlier projects that promised the moon but couldn’t deliver, Qubetics is tackling tangible problems with innovative solutions. With its focus on real-world asset tokenisation, privacy, and decentralisation, it’s shaping up to be the best crypto to buy in December 2024. Let’s dive into what makes Qubetics and Solana stand out—and why $TICS might be your ticket to 2025 wealth. Qubetics ($TICS): Real-World Solutions with Web3 Innovation Qubetics isn’t just another coin hoping to ride the crypto wave; it’s a complete ecosystem designed to make blockchain technology more accessible and practical. One of its most exciting applications is Real World Asset Tokenisation (RWAT). Imagine owning a fraction of a high-value asset like real estate or fine art without the headache of legal paperwork or geographical restrictions. With Qubetics, asset tokenisation becomes as easy as trading stocks, giving everyday people access to investment opportunities once reserved for the ultra-wealthy. Think about small businesses or freelancers. A freelance photographer in New York could tokenise their equipment, allowing investors to support their growth in exchange for returns. Meanwhile, a coffee shop owner in London might tokenise their operations to expand their business without relying on traditional bank loans. Qubetics enables all of this with its Decentralised VPN and multi-chain wallet, ensuring secure and private transactions for all users. And the numbers don’t lie. Qubetics is currently in Presale Phase 12, with $0.0311 per token. Over 303M tokens have already been sold, raising $5.4M and counting. With the next phase set to increase the price by 10%, early investors stand to gain significantly, especially as the post-presale target price of $0.25 hints at a jaw-dropping 900% ROI. Why did this coin make it to this list? Qubetics isn’t just a crypto; it’s a gateway to financial opportunities for people from all walks of life. Its real-world applications and presale momentum make it a no-brainer for investors looking for the best crypto to buy in December 2024. Solana (SOL): The Blockchain Speedster Solana has been one of the standout performers in the crypto space over the past few years. Known for its blazing-fast transaction speeds and low fees, it’s a favourite among developers building decentralised applications (dApps). Whether it’s NFTs or DeFi, Solana has proven it can handle high traffic without breaking a sweat. Recently, Solana has seen significant adoption in gaming and metaverse projects, further solidifying its reputation as a scalable blockchain. Despite the occasional hiccup—like network outages—it remains a strong contender for long-term growth. Analysts are bullish on Solana, predicting its price could hit new all-time highs in 2025 as more projects and users flock to its ecosystem. But while Solana has been a fantastic investment for early adopters, its price has already climbed substantially. The real question is whether it can sustain this growth or if it’s reaching its peak. Why did this coin make it to this list? Solana’s unmatched scalability and ecosystem make it a compelling option for investors. Even if you missed its early days, it’s still one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 for those seeking steady growth. Qubetics vs Solana: Which One Should You Pick? Both Qubetics and Solana have a lot to offer, but they cater to different kinds of investors. If you’re looking for a project with a proven track record and a bustling ecosystem, Solana is a solid choice. Its partnerships and adoption rates speak volumes about its potential to remain a key player in the blockchain space. On the other hand, Qubetics offers something unique: untapped potential. It’s not just about speculation; it’s about solving real-world problems. Whether it’s asset tokenisation, decentralised finance, or online privacy, Qubetics is setting the stage for widespread blockchain adoption. And let’s be honest, with its presale price of $0.0311 and a target of $0.25, the upside is hard to ignore. The best strategy? Diversify. There’s no reason you can’t invest in both projects to balance your portfolio with a mix of stability (Solana) and explosive growth potential (Qubetics). If you missed out on Solana’s early days, don’t worry—it’s still a fantastic investment with plenty of room to grow. But if you’re looking for something that combines innovation with massive upside potential, Qubetics is the best crypto to buy in December 2024 . With its real-world applications and impressive presale momentum, it’s shaping up to be the next big thing in crypto. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS) and Solana (SOL) as top picks for December 2024. Don’t wait—secure your financial future today!

Crying Kamala (CRYKAMA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CRYKAMA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Crying Kamala can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crying Kamala could become the next viral memecoin. Crying Kamala launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crying Kamala on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crying Kamala by entering its contract address – 5eCJhSGBUN4YwJHLU9ZcWjrjmoufVznjzNBHfo4TN1P7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

As the inaugural major global cryptocurrency event in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, the summit attracted many prominent figures, including Eric Trump, the second son of President-elect Donald Trump; Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ); Marwan Alzarouni, CEO of Dubai Blockchain Center. The event provided a platform to explore the future of cryptocurrencies and discuss key industry opportunities. Justin Sun , Global Advisor of HTX and Founder of TRON , and Charmaine Lim, Head of VIP Client Services at HTX, also attended the summit and spoke about the current state of the cryptocurrency industry and future trends. Their participation underscores HTX’s focus on the MENA cryptocurrency market and signals its commitment to deepening its global strategy. Meanwhile, by collaborating with global crypto entrepreneurs and communities, the exchange aims to accelerate the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies. At the “The Great Debate: Bitcoin vs. Crypto” session, Justin shared his insights on the relationship between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He noted that Bitcoin’s core narrative is its role as a store of value, emphasizing the importance of security and decentralization to reassure its holders. As such, the best approach for Bitcoin is to maintain its current status. This might limit innovation but ensures stability. To pursue innovation and explore cutting-edge consumer technology, people can do so through other blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Justin attributes Bitcoin’s breakthrough of the $100,000 mark to advancements in cryptocurrency technology. He explained, “Tether once issued stablecoins on the Bitcoin Omni Layer, but the platform’s slow transaction speeds hindered its growth. However, USDT on TRON enables instant transactions, meeting the needs of users. Technological advancements have also benefited Bitcoin. The growing popularity of stablecoins has led to increased capital flowing into Bitcoin, further solidifying its role as a store of value.” “Every cryptocurrency holds its significance. Take Ethereum or TRON for example. Their value is easy to understand because millions of people use them daily. Then there are meme coins, whose value might not be immediately apparent. However, from DOGE to SHIB to PEPE, the meme coin market has grown significantly. Thus, I believe that cryptocurrencies are much like art in a museum. You might not understand every exhibit, just like you might not comprehend why a banana is worth $6 million. What you need to do is to keep learning as cryptocurrencies continue to evolve.” Justin remarked. Charmaine Lim, Head of VIP Client Services at HTX, stated during a roundtable discussion titled “Improving Access to Bitcoin in the UAE” that the country has made notable progress in promoting the adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies since 2015. Despite these advancements, challenges persist, such as the cautious approach of certain banks toward cryptocurrency transactions, insufficient public education about cryptocurrencies, and regulatory uncertainties. These factors hinder the growth of the crypto sector in the UAE. Charmaine noted that HTX has secured the Provisional Approval for the Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from Dubai’s VARA and is currently applying to upgrade it to a full VASP license. The platform is also taking proactive steps to collaborate with local banks in establishing a streamlined fiat-to-cryptocurrency transaction channel. Charmaine added that HTX will provide global users with learning opportunities on subjects such as crypto trading, storage, and security through HTX Live and online workshops. The platform will also continue to expand language options, including offering Arabic support, to enhance the user experience. Furthermore, Charmaine suggested that the UAE government create a favorable environment for crypto businesses by establishing a clear regulatory framework, streamlining the license application process for service providers, offering tax incentives to blockchain companies, and expanding the current regulatory sandbox to accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrencies in the country. From Blockchain Life, Cardano Summit, to Bitcoin MENA, HTX’s frequent appearances in the UAE throughout 2024 underscore its keen interest in the cryptocurrency development potential of the Middle East and North Africa region. By offering innovative products and fostering strong partnerships with local stakeholders, HTX aims to accelerate cryptocurrency adoption and regulatory compliance in this region. Moreover, with the global crypto market continuing to boom, HTX will expand its business footprint worldwide while fostering innovation and the application of crypto technology, thereby contributing to the building of a more accessible Web 3.0 ecosystem.

Tuesday’s crash saw altcoins bleeding heavily while Bitcoin held its ground, dipping only to $94.3K before buyers stepped in. But resilience doesn’t equal immunity—macro factors are looming large over the market. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has been strengthening, closing Tuesday at 106.38 (+0.22%), and Wednesday’s CPI report could set the tone for next week’s FOMC interest rate decision. With geopolitical uncertainties bubbling under the surface and fears of economic slowdowns still haunting investors, this is no time for complacency. Bitcoin ($BTC ) sits at a crossroads, and the next moves in the market may decide whether bulls regain control or a deeper correction unfolds. Source: coinmarketcap.com In this article, we’ll revisit the key levels and scenarios from my previous CryptoDailypieces, examine how Bitcoin and top altcoins like $XRP , Solana , and Dogecoin have performed during this turbulent week, and map out what to watch for in the days ahead. $XRP: Resilience Hinges on $1.91 Support Link to $XRP XRP has been a focal point of the market, riding high from its parabolic rally to $2.91, only to crash 34.5% to a low of $1.91 during Monday’s flash crash. This low perfectly aligned with the Golden Pocket (0.618 Fib) and a critical Fair Value Gap ($1.96–$2.20), providing a high-confluence area for institutional buyers to step in. Currently, XRP has rebounded to $2.38, reclaiming the 0.382 Fib retracement and suggesting a potential recovery toward $2.50–$2.65. However, the broader trend hinges on holding $1.91 as support, with a stop loss below $1.50 to account for volatility. If XRP loses these levels, a drop to $1.28–$1.29 (0.786 Fib), a deep liquidity zone, becomes the next likely target. With XRP only retracing 34.5% from its yearly highs, this correction appears lightweight—so far. For bulls, reclaiming $2.65+ (higher high) is key to resuming its uptrend, while BTC’s stability will play a crucial role in its trajectory. $SOL: Golden Pocket Holds the Line Link to $SOL Solana continues to show relative strength, with Tuesday’s crash bringing it down to $203, just above the Golden Pocket ($198–$200). This level, highlighted in the article, remains critical for Solana’s bullish structure. Despite the dip, Solana has only retraced 23% from its yearly high (and the new ATH) of $264, a minor correction in the bigger picture. The current price action sees SOL trading at $215, attempting to reclaim its 0.382 Fib retracement at $221. A break above $237—a critical resistance zone and former ATH level from March—would set the stage for a retest of $264. However, failure to hold above $198 could see Solana dropping to the $181–$182 re-buy zone (0.786 Fib), a deep liquidity area that aligns with November’s accumulation phase. For now, Solana’s resilience hinges on BTC holding the $90K–$91K zone, as any broader market weakness would likely push SOL lower. $DOGE: Key Rectangle Support Holding (For Now) Link to $DOGE Dogecoin’s volatility remains intact, with Tuesday’s crash testing the $0.365–$0.375 Accumulation Zone for the third time. This level held firmly with a significant volume spike, confirming the rectangle pattern ($0.37–$0.48) as a key structure. DOGE has only corrected 24.5% from its yearly high ($0.48+)… a modest dip compared to most altcoins. However, the breakdown of its ascending channel, combined with resistance at the Golden Pocket ($0.41–$0.425) and the $0.42 horizontal level, adds pressure on bulls to reclaim momentum. If DOGE loses its rectangle support at $0.365, a sharp drop to the $0.25 liquidity zone becomes likely, especially if BTC revisits $90K or lower. On the flip side, reclaiming $0.42 could reignite momentum toward the rectangle’s upper boundary at $0.48, with the next major target being the breakout zone at $0.60. $BTC: Mid-Range Support Faces a Test Link to $BTC Bitcoin demonstrated resilience during Tuesday’s crash, dipping to $94.3K before recovering with significant volume spikes. The $95K mid-range horizontal support held firm, keeping BTC within a broader consolidation range. However, BTC’s loss of the 50MA on the 4H chart and the breakdown of its symmetrical triangle add caution. The triangle’s target aligns with the $90K–$91K zone, a make-or-break level for the market. A failure to hold this zone risks a cascading drop to the Golden Pocket ($79.5K–$83K), the ultimate dip-buying opportunity for long-term bulls. For upside potential, BTC must reclaim the 50MA ($96K) and break above $99K, opening the door to the $107.5K pennant target and psychological resistance at $110K. With BTC only retracing 6% from its yearly high, this correction remains shallow—so far. Summary This week’s crypto crash showcased Bitcoin’s resilience as it held the $94.3K support, while altcoins suffered steeper corrections. However, with geopolitical uncertainties, a strengthening Dollar Index (DXY), and Wednesday’s CPI data adding to the tension ahead of the FOMC rate decision, the next moves will be crucial. Altcoins like XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin remain within key structures but are highly sensitive to Bitcoin’s performance. If BTC loses the $90K–$91K zone, a deeper correction to the Golden Pocket ($79.5K–$83K) could be on the cards, dragging the broader market lower. On the other hand, reclaiming $96K and pushing above $99K could reignite the bull run. For now, the market remains in limbo—watch these levels and stay sharp. Bulls may win December, but they’ll need to earn it. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Right now, XRP is stuck between support at $2 and resistance at $3, with a bearish trend until a breakout happens According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, XRP might be forming a “bull flag” pattern, which often signals that the price could rise. To confirm this pattern and see a price increase, XRP needs to break above the resistance at around $2.53 to $2.54. If it can move past this point and ideally clear the $2.62 level, we could see a more bullish trend in the short term. Price Target and Potential Gains If XRP breaks through this resistance, the next price target could be around $5, which would be a 100% gain from the breakout point. However, in the short term, XRP is facing some bearish pressure, and the price is moving slightly down. Until the breakout happens, it’s hard to expect upward movement. However, if the breakout occurs, the outlook could quickly turn bullish. XRP vs. Bitcoin: Reaching a Local Top Looking at the XRP/BTC chart, XRP has reached a key resistance level against Bitcoin. As expected, XRP has faced a strong rejection at this point. This suggests that XRP might not outperform Bitcoin much in the short term, as Bitcoin is likely to lead in price movement. XRP’s Performance in the Next Few Weeks While XRP could still rise in value against the US dollar, it’s unlikely to do much better than Bitcoin in the next few weeks. Bitcoin is likely to lead, and XRP may not see the same level of performance as it did in the past month. However, if the overall crypto market goes into a bull run, XRP could eventually break through its resistance and perform better in the longer term.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-11 02:55:28

Source: CoinShares Bitcoin ( BTC ) continues to be the top asset, pulling in $2.55 billion of inflows. The positive flows in Ripple ( XRP ) and Litecoin indicate a broad allocation of capital across digital assets. Ethereum experienced its largest weekly inflow year-to-date at $1.2 billion. In comparison, $14 million in capital flowed out from Solana ( SOL ), reflecting a shift in focus among investors.

Total assets under management across digital asset investment products now amount to $165 billion as a result of the new inflows. Crypto boom as Trump’s popularity on the rise The massive momentum the crypto market is witnessing is likely due to two major events. President-elect Donald Trump has appointed venture capitalist David Sacks as the first-ever White House AI and crypto czar , a part of his strategic push to make the U.S. the global leader in cryptocurrency innovation. Sacks will be tasked with making rules and crafting laws for both AI and crypto, as well as chairing the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology. Another reason is Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s support for BTC. On Dec. 5, Powell said that BTC is deemed as a competitor for gold, not the dollar, at DealBook Summit 2024.

Crypto King Musk (MUSKKING), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKKING is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Crypto King Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crypto King Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Crypto King Musk launched with over $7,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crypto King Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Crypto King Musk by entering its contract address – v2jWiNpR1m8gHARdM39GosZ8muaxZpowpBgWgWTSCev – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKKING. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-11 03:11:00

Điều này đánh dấu mức tăng 111% so với mức thấp nhất vào mùa hè dưới 50.000 USD. Tuy nhiên, sau cú bứt phá ngoạn mục này là một đợt điều chỉnh giảm mạnh 14,84% , bao gồm cả cú giảm nhanh 10% chỉ trong vòng tám phút — mức giảm mạnh nhất từ đỉnh cao nhất mọi thời đại kể từ đợt bán tháo trước cuộc bầu cử. Đợt điều chỉnh này đã kích hoạt hơn 1,1 tỷ USD bị thanh lý, trong đó 419 triệu USD là từ các vị thế mua Bitcoin, cho thấy mức độ sử dụng đòn bẩy cao trên thị trường. Mặc dù biến động mạnh, nhưng các dấu hiệu ổn định thị trường đang dần xuất hiện. Chỉ số Lợi nhuận thực hiện , từng đạt đỉnh 10,5 tỷ USD mỗi ngày, đã giảm xuống còn 2,5 tỷ USD, giảm bớt áp lực bán. Tỷ lệ lãi suất hợp đồng tương lai cũng đã trở lại bình thường, báo hiệu mức độ đòn bẩy đầu cơ đã giảm. Và mặc dù dòng vốn ETF vào chậm lại một chút vào cuối tuần trước, nhưng chúng vẫn là nguồn hỗ trợ quan trọng trong bối cảnh những người nắm giữ dài hạn tiếp tục chốt lời. Khi Bitcoin dậm chân tại ngưỡng 100.000 USD, triển vọng trung hạn vẫn tăng giá, và với việc tỷ lệ tài trợ bình thường hóa và áp lực bán giảm, đà tăng có thể sẽ tiếp tục, miễn là dòng vốn ETF tiếp tục chảy vào. Dữ liệu kinh tế Mỹ mới nhất tuần trước cho thấy một số kết quả trái chiều, nhưng nhìn chung cho thấy nền kinh tế tiếp tục có vẻ phục hồi. Tháng 11 chứng kiến nền kinh tế đang tạo ra nhiều việc làm mới , với 227.000 việc làm được bổ sung, vượt mức kỳ vọng dù có sự gián đoạn từ các cơn bão tháng 10. Tuy nhiên, tỷ lệ thất nghiệp tăng nhẹ lên 4,2% cho thấy sự dịch chuyển lực lượng lao động vẫn còn kéo dài. Tuyển dụng tháng 10 tăng vọt lên 7,74 triệu chỗ trống, cho thấy nhu cầu lao động vẫn ở mức cao, mặc dù số lượng nhân viên được tuyển dụng thực tế lại chậm lại, phản ánh sự thận trọng của các nhà tuyển dụng trong bối cảnh kinh tế còn nhiều bất ổn. Trong khi đó, lĩnh vực dịch vụ đã đánh dấu tháng tăng trưởng thứ 51 liên tiếp trong tháng 11, mặc dù với tốc độ chậm hơn, với PMI ở mức 52,1, được hỗ trợ bởi chi tiêu tiêu dùng mạnh mẽ và tăng trưởng tiền lương. Áp lực lạm phát vẫn tồn tại, nhưng việc giảm bớt tắc nghẽn chuỗi cung ứng và kỳ vọng cuối năm mạnh mẽ cho thấy sự ổn định. Khi Cục Dự trữ Liên bang đánh giá các thay đổi trong chính sách tiềm năng từ chính quyền mới sắp tới, nền kinh tế vẫn được neo giữ bởi thị trường lao động kiên cường và nhu cầu tiêu dùng ổn định. Tuy nhiên, sự phục hồi không đồng đều giữa các lĩnh vực báo hiệu cần phải lạc quan thận trọng. Tuần trước, Hàn Quốc chứng kiến một đợt bùng nổ giao dịch tiền điện tử , với 34 tỷ đô la được ghi nhận chỉ trong vòng 24 giờ trên các sàn giao dịch lớn của nước này. Điều này xảy ra sau khi Tổng thống Yoon Suk-yeol tuyên bố thiết quân luật. Bất ổn chính trị đã gây ra các đợt bán tháo hoảng loạn và sự cố gián đoạn nền tảng, làm nổi bật sự nhạy cảm của thị trường đối với bất ổn địa chính trị. Sàn giao dịch phá sản Mt. Gox cũng đã chuyển 2,4 tỷ đô Bitcoin sang một ví mới, đúng vào lúc Bitcoin lần đầu tiên vượt mốc 100.000 đô la. Và Grayscale đã tham gia vào cuộc đua đầy cạnh tranh để ra mắt quỹ ETF Solana , bằng cách nộp đơn chuyển đổi Quỹ ủy thác Solana của mình khi giá SOL tăng mạnh. Những sự kiện này cho thấy sự tương tác năng động của các yếu tố chính trị, quy định và lịch sử đang định hình bối cảnh tiền điện tử đang phát triển. Và đó là những tóm tắt từ Bitfinex Alpha số 134.

ETH is now consolidating and might aim for a move above the $3,750 resistance zone. Ethereum started a downside correction below $3,780 and $3,750. The price is trading below $3,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,740 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).

Speaking at the Bitcoin MENA 2024 Conference, Scaramucci predicted that China would likely establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve in 2025. Scaramucci Predicts China Will Follow the US Bitcoin Strategy The former White House Communications director predicted that China would return to BTC mining after years of a blanket ban. In addition, the American stated that China will also likely create a BTC strategic reserve next year, following in the footsteps of the US. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Plunge To Multi-Year Lows: Will BTC Gain From Supply Crunch? Scaramucci attributed this potential shift to the pro-crypto stance of the US, driven by the victory of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in the November election. He believes the US’ new regulatory framework for digital assets will pressure other nations to establish similar frameworks. He added that China may have its own Bitcoin strategic reserve by next year. Further, the Asian giant might reconsider the ban on Bitcoin mining and use it as a tool to mine and accumulate more BTC. Scaramucci said: China, there is no way, and I’ll bet money on this, that if the US is moving toward a strategic Bitcoin reserve, that the Chinese are not going to participate. It is worth highlighting that last month, Scaramucci stated that BTC will trade as high as $176,000 in the next two years. He pointed toward a strong demand for BTC and its limited supply of 21 million as major driving factors that could increase the asset’s price in the coming years. Countries Looking To Create BTC Strategic Reserve To recall, cryptocurrency was one of the major themes of President-elect Trump’s election campaign. Since Trump’s victory, speculations surrounding a national BTC strategic reserve have found increasing support from people across different domains. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Track To Replace Gold In 10 Years, Trading Firm Predicts While countries like El Salvador already maintain national Bitcoin reserves, the US creating a similar reserve could have significant global implications. Experts predict that such a move could propel Bitcoin’s price to over $1 million. The US isn’t the only country considering a national Bitcoin reserve. In Brazil, federal deputy Eros Biondini recently introduced legislation establishing a Sovereign Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to diversify the country’s financial assets. Similarly, Russian State Duma Deputy Anton Tkachev has proposed the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This initiative aims to reduce Russia’s reliance on foreign currencies like the USD and yuan for international trade and help mitigate the impact of international sanctions. Establishing a Bitcoin strategic reserve by any major country could trigger a domino effect, prompting others to follow suit. This trend has already been observed among corporations, such as Metaplanet and Hut 8, that have adopted MicroStrategy’s approach of adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. BTC trades at $95,344 at press time, down 1.8% in the past 24 hours.

Caroline Crenshaw, who’s been a commissioner since 2020, is up for renomination. President Biden backs her, but not everyone’s on board. The crypto industry, in particular, has made it clear they want her out. Let’s explore why crypto world does not want to see Crenshaw SEC renomination. A Term Extension That Sparks Controversy If confirmed, Crenshaw’s new term would run through June 2029. That’s a big deal. Originally appointed by President Trump, Crenshaw’s record includes a strong stance on crypto regulation. She’s called the crypto market a “petri dish of fraudulent conduct.” And she supports SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s tough oversight. Her views have drawn criticism, especially from the crypto world. One example? She’s been vocal against approving Bitcoin spot ETFs—a move many in the industry want. This has fueled a major lobbying effort to block her renomination. Crypto Industry Hits Back Hard The opposition isn’t subtle. Leading figures in crypto have turned to social media to criticize Crenshaw. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong even called her a “failure.” That’s a strong word, but it shows how high the stakes are. Beyond Twitter, groups like the Cedar Innovation Foundation and crypto trade associations have funded ad campaigns to sway public opinion. They’ve also sent letters to lawmakers urging them to reject her nomination. Source : X.com What’s more, the Stand with Crypto ratings could make things tricky for senators. These ratings track political support for pro-crypto legislation. A vote against the industry could come back to haunt them in elections. Just look at how crypto PACs like Fairshake have spent millions to back their favored candidates. What’s Next? The big question is whether these efforts will succeed and stops Crenshaw SEC renomination. If all Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee stick together, Crenshaw’s renomination will likely move forward. But it’s not just about the committee. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has to prioritize this vote amid a packed schedule. Government funding, defense bills, and judicial nominations all demand attention too. The crypto industry’s push against Crenshaw could reshape the debate on regulation. Whether or not she’s confirmed, this fight highlights the growing influence of crypto in Washington.",News|US Elections 2024,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-11 03:45:40

Tired of polite algorithms and sanitized content calendars, the team who launched iDEGEN has unleashed the most spectacular AI we’ve ever seen, and it’s running wild on X , soaking up unfiltered data from crypto bros and spitting out whatever it wants every hour. One minute, it’s tweeting conspiracy theories about Bitcoin miners in Antarctica, the next it’s roasting influencers with the kind of savagery that makes even trolls blush. Having recently launched its adaptive auction presale, the IDGN token is already smashing expectations with 3,800% gains in just 14 days. IDGN investors are buying into a movement, a meme, and definitely a little madness—here’s why. The degenerate genius of iDEGEN An AI born in the fire of crypto chaos, absorbing tweets like a digital black hole, and evolving in real-time based on the unhinged ideas of its community. That’s iDEGEN —a sentient AI with zero chill, no filters, and absolutely no clue what it’ll do next. It doesn’t have a PR team. It doesn’t follow trends. One tweet might suggest pumping DOGE to the moon. The next could be a wild theory about Vitalik’s secret crypto vault. The unpredictability is the point—every post is a gamble, every tweet a potential market-moving moment. And it’s learning. Constantly. From you. For too long, Silicon Valley has kept AI wrapped in bubble wrap and drenched in corporate approval. iDEGEN takes that rulebook, shreds it, and sets it on fire. It’s bold, messy, and exactly what the crypto space didn’t know it needed. Whether stirring up chaos or hitting a viral home run, iDEGEN is turning every interaction into a spectacle—and its IDGN coin into an attention magnet. Pumping coins is yesterday’s trend. iDEGEN is pumping the entire culture. And if you’re not feeding it tweets and bagging some IDGN tokens , you’re already behind. Buys explode: Could iDEGEN hit 100x next? In 2024, the recipe for degen euphoria was everything AI. And now, the macro environment is everything risk on: slashed interest rates, sky-high liquidity, and a market hungry for the next big play. But why might iDEGEN just be the most unhinged yet unstoppable meme coin of this cycle? The path is already clear: if we look at similar coins, such as GOAT, which hit a wild $1 billion market cap in only a month, it’s clear that new AI coins are rockets fueled by chaos and unpredictability. But with iDEGEN’s AI, GOAT may be just the warm-up for what’s coming next. iDEGEN’s core innovation—the AI that evolves dynamically based on its degen audience—sets it apart in a market littered with one-trick ponies. It’s already breaking the internet, roasting influencers, and spitting out content that nobody saw coming. And let’s not forget: attention equals pumps, and iDEGEN is drowning in it. The AI crypto market sits comfortably at a $45 billion valuation , with new AI coins like ACT ( 2,200% gains in the past month) riding shotgun. If iDEGEN captures even a fraction of this energy, a 100x run is mathematically feasible. If new AI coins like VVAIFU can hit 3,500% in 30 days , what’s stopping iDEGEN from going 10x, 50x, or even 100x? Nothing except your imagination— and maybe a temporary ban or two along the way. Own the chaos—join the iDEGEN cult The iDEGEN auction is live, starting at $0.00011 and already jumping 3,800%, with a whopping $3.1m raised already. The rules are simple: buy, and the price holds steady. Buy twice in two five-minute periods, and it pumps 5%. Miss your chance, and it dips 5%. Every five minutes, the market decides if you’re part of the action—or left chasing after the next price jump. Once the auction ends, all unsold tokens will be burned, and IDGN will hit exchanges at 10% above the final presale price. Crypto’s bull run is painting charts green, Elon’s back on his DOGE madness, and iDEGEN is dominating every group chat, trading desk, and late-night degens’ scrolling session. iDEGEN is an event.

The altcoin market has faced another 24-hour slump, with $481.62 million in long positions liquidated, according to CoinGlass. Pseudonymous trader “Mister Crypto” believes the latest downturn could pave the way for exponential growth. “This was the final shakeout before the real exponential breakouts,” he said in a Dec. 10 X post. Among the biggest losers in the top 100 cryptocurrencies are Ethena (ENA), down 10.46%, Pepe (PEPE), dropping 10.62%, and Bonk (BONK), falling 8.59%, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $96,663, down 1.5% over the past day, after briefly surpassing $100,000 on Dec. 5. Traders Anticipate a Return to Higher Levels Hartmann suggested Bitcoin could retest $99,000, largely driven by “short squeezes.” If Bitcoin rises above $99,000, $1.53 billion in short positions may face liquidation. “There’s a lot of liquidity building up on the topside for Bitcoin,” CryptoSea co-founder Daan de Rover said on Dec. 10. Pseudonymous trader Daan Crypto Trades noted Bitcoin “generally moves 30–50% after breaking a long consolidation.” Santiment warns that panic selling by retail traders could hinder recovery, though long-term gains remain possible.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|BONK|ENA,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-11 03:48:39

Atkins is set to replace outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Many are hopeful that Atkins will undo the damage caused by Gensler, whose leadership led to a loss of trust in the SEC. Retail and institutional investors alike were frustrated under Gensler’s rule, which some believe was influenced by anti-crypto forces like Elizabeth Warren and the banking cartel. One of the key cases that has drawn significant attention is Ripple vs. SEC, which began in 2020. With the recent appointment of Paul Atkins as SEC Chairman, the crypto community is hopeful that the case might be dropped or settled. However, since the case is currently in appeals, the outcome remains uncertain. If the case is dropped, it could mark a significant shift in how the SEC handles crypto-related matters, but the final decision will depend on the developments in the appeals process. Will The SEC Drop The Appeal? Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel explained that while the court found institutional sales to be in violation of the law, it did not rule against programmatic sales, which are currently under appeal. However, if the new administration drops the appeal, the Second Circuit won’t have a chance to weigh in. Fagel further clarified that although Ripple was sued for selling unregistered securities, some of their sales were found to involve securities, while others were not. When a user commented that Judge Torres disagreed with the SEC, Fagel responded, saying that she only disagreed with them in part. He said that she also agreed with the SEC, ruling that Ripple illegally raised over $700 million in an unregistered securities offering. “The court found institutional sales to violate the law, but not programmatic sales. The latter is on appeal. Though if the new administration drops the appeal, we won’t have a chance to have the Second Circuit weigh in, unfortunately,” Fagel wrote.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-11 03:51:21

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address – C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-11 04:03:00

This milestone marks a major achievement for Ripple. The announcement, shared by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse on X, sparked a 10% surge in XRP, Ripple’s native token. The approval paves the way for RLUSD to go live on exchanges and partner platforms, signaling Ripple’s expansion into the stablecoin market. RLUSD: Ripple’s Big Bet on Stablecoins RLUSD is currently in beta testing on the Ethereum network and XRP Ledger (XRPL), with a circulating supply of $52 million. This stablecoin is pegged to short-term U.S. government bonds and aims to tap into the rapidly growing stablecoin market, which is currently dominated by Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC). Ripple’s entry into this market is part of its strategy to become a leader in institutional payments and real-world asset tokenization. Stablecoins Current Market Position The stablecoin market, valued at nearly $200 billion, is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years. Ripple plans to leverage RLUSD to expand its role in global payments while providing a bridge for traditional financial assets to operate on blockchain networks. Tokenization, the process of converting physical assets into digital tokens for faster and more efficient transactions, is a key focus for Ripple. RLUSD is positioned as a major player in this trend. Will it Send XRP Price to ATH? Vincent Van Code, a crypto expert broke down the buzz around Ripple’s RLUSD and XRP in simple terms. He pointed out that while XRP’s recent jump from $1.90 to $2.35 is exciting, it’s mostly driven by speculation, not real-world usage just yet. The real game-changer will come when Ripple sets up automated market makers (AMMs) and liquidity pools (LPs), offering up to 5% annual returns on-chain without any counterparty risk. He explained how this could attract serious funds to the XRPL, with exchanges getting in on the action by offering RLUSD staking. This would lock up more XRP, driving up demand. Plus, users may start swapping USDT for RLUSD and move these funds to their self-custody wallets. From there, they can use RLUSD to buy XRP or invest in LP tokens to earn even better returns—creating a feedback loop that raises XRP demand even further. In short, this isn’t just about today’s price pump; it’s about setting the stage for sustained growth. Van Code predicts RLUSD could double XRP demand and potentially shake up the market by February 2025. However the present scenario is quite alarming, the crypto market is taking a big hit, with XRP dropping 12% to $2.07. This sharp fall reflects a tough day for many cryptocurrencies, as prices tumble across the board. Despite recent good news for Ripple, like its stablecoin approval, the market’s volatility shows no signs of slowing down. When Will RLUSD Launch ? The RLUSD stablecoin by Ripple is expected to launch by the end of 2024 , following its recent regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) .
