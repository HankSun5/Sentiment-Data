The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyzing five cryptos that could turn $500 to $50,000 with 10,000% growth potential. Table of Contents Catzilla: Dominating meme coins with high potential Raydium: Solana liquidity integrated with Serum DEX Neiro Coin Uniswap’s UNI: Empowering governance in DeFi Jupiter Conclusion In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, certain digital assets are generating buzz for their potential to deliver staggering returns by 2025. These five carefully selected cryptocurrencies could soar, potentially turning $500 into $50,000. Catzilla: Dominating meme coins with high potential In the wild and unpredictable world of meme coins, few newcomers manage to roar as loudly as Catzilla. Inspired by the cultural juggernauts of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE, Catzilla combines viral meme appeal with the promise of unprecedented returns. What truly sets it apart is its creative backbone — a Godzilla-like feline tearing through a Japanese kaiju-inspired storyline. This narrative not only electrifies gamers and anime fans but also captivates investors searching for the next big crypto phenomenon. With a 700% ROI already on the radar, Catzilla’s carefully structured 14-stage presale allows investors to secure early positions as the token price ascends with each stage. Beyond the numbers, Catzilla will deliver on its triple value promise: Epic gameplay: A thrilling game infused with anime and kaiju mayhem, offering players rewards for their engagement. A mission that matters: Rallying the crypto community around fairness and decentralization, Catzilla will channel a rebellious spirit to combat greed and manipulation. An engaged community: Crypto enthusiasts, cat lovers, and anime fans to unite and fuel Catzilla’s meteoric rise. Catzilla is here to disrupt. By embracing its monstrous persona, the token symbolizes a return to the playful, community-driven essence of meme coins. The meme coin will also go further to offer a transparent and equitable ecosystem where every participant has a shot at success. Interested investors can join the Catzilla craze through its presale.

Unlike other automated market makers, Raydium provides on-chain liquidity to a central order book. This means that funds deposited into Raydium are turned into limit orders on Serum’s order books. This allows Raydium’s liquidity providers to access all of Serum’s trading flow and existing liquidity. The native token, RAY, is used for staking to earn fees, receiving allocations in initial token offerings, and participating in governance votes. With its integration into Solana and Serum, Raydium has potential in decentralized finance. Neiro Coin Neiro Coin is a new cryptocurrency that honors Neiro, a Shiba Inu adopted by the woman who owned Kabosu, the famous dog behind the Doge meme. Neiro Coin is entirely owned and managed by its community. The project aims to build on the popularity of the Doge meme and the community spirit. The Neiro Coin has potential for growth. In the current market cycle, its appeal lies in the connection to a well-loved meme and its community-driven approach.

Launched in September 2020, it allows holders to vote on aspects like fee structures and token distribution. Uniswap is a decentralized exchange on the Ethereum blockchain that uses an automated liquidity protocol, enabling trading without an order book and giving users full control of their funds. Its open-source nature and free token listing make it accessible and secure. Currently, Uniswap stands as the fourth-largest DeFi platform with over $3 billion in assets. The UNI token’s potential lies in its governance utility and the platform’s continued growth, making it attractive in the current market cycle. Jupiter Jupiter is a prominent DeFi platform on the Solana blockchain, recognized as the most popular DEX aggregator globally. It pools resources to enable efficient token swaps, futures trading, and decentralized stablecoin management. While originally focused on liquidity aggregation, Jupiter has expanded to include GMX-style perpetual futures and is launching its own decentralized stablecoin to mitigate custodial and regulatory risks. These developments position Jupiter for potential growth within Solana’s ecosystem, indicating that the JUP coin may see significant gains in the current market cycle. Conclusion While RAY, NEIRO, UNI, and JUP each hold unique promise in their respective domains, Catzilla rises as the standout choice for those chasing massive gains. Combining an ambitious 700% ROI presale, a captivating narrative, and a community-driven mission, Catzilla is more than a meme coin — it’s a symbol of financial rebellion and creative ingenuity. With its unique blend of gameplay, fairness, and a bold persona, it offers an opportunity to be part of something bigger.

He criticized Biden’s regulations, credited his father for Bitcoin’s rise past $100,000, and highlighted Bitcoin’s advantages over traditional finance. He promised the Trump family’s continued support for digital assets. Eric Trump, the vice president of the Trump Organization, delivered a powerful speech at the Bitcoin MENA 2024 conference in Abu Dhabi on December 9, after Trump’s victory. Today, @EricTrump shared his views on the significance of #Bitcoin and the role that he and @realDonaldTrump expect it to play in the future. The speech is extraordinary and I highly recommend watching it in full. pic.twitter.com/0WJooTcOvW — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) December 10, 2024 Eric Trump Predicts Bitcoin Eric predicted that Bitcoin would soon surpass the $1 million mark and called it the “cornerstone of a financial revolution.” In his address, Eric described Bitcoin as a “global asset” and stressed its importance in a world increasingly threatened by inflation, political instability, and natural disasters. “Bitcoin is the future of finance,” he proclaimed, emphasizing that its decentralized nature and fixed supply of 21 million coins make it a powerful hedge against the traditional financial system’s inefficiencies. “Bitcoin eliminates the need for tens of thousands of bankers pushing paperwork for exorbitant fees,” Eric added, making a strong argument for how cryptocurrency can simplify global transactions. He also took the opportunity to criticize the Biden administration’s stance on cryptocurrency, accusing it of waging a “war” on the sector through aggressive regulatory measures, particularly the lawsuits filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Eric highlighted the collapse of FTX as a turning point for the industry, noting that the previous administration’s actions had these uncertainties. Trump’s role in Bitcoin “Under my father’s leadership, America will lead the digital revolution,” he declared, receiving loud applause many of whom were sporting “Make Bitcoin Great Again” caps. He credited President-elect Donald Trump with driving Bitcoin’s recent surge past the $100,000 mark, stating, “When Bitcoin hit $100,000, I immediately called my father to share the good news.” He further argued that those who embrace Bitcoin now, including governments and institutions, will be the biggest winners in the digital revolution. “Bitcoin is instantly liquid, borderless, and a global currency,” he said. “It doesn’t rely on traditional banking systems. It’s not subject to corrupt governments.” He added that Bitcoin’s price would continue to climb, eventually reaching $1 million per coin. “A lot more eyes will be open when Bitcoin hits $1 million, and I’m confident it’s going to hit $1 million.” “It’s a shift in how companies like ours receive money,” he explained, referring to the Trump Organization’s involvement in cryptocurrency. Eric promised that the Trump family would remain steadfast supporters of digital assets, ensuring they continue to play a significant role in the global financial landscape.

Once a leader in Bitcoin mining, China banned the practice in 2021 but still contributes around 10% of global mining activity. At the Bitcoin MENA 2024 conference in Abu Dhabi, Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital made a prediction that China will return to Bitcoin mining and likely integrate the digital currency into its reserve assets by the end of 2025. China’s Re-entry into Bitcoin China’s relationship with Bitcoin has been complicated. In the past, the country was the global leader in Bitcoin mining, contributing to over 65% of the global hash power. However, in 2021, the Chinese government-imposed a ban on cryptocurrency mining and trading to limit financial risks and promote its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan. Since then, the ban has majorly impacted Bitcoin’s mining operations, with many miners relocating to more crypto-friendly regions. Though there is a ban, Scaramucci pointed out that around 10% of global mining continues within China’s borders. Scaramucci believes that the U.S.’s increasing approach towards Bitcoin will push other nations, including China, to reconsider their positions on the digital asset. He predicts that by next year, China will not only restart Bitcoin mining but may also add it to its reserves that signaling a potential shift in the country’s approach to digital currency. “By this time next year, the Chinese will be back in the Bitcoin game,” Scaramucci stated confidently at MENA, adding that China’s re-entry with Bitcoin would be strengthen its global economic position. Bitcoin Adoption Trump has promised to create a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve, that the country is stabling for financial stability and resilience. This has encouraged other countries, including Russia and Brazil, where lawmakers are proposing the integration of Bitcoin into their financial reserves as national assets. Scaramucci compares the global adoption of Bitcoin to a “match-selling race,” that no country can afford to ignore the growing trend. “You’re not going to be in a position in the world, in developing economies, where the U.S. is moving towards Bitcoin, and you are not moving towards Bitcoin,” he stated. The concept of strategic Bitcoin reserves has got attention in 2024. Countries like Russia, Brazil are actively considering Bitcoin into its treasury. Even within the U.S., with lawmakers such as Senator Cynthia Lummis advocating for the acquisition of Bitcoin holdings over a multi-year period. Other U.S. states, like Pennsylvania, have also shown interest in allocating Bitcoin. This shows Bitcoin is no longer seen as a speculative asset but a strategic financial tool. S caramucci believes this trend will only accelerate, with Bitcoin becoming an increasingly important asset in global financial portfolios. As the U.S. and other nations explore Bitcoin reserves, China’s re-engagement with Bitcoin could solidify the digital asset’s place in the global financial system. According to Scaramucci Bitcoin reserves and mining, China would regain its role as a major player in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Litecoin Has Continued To Witness Significant Activity Recently In a new post on X, IntoTheBlock has discussed what the various key on-chain indicators have been like for the Litecoin network recently. Below is the infographic shared by the analytics firm. According to the data, there are currently around 370,000 daily active addresses on the Litecoin blockchain. An address is said to be ‘active’ when it participates in some kind of transaction activity on the network, whether as a receiver or sender. Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLing Rewards: Long-Term Holders Selling At 326% Profit The metric’s value basically tells us about the amount of users that are using the cryptocurrency. Another indicator, the daily transactions, provides information about the exact measure of activity that these users are taking part in. At present, LTC users are making 200,000 transactions every day. IntoTheBlock has pointed out that this level of user activity is higher than on other networks like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA). “Much of this activity stems from Litecoin being one of the few cryptocurrencies actively used for payments,” notes the analytics firm. LTC offers cheap and fast transactions, so it has always been a network preferred as a mode of payments. The activity-related metrics continuing to be high (in fact, further growing over the past month) implies this selling point of the chain is still attracting users. Another metric in the infographic that correlates to activity is transaction volume, which keeps track of the daily total amount of USD value that’s being transferred to the network. Impressively, this indicator currently stands at $10.27 billion, which is higher than the coin’s total market cap. While Litecoin is continuing to do well in terms of activity-related metrics, the cryptocurrency has remained stagnant in terms of price growth. A result of this is that just 72% of the addresses on the network are sitting in some unrealized gain. Of course, this still means the majority are above water, but other networks like Bitcoin (BTC) have it close to the 100% mark right now due to the bull run. That said, another way to look at this could perhaps be that Litecoin has more relative room to run, since the risk of a mass selloff goes up the more investors get into profits. Related Reading: Analyst Sets $4.40 XRP Target As 3rd-Straight Bull Pennant Forms It seems that a strong majority of the Litecoin userbase also thinks similarly, as 78% of the 7.94 million Litecoin holders have been HODLing since more than a year. “As one of the older Layer 1 networks still seeing significant usage, Litecoin shouldn’t be overlooked,” says IntoTheBlock. It only remains to be seen, however, whether LTC can finally translate its positive on-chain metrics into price appreciation or not. LTC Price Litecoin has suffered a plunge of around 8% over the last 24 hours, which has taken its price to $113.

Crying Kamala (CRYKAMA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CRYKAMA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Crying Kamala can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crying Kamala could become the next viral memecoin. Crying Kamala launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crying Kamala on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crying Kamala by entering its contract address – 5eCJhSGBUN4YwJHLU9ZcWjrjmoufVznjzNBHfo4TN1P7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRYKAMA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-10 23:06:00

Per Chosun Ilbo , the National Assembly voted in favor of a legal amendment that will delay the launch of crypto tax until January 2027. However, both major parties agreed on the details of this amendment prior to President Yoon Seok-yul’s ill-fated decision to declare martial law on December 3. South Korean opposition leader Lee Jae-myung sought to force through a highly contested budget Tuesday in a show of political clout as he seeks to build momentum for another impeachment bid against President Yoon Suk Yeol https://t.co/g2kIskvpFx — Bloomberg (@business) December 10, 2024 Martial Law Chaos Derails Crypto Progress The media outlet reported that the National Assembly, which is now under heightened pressure to approve next year’s budget, has “moved into full-blown impeachment mode.” The crypto industry is still “waiting for legislative clarity.” But firms are now “braces for another sluggish wait” for change, Chosun wrote. The crypto tax law passed in the very nick of time, gaining approval on the very last day of the current plenary session. The bill had been slated for debate on December 4. Had the Assembly failed to vote on December 10, crypto tax would have launched as scheduled on Janaury 1, 2025. An All-stop Order The media outlet wrote that all “virtual asset-related” issues have now been pushed back in priority. It added that parliamentarians have agreed to an “all-stop” on all crypto-related matters. This means that a number of pressing crypto-related matters will likely remain in limbo until mid-2025. These include: South Korea’s long-standing initial coin offering (ICO) ban, which Yoon promised to “review” prior to his election A decision on whether domestic companies can buy crypto with their balance sheets A decision on securities token offering (STO) legalization, another Yoon manifesto promise A ruling on the legality of Bitcoin spot ETFs The newspaper wrote that all these issues and more “have been buried under the impeachment issue, making it impossible to expect a vote” on any of them. Instead, the National Assembly is “focusing on issues such as martial law, impeachment, and the next presidential election.” LIVE: Thousands of protesters are expected to gather in front of the parliament in Seoul, South Korea https://t.co/p4HiW6AeAs — Reuters (@Reuters) December 10, 2024 A Lifeline for Corporate Crypto Investors? The situation is not completely hopeless for crypto firms, however. The Financial Services Commission has recently “finalized step-by-step guidelines ” for corporate crypto accounts. In theory, it could implement most of these steps without relying on the National Assembly’s help. The newspaper wrote that STO-related discussions would “not progress until the first half of next year,” despite the fact that both parties broadly agree on the matter. Some officers, soldiers resisted martial law orders in their own ways https://t.co/yspytERgLT — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) December 10, 2024 Moving Overseas? An unnamed National Assembly “insider” was quoted as stating: “The martial law crisis has taken all of the National Assembly’s attention. So it is hard to justify dealing with virtual assets now, even though there are many outstanding bills that need work. We should view this as an indefinite postponement. It will last at least until the impeachment situation is resolved.” However, the outlet noted that there are now “concerns” that more domestic “blockchain and virtual asset companies and investors” will “relocate overseas due to the martial law situation.” Dealing with the aftermath of the short-lived martial law in South Korea appears much more complicated that it may seem. #MartialLaw #SouthKorea https://t.co/xZp3Iu5JRB — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) December 10, 2024 Crypto players have urged Seoul to roll out clearer guidelines. But it seems they will be left waiting until mid-2025 for answers. “There is a lot to discuss in the cryptoasset sector. But the current situation is regrettable. In the US, President-elect Donald Trump is looking to appoint people to handle virtual asset policies before he even takes office. It is urgent for South Korea to act quickly, too.” Kim Gap-rae, Senior Researcher, Capital Market Research Institute The post Martial Law Chaos: South Korea Pauses ‘All’ Work on Crypto Legislation appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Regulation|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2024-12-10 23:30:00

While Bitcoin and Ethereum are grappling with price dips, altcoins like Tron and Celestia are making steady gains, standing out for their innovation and resilience. Tron recently faced a slight dip, but its network activity is off the charts, showcasing its utility in DeFi and NFTs. Meanwhile, Celestia, the modular blockchain pioneer, is riding high on growing adoption and fresh partnerships that signal strong potential for long-term growth. Amid this excitement, Qubetics is carving out its place as the go-to crypto for savvy investors. Qubetics ($TICS) is redefining how crypto can solve real-world problems. Unlike older projects that struggled with usability and accessibility, Qubetics is simplifying crypto for everyday users. With its non-custodial multi-chain wallet, integrations with major financial systems, and an ROI potential of 900% post-presale, Qubetics is poised to revolutionize digital payments. Let’s break down why $TICS, Tron, and Celestia are the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): A Wallet for Everyone Imagine a world where paying with crypto is as easy as swiping your phone for Apple Pay. That’s the promise of Qubetics. Its non-custodial multi-chain wallet eliminates the hassle of traditional crypto transactions. No KYC requirements? Check. Smart contract conversion that turns crypto into fiat at the point of sale? Double-check. Whether you’re shopping online or running a business, this wallet is designed to make life simpler. Take small business owners, for instance. With Qubetics’ wallet, they can accept crypto without worrying about market volatility. The built-in smart contract conversion ensures stable payments, protecting them from sudden dips in value. On the flip side, imagine an everyday user like Sarah, who’s tired of juggling different wallets and platforms. With Qubetics, all her assets are in one place, and she can pay just like she would with a debit card. Currently in its 12th presale phase , Qubetics has already raised over $5.4M, sold more than 303M tokens, and attracted over 8,300 holders. At $0.031 per token, it’s a steal for early investors, especially with a 10% price increase coming next week. Post-presale, the price is set to skyrocket to $0.25, offering massive returns for those who get in now. With its unique features and community-first approach, Qubetics is a no-brainer for anyone looking to invest in the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Tron (TRX): The DeFi and NFT Powerhouse Tron has been around for a while, but it’s not just sitting back and resting on its laurels. The network is bustling with activity, particularly in the DeFi and NFT spaces. Recent data shows a slight dip in TRX prices, but its on-chain metrics paint a different picture. Active wallet addresses are hitting new highs, and transaction volumes are through the roof. Tron’s low transaction fees and lightning-fast processing times make it a favorite for developers and users alike. One of Tron’s standout achievements this year has been its expansion into decentralized storage solutions. Partnering with major platforms, Tron is aiming to be more than just another blockchain. It’s becoming an ecosystem. This focus on utility is why TRX is one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. For investors, Tron offers stability and long-term potential. Analysts predict TRX could break through resistance levels and hit new highs by early 2025. If you’re looking for a reliable altcoin with real-world use cases, Tron deserves a spot in your portfolio alongside Qubetics. Celestia (TIA): The Modular Blockchain Trailblazer Celestia is shaking things up with its modular blockchain architecture. Unlike traditional monolithic chains, Celestia separates consensus from execution, making it highly scalable and efficient. This unique approach has caught the attention of developers and enterprises alike, pushing TIA into the spotlight. Recent developments have bolstered Celestia’s position as a top contender in the crypto world. Strategic partnerships and increased adoption among developers have fueled steady gains in TIA’s price. And while it hasn’t experienced the wild price swings of other cryptos, its consistent growth signals strong investor confidence. Imagine a future where developers can build custom blockchains without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. That’s what Celestia offers. It’s not just a blockchain; it’s the foundation for a whole new way of thinking about decentralized applications. With its focus on scalability and innovation, Celestia is undoubtedly one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 for those seeking cutting-edge tech with long-term potential. Top Cryptos for December 2024 Choosing the right crypto to invest in can be overwhelming, but focusing on projects with strong fundamentals and real-world applications makes it easier. Qubetics ($TICS) stands out for its innovative wallet and massive presale success. Tron (TRX) continues to dominate in DeFi and NFTs, offering stability and growth. And Celestia (TIA) is pioneering modular blockchain technology, making it a top pick for tech enthusiasts and long-term investors.

Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) commissioner Hester Pierce calls for the next government to reform the crypto industry, one of them by stopping the bottleneck of government regulations . She noted that the digital asset industry faces obstacles to accessing the services they need. Therefore, she urges the government to stop preventing the crypto industry and start to move forward. The newly-elected government also needs to provide a clear framework for the commission to supervise this emerging industry. Clarity of framework is required to make a clear stance for the regulator and the market. As a regulator, she mentioned that the government should jointly work with the industry to evaluate the existing rules and provide any modifications that are needed. “Work with entities involved in crypto to try to figure out how the existing rules apply and where adjustments need to be made. And that needs to be a group exercise. It needs to be done in the public so that everyone can participate in it. And I think we can get to a good place to do that relatively quickly,” Pierce says on the interview with Fox Business Read more: Why Paul Atkins, Trump’s SEC chair pick, gives crypto a reason to hope again SEC under Atkins’s leadership Pierce, at the same interview, stated that the newly-picked chairman for next year, Paul Atkins, “is very good at thinking about how to use the government efficiently and effectively to solve problems”. She was also not shocked by Gary Gensler’s decision to step down from his position due to the change in the head of government. On Ripple’s lawsuit, Pierce has not replied with any comment yet, but this long process of legal actions, which was already taken by 2020, is the most expensive and inefficient way to regulate.

The partnership will improve the management of tokenized assets and facilitate the exchange between public and private blockchains. It will ensure improved data communication between various blockchain networks. Chainlink and Coinbase Partner To Accelerate Institutional Adoption of Tokenized Assets In a recent statement , Coinbase has stated that it will incorporate Chainlink’s CCIP into its Project Diamond. The integration is targeting to improve the compatibility between different chains in regards to tokenized assets. With CCIP, Coinbase will be able to bridge assets between the public and the private blockchain. Hence, the partnership will make it possible for tokenized assets to be usable across many blockchain networks. Project Diamond, which operates under the regulatory framework of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), is designed to serve institutional investors and asset managers. With this integration, institutions access secure and compliant solutions for their financial transactions. Additionally, the oracle network’s robust data and interoperability infrastructure will address the rising demand for secure on-chain data. This includes market prices, reference data, and key compliance information such as anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) details. Deputy Chief Investment Officer at Coinbase Asset Management, Marcel Kasumovich, commented, “By integrating the Chainlink standard natively into the Project Diamond platform, powered by Coinbase’s tech stack on Base, we’re paving the way for widespread institutional adoption of digital assets.” Enhancing Cross-Chain Functionality The adoption of the oracle network CCIP in Project Diamond is a significant move to ensure that digital assets are not confined to a single blockchain. This protocol enables the transfer and communication of assets across different networks. Johann Eid, Chief Business Officer at Chainlink Labs emphasized, “ “Coinbase’s adoption of the Chainlink standard for the Project Diamond platform underscores the critical importance of solving the end-to-end lifecycle management of tokenized assets.” The recent rumors of the possible collaboration of Chainlink with BlackRock have boosted LINK token price . As institutional investors start experimenting with the integration of blockchain with conventional finance, the prospects of growth have soared. This has boosted the LINK price as investors have increased their faith in the project’s future. Thus, the cooperation with Coinbase further proves that Chainlink aims to become a crucial provider of services for the digital asset market. As more institutions adopt blockchain and more so in the MENA region, the Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) becomes more valuable.

On December 10 the government dispatched 502 Bitcoin , or around $49.42 million, to two platforms, Binance and QCP Capital. Blockchain tracking service Arkham Intelligence says that this is the most current of a scheduled sell-off meant to maximize earnings by leveraging changes in the market. Bhutan sent 402 Bitcoin, which is worth $39.56 million, to Singapore-based QCP Capital in four separate transfers. A short time later, Binance got an extra 100 coins, which were worth $9.81 million. This is the latest in a series of deals like this that started in October. In that time, Bhutan sold a total of 1,696 BTC and made $139 million, with each crypto unit selling for an average of $81,999. A Record November Bitcoin Sale On November 14, 2024, Bhutan made a big sell through Binance, offloading 367 BTC for about $33.5 million. At the same time, the alpha coin hit an intraday high of more than $90,000. This transaction was one of the Bhutanese government’s more lucrative decisions, according to Arkham Intelligence, demonstrating its skill at market timing. Bhutan still holds a sizable amount of Bitcoin—11,688 BTC, or over $1.15 billion—despite these recent sell-offs. Along with the US, China, UK, and Ukraine, the Himalayan monarchy is now one among the top five countries in the world in terms of crypto ownership. Leveraging The Bull Market The current bull market has made it possible for countries like Bhutan and El Salvador to use cryptocurrency for business. El Salvador, for example, has taken advantage of the rise in Bitcoin price to pay for building projects like its ambitious Bitcoin City and to get rid of its debt. Even though it’s not as well known, Bhutan’s approach also focuses on using cryptocurrency as part of bigger economic plans. Market Dynamics And Future Outlook Bhutan’s trades coincide with a more general market downturn in terms of timing. Bitcoin just dropped below the psychological $100,000 mark, falling as low as $94,350 before rising to about $97,000. Analysts believe that after Bitcoin’s significant gain, this decline is a normal correction. The way Bhutan approaches the management of reserves emphasizes how governments may deliberately leverage market developments. Bhutan shows how nations may include digital assets into its economic plans by matching their sales with times of great demand and peak pricing. This calculated use of bitcoin reserves not only generates significant income but also emphasizes the growing importance of digital assets in world financial institutions. Bhutan’s measures could be a model for other governments trying to negotiate this erratic yet profitable environment as the crypto market develops.

Dogecoin (DOGE) is still the meme coin king and Dogwifhat (WIF) is establishing itself in the Solana ecosystem. However, a shift is happening with DTX Exchange (DTX), a hybrid utility token breaking records and hitting $9.99 million in presale, and it is looking good for the crypto space. Dogwifhat (WIF) Stays Strong Despite Market Volatility Dogwifhat (WIF) on the Solana blockchain is a serious meme coin contender. Despite a $5 million liquidation event that spooked the market, WIF is up 39% in the last month and getting a lot of attention from investors. WIF has gotten attention because of the price, the community, and marketing. The WIF community has been promoting the token through viral memes and grassroots campaigns on Twitter and Reddit and getting more engagement and visibility. WIF being on the Solana blockchain makes it a low-fee high-speed alternative to other meme coins for traders frustrated with Ethereum-based networks’ congestion. With community events and potential partnerships teased by the devs, WIF’s ecosystem can grow more and WIF will be a serious player in the memecoin space. The chart shows a descending triangle with mixed short-term momentum. But the $3 support has been getting bought in. If it breaks above $4.83, it could be a bullish breakout, and WIF could go to new all-time highs. Source: CoinMarketCap Dogecoin (DOGE) Still Rules the Crypto World The crypto community still loves Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme coin. Global brands accept DOGE as a payment method, and Elon Musk supports it. In the last month, DOGE has doubled, 391%, since the beginning of the year. On the technical side, an ascending triangle pattern suggests DOGE could rise 18% in the next few weeks to $0.58. Also, whale activity has increased, and big investors recently bought $276 million worth of DOGE, which indicates that they believe in its growth. Source: CoinMarketCap DTX Exchange (DTX): A New Era in Utility Token Investments While meme coins like DOGE and WIF are making headlines, DTX Exchange is changing the game with crypto utility and adoption. Unlike meme coins, DTX is focused on utility-driven innovation, a platform that combines crypto, forex, and stock trading all in one user-friendly ecosystem. DTX Exchange has raised a whopping $9,99 million in presale, and it’s above 50% of the 6th stage. The current token price is $0.12, 7th stage will increase to $0.14. So DTX is not only a proof of demand but also a game changer in the blockchain space. DTX token success is driven by its robust features, Phoenix Wallet for decentralized asset custody, and VulcanX blockchain for high-leverage trading on 100,000+ financial instruments. These features create a unified trading experience for retail and institutional investors. DTX Exchange has an active community of over 160,000 members who are part of the development process. Through governance rights and profit sharing DTX creates a collaborative environment. Also, SolidProof audited the project to give investors more confidence. Memecoins and Utility-Driven Tokens The crypto space is changing, and meme coins like DOGE and WIF are doing well, along with utility tokens like DTX. Memecoins rely on community and market hype, while hybrid tokens like DTX are carving out space by offering real use cases and sustainable growth. DTX Exchange (DTX) is an example of this with its record-breaking presale and solutions; for investors looking for the next big thing in crypto, DTX is positioning itself to be the leader.

The statement came in response to ongoing debates about the role of burns in driving demand for the token. Community Divided Over Token Burns The discussion was raised when the 1 Cent Dream project announced the completion of its second burn campaign of 250 million SHIB tokens. This initiative aimed to decrease the circulating supply and urged the community to participate in future burn events. While some praised the effort, others criticized Kusama and the team for not implementing more significant burns. A notable comment came from a community member, Gunz0369 , who argued that increased burns are essential for attracting new investors and ensuring the asset’s future growth. Kusama’s Response Kusama countered these claims, arguing that Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) recent success proves its performance is not solely reliant on burns. He noted that despite limited burn activity, the token has achieved a remarkable 192% price increase year-to-date, currently trading at $0.00002986. According to Kusama, focusing exclusively on burns overshadows the broader factors contributing to the token’s growth. He emphasized that the token’s ecosystem, including utility, governance, and strategic partnerships, has been instrumental in driving success. Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Layer 2 blockchain, is a key part of this ecosystem and has boosted sentiment and adoption. Kusama also pointed out that expanding the asset’s use cases and completing ecosystem projects will naturally lead to more burn opportunities. By attracting new users and increasing utility, the token’s circulating supply can be reduced effectively over time. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Shibarium’s Role in the Ecosystem Shibarium has sparked debate within the community regarding its impact on token burns. While some users highlighted its contribution to Shiba Inu’s growth, others questioned its effectiveness in reducing supply. Critics argued that Shibarium relies on the token’s success rather than the other way around. Kusama addressed these concerns by explaining that Shibarium is part of a comprehensive strategy to strengthen the ecosystem. Since its launch, Shibarium has facilitated the burning of over 56 billion SHIB through gas fee allocations. Additionally, the burn portal introduced as part of Shibarium has automatically removed more than 300 million SHIB from circulation. Despite these contributions, Kusama emphasized that no single factor, including Shibarium, can be credited for the asset’s overall success. He reiterated that growth stems from the combined marketing, partnerships, and community engagement efforts. SHIB Burn Statistics Since SHIB’s inception in August 2020, over 410.74 trillion tokens have been burned, significantly reducing its initial supply. However, Kusama and other developers focus on long-term strategies rather than relying solely on token incineration. The lead developer encouraged the community to adopt a balanced perspective, recognizing the importance of innovation, utility, and partnerships in driving the token’s value. While token burns remain a topic of interest for supporters, Kusama’s statement underscores the importance of a multifaceted approach to achieving long-term success. By focusing on utility, strategic partnerships, and ecosystem expansion, the asset claims to sustain its growth and enhance its position in the cryptocurrency market.

From Dogecoin’s meteoric rise to Shiba Inu’s staggering community growth, these tokens have proven they’re more than just punchlines—they’re opportunities. Now, the next wave of meme coins is gearing up to dominate in 2025, and one name, BTFD Coin , is already stealing the spotlight. Why? With its P2E (play-to-earn) game, staking rewards, and a rapidly expanding community, BTFD isn’t just another meme coin. It’s here to redefine the space. The buzz surrounding BTFD Coin is off the charts, especially after its presale went live on November 26, 2024. Investors flocked to grab a piece of this rising star, pushing the project through 25% of its presale stages in just 24 hours. Now in Stage 10 and priced at $0.0001, BTFD Coin has already raised over $2.8 million, with 4,200 holders and more than 45 billion tokens sold. Analysts are predicting explosive growth, making this presale one of the most talked-about events in crypto right now. But what makes BTFD Coin one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025? And how do Popcat and Turbo fit into this evolving meme coin narrative? Let’s break it down, starting with the hottest meme token of the year— BTFD Coin. BTFD Coin: The Future King of Meme Coins BTFD Coin (short for “Buy The Freakin’ Dip”) has taken the crypto scene by storm. Unlike most meme coins, which rely heavily on hype and community buzz, BTFD brings real utility to the table. Its play-to-earn (P2E) game is designed to keep users engaged while earning rewards in $BTFD tokens, creating a sustainable ecosystem. Plus, with staking rewards on offer, holders have every reason to HODL their tokens and watch their investments grow. Let’s talk numbers. BTFD Coin’s presale began at $0.000004 per token, and once it’s listed at $0.0006, early investors could see a jaw-dropping 15,000% return. For example, if you had invested $8,000 in Stage 5, where $BTFD was priced at $0.00005, you would’ve snagged 160 million tokens. At the listing price, those tokens would be worth $96,000. That’s a life-changing gain right there. The presale performance alone speaks volumes about the project’s potential. Within just 14 days, it smashed through the $2.5 million mark, and it’s now sitting comfortably at over $2.8 million. The community? Over 4,200 strong and growing daily. With only six stages left in the presale, FOMO (fear of missing out) is real, and for good reason. Analysts are already predicting a surge in $BTFD’s price post-listing, with some speculating it could hit $0.002 or higher by mid-2025. If you’re looking for one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025, this is it. The presale is your golden ticket. Don’t sleep on it. Popcat: The Internet Sensation Turned Crypto Star Popcat, inspired by the viral internet meme of a cat “popping” its mouth, is another meme coin making waves. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Popcat combines meme culture with innovative tokenomics to reward its holders. What sets Popcat apart is its community-driven approach. Every time a user interacts with the Popcat game or spreads the meme online, they earn $POP tokens. It’s like mining, but with memes. Popcat has also been gaining traction for its charitable initiatives. A portion of every transaction fee goes towards animal welfare organisations, which has endeared it to socially conscious investors. And let’s face it—who doesn’t love a good cause? From an investment perspective, Popcat has shown steady growth since its launch. Its initial price of $0.00001 has risen to $0.00008, with analysts forecasting it could hit $0.0005 by the end of 2025. While it doesn’t boast the same explosive presale performance as BTFD Coin, its loyal community and unique use case make it a solid contender. So, should you add Popcat to your portfolio? If you’re all about supporting projects with heart and believe in the power of internet culture, then yes. It’s one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025, especially if you’re in it for the long haul. Turbo: The Speed Demon of Meme Coins Turbo is all about speed—both in its transactions and its rise to fame. Launched as a decentralised meme coin on the Binance Smart Chain, Turbo aims to be the go-to token for quick and cheap transactions. Its ultra-fast blockchain technology and near-zero gas fees make it an attractive option for traders looking to move funds without breaking the bank. What makes Turbo one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025? It’s all in the branding. Turbo has managed to build a reputation as the “speedy meme coin,” and it’s doubling down with strategic partnerships in the gaming and eSports sectors. Gamers can now use $TURBO tokens to purchase in-game assets or participate in tournaments, further integrating the coin into a massive and lucrative market. Since its launch, Turbo has grown its market cap to over $15 million, and its token price has climbed from $0.00002 to $0.00015. While it’s still early days, Turbo’s focus on real-world utility and its thriving gaming partnerships make it a strong contender in the meme coin space. If you’re someone who loves the thrill of fast-paced investments, Turbo might just be your jam. It’s got the potential for big gains, especially as its use case expands in the gaming industry. Conclusion: Secure Your Spot in the Meme Coin Revolution Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that the meme coin space is evolving faster than ever. BTFD Coin, with its presale performance and groundbreaking features, is leading the charge, while Popcat and Turbo bring their own unique strengths to the table. If you’re serious about future-proofing your portfolio, now’s the time to act. The BTFD Coin presale is still ongoing, but it’s already in Stage 10, with prices set to rise as it approaches its final stages. Don’t miss your chance to get in early and ride the wave of one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and be part of the next big thing in crypto. Opportunities like this don’t come around every day. Are you ready to secure your spot?

Crypto King Musk (MUSKKING), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKKING is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Crypto King Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crypto King Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Crypto King Musk launched with over $7,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crypto King Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Crypto King Musk by entering its contract address – v2jWiNpR1m8gHARdM39GosZ8muaxZpowpBgWgWTSCev – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKKING. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-11 00:02:00

At press time, DOGE price was trading at $0.3934, a 6.15% decline from the 24-hour high. Amid this dip, whales have been actively transferring large amounts of DOGE, fueling speculation about a potential price rally. Dogecoin Whale Activity Triggers Rally Speculation In the past few hours, large transfers of Dogecoin have caught the attention of market participants. According to Whale Alert, over 61 million DOGE, worth approximately $23.5 million, were transferred from an unknown wallet to the Robinhood platform. This was followed by another transfer of nearly 85.4 million DOGE, valued at around $32.9 million. These large transactions come amid heightened market interest and could signal significant developments for the price of Dogecoin. Whale movements are often viewed as indicators of potential market shifts, particularly when such large sums are moved to exchanges. Traders and investors may be watching these transfers closely, speculating whether they signal the beginning of a price rally. As larger market participants move their positions, volatility in Dogecoin’s price could increase, leading to potential price swings in the coming days. Will DOGE Price Surge to $3? Several analysts are keeping a close eye on Dogecoin’s price action amid these large whale transactions. Ali Martinez, a crypto analyst, recently stated that Dogecoin is still in the early stages of its bullish cycle. He points to a potential price rise to $3 during the current bull run, with long-term projections suggesting a rise to as high as $18. Martinez bases his prediction on the weekly chart’s regression channel, which suggests that DOGE still has room for upward momentum. However, he acknowledges that the market could face some fluctuations before these price levels are reached. Despite the recent decline in Dogecoin’s price, analysts are optimistic about its medium-to-long-term prospects. Source: Coinglass However, DOGE’s open interest dipped by 12%, and its derivatives trading volume decreased by 10%, signaling a slight reduction in market activi Technical Breakout Sparks Renewed Optimism Technical analysis has also been pointing to a potential breakout for Dogecoin. Trader Tardigrade, another crypto analyst, notes that DOGE price has recently broken out of a Symmetrical Triangle pattern, which often signals a bullish trend. Following this breakout, the price of Dogecoin has not experienced a significant pullback, suggesting that the upward momentum may continue. If Dogecoin retraces to the upper boundary of the triangle at around $0.44, like it has done today, it could present a buying opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the next leg of the rally. Tardigrade suggests that the price could eventually reach $0.65, marking a potential 50% rallyfrom the current levels. Further, he predicts that DOGE might peak within the range of $8 to $10 before a possible retracement, which could provide another entry point for long-term investors. Moreover, from its current price of around $0.39, a rally to $3 would represent a significant increase of 630%, making it an enticing prospect for investors looking to capitalize on Dogecoin’s growth potential.

Table of Contents DOGEN: An alpha meme token capturing the crypto scene Cardano to soar as altseason approaches Avalanche eyes $62 resistance Polkadot on the brink of major breakout Kaspa: Potential surge above $0.22 resistance Conclusion While Bitcoin and Ethereum grab most of the spotlight, some overlooked cryptocurrencies are showing immense potential. These five select altcoins are poised for massive growth, with predictions of high values by Christmas. DOGEN: An alpha meme token capturing the crypto scene DOGE, SHIB, and FLOKI — the real alpha is here, DOGEN. Built for the strongest, boldest, and most fearless holders, DOGEN is the ultimate meme token for taking over the market. It’s not for the faint-hearted — it’s for those with the guts to chase greatness and the drive to win big. Frogs can leap away because DOGEN is here with the intention to rule. This Solana-powered beast has advanced from day one, with a 700% surge expected in the coming months. DOGEN also aims for thousand-fold gains that will redefine what meme tokens can achieve. Notably, DOGEN rewards its hardcore believers with an exclusive airdrop. Joining in is simple: Flex social media game, grab tokens during the presale, and recruit new members to the DOGEN army with a referral link. Every recruit earns their recruiter 20% of the golden points from the token buys. DOGEN’s referral system is as alpha as it gets. Investors also earn 7% from every token their direct recruits (1st level) buy using their referral code. As such, the more recruits, the bigger the rewards. As the altseason approaches, DOGEN holders could be among the ones leading the charge. DOGE is set to be a ticket to an exclusive community of winners to will enjoy luxurious campaigns, killer perks, and the best deals in the game. DOGEN is more than a token — it’s a lifestyle. Posh cars, stacks of cash, and unforgettable experiences are just the beginning for DOGEN holders who refuse to settle for less. Interested investors can join the DOGEN presale to flex hard and potentially earn big . Cardano to soar as altseason approaches Cardano currently trades between $1.06 and $1.33, showing stability despite a slight 0.43% drop over the past week. Impressively, it has surged over 157% in the last month and more than 171% over six months, reflecting strong upward momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 34, nearing oversold territory, which hints at a possible upward swing. If ADA breaks past the nearest resistance at $1.46, it could aim for the next target at $1.73, marking a substantial increase from current levels. With the altcoin season on the horizon and bullish market sentiments rising, ADA has significant potential to climb higher. Avalanche eyes $62 resistance Avalanche is moving within the $47-$58 range, with a 76% gain over the past month. The token’s price is nearing the resistance level at $62. A break above this could see it reach the next resistance at $73, representing a significant increase from current prices. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are both around $52, indicating a period of consolidation. The RSI is below 40, suggesting the coin is not overbought. With a low stochastic value, there is potential for further upside movement. The MACD is nearly flat, hinting at a possible trend reversal. AVAX may be set for a breakout as the altcoin market gains strength. You might also like: Dogen poised to overtake Dogecoin: 5,000% rally anticipated as whales join the frenzy Polkadot on the brink of major breakout The Polkadot price has shown impressive growth over the past month, surging by over 125%. The coin is currently trading in the range of $8.66 to $11.90, with strong potential to test the nearest resistance level at $13.40. Polkadot’s RSI and Stochastic indicators are in oversold regions, suggesting a bullish reversal soon. If the token breaks through this resistance, it could aim for the next level at $16.64, marking significant gains from current prices. With the anticipation of an altcoin season and a global crypto bull run, Polkadot stands poised for substantial growth in the near future. Kaspa: Potential surge above $0.22 resistance Kaspa is showing strong signs of growth. In the past month, its price has increased by over 61%. The current price range hovers between $0.16 and $0.20, sitting above the 100-day simple moving average of $0.17. The RSI at 44.86 suggests the coin is not overbought. With the nearest resistance level at $0.22, a breakout above this could see the price target the next resistance at $0.26. This would represent a potential gain of over 30% from current levels, with the bullish momentum supported by a 6.8% rise over the past week.. Conclusion Although ADA, AVAX, DOT, and KAS may have limited short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as a standout, designed for those who seek the best in life. Inspired by successful predecessors, it aims to build a community of leaders and offer real benefits, including exclusive campaigns and perks for early adopters.

This decision follows a plea agreement between former CEO Alex Mashinsky and United States prosecutors. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams requested the Southern District of New York’s District Court to delay Cohen-Pavon’s sentencing until after Mashinsky’s, which is set for April 2025. Williams highlighted that Cohen-Pavon’s testimony and shared information could significantly determine Mashinsky’s sentence. Judge John Koeltl approved the request, officially postponing the sentencing hearing. While granting the request, Judge Koeltl ordered both parties to report to the court on April 18 for an update. This will be ten days after Mashinky’s sentencing. The judge will likely make a sentencing to Cohen-Pavon on this date. Cohen-Pavon had earlier pleaded guilty to four counts of felony charges. Mashinsky’s agreement to plead guilty changed the proceedings While everything seemed to have fallen into place for Cohen-Pavon, Mashinsky’s agreement to plead guilty has altered the flow. On December 3, Mashinsky agreed to plead guilty to two charges as part of a deal with prosecutors. If the Judge gives a maximum sentence to the two charges, Mashinsky could spend up to 30 years in prison on both charges served consecutively. Cohen-Pavon and Mashinsky were indicted in July 2023. They were accused of misleading Celsius users to maximize profits by manipulating prices. When the two were indicted, Cohen-Pavon was not in the US, and he had pleaded not guilty by then. However, when he was finally arrested in September 2023, he pleaded guilty to several charges. Among the listed charges were conspiracy to commit price manipulation, wire fraud, manipulation of security prices, and securities fraud. Despite pleading guilty to these charges, Cohen-Pavon had never been sentenced, as he was scheduled for sentencing on December 11. Cohen-Pavon might Influence Mashinky’s sentencing Most people following the case wonder how Cohen-Pavon’s information to the court could sway the Judge’s consideration during Mashinsky’s sentencing. The former CEO pleaded guilty to misinforming users about Celsius’s approval from US regulators and not selling his CEL token holdings. As part of his plea deal, he was open to forfeiting $48 million in proceeds from the scheme. While awaiting his sentencing, Cohen-Pavon has been enjoying foreign travels freely. He was allowed to return to Israel from New York after posting a bond worth $500,000. Judge Koeltl also allowed him to travel to Singapore in September. The period coincided with the Token 2049 crypto conference in Singapore, leading to speculations of his attendance. Celsius went bankrupt in 2022. By then, it was a top crypto platform that had collapsed due to a market downturn. Most users lost their money locked in their accounts, leaving them in anguish. The investors were relieved in November when a Bankruptcy judge approved a reorganization plan for Celsius, making it possible for debtors to distribute about $2 billion to the platform’s creditors. The company indicated that they will begin repaying customers by next year. While the Celsius case is still active, these executives won’t be the first to face jail time in the crypto space. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried went through the legal process and was jailed. Besides, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao served his term in prison. The two were facing different charges.

Amid this correction, bearish tendencies among investors on Binance have surfaced. A recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost highlights a significant trend where Binance’s taker buy-sell ratio for Ethereum turned “sharply negative” at the $4,000 mark. This suggests that traders on the exchange have predominantly adopted a selling stance. Related Reading: Sell Pressure Rises As Ethereum Tests $4,000 Resistance—What’s Next For ETH? Ethereum Tug of War According to Darkfost, the bearish sentiment on Binance has persisted since the start of November, coinciding with Ethereum’s approach to this critical resistance level. The analyst pointed out that while this bearish sentiment could typically signal a potential reversal, Ethereum’s price movement has defied seeing high bearish inclination, driven by other influential factors. Notably, demand for Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) has surged, showcasing a growing institutional interest that continues to support Ethereum’s price action. The surge in demand for Ethereum ETFs signals a shift in market stance where institutional players increasingly influence price movements. Institutional interest, evidenced by consistent inflows into Ethereum-focused investment products seems to have been pivotal in offsetting the selling pressure observed among retail traders on Binance. ETH Market Performance And Outlook So far, Ethereum has seen a significant correction in its price decreasing to as low as $3,616 as of today. At the time of writing, the asset currently trades at a price of $3,621 down by nearly 6% in the past day. Notably, this price performance has unsurprisingly dropped the asset’s market cap by over $40 billion, falling from over $490 billion seen last week Friday to $434 billion today. Interestingly, despite this price decrease, Ethereum’s daily trading volume has seen an opposite trend rising from below $60 billion on December 6 to now at $72 billion. Given the current market condition, it is likely that the increase in ETH’s volume is coming from sell-offs.

According to data from Coinglass, in the past 24 hours , 526,828 traders were liquidated with the total liquidations coming in at $1.58 billion. Out of this total liquidations, ETH accounts for roughly $234.72 million. Long liquidations dominates reaching $208.83 million. Short traders also had their share losses registering $25.89 million worth of ETH liquidations. Regardless of this, analysts are still optimistic about Ethereum, suggesting that the current price dip is quite “healthy” for ETH’s market. $ETH remains strong in HTF!#Ethereum weekly healthy correction will be left behind as a RETEST and pumped hard! https://t.co/o78x8eBucf pic.twitter.com/YSixFqjuLQ — EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL 💹🧲📈 (@EtherNasyonaL) December 10, 2024 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",Ethereum|altcoin|crypto|crypto market|ETH|ethereum|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-11 00:30:16

There are already projections that the XRP price could spike to $100, and when this happens, Dogecoin (DOGE) will settle at $7. However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , a new AI-based crypto token, is sparking higher FOMO as it is slated for a 30,000% rally to $5.2. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Raises Investors’ Anticipation As It Sets Itself For A 30,000% Pump Even with the positivity around XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE), WallitIQ (WLTQ) is gaining more attention for its revolutionary crypto wallet that maximizes the strength of artificial intelligence (AI) to the fullest. Additionally, the way this platform uses AI and machine learning (ML) tools to ease crypto management and support smart investment is definitely a significant draw. It’s no wonder speculations are pointing to a possible 30,000% pump for its WLTQ token to $5.2. Currently, the WLTQ token is selling for $0.0243 after completing its initial presale stage, where it rose by 42% from $0.0171 and garnered over $2 million. Now, WallitIQ ( WLTQ ) is undergoing its newly commenced Stage 2 presale but is already nearing a $500,000 revenue milestone, indicating its potential for fast-paced growth in the DeFi and AI crypto market. Besides its presale performance, WallitIQ’s unique features are another reason analysts are optimistic that the WLTQ will surge 30,000% to $5.2. For starters, WallitIQ (WLTQ) boasts an automated portfolio rebalancing — a feature that enables optimal asset relocation in real-time, thereby mitigating risks and enhancing ROI. The platform also offers a Scan QR to Pay feature while using AI to effectively detect anomalies and provide predictive analysis, helping its users make smart investment decisions. Furthermore, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers top-notch security, user-convenient interface and multilingual AI chatbots. According to analysts, this innovation is one of the vital catalysts that will spark a 30,000% rally for WallitIQ’s token, potentially outperforming XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE). WallitIQ (WLTQ) is already listed on CoinMarketCap, with a few DEX listings awaiting its token when its presale elapses. This is poised to attract significant attention to its wallet-based platform which has top security features like an advanced Escrow Connect and biometric authentication systems to ensure close security on users’ assets. XRP Price May Hit $100 And Spark A $7 Rise For Dogecoin (DOGE) The XRP price has been on one of the most shocking, yet impressive journeys in the past month. Despite its legal issue, the XRP price pulled out of its sluggish phase as it priced above its long-standing $0.5 range to hit $2 a few days back. Now, the XRP price is held in a weekly range of $1.46 – $2.82, and it is showing potential to hit $100 in due time. With the XRP possibly approaching the $100 price mark, Dogecoin (DOGE) is also expected to settle around $7, aligning with the momentum of the XRP price. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price has shown over 150% pump in the past week while receiving positive momentum. Should the XRP price hit $100, it wouldn’t be surprising for Dogecoin (DOGE) to also take a leap to $7 from its current $0.4 price mark. Either way, investors are closely watching the XRP price as it maintains bullishness. Conclusion While XRP appears to be on a bullish run, its projected price target of $100 seems highly improbable compared to WallitIQ (WLTQ) , reaching $5.20. For XRP to hit $100, its market capitalization would need to soar to an unrealistic $5.2 trillion. In contrast, WallitIQ’s strategic positioning in the AI market and its SolidProof- audited smart contract will attract significant traction, potentially rallying its price by 30,000%. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) token is currently going for a low price of $0.0243. However, it won’t stay at this price for long. The platform is set for another price shift to $0.0420 in stage 3, giving investors a remarkable 72% profit. So, Invest in WallitIQ (WLTQ) now while it’s still in presale. According to analysts, with its one-of-a-kind features and immense growth potential, the value of WLTQ tokens is sure to surge by an impressive 30,000% and hit $5.2.

In a new strategy session, Cowen takes a look at the MVRV Z-score, which compares the market cap of BTC to the value of each coin the last time it was moved to gauge whether Bitcoin is undervalued, overvalued, or at fair value. Cowen notes that in the past, market cycle tops have occurred when the MVRV Z-Score hits a certain range. “Historically, market cycle tops for Bitcoin have corresponded to an MVRV Z-Score somewhere between seven to 10, at around seven to 10. In fact, the first cycle top, the MVRV Z-Score topped out at around 7.68. The last one topped out at around 7.15. And you can see the ones in between went even higher. Again, right now, the MVRV Z-Score high for this cycle is 3.29, but this is another metric that certainly could be useful in helping to confirm whether a high corresponds to a market cycle top or if that true euphoric sentiment is there, or if we just think it’s there. That’s kind of the thing about back in March 2024, it felt like the market was overheated, and it was, we got a mid-cycle top. But, a look at this chart would have helped to suggest that it was not in fact, a market cycle top. So I do think this is another chart that we can put in our toolkit to help us better navigate Bitcoin.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube At time of writing, BTC is trading at $96,253.
