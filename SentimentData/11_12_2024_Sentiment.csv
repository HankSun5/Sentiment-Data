The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyzing five cryptos that could turn $500 to $50,000 with 10,000% growth potential. Table of Contents Catzilla: Dominating meme coins with high potential Raydium: Solana liquidity integrated with Serum DEX Neiro Coin Uniswap’s UNI: Empowering governance in DeFi Jupiter Conclusion In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, certain digital assets are generating buzz for their potential to deliver staggering returns by 2025. These five carefully selected cryptocurrencies could soar, potentially turning $500 into $50,000. Catzilla: Dominating meme coins with high potential In the wild and unpredictable world of meme coins, few newcomers manage to roar as loudly as Catzilla. Inspired by the cultural juggernauts of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE, Catzilla combines viral meme appeal with the promise of unprecedented returns. What truly sets it apart is its creative backbone — a Godzilla-like feline tearing through a Japanese kaiju-inspired storyline. This narrative not only electrifies gamers and anime fans but also captivates investors searching for the next big crypto phenomenon. With a 700% ROI already on the radar, Catzilla’s carefully structured 14-stage presale allows investors to secure early positions as the token price ascends with each stage. Beyond the numbers, Catzilla will deliver on its triple value promise: Epic gameplay: A thrilling game infused with anime and kaiju mayhem, offering players rewards for their engagement. A mission that matters: Rallying the crypto community around fairness and decentralization, Catzilla will channel a rebellious spirit to combat greed and manipulation. An engaged community: Crypto enthusiasts, cat lovers, and anime fans to unite and fuel Catzilla’s meteoric rise. Catzilla is here to disrupt. By embracing its monstrous persona, the token symbolizes a return to the playful, community-driven essence of meme coins. The meme coin will also go further to offer a transparent and equitable ecosystem where every participant has a shot at success. Interested investors can join the Catzilla craze through its presale.

Unlike other automated market makers, Raydium provides on-chain liquidity to a central order book. This means that funds deposited into Raydium are turned into limit orders on Serum’s order books. This allows Raydium’s liquidity providers to access all of Serum’s trading flow and existing liquidity. The native token, RAY, is used for staking to earn fees, receiving allocations in initial token offerings, and participating in governance votes. With its integration into Solana and Serum, Raydium has potential in decentralized finance. Neiro Coin Neiro Coin is a new cryptocurrency that honors Neiro, a Shiba Inu adopted by the woman who owned Kabosu, the famous dog behind the Doge meme. Neiro Coin is entirely owned and managed by its community. The project aims to build on the popularity of the Doge meme and the community spirit. The Neiro Coin has potential for growth. In the current market cycle, its appeal lies in the connection to a well-loved meme and its community-driven approach.

Launched in September 2020, it allows holders to vote on aspects like fee structures and token distribution. Uniswap is a decentralized exchange on the Ethereum blockchain that uses an automated liquidity protocol, enabling trading without an order book and giving users full control of their funds. Its open-source nature and free token listing make it accessible and secure. Currently, Uniswap stands as the fourth-largest DeFi platform with over $3 billion in assets. The UNI token’s potential lies in its governance utility and the platform’s continued growth, making it attractive in the current market cycle. Jupiter Jupiter is a prominent DeFi platform on the Solana blockchain, recognized as the most popular DEX aggregator globally. It pools resources to enable efficient token swaps, futures trading, and decentralized stablecoin management. While originally focused on liquidity aggregation, Jupiter has expanded to include GMX-style perpetual futures and is launching its own decentralized stablecoin to mitigate custodial and regulatory risks. These developments position Jupiter for potential growth within Solana’s ecosystem, indicating that the JUP coin may see significant gains in the current market cycle. Conclusion While RAY, NEIRO, UNI, and JUP each hold unique promise in their respective domains, Catzilla rises as the standout choice for those chasing massive gains. Combining an ambitious 700% ROI presale, a captivating narrative, and a community-driven mission, Catzilla is more than a meme coin — it’s a symbol of financial rebellion and creative ingenuity. With its unique blend of gameplay, fairness, and a bold persona, it offers an opportunity to be part of something bigger.

He criticized Biden’s regulations, credited his father for Bitcoin’s rise past $100,000, and highlighted Bitcoin’s advantages over traditional finance. He promised the Trump family’s continued support for digital assets. Eric Trump, the vice president of the Trump Organization, delivered a powerful speech at the Bitcoin MENA 2024 conference in Abu Dhabi on December 9, after Trump’s victory. Today, @EricTrump shared his views on the significance of #Bitcoin and the role that he and @realDonaldTrump expect it to play in the future. The speech is extraordinary and I highly recommend watching it in full. pic.twitter.com/0WJooTcOvW — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) December 10, 2024 Eric Trump Predicts Bitcoin Eric predicted that Bitcoin would soon surpass the $1 million mark and called it the “cornerstone of a financial revolution.” In his address, Eric described Bitcoin as a “global asset” and stressed its importance in a world increasingly threatened by inflation, political instability, and natural disasters. “Bitcoin is the future of finance,” he proclaimed, emphasizing that its decentralized nature and fixed supply of 21 million coins make it a powerful hedge against the traditional financial system’s inefficiencies. “Bitcoin eliminates the need for tens of thousands of bankers pushing paperwork for exorbitant fees,” Eric added, making a strong argument for how cryptocurrency can simplify global transactions. He also took the opportunity to criticize the Biden administration’s stance on cryptocurrency, accusing it of waging a “war” on the sector through aggressive regulatory measures, particularly the lawsuits filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Eric highlighted the collapse of FTX as a turning point for the industry, noting that the previous administration’s actions had these uncertainties. Trump’s role in Bitcoin “Under my father’s leadership, America will lead the digital revolution,” he declared, receiving loud applause many of whom were sporting “Make Bitcoin Great Again” caps. He credited President-elect Donald Trump with driving Bitcoin’s recent surge past the $100,000 mark, stating, “When Bitcoin hit $100,000, I immediately called my father to share the good news.” He further argued that those who embrace Bitcoin now, including governments and institutions, will be the biggest winners in the digital revolution. “Bitcoin is instantly liquid, borderless, and a global currency,” he said. “It doesn’t rely on traditional banking systems. It’s not subject to corrupt governments.” He added that Bitcoin’s price would continue to climb, eventually reaching $1 million per coin. “A lot more eyes will be open when Bitcoin hits $1 million, and I’m confident it’s going to hit $1 million.” “It’s a shift in how companies like ours receive money,” he explained, referring to the Trump Organization’s involvement in cryptocurrency. Eric promised that the Trump family would remain steadfast supporters of digital assets, ensuring they continue to play a significant role in the global financial landscape.

Once a leader in Bitcoin mining, China banned the practice in 2021 but still contributes around 10% of global mining activity. At the Bitcoin MENA 2024 conference in Abu Dhabi, Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital made a prediction that China will return to Bitcoin mining and likely integrate the digital currency into its reserve assets by the end of 2025. China’s Re-entry into Bitcoin China’s relationship with Bitcoin has been complicated. In the past, the country was the global leader in Bitcoin mining, contributing to over 65% of the global hash power. However, in 2021, the Chinese government-imposed a ban on cryptocurrency mining and trading to limit financial risks and promote its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan. Since then, the ban has majorly impacted Bitcoin’s mining operations, with many miners relocating to more crypto-friendly regions. Though there is a ban, Scaramucci pointed out that around 10% of global mining continues within China’s borders. Scaramucci believes that the U.S.’s increasing approach towards Bitcoin will push other nations, including China, to reconsider their positions on the digital asset. He predicts that by next year, China will not only restart Bitcoin mining but may also add it to its reserves that signaling a potential shift in the country’s approach to digital currency. “By this time next year, the Chinese will be back in the Bitcoin game,” Scaramucci stated confidently at MENA, adding that China’s re-entry with Bitcoin would be strengthen its global economic position. Bitcoin Adoption Trump has promised to create a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve, that the country is stabling for financial stability and resilience. This has encouraged other countries, including Russia and Brazil, where lawmakers are proposing the integration of Bitcoin into their financial reserves as national assets. Scaramucci compares the global adoption of Bitcoin to a “match-selling race,” that no country can afford to ignore the growing trend. “You’re not going to be in a position in the world, in developing economies, where the U.S. is moving towards Bitcoin, and you are not moving towards Bitcoin,” he stated. The concept of strategic Bitcoin reserves has got attention in 2024. Countries like Russia, Brazil are actively considering Bitcoin into its treasury. Even within the U.S., with lawmakers such as Senator Cynthia Lummis advocating for the acquisition of Bitcoin holdings over a multi-year period. Other U.S. states, like Pennsylvania, have also shown interest in allocating Bitcoin. This shows Bitcoin is no longer seen as a speculative asset but a strategic financial tool. S caramucci believes this trend will only accelerate, with Bitcoin becoming an increasingly important asset in global financial portfolios. As the U.S. and other nations explore Bitcoin reserves, China’s re-engagement with Bitcoin could solidify the digital asset’s place in the global financial system. According to Scaramucci Bitcoin reserves and mining, China would regain its role as a major player in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Litecoin Has Continued To Witness Significant Activity Recently In a new post on X, IntoTheBlock has discussed what the various key on-chain indicators have been like for the Litecoin network recently. Below is the infographic shared by the analytics firm. According to the data, there are currently around 370,000 daily active addresses on the Litecoin blockchain. An address is said to be ‘active’ when it participates in some kind of transaction activity on the network, whether as a receiver or sender. Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLing Rewards: Long-Term Holders Selling At 326% Profit The metric’s value basically tells us about the amount of users that are using the cryptocurrency. Another indicator, the daily transactions, provides information about the exact measure of activity that these users are taking part in. At present, LTC users are making 200,000 transactions every day. IntoTheBlock has pointed out that this level of user activity is higher than on other networks like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA). “Much of this activity stems from Litecoin being one of the few cryptocurrencies actively used for payments,” notes the analytics firm. LTC offers cheap and fast transactions, so it has always been a network preferred as a mode of payments. The activity-related metrics continuing to be high (in fact, further growing over the past month) implies this selling point of the chain is still attracting users. Another metric in the infographic that correlates to activity is transaction volume, which keeps track of the daily total amount of USD value that’s being transferred to the network. Impressively, this indicator currently stands at $10.27 billion, which is higher than the coin’s total market cap. While Litecoin is continuing to do well in terms of activity-related metrics, the cryptocurrency has remained stagnant in terms of price growth. A result of this is that just 72% of the addresses on the network are sitting in some unrealized gain. Of course, this still means the majority are above water, but other networks like Bitcoin (BTC) have it close to the 100% mark right now due to the bull run. That said, another way to look at this could perhaps be that Litecoin has more relative room to run, since the risk of a mass selloff goes up the more investors get into profits. Related Reading: Analyst Sets $4.40 XRP Target As 3rd-Straight Bull Pennant Forms It seems that a strong majority of the Litecoin userbase also thinks similarly, as 78% of the 7.94 million Litecoin holders have been HODLing since more than a year. “As one of the older Layer 1 networks still seeing significant usage, Litecoin shouldn’t be overlooked,” says IntoTheBlock. It only remains to be seen, however, whether LTC can finally translate its positive on-chain metrics into price appreciation or not. LTC Price Litecoin has suffered a plunge of around 8% over the last 24 hours, which has taken its price to $113.

Crying Kamala (CRYKAMA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CRYKAMA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Crying Kamala can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crying Kamala could become the next viral memecoin. Crying Kamala launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crying Kamala on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crying Kamala by entering its contract address – 5eCJhSGBUN4YwJHLU9ZcWjrjmoufVznjzNBHfo4TN1P7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRYKAMA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-10 23:06:00

Per Chosun Ilbo , the National Assembly voted in favor of a legal amendment that will delay the launch of crypto tax until January 2027. However, both major parties agreed on the details of this amendment prior to President Yoon Seok-yul’s ill-fated decision to declare martial law on December 3. South Korean opposition leader Lee Jae-myung sought to force through a highly contested budget Tuesday in a show of political clout as he seeks to build momentum for another impeachment bid against President Yoon Suk Yeol https://t.co/g2kIskvpFx — Bloomberg (@business) December 10, 2024 Martial Law Chaos Derails Crypto Progress The media outlet reported that the National Assembly, which is now under heightened pressure to approve next year’s budget, has “moved into full-blown impeachment mode.” The crypto industry is still “waiting for legislative clarity.” But firms are now “braces for another sluggish wait” for change, Chosun wrote. The crypto tax law passed in the very nick of time, gaining approval on the very last day of the current plenary session. The bill had been slated for debate on December 4. Had the Assembly failed to vote on December 10, crypto tax would have launched as scheduled on Janaury 1, 2025. An All-stop Order The media outlet wrote that all “virtual asset-related” issues have now been pushed back in priority. It added that parliamentarians have agreed to an “all-stop” on all crypto-related matters. This means that a number of pressing crypto-related matters will likely remain in limbo until mid-2025. These include: South Korea’s long-standing initial coin offering (ICO) ban, which Yoon promised to “review” prior to his election A decision on whether domestic companies can buy crypto with their balance sheets A decision on securities token offering (STO) legalization, another Yoon manifesto promise A ruling on the legality of Bitcoin spot ETFs The newspaper wrote that all these issues and more “have been buried under the impeachment issue, making it impossible to expect a vote” on any of them. Instead, the National Assembly is “focusing on issues such as martial law, impeachment, and the next presidential election.” LIVE: Thousands of protesters are expected to gather in front of the parliament in Seoul, South Korea https://t.co/p4HiW6AeAs — Reuters (@Reuters) December 10, 2024 A Lifeline for Corporate Crypto Investors? The situation is not completely hopeless for crypto firms, however. The Financial Services Commission has recently “finalized step-by-step guidelines ” for corporate crypto accounts. In theory, it could implement most of these steps without relying on the National Assembly’s help. The newspaper wrote that STO-related discussions would “not progress until the first half of next year,” despite the fact that both parties broadly agree on the matter. Some officers, soldiers resisted martial law orders in their own ways https://t.co/yspytERgLT — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) December 10, 2024 Moving Overseas? An unnamed National Assembly “insider” was quoted as stating: “The martial law crisis has taken all of the National Assembly’s attention. So it is hard to justify dealing with virtual assets now, even though there are many outstanding bills that need work. We should view this as an indefinite postponement. It will last at least until the impeachment situation is resolved.” However, the outlet noted that there are now “concerns” that more domestic “blockchain and virtual asset companies and investors” will “relocate overseas due to the martial law situation.” Dealing with the aftermath of the short-lived martial law in South Korea appears much more complicated that it may seem. #MartialLaw #SouthKorea https://t.co/xZp3Iu5JRB — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) December 10, 2024 Crypto players have urged Seoul to roll out clearer guidelines. But it seems they will be left waiting until mid-2025 for answers. “There is a lot to discuss in the cryptoasset sector. But the current situation is regrettable. In the US, President-elect Donald Trump is looking to appoint people to handle virtual asset policies before he even takes office. It is urgent for South Korea to act quickly, too.” Kim Gap-rae, Senior Researcher, Capital Market Research Institute The post Martial Law Chaos: South Korea Pauses ‘All’ Work on Crypto Legislation appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Regulation|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2024-12-10 23:30:00

While Bitcoin and Ethereum are grappling with price dips, altcoins like Tron and Celestia are making steady gains, standing out for their innovation and resilience. Tron recently faced a slight dip, but its network activity is off the charts, showcasing its utility in DeFi and NFTs. Meanwhile, Celestia, the modular blockchain pioneer, is riding high on growing adoption and fresh partnerships that signal strong potential for long-term growth. Amid this excitement, Qubetics is carving out its place as the go-to crypto for savvy investors. Qubetics ($TICS) is redefining how crypto can solve real-world problems. Unlike older projects that struggled with usability and accessibility, Qubetics is simplifying crypto for everyday users. With its non-custodial multi-chain wallet, integrations with major financial systems, and an ROI potential of 900% post-presale, Qubetics is poised to revolutionize digital payments. Let’s break down why $TICS, Tron, and Celestia are the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): A Wallet for Everyone Imagine a world where paying with crypto is as easy as swiping your phone for Apple Pay. That’s the promise of Qubetics. Its non-custodial multi-chain wallet eliminates the hassle of traditional crypto transactions. No KYC requirements? Check. Smart contract conversion that turns crypto into fiat at the point of sale? Double-check. Whether you’re shopping online or running a business, this wallet is designed to make life simpler. Take small business owners, for instance. With Qubetics’ wallet, they can accept crypto without worrying about market volatility. The built-in smart contract conversion ensures stable payments, protecting them from sudden dips in value. On the flip side, imagine an everyday user like Sarah, who’s tired of juggling different wallets and platforms. With Qubetics, all her assets are in one place, and she can pay just like she would with a debit card. Currently in its 12th presale phase , Qubetics has already raised over $5.4M, sold more than 303M tokens, and attracted over 8,300 holders. At $0.031 per token, it’s a steal for early investors, especially with a 10% price increase coming next week. Post-presale, the price is set to skyrocket to $0.25, offering massive returns for those who get in now. With its unique features and community-first approach, Qubetics is a no-brainer for anyone looking to invest in the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Tron (TRX): The DeFi and NFT Powerhouse Tron has been around for a while, but it’s not just sitting back and resting on its laurels. The network is bustling with activity, particularly in the DeFi and NFT spaces. Recent data shows a slight dip in TRX prices, but its on-chain metrics paint a different picture. Active wallet addresses are hitting new highs, and transaction volumes are through the roof. Tron’s low transaction fees and lightning-fast processing times make it a favorite for developers and users alike. One of Tron’s standout achievements this year has been its expansion into decentralized storage solutions. Partnering with major platforms, Tron is aiming to be more than just another blockchain. It’s becoming an ecosystem. This focus on utility is why TRX is one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. For investors, Tron offers stability and long-term potential. Analysts predict TRX could break through resistance levels and hit new highs by early 2025. If you’re looking for a reliable altcoin with real-world use cases, Tron deserves a spot in your portfolio alongside Qubetics. Celestia (TIA): The Modular Blockchain Trailblazer Celestia is shaking things up with its modular blockchain architecture. Unlike traditional monolithic chains, Celestia separates consensus from execution, making it highly scalable and efficient. This unique approach has caught the attention of developers and enterprises alike, pushing TIA into the spotlight. Recent developments have bolstered Celestia’s position as a top contender in the crypto world. Strategic partnerships and increased adoption among developers have fueled steady gains in TIA’s price. And while it hasn’t experienced the wild price swings of other cryptos, its consistent growth signals strong investor confidence. Imagine a future where developers can build custom blockchains without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. That’s what Celestia offers. It’s not just a blockchain; it’s the foundation for a whole new way of thinking about decentralized applications. With its focus on scalability and innovation, Celestia is undoubtedly one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 for those seeking cutting-edge tech with long-term potential. Top Cryptos for December 2024 Choosing the right crypto to invest in can be overwhelming, but focusing on projects with strong fundamentals and real-world applications makes it easier. Qubetics ($TICS) stands out for its innovative wallet and massive presale success. Tron (TRX) continues to dominate in DeFi and NFTs, offering stability and growth. And Celestia (TIA) is pioneering modular blockchain technology, making it a top pick for tech enthusiasts and long-term investors. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS), Tron (TRX), and Celestia (TIA) as the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 . Don’t wait too long—these opportunities won’t last forever!

Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) commissioner Hester Pierce calls for the next government to reform the crypto industry, one of them by stopping the bottleneck of government regulations . She noted that the digital asset industry faces obstacles to accessing the services they need. Therefore, she urges the government to stop preventing the crypto industry and start to move forward. The newly-elected government also needs to provide a clear framework for the commission to supervise this emerging industry. Clarity of framework is required to make a clear stance for the regulator and the market. As a regulator, she mentioned that the government should jointly work with the industry to evaluate the existing rules and provide any modifications that are needed. “Work with entities involved in crypto to try to figure out how the existing rules apply and where adjustments need to be made. And that needs to be a group exercise. It needs to be done in the public so that everyone can participate in it. And I think we can get to a good place to do that relatively quickly,” Pierce says on the interview with Fox Business Read more: Why Paul Atkins, Trump’s SEC chair pick, gives crypto a reason to hope again SEC under Atkins’s leadership Pierce, at the same interview, stated that the newly-picked chairman for next year, Paul Atkins, “is very good at thinking about how to use the government efficiently and effectively to solve problems”. She was also not shocked by Gary Gensler’s decision to step down from his position due to the change in the head of government. On Ripple’s lawsuit, Pierce has not replied with any comment yet, but this long process of legal actions, which was already taken by 2020, is the most expensive and inefficient way to regulate.

The partnership will improve the management of tokenized assets and facilitate the exchange between public and private blockchains. It will ensure improved data communication between various blockchain networks. Chainlink and Coinbase Partner To Accelerate Institutional Adoption of Tokenized Assets In a recent statement , Coinbase has stated that it will incorporate Chainlink’s CCIP into its Project Diamond. The integration is targeting to improve the compatibility between different chains in regards to tokenized assets. With CCIP, Coinbase will be able to bridge assets between the public and the private blockchain. Hence, the partnership will make it possible for tokenized assets to be usable across many blockchain networks. Project Diamond, which operates under the regulatory framework of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), is designed to serve institutional investors and asset managers. With this integration, institutions access secure and compliant solutions for their financial transactions. Additionally, the oracle network’s robust data and interoperability infrastructure will address the rising demand for secure on-chain data. This includes market prices, reference data, and key compliance information such as anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) details. Deputy Chief Investment Officer at Coinbase Asset Management, Marcel Kasumovich, commented, “By integrating the Chainlink standard natively into the Project Diamond platform, powered by Coinbase’s tech stack on Base, we’re paving the way for widespread institutional adoption of digital assets.” Enhancing Cross-Chain Functionality The adoption of the oracle network CCIP in Project Diamond is a significant move to ensure that digital assets are not confined to a single blockchain. This protocol enables the transfer and communication of assets across different networks. Johann Eid, Chief Business Officer at Chainlink Labs emphasized, “ “Coinbase’s adoption of the Chainlink standard for the Project Diamond platform underscores the critical importance of solving the end-to-end lifecycle management of tokenized assets.” The recent rumors of the possible collaboration of Chainlink with BlackRock have boosted LINK token price . As institutional investors start experimenting with the integration of blockchain with conventional finance, the prospects of growth have soared. This has boosted the LINK price as investors have increased their faith in the project’s future. Thus, the cooperation with Coinbase further proves that Chainlink aims to become a crucial provider of services for the digital asset market. As more institutions adopt blockchain and more so in the MENA region, the Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) becomes more valuable.

Dogecoin (DOGE) is still the meme coin king and Dogwifhat (WIF) is establishing itself in the Solana ecosystem. However, a shift is happening with DTX Exchange (DTX), a hybrid utility token breaking records and hitting $9.99 million in presale, and it is looking good for the crypto space. Dogwifhat (WIF) Stays Strong Despite Market Volatility Dogwifhat (WIF) on the Solana blockchain is a serious meme coin contender. Despite a $5 million liquidation event that spooked the market, WIF is up 39% in the last month and getting a lot of attention from investors. WIF has gotten attention because of the price, the community, and marketing. The WIF community has been promoting the token through viral memes and grassroots campaigns on Twitter and Reddit and getting more engagement and visibility. WIF being on the Solana blockchain makes it a low-fee high-speed alternative to other meme coins for traders frustrated with Ethereum-based networks’ congestion. With community events and potential partnerships teased by the devs, WIF’s ecosystem can grow more and WIF will be a serious player in the memecoin space. The chart shows a descending triangle with mixed short-term momentum. But the $3 support has been getting bought in. If it breaks above $4.83, it could be a bullish breakout, and WIF could go to new all-time highs.

Global brands accept DOGE as a payment method, and Elon Musk supports it. In the last month, DOGE has doubled, 391%, since the beginning of the year. On the technical side, an ascending triangle pattern suggests DOGE could rise 18% in the next few weeks to $0.58. Also, whale activity has increased, and big investors recently bought $276 million worth of DOGE, which indicates that they believe in its growth. Source: CoinMarketCap DTX Exchange (DTX): A New Era in Utility Token Investments While meme coins like DOGE and WIF are making headlines, DTX Exchange is changing the game with crypto utility and adoption.

The statement came in response to ongoing debates about the role of burns in driving demand for the token. Community Divided Over Token Burns The discussion was raised when the 1 Cent Dream project announced the completion of its second burn campaign of 250 million SHIB tokens. This initiative aimed to decrease the circulating supply and urged the community to participate in future burn events. While some praised the effort, others criticized Kusama and the team for not implementing more significant burns. A notable comment came from a community member, Gunz0369 , who argued that increased burns are essential for attracting new investors and ensuring the asset’s future growth. Kusama’s Response Kusama countered these claims, arguing that Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) recent success proves its performance is not solely reliant on burns. He noted that despite limited burn activity, the token has achieved a remarkable 192% price increase year-to-date, currently trading at $0.00002986. According to Kusama, focusing exclusively on burns overshadows the broader factors contributing to the token’s growth. He emphasized that the token’s ecosystem, including utility, governance, and strategic partnerships, has been instrumental in driving success. Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Layer 2 blockchain, is a key part of this ecosystem and has boosted sentiment and adoption. Kusama also pointed out that expanding the asset’s use cases and completing ecosystem projects will naturally lead to more burn opportunities. By attracting new users and increasing utility, the token’s circulating supply can be reduced effectively over time. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Shibarium’s Role in the Ecosystem Shibarium has sparked debate within the community regarding its impact on token burns. While some users highlighted its contribution to Shiba Inu’s growth, others questioned its effectiveness in reducing supply. Critics argued that Shibarium relies on the token’s success rather than the other way around. Kusama addressed these concerns by explaining that Shibarium is part of a comprehensive strategy to strengthen the ecosystem. Since its launch, Shibarium has facilitated the burning of over 56 billion SHIB through gas fee allocations. Additionally, the burn portal introduced as part of Shibarium has automatically removed more than 300 million SHIB from circulation. Despite these contributions, Kusama emphasized that no single factor, including Shibarium, can be credited for the asset’s overall success. He reiterated that growth stems from the combined marketing, partnerships, and community engagement efforts. SHIB Burn Statistics Since SHIB’s inception in August 2020, over 410.74 trillion tokens have been burned, significantly reducing its initial supply. However, Kusama and other developers focus on long-term strategies rather than relying solely on token incineration. The lead developer encouraged the community to adopt a balanced perspective, recognizing the importance of innovation, utility, and partnerships in driving the token’s value. While token burns remain a topic of interest for supporters, Kusama’s statement underscores the importance of a multifaceted approach to achieving long-term success. By focusing on utility, strategic partnerships, and ecosystem expansion, the asset claims to sustain its growth and enhance its position in the cryptocurrency market.

From Dogecoin’s meteoric rise to Shiba Inu’s staggering community growth, these tokens have proven they’re more than just punchlines—they’re opportunities. Now, the next wave of meme coins is gearing up to dominate in 2025, and one name, BTFD Coin , is already stealing the spotlight. Why? With its P2E (play-to-earn) game, staking rewards, and a rapidly expanding community, BTFD isn’t just another meme coin. It’s here to redefine the space. The buzz surrounding BTFD Coin is off the charts, especially after its presale went live on November 26, 2024. Investors flocked to grab a piece of this rising star, pushing the project through 25% of its presale stages in just 24 hours. Now in Stage 10 and priced at $0.0001, BTFD Coin has already raised over $2.8 million, with 4,200 holders and more than 45 billion tokens sold. Analysts are predicting explosive growth, making this presale one of the most talked-about events in crypto right now. But what makes BTFD Coin one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025? And how do Popcat and Turbo fit into this evolving meme coin narrative? Let’s break it down, starting with the hottest meme token of the year— BTFD Coin. BTFD Coin: The Future King of Meme Coins BTFD Coin (short for “Buy The Freakin’ Dip”) has taken the crypto scene by storm. Unlike most meme coins, which rely heavily on hype and community buzz, BTFD brings real utility to the table. Its play-to-earn (P2E) game is designed to keep users engaged while earning rewards in $BTFD tokens, creating a sustainable ecosystem. Plus, with staking rewards on offer, holders have every reason to HODL their tokens and watch their investments grow. Let’s talk numbers. BTFD Coin’s presale began at $0.000004 per token, and once it’s listed at $0.0006, early investors could see a jaw-dropping 15,000% return. For example, if you had invested $8,000 in Stage 5, where $BTFD was priced at $0.00005, you would’ve snagged 160 million tokens. At the listing price, those tokens would be worth $96,000. That’s a life-changing gain right there. The presale performance alone speaks volumes about the project’s potential. Within just 14 days, it smashed through the $2.5 million mark, and it’s now sitting comfortably at over $2.8 million. The community? Over 4,200 strong and growing daily. With only six stages left in the presale, FOMO (fear of missing out) is real, and for good reason. Analysts are already predicting a surge in $BTFD’s price post-listing, with some speculating it could hit $0.002 or higher by mid-2025. If you’re looking for one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025, this is it. The presale is your golden ticket. Don’t sleep on it. Popcat: The Internet Sensation Turned Crypto Star Popcat, inspired by the viral internet meme of a cat “popping” its mouth, is another meme coin making waves. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Popcat combines meme culture with innovative tokenomics to reward its holders. What sets Popcat apart is its community-driven approach. Every time a user interacts with the Popcat game or spreads the meme online, they earn $POP tokens. It’s like mining, but with memes. Popcat has also been gaining traction for its charitable initiatives. A portion of every transaction fee goes towards animal welfare organisations, which has endeared it to socially conscious investors. And let’s face it—who doesn’t love a good cause? From an investment perspective, Popcat has shown steady growth since its launch. Its initial price of $0.00001 has risen to $0.00008, with analysts forecasting it could hit $0.0005 by the end of 2025. While it doesn’t boast the same explosive presale performance as BTFD Coin, its loyal community and unique use case make it a solid contender. So, should you add Popcat to your portfolio? If you’re all about supporting projects with heart and believe in the power of internet culture, then yes. It’s one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025, especially if you’re in it for the long haul. Turbo: The Speed Demon of Meme Coins Turbo is all about speed—both in its transactions and its rise to fame. Launched as a decentralised meme coin on the Binance Smart Chain, Turbo aims to be the go-to token for quick and cheap transactions. Its ultra-fast blockchain technology and near-zero gas fees make it an attractive option for traders looking to move funds without breaking the bank. What makes Turbo one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025? It’s all in the branding. Turbo has managed to build a reputation as the “speedy meme coin,” and it’s doubling down with strategic partnerships in the gaming and eSports sectors. Gamers can now use $TURBO tokens to purchase in-game assets or participate in tournaments, further integrating the coin into a massive and lucrative market. Since its launch, Turbo has grown its market cap to over $15 million, and its token price has climbed from $0.00002 to $0.00015. While it’s still early days, Turbo’s focus on real-world utility and its thriving gaming partnerships make it a strong contender in the meme coin space. If you’re someone who loves the thrill of fast-paced investments, Turbo might just be your jam. It’s got the potential for big gains, especially as its use case expands in the gaming industry. Conclusion: Secure Your Spot in the Meme Coin Revolution Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that the meme coin space is evolving faster than ever. BTFD Coin, with its presale performance and groundbreaking features, is leading the charge, while Popcat and Turbo bring their own unique strengths to the table. If you’re serious about future-proofing your portfolio, now’s the time to act. The BTFD Coin presale is still ongoing, but it’s already in Stage 10, with prices set to rise as it approaches its final stages. Don’t miss your chance to get in early and ride the wave of one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and be part of the next big thing in crypto. Opportunities like this don’t come around every day. Are you ready to secure your spot?

Crypto King Musk (MUSKKING), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKKING is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Crypto King Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crypto King Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Crypto King Musk launched with over $7,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crypto King Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Crypto King Musk by entering its contract address – v2jWiNpR1m8gHARdM39GosZ8muaxZpowpBgWgWTSCev – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKKING. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-11 00:02:00

At press time, DOGE price was trading at $0.3934, a 6.15% decline from the 24-hour high. Amid this dip, whales have been actively transferring large amounts of DOGE, fueling speculation about a potential price rally. Dogecoin Whale Activity Triggers Rally Speculation In the past few hours, large transfers of Dogecoin have caught the attention of market participants. According to Whale Alert, over 61 million DOGE, worth approximately $23.5 million, were transferred from an unknown wallet to the Robinhood platform. This was followed by another transfer of nearly 85.4 million DOGE, valued at around $32.9 million. These large transactions come amid heightened market interest and could signal significant developments for the price of Dogecoin. Whale movements are often viewed as indicators of potential market shifts, particularly when such large sums are moved to exchanges. Traders and investors may be watching these transfers closely, speculating whether they signal the beginning of a price rally. As larger market participants move their positions, volatility in Dogecoin’s price could increase, leading to potential price swings in the coming days. Will DOGE Price Surge to $3? Several analysts are keeping a close eye on Dogecoin’s price action amid these large whale transactions. Ali Martinez, a crypto analyst, recently stated that Dogecoin is still in the early stages of its bullish cycle. He points to a potential price rise to $3 during the current bull run, with long-term projections suggesting a rise to as high as $18. Martinez bases his prediction on the weekly chart’s regression channel, which suggests that DOGE still has room for upward momentum. However, he acknowledges that the market could face some fluctuations before these price levels are reached. Despite the recent decline in Dogecoin’s price, analysts are optimistic about its medium-to-long-term prospects. Source: Coinglass However, DOGE’s open interest dipped by 12%, and its derivatives trading volume decreased by 10%, signaling a slight reduction in market activi Technical Breakout Sparks Renewed Optimism Technical analysis has also been pointing to a potential breakout for Dogecoin. Trader Tardigrade, another crypto analyst, notes that DOGE price has recently broken out of a Symmetrical Triangle pattern, which often signals a bullish trend. Following this breakout, the price of Dogecoin has not experienced a significant pullback, suggesting that the upward momentum may continue. If Dogecoin retraces to the upper boundary of the triangle at around $0.44, like it has done today, it could present a buying opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the next leg of the rally. Tardigrade suggests that the price could eventually reach $0.65, marking a potential 50% rallyfrom the current levels. Further, he predicts that DOGE might peak within the range of $8 to $10 before a possible retracement, which could provide another entry point for long-term investors. Moreover, from its current price of around $0.39, a rally to $3 would represent a significant increase of 630%, making it an enticing prospect for investors looking to capitalize on Dogecoin’s growth potential.

It’s a little like turning a meme into a serious investment strategy—a perfect combination of internet culture, community vibes, and lucrative returns. The beauty of meme coins lies in their volatility, their cultural relevance, and the potential for sky-high returns if you get in early. Today, we’re focusing on some of the hottest options in the meme coin world: BTFD Coin, Notcoin, and Book of Meme. These are the names driving buzz, excitement, and opportunities for massive returns as we step into the upcoming year. But what’s especially exciting is BTFD Coin’s presale performance , which has been nothing short of phenomenal. The project recently raised a staggering $2.8 million in record time, proving its appeal among retail investors and crypto enthusiasts. Since its presale launch, over 45 billion BTFD Coins have already been sold, and its community—dubbed the Bulls Squad—continues to grow rapidly with more than 4,200 members already invested. With this kind of momentum, BTFD Coin could very well lead the pack when it comes to the best meme coins for significant returns. Ready to explore these meme coin powerhouses? Let’s dive into each one and discover their unique charm, potential growth opportunities, and why they could soon make you the next crypto success story. BTFD Coin: The Presale Phenomenon with Serious Momentum BTFD Coin is undoubtedly riding the wave with its incredibly strong presale numbers and loyal community backing. With its ethos based on “Buy The Dip” (BTFD) and the belief in embracing market opportunities at their lowest points, this meme coin is as much a movement as it is a token. The energy behind BTFD Coin is electric. This isn’t just another meme coin floating in the wind—it has a roadmap, a community-focused ethos, and massive utility potential. From staking rewards (offering up to 90% APY) to its exciting P2E game features , BTFD Coin is setting itself up for long-term sustainability and profitability. Now let’s talk about strategy. If you were to invest $40,000 into BTFD Coin during this presale, your returns could potentially be astronomical. Here’s how: Tokens purchased at the current price: 400,000,000 BTFD tokens (based on $0.0001 per token) Expected price in 2025 (predictions suggest $0.0006): 400,000,000 tokens x $0.0006 = $240,000 Imagine turning $40,000 into $240,000. That’s the kind of ROI that would make even the most seasoned investors sit up and take notice. With this kind of growth trajectory and strong backing, BTFD Coin deserves your attention as one of the best meme coins for significant returns. The bottom line? This presale has the hype, the stats, and the community behind it. If you’re looking to position yourself in a rising meme economy, BTFD Coin is your best bet. Notcoin: Poised for Growth in the Meme Space Next up is Notcoin, a rising star that has steadily gained traction thanks to its unique position and investor support. Notcoin has proven to be a fascinating blend of meme culture, utility, and investor enthusiasm. It’s all about leveraging engagement in a way that’s entirely community-driven and innovative. Currently priced at $0.007744, Notcoin has been steadily climbing, with analysts projecting that it will maintain this bullish trend through early 2025.

Table of Contents DOGEN: An alpha meme token capturing the crypto scene Cardano to soar as altseason approaches Avalanche eyes $62 resistance Polkadot on the brink of major breakout Kaspa: Potential surge above $0.22 resistance Conclusion While Bitcoin and Ethereum grab most of the spotlight, some overlooked cryptocurrencies are showing immense potential. These five select altcoins are poised for massive growth, with predictions of high values by Christmas. DOGEN: An alpha meme token capturing the crypto scene DOGE, SHIB, and FLOKI — the real alpha is here, DOGEN. Built for the strongest, boldest, and most fearless holders, DOGEN is the ultimate meme token for taking over the market. It’s not for the faint-hearted — it’s for those with the guts to chase greatness and the drive to win big. Frogs can leap away because DOGEN is here with the intention to rule.

DOGE is set to be a ticket to an exclusive community of winners to will enjoy luxurious campaigns, killer perks, and the best deals in the game. DOGEN is more than a token — it’s a lifestyle. Posh cars, stacks of cash, and unforgettable experiences are just the beginning for DOGEN holders who refuse to settle for less. Interested investors can join the DOGEN presale to flex hard and potentially earn big . Cardano to soar as altseason approaches Cardano currently trades between $1.06 and $1.33, showing stability despite a slight 0.43% drop over the past week. Impressively, it has surged over 157% in the last month and more than 171% over six months, reflecting strong upward momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 34, nearing oversold territory, which hints at a possible upward swing. If ADA breaks past the nearest resistance at $1.46, it could aim for the next target at $1.73, marking a substantial increase from current levels. With the altcoin season on the horizon and bullish market sentiments rising, ADA has significant potential to climb higher. Avalanche eyes $62 resistance Avalanche is moving within the $47-$58 range, with a 76% gain over the past month. The token’s price is nearing the resistance level at $62. A break above this could see it reach the next resistance at $73, representing a significant increase from current prices. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are both around $52, indicating a period of consolidation. The RSI is below 40, suggesting the coin is not overbought. With a low stochastic value, there is potential for further upside movement. The MACD is nearly flat, hinting at a possible trend reversal. AVAX may be set for a breakout as the altcoin market gains strength. You might also like: Dogen poised to overtake Dogecoin: 5,000% rally anticipated as whales join the frenzy Polkadot on the brink of major breakout The Polkadot price has shown impressive growth over the past month, surging by over 125%. The coin is currently trading in the range of $8.66 to $11.90, with strong potential to test the nearest resistance level at $13.40. Polkadot’s RSI and Stochastic indicators are in oversold regions, suggesting a bullish reversal soon. If the token breaks through this resistance, it could aim for the next level at $16.64, marking significant gains from current prices. With the anticipation of an altcoin season and a global crypto bull run, Polkadot stands poised for substantial growth in the near future. Kaspa: Potential surge above $0.22 resistance Kaspa is showing strong signs of growth. In the past month, its price has increased by over 61%. The current price range hovers between $0.16 and $0.20, sitting above the 100-day simple moving average of $0.17. The RSI at 44.86 suggests the coin is not overbought. With the nearest resistance level at $0.22, a breakout above this could see the price target the next resistance at $0.26. This would represent a potential gain of over 30% from current levels, with the bullish momentum supported by a 6.8% rise over the past week.. Conclusion Although ADA, AVAX, DOT, and KAS may have limited short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as a standout, designed for those who seek the best in life. Inspired by successful predecessors, it aims to build a community of leaders and offer real benefits, including exclusive campaigns and perks for early adopters.

This decision follows a plea agreement between former CEO Alex Mashinsky and United States prosecutors. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams requested the Southern District of New York’s District Court to delay Cohen-Pavon’s sentencing until after Mashinsky’s, which is set for April 2025. Williams highlighted that Cohen-Pavon’s testimony and shared information could significantly determine Mashinsky’s sentence. Judge John Koeltl approved the request, officially postponing the sentencing hearing. While granting the request, Judge Koeltl ordered both parties to report to the court on April 18 for an update. This will be ten days after Mashinky’s sentencing. The judge will likely make a sentencing to Cohen-Pavon on this date. Cohen-Pavon had earlier pleaded guilty to four counts of felony charges. Mashinsky’s agreement to plead guilty changed the proceedings While everything seemed to have fallen into place for Cohen-Pavon, Mashinsky’s agreement to plead guilty has altered the flow. On December 3, Mashinsky agreed to plead guilty to two charges as part of a deal with prosecutors. If the Judge gives a maximum sentence to the two charges, Mashinsky could spend up to 30 years in prison on both charges served consecutively. Cohen-Pavon and Mashinsky were indicted in July 2023. They were accused of misleading Celsius users to maximize profits by manipulating prices. When the two were indicted, Cohen-Pavon was not in the US, and he had pleaded not guilty by then. However, when he was finally arrested in September 2023, he pleaded guilty to several charges. Among the listed charges were conspiracy to commit price manipulation, wire fraud, manipulation of security prices, and securities fraud. Despite pleading guilty to these charges, Cohen-Pavon had never been sentenced, as he was scheduled for sentencing on December 11. Cohen-Pavon might Influence Mashinky’s sentencing Most people following the case wonder how Cohen-Pavon’s information to the court could sway the Judge’s consideration during Mashinsky’s sentencing. The former CEO pleaded guilty to misinforming users about Celsius’s approval from US regulators and not selling his CEL token holdings. As part of his plea deal, he was open to forfeiting $48 million in proceeds from the scheme. While awaiting his sentencing, Cohen-Pavon has been enjoying foreign travels freely. He was allowed to return to Israel from New York after posting a bond worth $500,000. Judge Koeltl also allowed him to travel to Singapore in September. The period coincided with the Token 2049 crypto conference in Singapore, leading to speculations of his attendance. Celsius went bankrupt in 2022. By then, it was a top crypto platform that had collapsed due to a market downturn. Most users lost their money locked in their accounts, leaving them in anguish. The investors were relieved in November when a Bankruptcy judge approved a reorganization plan for Celsius, making it possible for debtors to distribute about $2 billion to the platform’s creditors. The company indicated that they will begin repaying customers by next year. While the Celsius case is still active, these executives won’t be the first to face jail time in the crypto space. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried went through the legal process and was jailed. Besides, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao served his term in prison. The two were facing different charges.

Amid this correction, bearish tendencies among investors on Binance have surfaced. A recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost highlights a significant trend where Binance’s taker buy-sell ratio for Ethereum turned “sharply negative” at the $4,000 mark. This suggests that traders on the exchange have predominantly adopted a selling stance. Related Reading: Sell Pressure Rises As Ethereum Tests $4,000 Resistance—What’s Next For ETH? Ethereum Tug of War According to Darkfost, the bearish sentiment on Binance has persisted since the start of November, coinciding with Ethereum’s approach to this critical resistance level. The analyst pointed out that while this bearish sentiment could typically signal a potential reversal, Ethereum’s price movement has defied seeing high bearish inclination, driven by other influential factors. Notably, demand for Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) has surged, showcasing a growing institutional interest that continues to support Ethereum’s price action. The surge in demand for Ethereum ETFs signals a shift in market stance where institutional players increasingly influence price movements. Institutional interest, evidenced by consistent inflows into Ethereum-focused investment products seems to have been pivotal in offsetting the selling pressure observed among retail traders on Binance. ETH Market Performance And Outlook So far, Ethereum has seen a significant correction in its price decreasing to as low as $3,616 as of today. At the time of writing, the asset currently trades at a price of $3,621 down by nearly 6% in the past day. Notably, this price performance has unsurprisingly dropped the asset’s market cap by over $40 billion, falling from over $490 billion seen last week Friday to $434 billion today. Interestingly, despite this price decrease, Ethereum’s daily trading volume has seen an opposite trend rising from below $60 billion on December 6 to now at $72 billion. Given the current market condition, it is likely that the increase in ETH’s volume is coming from sell-offs.

According to data from Coinglass, in the past 24 hours , 526,828 traders were liquidated with the total liquidations coming in at $1.58 billion. Out of this total liquidations, ETH accounts for roughly $234.72 million. Long liquidations dominates reaching $208.83 million. Short traders also had their share losses registering $25.89 million worth of ETH liquidations. Regardless of this, analysts are still optimistic about Ethereum, suggesting that the current price dip is quite “healthy” for ETH’s market. $ETH remains strong in HTF!#Ethereum weekly healthy correction will be left behind as a RETEST and pumped hard! https://t.co/o78x8eBucf pic.twitter.com/YSixFqjuLQ — EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL 💹🧲📈 (@EtherNasyonaL) December 10, 2024 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",Ethereum|altcoin|crypto|crypto market|ETH|ethereum|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-11 00:30:16

Here’s What Is Next",https://timestabloid.com/rlusd-wins-regulatory-approval-ripple-ceo-confirms-heres-what-is-next/,"Ripple has achieved a significant milestone as the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) granted final approval for its stablecoin RLUSD. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the development via Twitter, confirming that exchange and partner listings for RLUSD would soon be available. He further emphasized that updates regarding the stablecoin’s launch will be communicated directly through Ripple’s official channels. The approval marks a pivotal step for Ripple. It positions RLUSD to make a meaningful impact in the growing stablecoin market. Stablecoins, digital assets pegged to stable financial instruments such as fiat currencies, are gaining traction as a transformative force in the payments sector. Ripple’s RLUSD aims to capitalize on this trend by offering a secure, regulated, and scalable solution for businesses and consumers. Ripple’s Vision for RLUSD In a recent interview with CNBC, Ripple President Monica Long highlighted the company’s ambitions for RLUSD . Long described the stablecoin market as a high-growth sector with significant potential. Currently valued at approximately $1 billion, the global stablecoin market is projected to exceed $3 trillion in the coming years. Long attributed this anticipated expansion to the increasing adoption of stablecoins for payments and cross-border transactions. Long also emphasized the critical role of regulatory compliance in ensuring the success and stability of RLUSD. Ripple’s collaboration with the NYDFS to finalize its trust application underscores its commitment to adhering to regulatory standards. According to Long, regulatory clarity is essential for fostering trust and broader adoption of stablecoins in the financial ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Reaction and Implications The announcement of NYDFS approval for RLUSD has generated significant market excitement. Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, XRP, saw a 6.72% increase in value, trading at $2.37 within the last 24 hours. This uptick reflects growing investor confidence in Ripple’s ability to innovate and expand its influence in the digital payments space. RLUSD’s launch is expected to enhance Ripple’s product offerings, particularly in its enterprise-focused payment solutions. By providing a stable and regulated digital asset, Ripple aims to streamline cross-border transactions, reduce costs, and improve efficiency for businesses worldwide. Additionally, the RLUSD launch could bolster Ripple’s competitive edge against other stablecoins, such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), by leveraging its regulatory approval and reputation for transparency. Broader Industry Impact The approval of RLUSD by a stringent regulatory authority like the NYDFS sets a benchmark for the stablecoin industry. It demonstrates the importance of proactive engagement with regulators and adherence to compliance requirements in launching digital financial products. Ripple’s approach could be a model for other blockchain companies aiming to integrate stablecoins into the broader financial system.

There are already projections that the XRP price could spike to $100, and when this happens, Dogecoin (DOGE) will settle at $7. However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , a new AI-based crypto token, is sparking higher FOMO as it is slated for a 30,000% rally to $5.2. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Raises Investors’ Anticipation As It Sets Itself For A 30,000% Pump Even with the positivity around XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE), WallitIQ (WLTQ) is gaining more attention for its revolutionary crypto wallet that maximizes the strength of artificial intelligence (AI) to the fullest. Additionally, the way this platform uses AI and machine learning (ML) tools to ease crypto management and support smart investment is definitely a significant draw. It’s no wonder speculations are pointing to a possible 30,000% pump for its WLTQ token to $5.2. Currently, the WLTQ token is selling for $0.0243 after completing its initial presale stage, where it rose by 42% from $0.0171 and garnered over $2 million. Now, WallitIQ ( WLTQ ) is undergoing its newly commenced Stage 2 presale but is already nearing a $500,000 revenue milestone, indicating its potential for fast-paced growth in the DeFi and AI crypto market. Besides its presale performance, WallitIQ’s unique features are another reason analysts are optimistic that the WLTQ will surge 30,000% to $5.2. For starters, WallitIQ (WLTQ) boasts an automated portfolio rebalancing — a feature that enables optimal asset relocation in real-time, thereby mitigating risks and enhancing ROI. The platform also offers a Scan QR to Pay feature while using AI to effectively detect anomalies and provide predictive analysis, helping its users make smart investment decisions. Furthermore, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers top-notch security, user-convenient interface and multilingual AI chatbots. According to analysts, this innovation is one of the vital catalysts that will spark a 30,000% rally for WallitIQ’s token, potentially outperforming XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE). WallitIQ (WLTQ) is already listed on CoinMarketCap, with a few DEX listings awaiting its token when its presale elapses. This is poised to attract significant attention to its wallet-based platform which has top security features like an advanced Escrow Connect and biometric authentication systems to ensure close security on users’ assets. XRP Price May Hit $100 And Spark A $7 Rise For Dogecoin (DOGE) The XRP price has been on one of the most shocking, yet impressive journeys in the past month. Despite its legal issue, the XRP price pulled out of its sluggish phase as it priced above its long-standing $0.5 range to hit $2 a few days back. Now, the XRP price is held in a weekly range of $1.46 – $2.82, and it is showing potential to hit $100 in due time. With the XRP possibly approaching the $100 price mark, Dogecoin (DOGE) is also expected to settle around $7, aligning with the momentum of the XRP price. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price has shown over 150% pump in the past week while receiving positive momentum. Should the XRP price hit $100, it wouldn’t be surprising for Dogecoin (DOGE) to also take a leap to $7 from its current $0.4 price mark. Either way, investors are closely watching the XRP price as it maintains bullishness. Conclusion While XRP appears to be on a bullish run, its projected price target of $100 seems highly improbable compared to WallitIQ (WLTQ) , reaching $5.20. For XRP to hit $100, its market capitalization would need to soar to an unrealistic $5.2 trillion. In contrast, WallitIQ’s strategic positioning in the AI market and its SolidProof- audited smart contract will attract significant traction, potentially rallying its price by 30,000%. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) token is currently going for a low price of $0.0243. However, it won’t stay at this price for long. The platform is set for another price shift to $0.0420 in stage 3, giving investors a remarkable 72% profit. So, Invest in WallitIQ (WLTQ) now while it’s still in presale. According to analysts, with its one-of-a-kind features and immense growth potential, the value of WLTQ tokens is sure to surge by an impressive 30,000% and hit $5.2.

In a new strategy session, Cowen takes a look at the MVRV Z-score, which compares the market cap of BTC to the value of each coin the last time it was moved to gauge whether Bitcoin is undervalued, overvalued, or at fair value. Cowen notes that in the past, market cycle tops have occurred when the MVRV Z-Score hits a certain range. “Historically, market cycle tops for Bitcoin have corresponded to an MVRV Z-Score somewhere between seven to 10, at around seven to 10. In fact, the first cycle top, the MVRV Z-Score topped out at around 7.68. The last one topped out at around 7.15. And you can see the ones in between went even higher. Again, right now, the MVRV Z-Score high for this cycle is 3.29, but this is another metric that certainly could be useful in helping to confirm whether a high corresponds to a market cycle top or if that true euphoric sentiment is there, or if we just think it’s there. That’s kind of the thing about back in March 2024, it felt like the market was overheated, and it was, we got a mid-cycle top. But, a look at this chart would have helped to suggest that it was not in fact, a market cycle top. So I do think this is another chart that we can put in our toolkit to help us better navigate Bitcoin.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube At time of writing, BTC is trading at $96,253.

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address – C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-11 01:24:09

Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, in his X post on Dec. 11, stated that MicroStrategy (MSTR) would like to be added to the Nasdaq 100 index on Dec. 23, the announcement set to be on Thursday. This development came after the company issued more financial bonds and senior notes to institutional investors in the United States in order to acquire more Bitcoin ( BTC ) in the future. He also expects the company to enter the S&P 500 index by next year, which is considered difficult by some analysts to achieve in the near future. “$MSTR is likely to be added to $QQQ on 12/23 (w/ announcement coming 12/13).

S&P 500 add next yr prob,” Balchunas says James Seyffart, another Bloomberg ETF analyst, also stated that the odds for MicroStrategy to enter the S&P 500 are rising after the Nasdaq 100.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. NVIDIA millionaire bets on Solana rebound as DTX Exchange eyes 55,000% gains with a $10M presale. Table of Contents Solana price consolidates as volume drops DTX Exchange stuns with $10 million presale performance Conclusion November’s surging volumes and prices made many people rich. However, at the end of the month, the market corrected as Bitcoin and XRP holders adjusted their holdings, leading to many coins stumbling. Every upcycle has proven that the highest gains are in projects with strong community support and high user utility. One such project that is picking up community support is DTX Exchange (DTX). DTX Exchange has a promising ICO with huge growth potential. In addition to its growth prospects, DTX’s expected impact on the crypto trading scene has made it a solid altcoin to watch out for. Solana price consolidates as volume drops Solana’s price dropped 4% in the daily charts, currently trading around the $214 region. This fall has been attributed to increased selling pressure as investors look for profit realization. The SOL market cap is down by 1.43% to $102.3 billion, and its market volume is also down by 7.5% to $8.916 billion. However, Solana’s long-term prospects remain strong. With its strong ecosystem and developer support, the Solana price correction will probably end in the next crypto market rally. While the negative news about SOL ETFs being rejected may have lowered Solana’s price, many investors are waiting for the incoming SEC Chair, Paul Atkins, before they give up on Solana ETFs. Nonetheless, astute investors are consolidating their holdings. DTX Exchange stuns with $10 million presale performance The DTX Exchange brings a new perspective to trading with a platform that will allow users to trade cryptos, forex, equities, and contract-for-differences (CFDs). While the basic processes might be similar to other exchanges, DTX seeks to redefine crypto trading with its sophisticated infrastructure and trading features. DTX Exchange’s presale is selling out faster than many other altcoins in their pre-sales, raising $10 million in Round 6. The platform has also successfully launched its signature products, such as Phoenix Wallet and VulcanX blockchain. DTX’s current selling price of $0.12 will increase to $0.14 in the next round, suggesting high returns for early investors. Conclusion Solana has undoubtedly been among the most successful DeFi projects with its high blockchain utility and a vibrant ecosystem. However, the recent ETF news has caused some pessimism for SOL holders, shown by their interest in exploring Layer-1 alternatives that crack into top rankings. DTX’s core appeal lies in its hybrid platform, which can link traditional and digital finance. The exchange will enable multi-asset trading across equities, cryptocurrencies, and forex, with strict compliance standards. The presale value of $10 million has left experts in shock, crowning DTX Exchange an emerging DeFi giant as it moves towards stage 7.

The St. Kitts and Nevis national from America told Carlson his arrest wasn’t about tax fraud charges, but political persecution, noting of the Department of Justice: “They can get you if they want you.” Early bitcoin startup investor and passionate freedom advocate Roger Ver, also known as “Bitcoin Jesus,” could face 109 years in prison if extradited from Spain to face trial in the U.S. As Ver noted in his recent interview with political commentator Tucker Carlson, that would probably mean dying in prison. And for what? He feels the charges are politically motivated , having nothing to do with alleged tax fraud the state says Ver committed both before and after he was a U.S. citizen. “More than a decade after I had already renounced my U.S. citizenship, and just a couple of weeks after I had published a book on the hijacking of bitcoin, how it no longer works as peer-to-peer cash for the world … right after my book gets published that exposes how people claiming to work for intelligence agencies hijacked bitcoin to do that … suddenly I get arrested and tossed in jail in Spain,” Ver told Carlson early in the video interview. Roger Ver sat down with American political commentator Tucker Carlson to talk about his ongoing battle with the U.S. legal system. Ver renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2014, after an earlier run-in with the American justice system and the ATF (ostensibly for selling firecrackers online) landed him in prison for 10 months. Ver believes that this event was also politically motivated, after he made cutting criticism of the U.S. government while running for office in California in 2000. In the interview Ver is on the verge of tears as he brings up the tragic murder of innocent Americans in Waco, Texas in 1993: “Even if the parents were religious nuts, the ATF and the FBI literally burnt to death everybody in their home there and then posed for photos on top of the corpses of little kids. That sort of thing is not okay,” Ver stated. “In the debate with the republican and democratic candidates, I called the ATF a bunch of murderers that they are for having done that, and boy did they not like that,” Ver emphasized to Carlson. He then became the only person in the world to be prosecuted for selling the particular brand of firecracker he was shipping on Ebay, even though major retailers and others were also selling it. Ver was arrested in Spain shortly after the release of his book, Hijacking Bitcoin. BTC hijacked, Zano and Monero may sustain economic freedom Roger’s new book, Hijacking Bitcoin: The Hidden History of BTC, details how the blocksize wars (disagreement on how and whether to scale BTC amongst developers and community members), potential infiltration by state intelligence agencies, and outright propaganda have rendered what is currently known as Bitcoin as an impotent, merely speculative asset. This is in stark opposition to what Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto wanted, as the bitcoin whitepaper states it was designed to be a permissionless, electronic cash. “And in the early days everybody knew bitcoin was supposed to be money for the world, bitcoin was supposed to be used for payments as peer-to-peer cash for the world, and that’s how people were using it,” Ver told Carlson, before explaining how advocates for small blocks began creating propaganda to sway opinion, the CIA took interest, and forums on Reddit and elsewhere were blatantly censored and shut down via DDoS attacks. Throughout the exchange, Carlson repeatedly hammered home the idea that bitcoin is not private (almost as if there was an agenda to turn people away from crypto), and then asked Ver his thoughts on the matter, and whether Bitcoin can be made private. Interestingly Ver did not mention the CashFusion privacy protocol on Bitcoin Cash , which he views as the original and “real” bitcoin, but did bring up privacy coins and networks like Zano and Monero. Zano was one privacy coin Roger Ver mentioned in the interview. “It sounds like your ideological commitment is overriding your financial interests,” Carlson said at one point in the interview. Ver responded: “It’s not even close for me.” Ver described how certain protocols are much better for economic freedom than BTC held on centralized exchanges, which is worse privacy-wise than even a normal bank account. “Luckily there’s other cryptocurrencies out there that do give people more privacy, so there’s things like Monero which most people are now using if they want some privacy … There’s another one called Zano that allows anybody to create their own privacy token in which nobody can see what’s going on,” Ver explained, continuing: “And if you really want to get the three-letter agencies upset, or governments upset, there’s a project called Confidential Layer, which is creating a bridge from Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum onto Zano.” In Ver’s view, with people using money the state cannot control, permissionlessly, the government won’t be able to fund wars, or massacres like at Waco, nearly as easily. “It’s a wonderful thing when government loses the ability to control people’s lives,” Ver noted. And while Bitcoin Jesus did lament at one point that “they can get you if they want you” by cooking up bogus tax charges, the first bitcoin startup investor doesn’t seem to be backing down in the face of their violent threats.

37486587,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51859,1733882303,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,The Rise of Web 3.0: A New Era of the Internet,https://timestabloid.com/the-rise-of-web-3-0-a-new-era-of-the-internet/,"The internet has evolved dramatically since its inception. From the early days of static web pages in Web 1.0 to the interactive and social platform era of Web 2.0, we are now entering the era of Web 3.0 . This transformation is revolutionizing how we interact with digital content, services, and communities, promising greater autonomy, security, and personalization for users. What is Web 3.0? Web 3.0, often referred to as the decentralized web, is built on blockchain technology and aims to create a more user-centric internet. Unlike Web 2.0, which is dominated by centralized platforms like social media giants and cloud service providers, Web 3.0 focuses on decentralization, transparency, and user control. Imagine an internet where you own your data and digital identity without relying on intermediaries. Whether it’s financial transactions, gaming, or content creation, Web 3.0 allows for peer-to-peer interactions secured through blockchain. For example, users engaging in online entertainment, such as kazino online , benefit from enhanced privacy, secure payments, and provably fair systems—a fundamental shift from traditional centralized platforms. Key Features of Web 3.0 Decentralization Unlike its predecessors, Web 3.0 relies on decentralized networks. Data is stored across multiple nodes instead of centralized servers, reducing vulnerabilities like hacking and censorship. This ensures a more secure and resilient system where no single entity has complete control. Blockchain Technology The backbone of Web 3.0, blockchain technology provides a transparent, immutable ledger for transactions and data exchanges. Whether for cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, or tokenized assets, blockchain ensures trust and accountability among users. AI and Machine Learning Web 3.0 integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to provide personalized experiences. For instance, AI can analyze user behavior to suggest tailored content, products, or services without violating privacy, as the data remains decentralized and encrypted. Semantic Web The semantic web enables machines to understand the meaning of data, facilitating more accurate searches and interactions. This enhancement creates a seamless digital experience, whether you’re looking for a specific product or exploring complex topics. Ownership of Digital Identity With Web 3.0, users have complete control over their digital identities. This is made possible through decentralized identifiers (DIDs), which allow individuals to authenticate themselves securely across platforms without sharing sensitive information. Web 3.0 in Everyday Life The practical applications of Web 3.0 are already shaping various industries, and its potential seems limitless. Here are some examples of how Web 3.0 impacts everyday life: Finance and Banking Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms are at the forefront of Web 3.0 innovations. They allow users to trade, lend, or borrow assets without traditional banking intermediaries. This accessibility opens financial opportunities to people worldwide, even in underbanked regions. Gaming and Entertainment Blockchain-based games and online entertainment platforms are redefining the gaming experience. Players can own in-game assets, trade them as NFTs (non-fungible tokens), and engage in fair, transparent gameplay. Similarly, platforms for online casinos ensure users’ funds and transactions remain secure and transparent. Content Creation Web 3.0 empowers creators by enabling them to monetize their content directly. Platforms like decentralized streaming services or NFT marketplaces ensure artists and writers retain ownership of their work while receiving fair compensation. Supply Chain Management Blockchain technology brings transparency and efficiency to supply chains. Companies can track products from origin to delivery, ensuring ethical sourcing and minimizing fraud. Healthcare Decentralized health records give patients control over their medical history. They can share access with healthcare providers as needed, ensuring privacy and eliminating duplicate records. The Challenges Ahead While the promise of Web 3.0 is exciting, there are challenges to overcome before it becomes mainstream. Scalability Blockchain networks currently face scalability issues, with slower transaction speeds and higher costs compared to traditional systems. User Adoption The transition to Web 3.0 requires users to adapt to new technologies like crypto wallets and decentralized applications (dApps). This learning curve may delay widespread adoption. Regulatory Uncertainty Governments and regulatory bodies are still figuring out how to govern blockchain-based systems. Striking a balance between innovation and regulation will be crucial for Web 3.0’s success. Energy Consumption Blockchain networks, especially those using proof-of-work consensus mechanisms, consume significant energy. The move towards more sustainable models like proof-of-stake is critical for minimizing environmental impact. The Future of Web 3.0 Web 3.0 holds the potential to redefine the digital landscape, transforming the way we interact with technology. As blockchain technology evolves and becomes more efficient, its adoption across various industries is expected to accelerate. For users, this decentralized web promises greater empowerment—whether through enhanced financial freedom, secure interactions, or full ownership of their digital presence. For businesses, adapting to this paradigm shift will require embracing decentralized models and prioritizing transparency to stay relevant. In the next decade, Web 3.0 could become as integral to our lives as Web 2.0 is today. From decentralized finance and personalized AI-driven platforms to innovations like the metaverse, the future of Web 3.0 is shaping a digital world where users regain control of their online interactions. With providers like Wordscloud crafting insightful and accessible content , the journey to understanding and adopting Web 3.0 becomes clearer for businesses and individuals alike.

The analyst further explained why XRP could hit double digits in this market cycle following this development. Weekly Bull Flag Appears On XRP Price Chart In an X post, Dark Defender stated that a weekly bull flag has now appeared on the weekly XRP price chart. He noted that this bull flag had earlier appeared on the daily chart when XRP was at $0.70, as the crypto targetted the $1.88 price level, which it eventually rallied to. With this bull flag on the weekly, the crypto analyst predicted that XRP could rally to double digits. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bull Run: Analyst Reveals Why BTC Will Hit Its Top A Month From Now Below $150,000 His accompanying chart showed that the XRP price could rally to as high as $11 as it breaks out from this bull flag. XRP is expected to hit this price target in early 2025, between January and March. Dark Defender cautioned market participants that there will surely be some sideways price movement. However, the crypto analyst expects the ultimate targets to stay the same. Based on Dark Defender’s previous analysis, the $11 target is unlikely to be the market top for the XRP price, as the crypto analyst predicted that the crypto could rally as high as $18 in this bull run. For now, XRP continues to trade sideways, just as he warned that the crypto would do. The crypto had recorded a parabolic rally last month, recording a price gain of 281%. However, the XRP price has cooled off this month as it consolidates for its next leg up. Dark Defender previously highlighted $2.13 and $2.27 as key support levels to watch out for as XRP ranges. Meanwhile, the analyst mentioned $3.9 and $5.5 as the next targets XRP could reach on its next leg up. An “Optimistic” Target For XRP In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez stated that $48.12 is an “optimistic” target for the XRP price. Meanwhile, he highlighted the $8.40 price level as a conservative target for XRP. These predictions came as the crypto analyst remarked that the crypto looks undervalued after breaking out of a massive multi-year symmetrical triangle, which he highlighted on the chart. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Prediction: Here’s What The 91-Day Pattern Says Could Happen Next Meanwhile, in another X post, he revealed that the XRP price has formed three consecutive bull pennants on its 4-hour chart. Based on this, Martinez stated that market participants should hope for a retest of $2.25 so they can buy the dip, with XRP targeting $4.40 on its next leg up. A rally to $4.40 will mark a new all-time high (ATH) for XRP. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.18, down over 11% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Chainlink (LINK) is making headlines with predictions of it possibly hitting $60 soon, riding high on its dominance in decentralized oracle technology. Meanwhile, SEI (SEI) has drawn attention with its latest network upgrade, setting the stage for enhanced scalability and functionality. These updates highlight why these projects are catching the eyes of investors looking for the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. In the middle of this, Qubetics ($TICS) is rewriting the rulebook for crypto usability. Unlike its predecessors, Qubetics bridges the gap between crypto and everyday life with a focus on solving real-world problems. Currently in Presale Phase 12, with strong community support and significant growth potential, Qubetics is shaping up to be a game-changer.

That’s Chainlink in action, and it’s why LINK remains one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Chainlink’s recent partnerships are also worth noting. By collaborating with traditional financial institutions, LINK is cementing its role as a critical component in the future of blockchain technology.

This Best Crypto to Buy in December 2024 Can Make You Rich,https://timestabloid.com/failed-to-join-the-solana-train-to-wealth-this-best-crypto-to-buy/,"The crypto market never sleeps, and December 2024 is proving to be a pivotal month for investors. Solana (SOL), often hailed as Ethereum’s faster and cheaper competitor, has made headlines with its rapid growth and adoption over the past few years. From NFTs to DeFi, Solana has been at the forefront of blockchain innovation. But if you feel like you’ve missed out on Solana’s meteoric rise, you’re not alone. Its early investors have already cashed in big, leaving many wondering, “What’s next?” Enter Qubetics ($TICS), a groundbreaking Web3 aggregator designed to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and real-world usability. Unlike earlier projects that promised the moon but couldn’t deliver, Qubetics is tackling tangible problems with innovative solutions. With its focus on real-world asset tokenisation, privacy, and decentralisation, it’s shaping up to be the best crypto to buy in December 2024. Let’s dive into what makes Qubetics and Solana stand out—and why $TICS might be your ticket to 2025 wealth. Qubetics ($TICS): Real-World Solutions with Web3 Innovation Qubetics isn’t just another coin hoping to ride the crypto wave; it’s a complete ecosystem designed to make blockchain technology more accessible and practical. One of its most exciting applications is Real World Asset Tokenisation (RWAT). Imagine owning a fraction of a high-value asset like real estate or fine art without the headache of legal paperwork or geographical restrictions. With Qubetics, asset tokenisation becomes as easy as trading stocks, giving everyday people access to investment opportunities once reserved for the ultra-wealthy. Think about small businesses or freelancers. A freelance photographer in New York could tokenise their equipment, allowing investors to support their growth in exchange for returns. Meanwhile, a coffee shop owner in London might tokenise their operations to expand their business without relying on traditional bank loans. Qubetics enables all of this with its Decentralised VPN and multi-chain wallet, ensuring secure and private transactions for all users. And the numbers don’t lie. Qubetics is currently in Presale Phase 12, with $0.0311 per token. Over 303M tokens have already been sold, raising $5.4M and counting. With the next phase set to increase the price by 10%, early investors stand to gain significantly, especially as the post-presale target price of $0.25 hints at a jaw-dropping 900% ROI. Why did this coin make it to this list? Qubetics isn’t just a crypto; it’s a gateway to financial opportunities for people from all walks of life. Its real-world applications and presale momentum make it a no-brainer for investors looking for the best crypto to buy in December 2024. Solana (SOL): The Blockchain Speedster Solana has been one of the standout performers in the crypto space over the past few years. Known for its blazing-fast transaction speeds and low fees, it’s a favourite among developers building decentralised applications (dApps). Whether it’s NFTs or DeFi, Solana has proven it can handle high traffic without breaking a sweat. Recently, Solana has seen significant adoption in gaming and metaverse projects, further solidifying its reputation as a scalable blockchain. Despite the occasional hiccup—like network outages—it remains a strong contender for long-term growth. Analysts are bullish on Solana, predicting its price could hit new all-time highs in 2025 as more projects and users flock to its ecosystem. But while Solana has been a fantastic investment for early adopters, its price has already climbed substantially. The real question is whether it can sustain this growth or if it’s reaching its peak. Why did this coin make it to this list? Solana’s unmatched scalability and ecosystem make it a compelling option for investors. Even if you missed its early days, it’s still one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 for those seeking steady growth. Qubetics vs Solana: Which One Should You Pick? Both Qubetics and Solana have a lot to offer, but they cater to different kinds of investors. If you’re looking for a project with a proven track record and a bustling ecosystem, Solana is a solid choice. Its partnerships and adoption rates speak volumes about its potential to remain a key player in the blockchain space. On the other hand, Qubetics offers something unique: untapped potential. It’s not just about speculation; it’s about solving real-world problems. Whether it’s asset tokenisation, decentralised finance, or online privacy, Qubetics is setting the stage for widespread blockchain adoption. And let’s be honest, with its presale price of $0.0311 and a target of $0.25, the upside is hard to ignore. The best strategy? Diversify. There’s no reason you can’t invest in both projects to balance your portfolio with a mix of stability (Solana) and explosive growth potential (Qubetics). If you missed out on Solana’s early days, don’t worry—it’s still a fantastic investment with plenty of room to grow. But if you’re looking for something that combines innovation with massive upside potential, Qubetics is the best crypto to buy in December 2024 . With its real-world applications and impressive presale momentum, it’s shaping up to be the next big thing in crypto. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS) and Solana (SOL) as top picks for December 2024. Don’t wait—secure your financial future today!

Crying Kamala (CRYKAMA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CRYKAMA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Crying Kamala can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crying Kamala could become the next viral memecoin. Crying Kamala launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crying Kamala on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crying Kamala by entering its contract address – 5eCJhSGBUN4YwJHLU9ZcWjrjmoufVznjzNBHfo4TN1P7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRYKAMA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-11 02:22:00

As the inaugural major global cryptocurrency event in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, the summit attracted many prominent figures, including Eric Trump, the second son of President-elect Donald Trump; Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ); Marwan Alzarouni, CEO of Dubai Blockchain Center. The event provided a platform to explore the future of cryptocurrencies and discuss key industry opportunities. Justin Sun , Global Advisor of HTX and Founder of TRON , and Charmaine Lim, Head of VIP Client Services at HTX, also attended the summit and spoke about the current state of the cryptocurrency industry and future trends. Their participation underscores HTX’s focus on the MENA cryptocurrency market and signals its commitment to deepening its global strategy. Meanwhile, by collaborating with global crypto entrepreneurs and communities, the exchange aims to accelerate the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies. At the “The Great Debate: Bitcoin vs. Crypto” session, Justin shared his insights on the relationship between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He noted that Bitcoin’s core narrative is its role as a store of value, emphasizing the importance of security and decentralization to reassure its holders. As such, the best approach for Bitcoin is to maintain its current status. This might limit innovation but ensures stability. To pursue innovation and explore cutting-edge consumer technology, people can do so through other blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Justin attributes Bitcoin’s breakthrough of the $100,000 mark to advancements in cryptocurrency technology. He explained, “Tether once issued stablecoins on the Bitcoin Omni Layer, but the platform’s slow transaction speeds hindered its growth. However, USDT on TRON enables instant transactions, meeting the needs of users. Technological advancements have also benefited Bitcoin. The growing popularity of stablecoins has led to increased capital flowing into Bitcoin, further solidifying its role as a store of value.” “Every cryptocurrency holds its significance. Take Ethereum or TRON for example. Their value is easy to understand because millions of people use them daily. Then there are meme coins, whose value might not be immediately apparent. However, from DOGE to SHIB to PEPE, the meme coin market has grown significantly. Thus, I believe that cryptocurrencies are much like art in a museum. You might not understand every exhibit, just like you might not comprehend why a banana is worth $6 million. What you need to do is to keep learning as cryptocurrencies continue to evolve.” Justin remarked. Charmaine Lim, Head of VIP Client Services at HTX, stated during a roundtable discussion titled “Improving Access to Bitcoin in the UAE” that the country has made notable progress in promoting the adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies since 2015. Despite these advancements, challenges persist, such as the cautious approach of certain banks toward cryptocurrency transactions, insufficient public education about cryptocurrencies, and regulatory uncertainties. These factors hinder the growth of the crypto sector in the UAE. Charmaine noted that HTX has secured the Provisional Approval for the Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from Dubai’s VARA and is currently applying to upgrade it to a full VASP license. The platform is also taking proactive steps to collaborate with local banks in establishing a streamlined fiat-to-cryptocurrency transaction channel. Charmaine added that HTX will provide global users with learning opportunities on subjects such as crypto trading, storage, and security through HTX Live and online workshops. The platform will also continue to expand language options, including offering Arabic support, to enhance the user experience. Furthermore, Charmaine suggested that the UAE government create a favorable environment for crypto businesses by establishing a clear regulatory framework, streamlining the license application process for service providers, offering tax incentives to blockchain companies, and expanding the current regulatory sandbox to accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrencies in the country. From Blockchain Life, Cardano Summit, to Bitcoin MENA, HTX’s frequent appearances in the UAE throughout 2024 underscore its keen interest in the cryptocurrency development potential of the Middle East and North Africa region. By offering innovative products and fostering strong partnerships with local stakeholders, HTX aims to accelerate cryptocurrency adoption and regulatory compliance in this region. Moreover, with the global crypto market continuing to boom, HTX will expand its business footprint worldwide while fostering innovation and the application of crypto technology, thereby contributing to the building of a more accessible Web 3.0 ecosystem.

Tuesday’s crash saw altcoins bleeding heavily while Bitcoin held its ground, dipping only to $94.3K before buyers stepped in. But resilience doesn’t equal immunity—macro factors are looming large over the market. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has been strengthening, closing Tuesday at 106.38 (+0.22%), and Wednesday’s CPI report could set the tone for next week’s FOMC interest rate decision. With geopolitical uncertainties bubbling under the surface and fears of economic slowdowns still haunting investors, this is no time for complacency. Bitcoin ($BTC ) sits at a crossroads, and the next moves in the market may decide whether bulls regain control or a deeper correction unfolds. Source: coinmarketcap.com In this article, we’ll revisit the key levels and scenarios from my previous CryptoDailypieces, examine how Bitcoin and top altcoins like $XRP , Solana , and Dogecoin have performed during this turbulent week, and map out what to watch for in the days ahead. $XRP: Resilience Hinges on $1.91 Support Link to $XRP XRP has been a focal point of the market, riding high from its parabolic rally to $2.91, only to crash 34.5% to a low of $1.91 during Monday’s flash crash. This low perfectly aligned with the Golden Pocket (0.618 Fib) and a critical Fair Value Gap ($1.96–$2.20), providing a high-confluence area for institutional buyers to step in. Currently, XRP has rebounded to $2.38, reclaiming the 0.382 Fib retracement and suggesting a potential recovery toward $2.50–$2.65. However, the broader trend hinges on holding $1.91 as support, with a stop loss below $1.50 to account for volatility. If XRP loses these levels, a drop to $1.28–$1.29 (0.786 Fib), a deep liquidity zone, becomes the next likely target. With XRP only retracing 34.5% from its yearly highs, this correction appears lightweight—so far. For bulls, reclaiming $2.65+ (higher high) is key to resuming its uptrend, while BTC’s stability will play a crucial role in its trajectory. $SOL: Golden Pocket Holds the Line Link to $SOL Solana continues to show relative strength, with Tuesday’s crash bringing it down to $203, just above the Golden Pocket ($198–$200). This level, highlighted in the article, remains critical for Solana’s bullish structure. Despite the dip, Solana has only retraced 23% from its yearly high (and the new ATH) of $264, a minor correction in the bigger picture. The current price action sees SOL trading at $215, attempting to reclaim its 0.382 Fib retracement at $221. A break above $237—a critical resistance zone and former ATH level from March—would set the stage for a retest of $264. However, failure to hold above $198 could see Solana dropping to the $181–$182 re-buy zone (0.786 Fib), a deep liquidity area that aligns with November’s accumulation phase. For now, Solana’s resilience hinges on BTC holding the $90K–$91K zone, as any broader market weakness would likely push SOL lower. $DOGE: Key Rectangle Support Holding (For Now) Link to $DOGE Dogecoin’s volatility remains intact, with Tuesday’s crash testing the $0.365–$0.375 Accumulation Zone for the third time. This level held firmly with a significant volume spike, confirming the rectangle pattern ($0.37–$0.48) as a key structure. DOGE has only corrected 24.5% from its yearly high ($0.48+)… a modest dip compared to most altcoins. However, the breakdown of its ascending channel, combined with resistance at the Golden Pocket ($0.41–$0.425) and the $0.42 horizontal level, adds pressure on bulls to reclaim momentum. If DOGE loses its rectangle support at $0.365, a sharp drop to the $0.25 liquidity zone becomes likely, especially if BTC revisits $90K or lower. On the flip side, reclaiming $0.42 could reignite momentum toward the rectangle’s upper boundary at $0.48, with the next major target being the breakout zone at $0.60. $BTC: Mid-Range Support Faces a Test Link to $BTC Bitcoin demonstrated resilience during Tuesday’s crash, dipping to $94.3K before recovering with significant volume spikes. The $95K mid-range horizontal support held firm, keeping BTC within a broader consolidation range. However, BTC’s loss of the 50MA on the 4H chart and the breakdown of its symmetrical triangle add caution. The triangle’s target aligns with the $90K–$91K zone, a make-or-break level for the market. A failure to hold this zone risks a cascading drop to the Golden Pocket ($79.5K–$83K), the ultimate dip-buying opportunity for long-term bulls. For upside potential, BTC must reclaim the 50MA ($96K) and break above $99K, opening the door to the $107.5K pennant target and psychological resistance at $110K. With BTC only retracing 6% from its yearly high, this correction remains shallow—so far. Summary This week’s crypto crash showcased Bitcoin’s resilience as it held the $94.3K support, while altcoins suffered steeper corrections. However, with geopolitical uncertainties, a strengthening Dollar Index (DXY), and Wednesday’s CPI data adding to the tension ahead of the FOMC rate decision, the next moves will be crucial. Altcoins like XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin remain within key structures but are highly sensitive to Bitcoin’s performance. If BTC loses the $90K–$91K zone, a deeper correction to the Golden Pocket ($79.5K–$83K) could be on the cards, dragging the broader market lower. On the other hand, reclaiming $96K and pushing above $99K could reignite the bull run. For now, the market remains in limbo—watch these levels and stay sharp. Bulls may win December, but they’ll need to earn it. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Right now, XRP is stuck between support at $2 and resistance at $3, with a bearish trend until a breakout happens According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, XRP might be forming a “bull flag” pattern, which often signals that the price could rise. To confirm this pattern and see a price increase, XRP needs to break above the resistance at around $2.53 to $2.54. If it can move past this point and ideally clear the $2.62 level, we could see a more bullish trend in the short term. Price Target and Potential Gains If XRP breaks through this resistance, the next price target could be around $5, which would be a 100% gain from the breakout point. However, in the short term, XRP is facing some bearish pressure, and the price is moving slightly down. Until the breakout happens, it’s hard to expect upward movement. However, if the breakout occurs, the outlook could quickly turn bullish. XRP vs. Bitcoin: Reaching a Local Top Looking at the XRP/BTC chart, XRP has reached a key resistance level against Bitcoin. As expected, XRP has faced a strong rejection at this point. This suggests that XRP might not outperform Bitcoin much in the short term, as Bitcoin is likely to lead in price movement. XRP’s Performance in the Next Few Weeks While XRP could still rise in value against the US dollar, it’s unlikely to do much better than Bitcoin in the next few weeks. Bitcoin is likely to lead, and XRP may not see the same level of performance as it did in the past month. However, if the overall crypto market goes into a bull run, XRP could eventually break through its resistance and perform better in the longer term.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-11 02:55:28

Source: CoinShares Bitcoin ( BTC ) continues to be the top asset, pulling in $2.55 billion of inflows. The positive flows in Ripple ( XRP ) and Litecoin indicate a broad allocation of capital across digital assets. Ethereum experienced its largest weekly inflow year-to-date at $1.2 billion. In comparison, $14 million in capital flowed out from Solana ( SOL ), reflecting a shift in focus among investors. Blockchain equities, on the whole, also saw $124 million in inflows, which is the highest since January.

Total assets under management across digital asset investment products now amount to $165 billion as a result of the new inflows. Crypto boom as Trump’s popularity on the rise The massive momentum the crypto market is witnessing is likely due to two major events. President-elect Donald Trump has appointed venture capitalist David Sacks as the first-ever White House AI and crypto czar , a part of his strategic push to make the U.S. the global leader in cryptocurrency innovation. Sacks will be tasked with making rules and crafting laws for both AI and crypto, as well as chairing the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology. Another reason is Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s support for BTC. On Dec. 5, Powell said that BTC is deemed as a competitor for gold, not the dollar, at DealBook Summit 2024.

Crypto King Musk (MUSKKING), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKKING is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Crypto King Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crypto King Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Crypto King Musk launched with over $7,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crypto King Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Crypto King Musk by entering its contract address – v2jWiNpR1m8gHARdM39GosZ8muaxZpowpBgWgWTSCev – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKKING. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-11 03:11:00

Và mặc dù dòng vốn ETF vào chậm lại một chút vào cuối tuần trước, nhưng chúng vẫn là nguồn hỗ trợ quan trọng trong bối cảnh những người nắm giữ dài hạn tiếp tục chốt lời. Khi Bitcoin dậm chân tại ngưỡng 100.000 USD, triển vọng trung hạn vẫn tăng giá, và với việc tỷ lệ tài trợ bình thường hóa và áp lực bán giảm, đà tăng có thể sẽ tiếp tục, miễn là dòng vốn ETF tiếp tục chảy vào. Dữ liệu kinh tế Mỹ mới nhất tuần trước cho thấy một số kết quả trái chiều, nhưng nhìn chung cho thấy nền kinh tế tiếp tục có vẻ phục hồi. Tháng 11 chứng kiến nền kinh tế đang tạo ra nhiều việc làm mới , với 227.000 việc làm được bổ sung, vượt mức kỳ vọng dù có sự gián đoạn từ các cơn bão tháng 10. Tuy nhiên, tỷ lệ thất nghiệp tăng nhẹ lên 4,2% cho thấy sự dịch chuyển lực lượng lao động vẫn còn kéo dài. Tuyển dụng tháng 10 tăng vọt lên 7,74 triệu chỗ trống, cho thấy nhu cầu lao động vẫn ở mức cao, mặc dù số lượng nhân viên được tuyển dụng thực tế lại chậm lại, phản ánh sự thận trọng của các nhà tuyển dụng trong bối cảnh kinh tế còn nhiều bất ổn. Trong khi đó, lĩnh vực dịch vụ đã đánh dấu tháng tăng trưởng thứ 51 liên tiếp trong tháng 11, mặc dù với tốc độ chậm hơn, với PMI ở mức 52,1, được hỗ trợ bởi chi tiêu tiêu dùng mạnh mẽ và tăng trưởng tiền lương. Áp lực lạm phát vẫn tồn tại, nhưng việc giảm bớt tắc nghẽn chuỗi cung ứng và kỳ vọng cuối năm mạnh mẽ cho thấy sự ổn định. Khi Cục Dự trữ Liên bang đánh giá các thay đổi trong chính sách tiềm năng từ chính quyền mới sắp tới, nền kinh tế vẫn được neo giữ bởi thị trường lao động kiên cường và nhu cầu tiêu dùng ổn định. Tuy nhiên, sự phục hồi không đồng đều giữa các lĩnh vực báo hiệu cần phải lạc quan thận trọng. Tuần trước, Hàn Quốc chứng kiến một đợt bùng nổ giao dịch tiền điện tử , với 34 tỷ đô la được ghi nhận chỉ trong vòng 24 giờ trên các sàn giao dịch lớn của nước này. Điều này xảy ra sau khi Tổng thống Yoon Suk-yeol tuyên bố thiết quân luật. Bất ổn chính trị đã gây ra các đợt bán tháo hoảng loạn và sự cố gián đoạn nền tảng, làm nổi bật sự nhạy cảm của thị trường đối với bất ổn địa chính trị. Sàn giao dịch phá sản Mt. Gox cũng đã chuyển 2,4 tỷ đô Bitcoin sang một ví mới, đúng vào lúc Bitcoin lần đầu tiên vượt mốc 100.000 đô la. Và Grayscale đã tham gia vào cuộc đua đầy cạnh tranh để ra mắt quỹ ETF Solana , bằng cách nộp đơn chuyển đổi Quỹ ủy thác Solana của mình khi giá SOL tăng mạnh. Những sự kiện này cho thấy sự tương tác năng động của các yếu tố chính trị, quy định và lịch sử đang định hình bối cảnh tiền điện tử đang phát triển. Và đó là những tóm tắt từ Bitfinex Alpha số 134.

ETH is now consolidating and might aim for a move above the $3,750 resistance zone. Ethereum started a downside correction below $3,780 and $3,750. The price is trading below $3,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,740 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).

Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,750 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,600 level. The first major support sits near the $3,550 zone. A clear move below the $3,550 support might push the price toward the $3,500 support.

Speaking at the Bitcoin MENA 2024 Conference, Scaramucci predicted that China would likely establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve in 2025. Scaramucci Predicts China Will Follow the US Bitcoin Strategy The former White House Communications director predicted that China would return to BTC mining after years of a blanket ban. In addition, the American stated that China will also likely create a BTC strategic reserve next year, following in the footsteps of the US. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Plunge To Multi-Year Lows: Will BTC Gain From Supply Crunch? Scaramucci attributed this potential shift to the pro-crypto stance of the US, driven by the victory of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in the November election. He believes the US’ new regulatory framework for digital assets will pressure other nations to establish similar frameworks. He added that China may have its own Bitcoin strategic reserve by next year. Further, the Asian giant might reconsider the ban on Bitcoin mining and use it as a tool to mine and accumulate more BTC. Scaramucci said: China, there is no way, and I’ll bet money on this, that if the US is moving toward a strategic Bitcoin reserve, that the Chinese are not going to participate. It is worth highlighting that last month, Scaramucci stated that BTC will trade as high as $176,000 in the next two years. He pointed toward a strong demand for BTC and its limited supply of 21 million as major driving factors that could increase the asset’s price in the coming years. Countries Looking To Create BTC Strategic Reserve To recall, cryptocurrency was one of the major themes of President-elect Trump’s election campaign. Since Trump’s victory, speculations surrounding a national BTC strategic reserve have found increasing support from people across different domains. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Track To Replace Gold In 10 Years, Trading Firm Predicts While countries like El Salvador already maintain national Bitcoin reserves, the US creating a similar reserve could have significant global implications. Experts predict that such a move could propel Bitcoin’s price to over $1 million. The US isn’t the only country considering a national Bitcoin reserve. In Brazil, federal deputy Eros Biondini recently introduced legislation establishing a Sovereign Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to diversify the country’s financial assets. Similarly, Russian State Duma Deputy Anton Tkachev has proposed the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This initiative aims to reduce Russia’s reliance on foreign currencies like the USD and yuan for international trade and help mitigate the impact of international sanctions. Establishing a Bitcoin strategic reserve by any major country could trigger a domino effect, prompting others to follow suit. This trend has already been observed among corporations, such as Metaplanet and Hut 8, that have adopted MicroStrategy’s approach of adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. BTC trades at $95,344 at press time, down 1.8% in the past 24 hours.

Caroline Crenshaw, who’s been a commissioner since 2020, is up for renomination. President Biden backs her, but not everyone’s on board. The crypto industry, in particular, has made it clear they want her out. Let’s explore why crypto world does not want to see Crenshaw SEC renomination. A Term Extension That Sparks Controversy If confirmed, Crenshaw’s new term would run through June 2029. That’s a big deal. Originally appointed by President Trump, Crenshaw’s record includes a strong stance on crypto regulation. She’s called the crypto market a “petri dish of fraudulent conduct.” And she supports SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s tough oversight. Her views have drawn criticism, especially from the crypto world. One example? She’s been vocal against approving Bitcoin spot ETFs—a move many in the industry want. This has fueled a major lobbying effort to block her renomination. Crypto Industry Hits Back Hard The opposition isn’t subtle. Leading figures in crypto have turned to social media to criticize Crenshaw. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong even called her a “failure.” That’s a strong word, but it shows how high the stakes are. Beyond Twitter, groups like the Cedar Innovation Foundation and crypto trade associations have funded ad campaigns to sway public opinion. They’ve also sent letters to lawmakers urging them to reject her nomination. Source : X.com What’s more, the Stand with Crypto ratings could make things tricky for senators. These ratings track political support for pro-crypto legislation. A vote against the industry could come back to haunt them in elections. Just look at how crypto PACs like Fairshake have spent millions to back their favored candidates. What’s Next? The big question is whether these efforts will succeed and stops Crenshaw SEC renomination. If all Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee stick together, Crenshaw’s renomination will likely move forward. But it’s not just about the committee. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has to prioritize this vote amid a packed schedule. Government funding, defense bills, and judicial nominations all demand attention too. The crypto industry’s push against Crenshaw could reshape the debate on regulation. Whether or not she’s confirmed, this fight highlights the growing influence of crypto in Washington.",News|US Elections 2024,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-11 03:45:40

Tired of polite algorithms and sanitized content calendars, the team who launched iDEGEN has unleashed the most spectacular AI we’ve ever seen, and it’s running wild on X , soaking up unfiltered data from crypto bros and spitting out whatever it wants every hour. One minute, it’s tweeting conspiracy theories about Bitcoin miners in Antarctica, the next it’s roasting influencers with the kind of savagery that makes even trolls blush. Having recently launched its adaptive auction presale, the IDGN token is already smashing expectations with 3,800% gains in just 14 days. IDGN investors are buying into a movement, a meme, and definitely a little madness—here’s why. The degenerate genius of iDEGEN An AI born in the fire of crypto chaos, absorbing tweets like a digital black hole, and evolving in real-time based on the unhinged ideas of its community. That’s iDEGEN —a sentient AI with zero chill, no filters, and absolutely no clue what it’ll do next. It doesn’t have a PR team. It doesn’t follow trends. One tweet might suggest pumping DOGE to the moon. The next could be a wild theory about Vitalik’s secret crypto vault. The unpredictability is the point—every post is a gamble, every tweet a potential market-moving moment. And it’s learning. Constantly. From you. For too long, Silicon Valley has kept AI wrapped in bubble wrap and drenched in corporate approval. iDEGEN takes that rulebook, shreds it, and sets it on fire. It’s bold, messy, and exactly what the crypto space didn’t know it needed. Whether stirring up chaos or hitting a viral home run, iDEGEN is turning every interaction into a spectacle—and its IDGN coin into an attention magnet. Pumping coins is yesterday’s trend. iDEGEN is pumping the entire culture. And if you’re not feeding it tweets and bagging some IDGN tokens , you’re already behind. Buys explode: Could iDEGEN hit 100x next? In 2024, the recipe for degen euphoria was everything AI. And now, the macro environment is everything risk on: slashed interest rates, sky-high liquidity, and a market hungry for the next big play. But why might iDEGEN just be the most unhinged yet unstoppable meme coin of this cycle? The path is already clear: if we look at similar coins, such as GOAT, which hit a wild $1 billion market cap in only a month, it’s clear that new AI coins are rockets fueled by chaos and unpredictability. But with iDEGEN’s AI, GOAT may be just the warm-up for what’s coming next. iDEGEN’s core innovation—the AI that evolves dynamically based on its degen audience—sets it apart in a market littered with one-trick ponies. It’s already breaking the internet, roasting influencers, and spitting out content that nobody saw coming. And let’s not forget: attention equals pumps, and iDEGEN is drowning in it. The AI crypto market sits comfortably at a $45 billion valuation , with new AI coins like ACT ( 2,200% gains in the past month) riding shotgun. If iDEGEN captures even a fraction of this energy, a 100x run is mathematically feasible. If new AI coins like VVAIFU can hit 3,500% in 30 days , what’s stopping iDEGEN from going 10x, 50x, or even 100x? Nothing except your imagination— and maybe a temporary ban or two along the way. Own the chaos—join the iDEGEN cult The iDEGEN auction is live, starting at $0.00011 and already jumping 3,800%, with a whopping $3.1m raised already. The rules are simple: buy, and the price holds steady. Buy twice in two five-minute periods, and it pumps 5%. Miss your chance, and it dips 5%. Every five minutes, the market decides if you’re part of the action—or left chasing after the next price jump. Once the auction ends, all unsold tokens will be burned, and IDGN will hit exchanges at 10% above the final presale price. Crypto’s bull run is painting charts green, Elon’s back on his DOGE madness, and iDEGEN is dominating every group chat, trading desk, and late-night degens’ scrolling session. iDEGEN is an event. A revolution. A bet on the beautifully unpredictable. Whether you’re here for the gains or the chaos—or both—there’s one thing certain: you don’t want to miss what happens next.

The altcoin market has faced another 24-hour slump, with $481.62 million in long positions liquidated, according to CoinGlass. Pseudonymous trader “Mister Crypto” believes the latest downturn could pave the way for exponential growth. “This was the final shakeout before the real exponential breakouts,” he said in a Dec. 10 X post. Among the biggest losers in the top 100 cryptocurrencies are Ethena (ENA), down 10.46%, Pepe (PEPE), dropping 10.62%, and Bonk (BONK), falling 8.59%, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $96,663, down 1.5% over the past day, after briefly surpassing $100,000 on Dec. 5. Traders Anticipate a Return to Higher Levels Hartmann suggested Bitcoin could retest $99,000, largely driven by “short squeezes.” If Bitcoin rises above $99,000, $1.53 billion in short positions may face liquidation. “There’s a lot of liquidity building up on the topside for Bitcoin,” CryptoSea co-founder Daan de Rover said on Dec. 10. Pseudonymous trader Daan Crypto Trades noted Bitcoin “generally moves 30–50% after breaking a long consolidation.” Santiment warns that panic selling by retail traders could hinder recovery, though long-term gains remain possible.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|BONK|ENA,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-11 03:48:39

Atkins is set to replace outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Many are hopeful that Atkins will undo the damage caused by Gensler, whose leadership led to a loss of trust in the SEC. Retail and institutional investors alike were frustrated under Gensler’s rule, which some believe was influenced by anti-crypto forces like Elizabeth Warren and the banking cartel. One of the key cases that has drawn significant attention is Ripple vs. SEC, which began in 2020. With the recent appointment of Paul Atkins as SEC Chairman, the crypto community is hopeful that the case might be dropped or settled. However, since the case is currently in appeals, the outcome remains uncertain. If the case is dropped, it could mark a significant shift in how the SEC handles crypto-related matters, but the final decision will depend on the developments in the appeals process. Will The SEC Drop The Appeal? Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel explained that while the court found institutional sales to be in violation of the law, it did not rule against programmatic sales, which are currently under appeal. However, if the new administration drops the appeal, the Second Circuit won’t have a chance to weigh in. Fagel further clarified that although Ripple was sued for selling unregistered securities, some of their sales were found to involve securities, while others were not. When a user commented that Judge Torres disagreed with the SEC, Fagel responded, saying that she only disagreed with them in part. He said that she also agreed with the SEC, ruling that Ripple illegally raised over $700 million in an unregistered securities offering. “The court found institutional sales to violate the law, but not programmatic sales. The latter is on appeal. Though if the new administration drops the appeal, we won’t have a chance to have the Second Circuit weigh in, unfortunately,” Fagel wrote.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-11 03:51:21

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address – C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-11 04:03:00

This milestone marks a major achievement for Ripple. The announcement, shared by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse on X, sparked a 10% surge in XRP, Ripple’s native token. The approval paves the way for RLUSD to go live on exchanges and partner platforms, signaling Ripple’s expansion into the stablecoin market. RLUSD: Ripple’s Big Bet on Stablecoins RLUSD is currently in beta testing on the Ethereum network and XRP Ledger (XRPL), with a circulating supply of $52 million. This stablecoin is pegged to short-term U.S. government bonds and aims to tap into the rapidly growing stablecoin market, which is currently dominated by Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC). Ripple’s entry into this market is part of its strategy to become a leader in institutional payments and real-world asset tokenization. Stablecoins Current Market Position The stablecoin market, valued at nearly $200 billion, is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years. Ripple plans to leverage RLUSD to expand its role in global payments while providing a bridge for traditional financial assets to operate on blockchain networks. Tokenization, the process of converting physical assets into digital tokens for faster and more efficient transactions, is a key focus for Ripple. RLUSD is positioned as a major player in this trend. Will it Send XRP Price to ATH? Vincent Van Code, a crypto expert broke down the buzz around Ripple’s RLUSD and XRP in simple terms. He pointed out that while XRP’s recent jump from $1.90 to $2.35 is exciting, it’s mostly driven by speculation, not real-world usage just yet. The real game-changer will come when Ripple sets up automated market makers (AMMs) and liquidity pools (LPs), offering up to 5% annual returns on-chain without any counterparty risk. He explained how this could attract serious funds to the XRPL, with exchanges getting in on the action by offering RLUSD staking. This would lock up more XRP, driving up demand. Plus, users may start swapping USDT for RLUSD and move these funds to their self-custody wallets. From there, they can use RLUSD to buy XRP or invest in LP tokens to earn even better returns—creating a feedback loop that raises XRP demand even further. In short, this isn’t just about today’s price pump; it’s about setting the stage for sustained growth. Van Code predicts RLUSD could double XRP demand and potentially shake up the market by February 2025. However the present scenario is quite alarming, the crypto market is taking a big hit, with XRP dropping 12% to $2.07. This sharp fall reflects a tough day for many cryptocurrencies, as prices tumble across the board. Despite recent good news for Ripple, like its stablecoin approval, the market’s volatility shows no signs of slowing down. When Will RLUSD Launch ? The RLUSD stablecoin by Ripple is expected to launch by the end of 2024 , following its recent regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) . Is the Federal Reserve Going to Use XRP?

Cryptocurrency Derivatives Market Has Just Seen Massive Long Liquidations According to data from CoinGlass, a mass amount of liquidations have piled up over on the derivatives side of the cryptocurrency sector during the last 24 hours. “Liquidation” here refers to the forceful closure that any open contract undergoes when its bet fails enough to accumulate losses equal to a certain degree (the exact value of which may differ between platforms). Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLing Rewards: Long-Term Holders Selling At 326% Profit Below is a table that breaks down the relevant numbers related to the liquidations from the past day. As is visible, there have been total liquidations of cryptocurrency-related contracts worth a whopping $1.56 billion in the past day. The long holders were involved in an overwhelming majority of this flush, with liquidations associated with them standing at $1.39 billion (almost 90% of the total). The reason behind the large liquidations is the crash that the altcoin market has faced during this window, with many popular coins like XRP and Dogecoin being down double digits. It would appear that many traders had set up bullish positions on the market, hoping that the recent momentum led by Bitcoin’s exploration to new highs would continue shortly. BTC has interestingly managed to limit its losses to just 2%, but evidently, the rest of the market hasn’t been so lucky. As for which of the assets was responsible for the most liquidations, the below heatmap shows it. Usually, Bitcoin leads the market liquidations, but it appears the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum has instead contributed the most towards the flush with $229 million in positions. Dogecoin and XRP have followed BTC’s $173 million liquidations with flushes of $88 million and $68 million, respectively. Their large liquidations are likely due to their popularity and the notable scale of drawdown they have seen. It would also seem that the speculative interest in the sector has been so deep recently that the small cap assets (referred to as ‘others’ in the heatmap) have added up to a massive $496 million liquidation. Related Reading: Analyst Sets $4.40 XRP Target As 3rd-Straight Bull Pennant Forms Mass liquidation events aren’t particularly rare in the cryptocurrency sector, but today’s flush has been extraordinary even for the market’s standards. These events happen from time to time because coins across the board generally display notable volatility, and a lot of speculators opt for risky amounts of leverage. These two conditions have been particularly pronounced recently, which is why the derivatives sector has exploded in this fashion. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $2.09, down almost 15% in the last seven days.

Fast forward to the Web3 era, and BitMEX CEO Stephan Lutz, who was appointed to the role in late 2022, says he's fine with competitors copying the crypto exchange's invention of the perpetual swap, the financial instrument that underpins the crypto derivatives market. The more traders access the tool, the healthier the market, the logic goes. “It was copied by everyone, because that’s just open-source know-how,"" Lutz said in an interview with CoinDesk. The whole world works on it, which is like the best form of flattery we can wish for in the end.” Unlike futures — which are contracts to buy or sell an asset at a specific price on a specific date — the perpetual swap eliminates expiration and mirrors the feel of margin trading. Perpetuals act as a rolling series of short-term futures contracts using a funding rate, or payment exchanged between long and short positions, to maintain price alignment with the underlying asset. Lutz argues that the perpetual swap was a cornerstone innovation in crypto trading because it addressed a fundamental challenge in building derivatives in the early crypto market structure. ""You faced counterparty credit risk, and there was no real structure for bringing longs and shorts together,” he said. ""The perpetual swap with the funding mechanism and the insurance fund in the background sparked the whole [futures] trading industry."" It also allows traders to react with the hyperdrive speed required in crypto. ""If you say it's a seven-year cycle [ some investors believe the market functions in this pattern ] in TradFi, this cycle is six months in crypto,"" Lutz, a veteran of Deutsche Börse, which operates the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, said. ""You need to react to new developments very quickly."" While BitMEX is nowhere near the largest derivatives exchange by volume anymore – that's what happens when larger centralized exchanges, like Binance, adopt the perp and get into the derivatives business – it still has a loyal cadre of traders. One reason for that is because BitMEX does not have its own market-making desk. It doesn't trade against its own customers, Lutz said. ""Our funding rates can sometimes differ because we ensure completely independent price discovery, which is important for maintaining fairness,"" he said. ""It's a matter of neutrality."" During periods of high volatility, particularly market downturns, BitMEX often sees its market share spike — sometimes double — Lutz explains because of the exchange's loyal cadre of derivatives traders. Another 10 years Sometimes it's tough to imagine where a crypto company will be in 10 years, given the speed at which the industry operates. Compare the liquidation and winding up of Lehman Brothers, to the relatively rapid resolution of FTX's bankruptcy. As for BitMEX, Lutz foresees the exchange maintaining its niche in bitcoin-based derivatives while selectively expanding its offerings. And maybe sometime during this next decade, BitMEX will invent something new — and be flattered when the entire industry copies it.",Markets,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-11 05:02:50

There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $220 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. The next major resistance is near the $224 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $243 swing high to the $203 low. The main resistance could be $228. A successful close above the $228 resistance level could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $235. Any more gains might send the price toward the $250 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $220 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $212 level. The first major support is near the $205 level. A break below the $205 level might send the price toward the $200 zone. If there is a close below the $200 support, the price could decline toward the $188 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level.

John E. Deaton following his interview on 60 Minutes highlighted Garlinghouse’s resilience during Ripple’s ongoing battle with the SEC and its recent stablecoin launch, making a case for him as “Crypto CEO of the Year.” With Ripple sailing rough waters and still expanding, 2025 could be the company’s most transformative year yet. https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1866676037049782422 A Tough Fight with the SEC Ripple has been fighting a long legal battle with the SEC, and many, including crypto expert John E. Deaton, believe the company could win. Deaton points to the support of key commissioners like Hester Peirce, Mark Uyeda, and Paul Atkins who think the SEC’s appeal should be dismissed. If the appeal is dropped by voting, Ripple could finally get the clarity it needs to operate more freely in the U.S. market. This would be a big win for Ripple and could open up new opportunities for growth in the U.S., a crucial market for the company. Positioning for a Regulatory Breakthrough Deaton predicts 2025 could be Ripple’s defining year, especially if the SEC’s appeal is dismissed, a move even critics like John Reed Stark support. With a pro-crypto administration and bipartisan regulatory clarity on the horizon, Ripple’s U.S. market expansion appears promising. Deaton highlighted the company’s resilience, achieving 95% of its business outside the U.S. during regulatory hurdles. In January 2024, Ripple’s bold $285 million share buyback at an $11 billion valuation showcased confidence, despite legal uncertainties. With $1 billion in cash and 40 billion XRP held in escrow, Deaton speculates Ripple’s valuation could exceed $100 billion. A dismissed appeal might pave the way for Ripple’s IPO by late 2025 or early 2026. Moreover, with Trump’s win, many predict that the Ripple vs SEC case will be dismissed by the new SEC commissioner. RLUSD’s launch before the finale of the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit in January hints that Ripple is very sure that the case will not drag further. However, the news has not given a positive boost to XRP as predicted and it dropped by 12% to $2.07. While the entire crypto market is down in the holiday season it will be interesting to see how and when XRP touches its coveted target of $3. Is XRP a Good Investment ? XRP could be a good investment given Ripple’s strong leadership, solid financials, and potential regulatory clarity in 2025, which may boost growth. However, ongoing SEC challenges and market volatility present risks to consider. How high can XRP go? XRP can reach a high of $3 or more if Ripple secures a favorable outcome in its legal battle with the SEC and gains regulatory clarity in the U.S. This, combined with Ripple’s strong financial position and potential IPO, could drive its growth.",News|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-11 05:18:41

Crying Kamala (CRYKAMA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CRYKAMA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Crying Kamala can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crying Kamala could become the next viral memecoin. Crying Kamala launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crying Kamala on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crying Kamala by entering its contract address – 5eCJhSGBUN4YwJHLU9ZcWjrjmoufVznjzNBHfo4TN1P7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRYKAMA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-11 05:20:00

Crypto analysts believe that this 20x gain on SOL is very much a possibility in the future bull run. With more than a 200% surge in 2024 so far, it is already one of the top-performing altcoins, with a market cap soaring past $100 billion. Can Solana Price Stage Mega Rally to $4,000? Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez has projected a bullish future for Solana ($SOL), suggesting the token could soar to $4,000. The prediction is based on the analysis of a classic “cup and handle” chart pattern. This ambitious target reflects growing confidence in Solana’s ecosystem and its long-term price trajectory. Source: Ali Charts Of course, this price target is a long-term projection as another $20x gain would mean that SOL becomes a $2 trillion asset, the current size of Bitcoin. But market analysts still believe that the mega SOL rally isn’t over and we could at least see $600 levels in the upcoming bull run and $420 by Christmas. Following its monthly top of $263, the Solana price retraced more than 20% to hit the low of $203 on Tuesday, December 10, before bouncing back from there again. Popular crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa has shared a bullish outlook for Solana price, predicting that a bottom could form in the near future. According to the analyst, “Bottom formations are often violent events and take some time, but overall, those who are willing to buy are rewarded.” I think we bottom relatively soon.

CryptoQuant analysis shows that Solana is one of the many altcoins that could hit fresh all-time highs after some healthy pullback over the last two weeks. The heatmaps for altcoins project SOL as a leading candidate to hit fresh all-time highs soon. Courtesy: CryptoQuant SOL ETF Approval Faces Resistance While the market has been anticipating a spot Solana ETF approval for a long time, recent reports suggest that the current administration of the US SEC is unwilling to consider it. Crypto market analysts believe that would only be possible after Paul Atkins takes charge of the SEC chair next month in January. It would be interesting to see how long would it take to approve SOL ETF after Donald Trump takes charge of the White House in January. Several market players like Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares, Canary Capital, and Grayscale have filed for a spot Solana ETF in the past few months. As of press time, the SOL price is trading at $219 with a market cap above $103 billion.

Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin received approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), while Tether’s USDT was recognized as an Accepted Virtual Asset (AVA) by the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). Ripple Secures NYDFS Approval for RLUSD Stablecoin, Aims to Revolutionize Institutional Payments Ripple Labs has achieved a significant milestone with the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approving its RLUSD stablecoin. Announced by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse in a Dec. 10 X post, the approval marks a pivotal step for Ripple's expansion into the competitive stablecoin market. The RLUSD stablecoin, first unveiled in April 2024, is positioned as a competitor to Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. These two market leaders currently boast a combined market capitalization of $180 billion. Ripple has ambitious plans for RLUSD, projecting that the stablecoin could reach a staggering $2 trillion market capitalization by 2028. Ripple's foray into the stablecoin sector began with RLUSD’s testing on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August. By October, the company announced partnerships with several high-profile exchanges, including Uphold, Bitstamp, Bitso, MoonPay, Independent Reserve, CoinMENA, and Bullish. These collaborations were instrumental in preparing RLUSD for its eventual launch and adoption. Garlinghouse has hinted that announcements on exchange and partner listings for RLUSD are imminent, setting the stage for Ripple to compete directly with existing stablecoins. With the NYDFS approval, Ripple has cleared a regulatory hurdle that solidifies its credibility in the eyes of institutional players—a key target demographic for RLUSD. RLUSD, like other USD-backed stablecoins, will maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. Ripple has outlined a robust reserve strategy, including USD deposits, short-term US Treasury bonds, and other cash equivalents, to ensure stability. This approach aligns with the increasing regulatory scrutiny faced by stablecoin issuers. Monica Long, Ripple’s president, described RLUSD in June as “complementary and additive” to Ripple’s flagship XRP token. This dual offering positions Ripple to cater to both retail and institutional audiences, leveraging XRP’s established network while RLUSD addresses the growing demand for stable, dollar-backed digital assets. Ripple’s stablecoin strategy emphasizes institutional adoption. Garlinghouse highlighted this focus in September, outlining plans to tailor RLUSD to financial institutions seeking efficient, transparent, and secure payment solutions. By addressing this niche, Ripple aims to carve out a substantial market share in the burgeoning stablecoin sector. Ripple’s entry into the stablecoin market comes amidst its ongoing legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over XRP token offerings. Despite the legal challenges, Ripple continues to advocate for the broader cryptocurrency industry, with Garlinghouse recently appearing on CBS’s 60 Minutes to discuss the sector’s potential impact on the 2024 US presidential election. Ripple’s Competitive Edge What sets Ripple apart is its established reputation and robust infrastructure. The company’s XRP Ledger is known for its speed, scalability, and low transaction costs. By integrating RLUSD into this ecosystem, Ripple offers an end-to-end solution for cross-border payments and financial transactions. Furthermore, Ripple’s partnerships with global exchanges and financial institutions enhance RLUSD’s accessibility and usability. This network effect could play a crucial role in RLUSD achieving its ambitious market capitalization target. Ripple’s approval from the NYDFS is a critical step, but the journey is far from over. The company now faces the challenge of scaling RLUSD and gaining traction in a market dominated by USDT and USDC. However, Ripple’s innovative approach, combined with its focus on institutional adoption, positions it well for success. As the cryptocurrency industry evolves, stablecoins like RLUSD are poised to play an increasingly vital role in bridging traditional finance and blockchain technology. Tether’s USDt Stablecoin Gains Regulatory Recognition in Abu Dhabi Global Market While Ripple tries to gain traction in the stablecoin market, Tether continues to expand its lead. The Abu Dhabi Global Market’s (ADGM) Financial Services Regulatory Authority has officially recognized Tether’s USDt (USDT) stablecoin as an Accepted Virtual Asset (AVA). This development not only solidifies USDT’s status as the largest stablecoin by market capitalization but is also evidence of the United Arab Emirates’ commitment to becoming a global leader in digital finance. The recognition allows licensed financial service providers within the ADGM to offer services related to USDT, marking a significant milestone in the stablecoin’s journey. Covering USDT issued on multiple blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche, the decision aligns with the UAE’s broader strategy of fostering innovation and embracing digital finance. With a market capitalization exceeding $138 billion, Tether’s USDT continues to dominate the stablecoin market, holding approximately 70% of the sector’s total value. This endorsement by the ADGM further reinforces USDT’s role as a critical bridge between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. The ADGM’s decision to integrate USDT into its regulatory framework is a strong indication of its ambition to position Abu Dhabi as a hub for financial innovation. By welcoming stablecoins into its ecosystem, the ADGM is not only supporting economic diversification within the UAE but also laying the groundwork for a future where digital and traditional financial systems coexist seamlessly. The move follows a global trend where regulatory bodies recognize the potential of stablecoins to enhance financial inclusivity and efficiency. However, it also comes with challenges as regulators grapple with ensuring robust risk management and stability in this fast-evolving space. The ADGM’s forward-looking stance contrasts with more cautious views from regulatory bodies such as the United States Financial Services Oversight Council (FSOC). The FSOC has consistently flagged concerns about the concentration of market power in the stablecoin sector, with Tether being the dominant player. The council’s warnings shed some light on potential risks, including systemic vulnerabilities and exposure to bank runs. In its most recent report, the FSOC emphasized the need for stronger risk management standards to mitigate these risks as stablecoins continue to gain traction in traditional financial systems. Tether’s recent activity has further cemented its position as a major player in the cryptocurrency market. In November, the company injected over $5 billion into the market within 72 hours, fueling discussions about its influence on market dynamics. This rapid expansion coincided with Bitcoin’s surge to a record high of $76,200, highlighting the intertwined nature of stablecoin activity and broader market movements. The minting spree propelled USDT’s market capitalization from $124 billion in early November to $138 billion by Dec. 10, a growth trajectory that coincided with the ADGM approval. Balancing Opportunity and Risk While the recognition of USDT as an AVA in the ADGM is a positive development for Tether and the broader stablecoin sector, it also brings regulatory challenges to the forefront. Stablecoins offer unparalleled opportunities for financial innovation, but their integration into traditional systems must be carefully managed to ensure stability and transparency. The ADGM’s decision is a step toward achieving this balance, setting a precedent for other jurisdictions to follow. By providing a regulated framework for stablecoins, the ADGM is fostering trust and encouraging broader adoption of digital assets in mainstream financial systems. As the global stablecoin market continues to grow, regulatory acceptance like that from the ADGM will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of digital finance. For Tether, this recognition is not just a validation of USDT’s utility but also an opportunity to expand its presence in the Middle East, a region increasingly seen as a hub for cryptocurrency innovation. With its dominant market position and ongoing efforts to integrate into regulated ecosystems, Tether is poised to remain a cornerstone of the stablecoin sector. The UAE’s proactive approach, exemplified by the ADGM’s decision, sets a strong example for other nations exploring the potential of stablecoins as a tool for financial inclusion and economic growth.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-11 05:30:23

According to them, rising investor interest, more involvement from major financial players, good economic conditions, and more friendly political attitudes will all contribute to making 2025 the “Year of the Crypto IPO”. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana to reach new records according to Bitwise Another prediction included in the report was for BTC to cross $200,000 by the end of next year. A bonus prediction mentions BTC to surpass gold’s market cap of $18 trillion in the year 2029. On the other hand, Ethereum will also hit a record high of $7,000, pushed by increasing activity on Ethereum’s layer 2 networks, including a “massive growth in stablecoins and tokenized projects” and more cash inflows into Ether exchange-traded funds. Hougan and Rasmussen expect Solana’s association with “serious” projects to increase its price to $750, a 250% rise from its current price of $215.

This blockchain-powered Fund changes the traditional donation paradigm by bridging the gap between investing and donating, allowing investors to become part of something greater. Additionally, with the added element of a fair launch, investors can also benefit from the current bullish economy. What is Charity Investment Fund? The desire to do good lies within everyone. However, not everyone is incentivised to take the right direction. Charity Investment Fund makes it easier by implementing a simple approach: tying the generation of returns to donations. Users can invest in the native digital currency introduced by CHIF. By doing so, they not only create new opportunities to earn gains but also participate in a movement aimed at tackling global challenges. This approach, according to the project’s developers, harnesses the strength of the investment world and directs it toward the path of growth. In essence, the goal of CHIF is to create a circular economy with an altruistic end-game. An influx of investors, incentivised to do good deeds, may come flowing in, and in return, donations will continue to be generated. In theory, this could lead to a perpetual influx of donations, making the world all the better for it. Beneficiaries Of This Unique Donation Ecosystem With charitable initiatives, it is important to have clear goals. It is impractical to focus on all different types of organisations, but one cannot avert their eyes from legitimate causes either. Therefore, Charity Investment Fund has taken an innovative stand to ensure that everyone is taken care of properly. 50% of all the proceeds generated from the ecosystem will be distributed among a selection of charitable foundations. These foundations are yet to be affiliated with this initiative. However, the Charity Investment Fund will not solely decide on selecting the right recipients by itself. Since CHIF is a community-driven initiative, those who participate in this project will benefit. A poll is available on the website to ensure that all donors, as well as investors, have a say in dictating the direction of where the proceeds go. And since transparency is the goal the organisation is striving to achieve, donors will also receive a detailed report of where the funds eventually end up. CHIF Token – The Core Element of Charity Investment Fund Charity Investment Fund is striving to create a sustainable economy with the CHIF token. Described in the whitepaper as a social impact token, it has been developed on the Binance Smart Chain and a wrapped token (wCHIF) is planned to run on an EVM-compatible blockchain. The latter is a custom blockchain designed to facilitate the donation ecosystem. The EVM-compatible chain will also play a major role in expanding Charity Investment Fund’s reach. Additionally, the token is audited, which adds another layer of trust to the organisation. This chain will operate on a Proof of Authority consensus mechanism, reducing transaction costs and enhancing processing speed. Furthermore, the chain will enhance security while reducing energy consumption, making Charity Investment Fund an eco-friendly platform as well. CHIF Fair Launch – Giving All an Equal Chance to Grow CHIF will be made available via a fair launch, an event that will start on December 18th, 2024. The token’s fair launch has been designed as an inclusive event, giving everyone a fair chance to invest in this project. Pinksale has been chosen as the portal for people to participate in this fair launch, and token distribution has already been finalised. 51% of the amount generated through the fair launch will go into the liquidity pool. The remaining 49% will be distributed equally among the Charity Investment Fund initiatives and charities. Beyond Fair Launch – Charity Investment Fund’s 50/50 Model Charity Investment Fund has ensured that it continues to adhere to its altruistic goals beyond the fair launch. So, once the initial launch has concluded, CHIF tokens held by Charity Investment Fund will be split 50/50. That means that for any tokens sold by the Fund afterwards, 50% of the proceeds will go to different charitable organisations. 12 organisations have been nominated so far, they include. 1. World Wildlife Fund (WWF) 2. Ukrainian Red Cross 3. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in Asia-Pacific 4. World Animal Protection US 5. UNICEF 6. Oxfam International 7. Rainforest Alliance 8. Charity: Water 9. Amnesty International 10. American Cancer Society 11. Oceana 12. IFAW As for the remaining 50% of the tokens held by Charity Investment Fund, they will be used to further develop the project. The end goal is to create a charitable platform with a dedicated wallet for each charity. This wallet will store tokens that are tied to a specific charity, creating a trustless system where donations automatically go to the charitable organisations. With its unique approach to creating a charity ecosystem driven by a new form of economy, the Charity Investment Fund might become a leading cryptocurrency investment in the future. People want to do good, and when there is a project that can nudge them in that direction through profit, it represents a good deal. Furthermore, the broader market dynamics may also push the value of the CHIF token higher, making focusing on the upcoming fair launch a prudent choice.

The United States has been at the forefront in advocating for a strategic Bitcoin reserve since the re-election of President-elect Donald Trump. Furthermore, top Fed officials believe that Bitcoin is a digital gold with better features including a limited supply of 21 million units. Additionally, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has proved to be a major success on Wall Street, signaling heightened demand from institutional investors. Alabama State to Lead on Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Plan The state of Alabama could be eyeing to adopt a strategic Bitcoin reserve to ramp up local investment and businesses. According to the state’s auditor Andrew Sorell, the adoption of a Bitcoin plan will shield the people of Alabama from rising inflation and the potential impact of ongoing global de-dollarization. “A well-balanced portfolio should include exposure to many different types of asset classes. As of now, crypto is a $3 trillion asset class that the state has zero exposure to. It is also the most rapidly growing asset class, with the greatest potential for price appreciation. Investing in Treasuries and bonds certainly has its place, but earning a 4% yield while inflation is 2.7% is barely breaking even,” Sorell noted. Market Impact According to Dennis Porter, co-founder of Satoshi Action Fund, the adoption of a strategic Bitcoin reserve will largely escalate the supply vs demand crisis. Furthermore, the supply of Bitcoin on centralized exchanges has dropped to a multi-year low of below 2.26M amid heightened demand from whale investors. With the United States seeking to purchase around 1 million Bitcoin in the next five years under the Trump administration, the overall supply will heavily shrink and result in a super bull cycle.

Currently, BabyDoge is trading at $0.00000000539, which is just 16% from its 2022 all-time high (ATH). Will we see a breakout soon? Musk Sparks BabyDoge Mania Elon Musk, the business mogul and meme coin fanatic, sent two tweets this week that helped bolster the BabyDoge price. First, he tweeted an image depicting a doge dog heading a sandstorm that is sweeping across a city. This is likely a reference to his position as co-head of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E for short) once President-elect Trump takes office. The department aims to cut U.S. government spending but has drawn a lot of buzz among crypto fans because its ticker symbol resembles Dogecoin’s. Unsurprisingly, Musk was unable to resist playing on this. He’s posted countless memes about it since the position was first proposed. pic.twitter.com/eYTt40ahVq — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 7, 2024 Musk then tweeted a second image of him and his son captioned “The Dogefather” and “The Dogeson.” Although Musk didn’t address Baby Doge Coin directly, the resemblance was enough to cause a buying frenzy. pic.twitter.com/DYazX7KMhh — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 7, 2024 Based on its current price of $0.00000000539, BabyDoge is up 23% today, 119% this week, and 105% this month. It holds an $851 million market cap and a $1.73 billion 24-hour trading volume. Traders Eye New ATH Top traders favor BabyDoge hitting a new ATH soon, with Solberg Invest saying it could occur early in 2025. The analyst noted that the price broke above a trendline resistance level and even broke above a key macro mid-range level. He suggests that BabyDoge will retest this mid-range support before pressing to a new ATH. $BABYDOGE Bulls in Control! Rally post-downtrend break, targeting $0.00000000678!

And while some traders target new highs, others are now seeking the next project that could provide big gains. Analysts Think These Meme Coins Could Explode Next One of the newest projects getting a lot of attention is Crypto All-Stars . It’s building a meme coin staking platform that lets users stake Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Bonk, and more from one app. Users can maximize their staking rewards by holding $STARS, which unifies meme coin fans industry-wide under one token. It’s a concept that could attract huge demand, which analysts say could translate to strong price growth. For instance, ClayBro says it could 10x. He also notes that the project shows huge early demand, which adds to its growth potential. Crypto All-Stars is conducting a presale that has raised over $11 million so far. However, as ClayBro highlights, the presale ends in 10 days, so prospective buyers must act quickly. Flockerz is another promising presale project. It’s creating a new form of governance called “Vote-to-Earn.” This is where all holders of the $FLOCK meme coin get to vote on every decision relating to the project’s future and get paid for it. By placing control in the community’s hands, it ensures decentralization while creating token utility, which could uplift buying pressure. Investors can also stake their $FLOCK tokens for more rewards. Analyst Austin Hilton hailed this as a “great meme coin presale” and urged investors not to miss out. The presale is ongoing and has raised $5.4 million so far. Fartcoin is another meme coin showing huge potential. While it’s not in its presale phase like Crypto All-Stars and Flockerz, it’s in the AI-agent narrative, which is trending and could have much more room for growth. The project uses Andy Ayrey’s Terminal of Truth platform, allowing users to watch an unrestricted conversation between two AI agents unfold in real-time. The idea is to test AI’s boundaries and limitations and find whether it can produce unexpected applications in the crypto space. Indeed, the project’s name instils comedic value, which meme coins are renowned for. This synergy of disruptive technology and memetic humour has made it a fan favourite, with Fartcoin trending on social media this week. Analyst yh_0x noted Fartcoin’s recent strength and suggests it will push toward new highs in the coming weeks. $FARTCOIN one of the strongest recovery of any coin thus far. Clear demand, I think this breakouts to new highs soon.

Recent data from CryptoQuant has highlighted patterns in accumulation and exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, providing a detailed look at Ethereum’s potential trajectory as it underperforms relative to Bitcoin in the current cycle. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Faces Pressure: Bulls Tested After Setback Analyzing Trends in Accumulation and ETF Inflows In a series of posts shared on social media platform X, CryptoQuant analysts dissected Ethereum’s key metrics. One of the standout observations was Ethereum’s balance in accumulation addresses. These addresses now hold approximately 19.5 million ETH, valued at around $78 billion. For comparison, Bitcoin accumulation addresses hold about 2.8 million BTC, worth $280 billion. While the dollar value of Bitcoin held is four times larger than Ethereum, this aligns with their relative market capitalizations, offering insights into investor behaviour. Another critical metric spotlighted was the steady inflow into Ethereum-focused ETFs over the past months. Notable spikes were recorded on several key dates, including $1.1 billion on November 11 and $839 million on December 4, 2024. According to the CryptoQuant analysts, these consistent inflows are a strong indicator of institutional buying interest, reinforcing Ethereum’s growing appeal among large-scale investors. The Ethereum ETF has seen steady inflows in recent months. Key spikes on: Nov 11, 2024: $1,100M Nov 21, 2024: $754M Nov 25, 2024: $629M Nov 27, 2024: $883M Dec 4, 2024: $839M These inflows reflect strong buying pressure. pic.twitter.com/OIwWNmRPYB — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 10, 2024 Despite the strong ETF demand, Ethereum’s price movements have been less dramatic compared to Bitcoin’s performance in this cycle. Historically, Ethereum’s price peaks have trailed Bitcoin’s, as seen during the 2021 bull run. At that time, Bitcoin hit an all-time high (ATH) in March with a 480% gain, while Ethereum peaked few months after with roughly 1,114% increase. However, in the current cycle, Ethereum appears to be underperforming, signaling a shift in market dynamics. Taker Volume and Potential Growth Furthermore, a significant area of concern the analysts mentioned is the Ethereum’s taker volume, which reflects market sentiment by comparing aggressive buying and selling activity. CryptoQuant reported that Ethereum’s taker-seller volume has hit a record low of -400 million. This aggressive selling activity is reminiscent of patterns observed before its ATH in 2021. While the current selling pressure may seem bearish, it could also signal a market nearing a critical pivot point. Ethereum Taker Volume is at its lowest level on record.

In a Dec. 10 X post, Scam Sniffer revealed that fraudsters are creating fake X accounts to impersonate well-known crypto influencers. They then invite users to join Telegram groups under the guise of offering exclusive investment insights. Once inside the Telegram group, users are prompted to verify their identities through “OfficiaISafeguardBot,” a fraudulent verification bot. According to Scam Sniffer, this bot “creates artificial urgency” by imposing short timeframes for verification. How the Scam Works The fake bot injects malicious PowerShell code into victims’ systems, downloading and running malware designed to compromise both computer systems and crypto wallets. Scam Sniffer reported “numerous cases” of this malware being used to steal private keys, enabling the theft of cryptocurrency. The security firm explained that the recent known cases of this scam were all linked to the fake verification bot. “It’s currently unclear if there are other malicious bots. However, it’s obviously simple for them to impersonate others as well,” Scam Sniffer told Cointelegraph. Sophisticated Infrastructure Behind the Scam Scam Sniffer noted that while malware targeting everyday users has existed for a long time, the infrastructure supporting such scams is “developing rapidly” and becoming increasingly “sophisticated.” The firm likened this evolution to a “scam-as-a-service” model, where creators of crypto wallet-draining malware provide their tools to phishing scammers for profit. Although malware distribution via Telegram and impersonation scams are not new, Scam Sniffer stated, “This is the first time we’re seeing this specific combination of fake X accounts, fake Telegram channels, and malicious Telegram bots.”",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-11 06:02:00

Meanwhile, Ray Dalio recently backed Bitcoin and gold as hedges against a looming debt crisis, and Eric Trump predicted that Bitcoin could reach $1 million. Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings expanded its Bitcoin holdings to 40,435 BTC, valued at $3.92 billion, and achieved a record-breaking 50 EH/s hashrate. Microsoft Sticks to Traditional Treasury Strategy Over Bitcoin Microsoft shareholders rejected a proposal to add Bitcoin (BTC) to the company’s balance sheet during the annual shareholder meeting on Dec. 10. The resolution was put forth by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a pro-free-market think tank, and argued that adopting Bitcoin would diversify profits and enhance shareholder value. The proposal suggested allocating 1% to 5% of Microsoft’s profits to Bitcoin investments and pointed out the potential of Bitcoin as a transformative financial asset. The proposal also claimed it could create trillions in value while mitigating risks for shareholders. During the meeting, NCPPR presented a pre-recorded video supporting its proposal. The video shed some light on Bitcoin’s growing institutional adoption, and mentioned BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF and MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy as examples. The think tank described Bitcoin as volatile but maintained that ignoring it could jeopardize shareholder interests. Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor also addressed Microsoft’s board, and shared that Bitcoin could add close to $5 trillion to the company’s market cap. Despite these arguments, Microsoft’s board dismissed the proposal as unnecessary due to its existing robust processes for managing corporate treasury to ensure stability and predictability. In its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the board specifically referred to the risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility and shared that it is very confident in the company’s current strategies for long-term shareholder benefit. The board also dismissed comparisons to MicroStrategy due to some differences in the firms’ approaches to the cryptocurrency market. Shareholders ultimately aligned with the board’s guidance by voting against the resolution. The NCPPR pursued similar initiatives with other major corporations. On Dec. 8, the group submitted a proposal to Amazon, and suggested that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against inflation and protect shareholder value. This proposal will be reviewed during Amazon’s shareholder meeting in April of 2025. Ray Dalio Warns of Debt Crisis and Backs Bitcoin Rumors suggest that people and companies not getting on the Bitcoin train now might regret it soon. Billionaire investor Ray Dalio recently voiced some of his concerns about a looming global financial crisis tied to unsustainable debt levels, and urged a pivot toward hard assets like Bitcoin and gold. At a financial conference in Abu Dhabi, Dalio, who is the founder of Bridgewater Associates, spoke about the unprecedented indebtedness in major economies like the United States and China. He warned that the current trajectory could result in a debt crisis and a big decline in the value of money in the years ahead. Ray Dalio (Source: South China Morning Post ) Dalio advised people to steer clear of debt assets, including bonds, and placed emphasis on the importance of focusing on broader economic forces rather than daily market fluctuations. He also believes in the value of hard money, and suggested gold and Bitcoin as viable options for investors looking to hedge against inflation and economic instability. While Dalio previously doubted the potential of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, he recently shifted his stance by advocating for its inclusion in investment portfolios. In 2022, he even recommended allocating up to 2% of a portfolio to Bitcoin alongside gold to counter inflationary pressures. This endorsement happened amid broader debates about Bitcoin’s role in national financial strategies. Gold advocate Peter Schiff recently called on the Biden administration to sell all Bitcoin held by the U.S. government, and argued that a move like that could reduce the 2024 budget deficit and counter what he described as the harmful idea of establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Eric Trump Predicts Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million Eric Trump, the executive vice president of the Trump Organization and son of President-elect Donald Trump, shared his very optimistic vision for Bitcoin during a keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 10. Trump predicted that Bitcoin will eventually reach $1 million per coin, and described the crypto as a “financial paradigm” capable of transforming the global economy. Trump strongly believes in Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and a hedge against inflation, political instability, and natural disasters. Trump drew parallels between Bitcoin adoption and the rise of email, and shared that revolutionary technologies often take time to gain mass acceptance. He also referred to Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins as a unique feature that will drive its value in the long term. Following his latest prediction, Trump has joined other well known advocates like Michael Saylor and Cathie Wood, who both forecasted that BTC could reach the $1 million milestone. Eric Trump at MENA Abu Dhabi (Source: YouTube ) He also stressed the importance of early adoption, and warned that those who fail to embrace Bitcoin and digital currencies risk falling behind. Trump specifically referred to the growing interest in cryptocurrency among major institutions, and shared an anecdote about a friend whose bank, one of the world’s largest, recently launched a crypto desk and committed large resources to the space. Trump finished his speech by celebrating Bitcoin’s recent milestone of surpassing $100,000 for the first time. He also praised the Bitcoin community for their dedication, and reiterated the Trump family’s support for the cryptocurrency. MARA Buys $1.1 Billion in Bitcoin Bitcoin mining giant MARA Holdings Inc. once again expanded its Bitcoin holdings after purchasing 11,774 BTC for $1.1 billion on Dec. 10. The crypto was bought at an average price of $96,000 per Bitcoin, and the purchase was funded through a zero-coupon convertible note offering that was conducted last month. With this acquisition, MARA’s total Bitcoin holdings rose to 40,435 BTC, which is valued at approximately $3.92 billion at the current price. The company reported a 12.3% BTC Yield in the fourth quarter and a 47.6% yield for the year. This reflects the percentage increase in its Bitcoin holdings relative to its fully diluted shares outstanding. MARA implemented a treasury policy since July to retain all Bitcoin it mines while leveraging capital market instruments to boost its reserves even more, very similar to the strategy employed by MicroStrategy. In addition to increasing its Bitcoin holdings, MARA also achieved a major milestone in mining operations. The company’s hashrate doubled in 2024 to reach 50 exahashes per second (EH/s). MARA is the first public Bitcoin miner to achieve this benchmark. Despite these accomplishments, MARA’s stock experienced mixed performance. Shares closed 4.4% lower at $22.81 on Dec. 10 and have seen minimal after-hours recovery. Year-to-date, MARA’s stock is down 0.55%, which is in stark contrast to its remarkable 586% surge during 2023’s market rebound.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-11 06:13:03

Is this a good time to buy, or should traders await a bigger dip? Turbo Pumps On Coinbase Listing and AI Boom The strength behind Turbo’s recent pump is two-fold. First, this project was just listed on Coinbase, which will expose it to tens of millions of platform users who didn’t previously have access. Unsurprisingly, this triggered a sharp price uprising. Turbo was also listed on Binance in September, so it’s now available on the two largest centralized exchanges. The second reason for Turbo’s strength is the rising demand for AI-related cryptos. Turbo claims to be the first AI-created meme coin, launched in 2023. This historical claim works in its favor as the AI meme coin sector grows, and it’s blistering hot right now. It's literally all about AI. You don't hold enough AI coins. https://t.co/wuaNam6qiu — Kaduna (@CryptoKaduna) December 9, 2024 This year, AI-agent meme coins such as Goatseus Maximimus and ACT I: The AI Propehcy have emerged, and netizens are continually exploring new blockchain applications using them. Analytics platform Kaito AI highlighted this in a recent tweet, noting that the bulk of crypto “mindshare” is concentrated in the AI and meme coin sectors. Current narrative mindshare %s. The AI & Meme train does not stop. pic.twitter.com/CBLsXWRu0n — Kaito AI (@_kaitoai) December 8, 2024 This creates a rising tide for AI-related meme coins, from which Turbo is benefitting. However, unlike AI-agent meme coins, Turbo lacks utility. Traders must consider this since it may suppress its growth potential amidst the AI meme coin boom. But what do the charts say? Turbo Uptrend Not Over Yet Turbo is currently trading at $0.011, down 11% today, up 48% this week, and up 18% this month. While today’s sell-off may raise concerns, analysts believe the uptrend will continue in the weeks ahead. Trader Sxei says that Turbo is preparing for its next leg up, which will take it to highs of $0.015. However, on a higher time scale, the analyst suggests even more gains are at play, predicting highs of $0.06. $Turbo just printed a higher high, confirming the DCL on November 26th. It was a failed cycle, but with a higher high im not worried. pic.twitter.com/9MdZGPiMLJ — Martix (@martinxi5u4) December 7, 2024 Cryptomojo agrees with Sxei’s near-term target, noting that Turbo has broken a descending channel resistance level and will now veer toward $0.015. With the rise of the AI meme coin sector and Turbo’s recent strength, a move toward $0.015 is certainly achievable in the short term. In the long term, Sxei’s $0.06 target could prove a bull market high for the frog-themed AI meme coin. But as Turbo shows strength, another frog-themed meme coin has emerged and is making huge early progress. It’s called Wall Street Pepe, and it’s currently undergoing a presale. Is Wall Street Pepe The Next Big Frog Meme Coin? Turbo does very little for its holders besides being a meme coin. However, Wall Street Pepe is making a name by leveling up its community’s ability to make cash. Encapsulating Pepe coin’s nonchalant demeanor and Jordan Belfort’s electric ambition, Wall Street Pepe is creating an army of investors who choose rich. The project is undergoing a presale and has raised $3.5 million so far. Wall Street Pepe is more than a meme coin. It’s an ecosystem comprising trading signals, data insights, meme coin picks, an insider trading group, staking, and trading rewards. GM to everyone except those that fade $WEPE pic.twitter.com/bDRl6dZVn7 — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) December 9, 2024 Essentially, they’re creating a community and equipping it with all the tools needed for success in the crypto markers. The $3.5 million presale raise shows a big nod of approval from investors. However, the project is also drawing attention from top analysts. Recently, Austin Hilton said Wall Street Pepe is “absolutely catching fire.” Hilton highlighted that the project is “doing something completely different,” which gives it big potential for after the ICO ends. He also warned his 292K YouTube subscribers to act before it’s too late. The current $WEPE price is $0.000207, but this will rise throughout the ICO, with the next increase in three days.

The BTC price has been facing strong resistance at $100K with analysts suggesting a possible top. However, analysts at VanEck believe otherwise stating that the Bitcoin bull run isn’t over yet. Altcoin Season Index Flashes Bitcoin Gains Ahead Investment firm VanEck has shared optimistic insights for Bitcoin, linking strong altcoin performance to potential BTC gains. According to their analysis, when the Altcoin Season Index surpasses 60—indicating that over 60% of the top 50 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days—Bitcoin tends to deliver positive returns in the subsequent months. The Altcoin Season Index measures the percentage of the top 50 cryptocurrencies outperforming Bitcoin over a 90-day period. A value above 60 suggests a strong altcoin season, historically correlating with favorable BTC performance. Source: Blockchain Center VanEck’s findings reveal that after the index crosses 60, Bitcoin’s average returns are: +10% over 1 month, +30% over 3 months, +73% over 6 months. The study, which analyzed 61 such instances, also highlighted Bitcoin’s probability of positive returns: 56.5% over 1 month, 59.9% over 3 months, and 61.1% over 6 months. This means that the BTC price can rally to $160K by mid-2025. Earlier this week, altcoins faced strong selling pressure after a mega rally following Donald Trump’s victory. However, market analysts call it a healthy pullback adding that it has helped remove excess froth from the sector. Additionally, altcoins have given a healthy bounce back from the super trendline. What’s Next for BTC Price? Crypto analyst IncomeSharks shares robust demand for Bitcoin below the $95,000 mark, stating that price wicks in the zone are quickly bought up. The pattern has occurred seven times, reinforcing the area as a critical support level. Source: IncomeSharks “Everything about this is bullish,” noted IncomeSharks, emphasizing the lack of any technical analysis (TA) indicators pointing to a market top. The consistent buying pressure suggests strong investor confidence in further upward price movement, despite the altcoin market soaring. Blockchain analytics platform Santiment also reported that the BTC price drop to $94,200 triggered a major fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). Social media discussions are now rife with calls for Bitcoin to plunge further, targeting levels between $80,000 and $89,000. Santiment interprets the growing bearish sentiment as a potentially bullish signal for BTC. As of press time, the Bitcoin price is trading flat at $97,700 levels with its market cap at $1.933 trillion. On the other hand, inflows in spot Bitcoin ETFs have continued at a strong pace. On Tuesday, the net inflows stood at $438.5 million with BlackRock’s IBIT netting $295.6 million and Fidelity’s FBTC netting $210.5 million, per data from Farside Investors .

With the BTFD presale priced at $0.0001 per coin and set to hit $0.0006 upon listing, early adopters stand to gain massive returns. At its current stage, the presale has sold over 45 billion coins, raised $2.8 million, and captivated more than 4,200 holders. Why BTFD Stands Out BTFD isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a rallying cry for investors who know the power of buying low. Built on Ethereum, it leverages the blockchain’s robust security and scalability to deliver low-cost transactions and unmatched liquidity. Its tokenomics are finely tuned to reward early backers, with 48% of the supply reserved for presale buyers. But here’s the kicker: BTFD’s ecosystem goes beyond holding. It features a live play-to-earn (P2E) game that allows users to earn rewards while navigating through exciting challenges. Plus, with staking rewards averaging 90% APY, investors can compound their gains over time. This is what makes it the top among the best meme coins to join in December 2024! Presale Details Now in its 10th stage, this meme coin presale offers coins at $0.0001. With the total supply capped at 173 billion coins, this is your chance to get in early before the price skyrockets. Let’s crunch the numbers: a $1,500 investment at $0.0001 per coin would net you 15 million BTFD. At $0.0006, that’s a potential value of $9,000—an ROI of 500%. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Bullish Breakout on the Horizon Shiba Inu has been the talk of the town lately, thanks to its 60% price surge over the past month. Currently trading at $0.0000298, SHIB is forming an ascending triangle pattern, a bullish signal that could trigger a 100% rally if resistance levels are broken. SHIB’s momentum is supported by its large-holder concentration, with 73% of its circulating supply controlled by whales and investors holding between 0.1% and 1%. This indicates strong confidence among long-term holders, 76% of whom have retained their investments for over a year. The ecosystem also benefits from SHIB burns and increasing adoption, making it a favourite among meme coin enthusiasts. Over the past week, SHIB recorded $2.16 billion in transactions exceeding $100,000, underscoring its strong appeal to big players. Analysts are optimistic about SHIB’s potential to double in value. If the ascending triangle pattern holds, the coin could hit new highs, making it a top pick for investors looking to diversify their portfolio with a proven performer. Shiba BoneSwap (BONE): The Backbone of Shibarium Shiba BoneSwap (BONE) has carved its niche as the governance token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. As the exclusive gas fee token for Shibarium, BONE is essential for transactions on the Layer-2 blockchain, giving it intrinsic value beyond speculation. BONE’s integration into Shibarium has driven adoption, while strategic exchange listings like Trive Exchange in June 2024 have enhanced its accessibility. Currently trading at $0.60, BONE has shown resilience despite market fluctuations, with a 5% gain over the past week. With a maximum supply of 250 million tokens and 229.9 million in circulation, BONE offers a solid investment case. Its role in the Shiba Inu ecosystem ensures continuous demand, while the Shib Army’s active governance participation adds a layer of community-driven stability. Why You Shouldn’t Wait If you’re serious about joining the meme coin revolution, these three projects are your best bets for December 2024. BTFD’s presale offers unbeatable entry points with significant upside potential, while SHIB and BONE provide proven track records and ecosystem utility. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out! Opportunities like this are rare. BTFD Coin’s presale is blazing ahead, offering a golden chance to turn $1,500 into $9,000 when it lists at $0.0006. Add Shiba Inu (SHIB), with its potential 100% rally, and Shiba BoneSwap (BONE), driving the Shibarium ecosystem, and you’ve got a trio of winners. The clock’s ticking, and every moment you wait, someone else leaps forward. Join the BTFD presale today and be part of the next crypto success story. These are the best meme coins to join in December 2024—don’t wait to make your move! Join the BTFD Coin today and secure your place in the next crypto success story.

Those who didn’t secure their positions in time felt the sting of “what-ifs” as the token’s popularity surged post-launch. If you’re among the many left behind, here’s the good news: BTFD Coin has all the ingredients to become the next big thing. Why BTFD Coin is Your Second Shot at Meme Coin Success This isn’t a project that lives purely on hype or memes alone.

That means users can stake their coins, earn rewards through engaging games, and interact with a variety of blockchain utilities—creating a more active, fun, and rewarding community experience. High Staking Rewards—Up to 90% APY Staking is more than a feature here; it’s an actual financial strategy. BTFD offers stakers an average APY of 90% , meaning you can watch your holdings compound faster than your TikTok feed refreshes. Community-First Ecosystem with Momentum With 4,200+ active members in the Bulls Squad and over 45 billion coins already in circulation, BTFD Coin has demonstrated immense traction. This isn’t just a token—it’s a full-blown movement backed by a motivated and engaged community.

Investment Opportunity: $750 Into BTFD Coin’s Presale Let’s say you invested $750 into BTFD Coin’s current presale at the affordable price of $0.0001 per coin. Here’s how things could shape up for you: Initial investment: $750 Price per coin at the current presale rate: $0.0001 Projected price: $0.0006 (conservative projections suggest a target price of $0.0006 post-launch) Number of coins purchased: $750 ÷ $0.0001 = 7,500,000 BTFD coins Potential return at $0.0006: 7,500,000 × $0.0006 = $4,500 Your $750 could potentially turn into $4,500 if BTFD Coin meets its projected market performance. That’s a 6X return for a simple early investment at its presale stage. BTFD Coin is proving to be much more than a meme token. With its unique utilities, active staking program, gaming rewards, and explosive community momentum, this coin could be the kind of underdog investment you’ll thank yourself for later.

Some altcoins faced an over 50% pullback in less than 24 hours, which caused a significant switch in market sentiment. Meanwhile, the altcoin market capitalisation has reached some crucial levels, which triggered a massive breakout during the 2021 bull run. Therefore, some more fallout is expected, which may validate the start of the next Altseason. The markets have entered an interesting position, with the altcoins dropping by a large margin while the Bitcoin price barely rose. Currently, most of the altcoins have filled the wicks of yesterday’s wipeout and locked in higher lows. This is believed to be a good indication of where the altcoins may begin to reclaim some lost levels. On the other hand, the Bitcoin dominance dropped below the bullish range but is trying hard to validate a rebound. Will the levels manage to set up a strong recovery? If yes, will Altseason kick off? To analyse the next course of action of the altcoins, the Bitcoin dominance chart plays a major role. A drop in the dominance levels usually triggers the altcoins, while a huge pullback initiates a strong altseason. Presently, the levels have dropped from the rising wedge, which is believed to result in a significant pullback followed by a recovery. However, the historical pattern suggests that dominance is poised for more downfall. Back in 2021, during the bull run, the BTC dominance surged and reached above 70%, which resembles the current rise above 60%. The levels dropped from the rising wedge and consolidated along the support, which helped the BTC price mark a new ATH in 2021 as well as in recent times. Unfortunately, the dominance kept on falling, regardless of the market dynamics, which is expected to repeat in the next few days. Considering the technicals, the RSI has plunged below the average zone for the first time since December 2022, suggesting a drop to the lower threshold. Secondly, the volume has reached the bull run peak levels, and once they calm down, the dominance may begin to move sideways, allowing the altcoins to thrive and maintain a healthy Altseason probably in the first few weeks of 2025 that could persist for the rest of the year.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-11 07:19:12

37494902,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51866,1733901955,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse 60 Minutes Interview In Summary,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-ceo-brad-garlinghouse-60-minutes-interview-in-summary/,"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse made a notable appearance on CBS’ 60 Minutes, where he defended Ripple’s role in the cryptocurrency industry and its rising influence in American politics. During the interview , Garlinghouse highlighted Ripple’s significant financial contributions to political campaigns during the 2024 election cycle, emphasizing the importance of supporting pro-crypto candidates across party lines. Ripple and two other crypto firms collectively contributed $144 million to super PACs, backing 62 congressional candidates—29 Republicans and 33 Democrats. With an impressive success rate, 85% of those candidates won their races. “Do I think we had an impact? Absolutely,” Garlinghouse stated. Ripple’s Role in Shaping Political Support The contributions marked a calculated effort by Ripple and its allies to influence congressional elections. One-third of all corporate donations to super PACs during this cycle came from the crypto sector. When asked by interviewer Margaret Brennan whether these actions amounted to “buying elections,” Garlinghouse rejected the idea. He argued that voters made independent decisions but acknowledged Ripple’s financial role in supporting campaigns. “We educated voters, as many industries do, about candidates,” he explained, adding, “We absolutely supercharged candidates with money.” The interview also touched on President Donald Trump’s apparent support for the crypto industry. His administration’s policy direction has become clearer with the nomination of crypto-friendly figures, including Scott Bessent for Treasury Secretary and Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, to replace Gary Gensler as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additionally, Trump created a new White House Crypto Czar role, signaling a commitment to a regulatory framework favorable to digital assets. Ripple’s Legal Battle with the SEC The conversation also addressed Ripple’s ongoing legal dispute with the SEC, which began in December 2020. The SEC’s lawsuit alleges that XRP is an unregistered security. Garlinghouse characterized the lawsuit as part of a broader “war on crypto” led by former SEC Chair Gensler. He noted that Ripple, and some other crypto companies, helped establish the super PAC “Fairshake” in response to regulatory challenges. Garlinghouse revealed that Ripple has spent over $150 million defending itself in court and reiterated that XRP does not meet the definition of a security. “I think I’m reasonably intelligent about something like, ‘What is a security?’ Never once had I considered the possibility that XRP is a security,” he remarked. Despite Garlinghouse’s assertions, critics remain unconvinced. John Reed Stark, a former SEC official, argued that the courts have consistently sided with the SEC in similar cases. Describing the designation of XRP as a security as “an obvious call,” Stark also voiced broader concerns about cryptocurrency’s potential misuse in crimes such as ransomware and money laundering. Garlinghouse countered these criticisms by pointing out that there are bad actors in every industry. “Bernie Madoff went to jail. That doesn’t make every hedge fund manager a criminal,” he said, emphasizing Ripple’s commitment to compliance and regulatory engagement. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Future of Crypto Regulation and XRP’s Resurgence In the interview, Garlinghouse called for regulatory clarity, advocating for crypto regulation to shift from the SEC to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). He argued that the CFTC’s approach would foster innovation while maintaining market integrity. Critics like Stark, however, contend that this would weaken investor protections, as the SEC’s mandate is centered on safeguarding investors. Meanwhile, XRP’s value has remarkably increased, surging over 300% since Election Day and solidifying its position as a leading cryptocurrency. Ripple has already announced an additional $25 million contribution to Fairshake, bringing its total funding to $103 million, to support pro-crypto candidates in future elections. Despite its recent gains, XRP’s price dipped by 5.89% in the last 24 hours, settling at $2.40. While the cryptocurrency industry faces ongoing skepticism from figures like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and investor Warren Buffett, Garlinghouse pointed to the rapid success of the Bitcoin ETF as evidence of growing acceptance. “It attracted more assets in less time than any ETF ever before,” he said. Ripple’s strategies indicate its determination to remain a major player in shaping the future of cryptocurrency policy and adoption.

Kyrgyzstan’s Parliament has approved a draft law defining the status and legal framework for the digital som, the country’s central bank digital currency , in its first reading, Azerbaijani media outlet Trend reports . The National Bank of Kyrgyzstan, which will oversee the issuance and operation of the digital som, plans to launch prototype testing in early 2025. Following successful trials, a decision on full implementation is expected by the end of 2026, the report reads. Once adopted, the digital som will serve as legal tender, issued only by the central bank through a specialized platform that manages its distribution, accounting, and security. It’s understood that the digital som platform is designed to support both online and offline transactions, ensuring accessibility even in areas with limited internet connectivity. Offline transactions will be stored locally on devices and synchronized with the platform once internet access is restored.

In August, the National Bank began public discussions on constitutional amendments to support the integration of the digital currency. The proposed system includes digital accounts for platform participants and digital wallets for individual users, accessible through banking apps and other financial institutions. Unlike many central bank digital currency initiatives that emphasize blockchain, Kyrgyzstan’s draft law avoids explicit mention of distributed ledger technology. Instead, it incorporates smart contracts and emphasizes centralized management under the National Bank. The digital som is slated for full integration into Kyrgyzstan’s financial ecosystem by January 2027.

Web3 security firm ScamSniffer has warned of a new scam targeting cryptocurrency users by mimicking popular influencers in the space and draining their wallets using stealthy malware. The attack begins when the scammers create fake X accounts posing as popular cryptocurrency influencers and promoting Telegram groups that promise to offer investment advice. These groups are often touted as “exclusive” and are typically promoted under the posts of the influencers that the scammers are imitating to make them look legitimate. When unsuspecting users join the group via the invite link, they are asked to verify using a Telegram verification bot dubbed “OfficialSafeguardBot” which, according to ScammSniffer, “creates artificial urgency” by giving users very little time to complete the captcha.

See below. Telegram verification bot prompting users to run malicious code. Source: ScamSniffer on X According to ScamSniffer, there have been “numerous cases recently” where similar tactics have been used to steal a user’s private keys. The malware has also managed to bypass several antiviruses, with only VirusTotal flagging it as malicious. To protect oneself, it advised users to use hardware wallets, avoid executing unknown commands, and avoid installing unverified software. The report follows an earlier warning for ScamSniffer about a surge in fake X accounts in December. Notably, impersonation accounts have spiked over 87% since November, and two victims lost over $3 million by clicking malicious links promoted via some of these accounts. Over the past months, threat actors have increasingly resorted to using malware designed to drain crypto assets. This surge coincides with Bitcoin’s rally to $100,000 and a broader rise in altcoins, making the crypto sector increasingly lucrative for scammers. On Dec. 9, Cado Security Labs flagged the Realst malware infiltrating users’ systems using a fake meeting application after social engineering them into believing they needed to download the application for a legitimate business opportunity or interaction with a trusted contact. Once deployed , the malware steals crypto assets, browser-stored credentials, banking card details, and other sensitive information. In October, the decentralized finance protocol Radiant Capital lost over $50 million after the systems of some of the platform’s developers were compromised via a zipped PDF file containing malware. The attack involved social engineering, with the infected file being promoted via Telegram by an attacker impersonating a trusted former contractor.

The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) granted this certification, marking a significant milestone for Ripple as it ventures into the stablecoin market. Ripple aims to make RLUSD a dependable digital currency option for clients, minimizing the price swings commonly associated with XRP , its flagship asset. This move is part of Ripple’s strategy to expand its services and adapt to New York’s strict regulatory environment. To do so, the company is expected to secure a limited-purpose trust charter, allowing it to offer specific digital asset services without facing the challenges posed by traditional banking regulations. Additionally, Ripple will need a BitLicense, which enables crypto platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood to provide trading and custody services in the state. This approval places Ripple alongside other regulated stablecoin providers such as Paxos (PAX) and Gemini (GUSD). Keith Grossman, president of Enterprise at MoonPay, voiced support for Ripple’s market entry, highlighting the importance of well-regulated companies in reshaping global finance. Garlinghouse also shared that details about RLUSD’s launch, exchange listings, and partnerships will be announced soon , ensuring the public is updated directly by Ripple. In a recent CBS “60 Minutes” interview, Garlinghouse emphasized the need for clear regulatory guidelines to preserve U.S. leadership in the crypto sector . He argued that uncertainty in regulations could drive the industry to countries with weaker oversight. Ripple has consistently advocated for transparent rules, urging policymakers to establish a balanced framework. The Ripple CEO also touched on the political landscape, mentioning President-elect Donald Trump’s evolving views on Bitcoin. Garlinghouse humorously noted that voters were aware of potential conflicts of interest when electing him. He also praised bipartisan efforts in Congress, particularly the Fit 21 bill, which proposes transferring some regulatory responsibilities from the SEC to the CFTC . This legislation aims to ease the regulatory challenges faced by crypto businesses. Regarding the ongoing lawsuit over XRP’s classification as a security, Garlinghouse confidently stated that he does not believe XRP meets the definition of a security, dismissing the allegations as baseless. Ripple’s victory in securing stablecoin approval marks a crucial step forward in its mission to innovate responsibly in the evolving crypto space.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-11 07:32:08

On-chain stats on Wednesday indicated that the whale moved millions of WIF to Coinbase, sparking bearish sentiments among investors amid a broader crash. Notably, WIF price tanked roughly 3% intraday in light of the massive dump to the crypto exchange. Crypto market enthusiasts speculate over the dog-themed meme coin ‘s future trajectory as such alarming market events unfold. Dogwifhat Whale Offloads $3M Tokens To Coinbase Sparking Speculations According to data from Lookonchain, a Dogwifhat whale moved 1.2 million tokens, worth $3.47 million, to the crypto exchange giant Coinbase. This whale’s address, per Solscan’s data , was recorded as 72X13Krh1nCM.. Intriguingly, the whale accumulated the abovementioned amount roughly eleven months ago with a mere investment of $393K. Now, in light of the market witnessing a bull run post-Trump’s win, this whale’s holding offered a notable $3 million profit. However, it’s also noteworthy that the dump comes against the backdrop of recent volatility reflected across the broader sector. CoinGape reported crypto liquidations surging to $1.76 billion recently, with Altcoins primarily bearing the heat. Dogwifhat liquidations on December 9 and 10 totaled $22 million, per Coinglass data. Notably, the whale’s selloff might be due to investor apprehensiveness or profit-booking motive as the market currently witnesses a turbulent action amid huge amounts liquidated. In light of the abovementioned factors, traders and investors speculate about the top meme coin’s future price movement. What’s Next For WIF? At the time of reporting, WIF price cracked nearly 3.5% intraday and is currently trading at $2.87. Its 24-hour low and high were $2.66 and $3.01, respectively. Notably, the token currently trades 41% below its ATH of $4.85, with recent Dogwifhat whale selloff and other stats projecting uncertainty over the crypto’s future movements. However, a recent Dogwifhat price analysis by CoinGape pointed out that the coin is expected to hit the $10 price level by December 2025 end. Given that the meme token crosses resistance at the $4 mark, it could achieve its previous ATH of $4.85. Crossing this ATH could further pave the way for an uplift toward the $10 mark. Nevertheless, market watchers continue to extensively eye the token for price action shifts ahead.

Through this collaboration, Binance plans to integrate USDC across its products and services, making it available for more than 240 million Binance users who wish to access and use USDC for trading, saving, and making payments. Not only that, Binance will also include USDC in its corporate treasury operations, indicating a major shift towards the use of the stablecoin for on-chain financial operations. In return, Circle will equip Binance with the technology, liquidity, and tools necessary to bring users benefits from the USDC infrastructure.

Chairman and CEO of Circle, Jeremy Allaire , expressed a similar optimism towards the stablecoin issuer’s partnership with Binance, calling the crypto exchange “an incredibly innovative company” that has shown a deep commitment to improving product quality, innovation, and user experience. “This is a tremendous opportunity for USDC as it becomes ubiquitous on the Binance platform. I’m thrilled to be working with the Binance leadership team as they continue to build the largest digital asset company in the world,” said Allaire.

According to data from VISA , stablecoins have been used to facilitate more than 1 billion transactions, with a value equal to around $8 trillion.

Ferguson currently serves as a commissioner for the antitrust agency. According to his biography, he once clerked for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. “Andrew has a proven record of standing up to Big Tech censorship and protecting Freedom of Speech in our Great Country,” Trump said in a Tuesday statement posted to his Truth Social network . “Andrew will be the most America First and pro-innovation FTC Chair in our Country’s History.” In a statement following the announcement, Ferguson said he was honored to be chosen to lead the agency. “At the FTC, we will end Big Tech’s vendetta against competition and free speech. We will make sure that America is the world’s technological leader and the best place for innovators to bring new ideas to life,” he said in a post on X . Thank you President Trump. Under your leadership, American businesses will become stronger and more competitive, and will better serve workers and consumers, than ever before. I’m honored that you’ve chosen me to be FTC Chairman in your mission to make our country great again.… pic.twitter.com/GxmYWfjpqm — Andrew Ferguson (@AFergusonFTC) December 11, 2024 Ferguson serves as one of the two Republican commissioners on the five-member panel led by Lina Khan. Ferguson, previously the solicitor general of Virginia, was appointed to the commission by President Biden and officially joined the FTC on April 2. The future of FTC under Trump The Federal Trade Commission is responsible for the enforcement of antitrust and consumer protection laws. Khan’s replacement is expected to mean that the FTC will be less stringent in its antitrust enforcement. The new chairman is expected to designate new directors for the FTC’s antitrust and consumer protection divisions. Khan became a lightning rod for Wall Street and Silicon Valley by suing Amazon and Meta and blocking billions of dollars worth of corporate acquisitions, all while alleging anticompetitive behavior. The FTC barred a proposed merger between Korger and Albertsons, two major supermarket chains that executed a $24.6 billion agreement in 2022 during Khan’s tenure. On Tuesday, a judge put the brakes on the merger following a lawsuit from the FTC aimed at preventing the deal, arguing it would result in elevated prices and lowered wages for employees. Donald Trump is on a streak to ensure that no money will leave American Markets, from taxes to tariffs. The mistakes Khan made with the American economy will not be repeated during his tenure. Today, Trump has welcomed billionaire investors to America. On Truth Social, he posted that “Any person or company investing ONE BILLION DOLLARS, OR MORE, in the United States of America, will receive fully expedited approvals and permits, including, but in no way limited to, all Environmental approvals. GET READY TO ROCK!!!” To that, Elon Musk said , “This is awesome.” Lina Khan, the current leader of the FTC, has managed billions of dollars in dismissed corporate acquisitions, provoking the displeasure of Wall Street. Trump focuses on trade in his MAGA agenda Ferguson’s experience could lead to more scrutiny of huge tech corporations. In a statement earlier this month, he urged for the prosecution of “unlawful collision” between web platforms that might hinder “Americans’ ability to exchange ideas freely and openly.” Trump’s reelection has sparked concerns about how his administration will handle ongoing antitrust cases against internet giants such as Apple and Amazon. Google is also awaiting a ruling on whether a federal judge would accept the US government’s suggestion that it be forced to sell Chrome after its search operation was ruled a monopoly. The new administration may also decide to dismiss any ongoing FTC investigations. Last week on X, Ferguson praised Trump’s selection of Gail Slater to head the Justice Department’s antitrust division, noting that Trump highlighted her commitment to pursuing legal action against major tech platforms for purported competition violations. While Trump was expected to replace Khan, certain Republicans, including those tapped to join the Trump administration, have been dubbed “Khanservatives” because they advocate for stricter, not weaker, antitrust enforcement. In February, Vice President-elect JD Vance said that Khan is “one of the few people in the Biden administration who I think is doing a pretty good job.” Deep into trade, Trump also said he is selecting Mark Meador as his pick to be an FTC commissioner. “Mark has also worked as an antitrust enforcer at both the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice Antitrust Division, and in private practice at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP,” Trump said in the post.

The proposal, presented by MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor , called for Microsoft to diversify its portfolio by allocating a portion of its reserves to Bitcoin . Saylor argued that Bitcoin, now the seventh-largest global asset, is poised for explosive growth, with its market capitalization projected to surpass $2 trillion in the near future and potentially reach over $200 trillion by 2045. In his presentation, he emphasized Bitcoin’s potential as a transformative investment opportunity, aligning with major market trends. Despite these optimistic projections, Microsoft’s board cautioned against the plan, citing concerns about potential risks and volatility. Shareholders ultimately agreed, voting against the proposal during a meeting held on December 10. The board described Bitcoin investments as ""unnecessary risks"" that do not align with the company’s strategy. Following the vote, Saylor expressed his disappointment on social media, stating, ""Microsoft shareholders will regret this decision in time. Bitcoin doesn’t wait—it simply rewards those who understand its value."" He remains convinced that Bitcoin will continue to redistribute wealth globally as more investors recognize its significance. Meanwhile, Amazon appears to be taking a different stance on cryptocurrency. Stakeholders at the company proposed an ambitious plan to invest a substantial portion of its cash reserves in Bitcoin, signaling a contrasting approach to digital asset adoption among major tech giants. This move highlights the varied strategies corporations are employing when it comes to cryptocurrency investments. Bitcoin’s market briefly reacted to the news, showing slight fluctuations, but it has since stabilized. Microsoft’s stock performance remains unaffected, demonstrating continued growth over the year. In contrast, MicroStrategy has experienced substantial gains, largely attributed to its heavy investment in Bitcoin. Entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano weighed in on the developments, remarking that while Bitcoin’s progress is unaffected by Microsoft’s decision, the company may eventually recognize its potential.

The theft, uncovered by well-known crypto investigator ZachXBT, involved over 1,700 suspicious USDC transactions, followed by laundering the funds through Polygon and Ethereum. The criminal, using the alias ""Excite,"" has been flaunting luxury purchases online, with metadata suggesting a possible location in Denmark. The attack, which began on April 21, saw the stolen funds split across three wallets, most of which remain inactive. ZachXBT noted that the culprit partially revealed his face in photos shared on social media, providing a lead that could help identify him. However, questions remain about how Coinbase's AML system failed to detect these activities within a 16-hour window. This lapse has raised concerns, especially given Coinbase's past issues with compliance and a $50 million fine for violations last year. Commenters on ZachXBT's posts criticized Coinbase for being overly strict with legitimate users while failing to catch significant criminal activities. This incident follows other challenges for the platform, including recent scams impersonating Coinbase Support and the removal of Bitcoin payments due to operational issues. ZachXBT hinted that others might be involved in the theft, given how the funds were divided. He also emphasized the importance of determining how the hacker bypassed Coinbase’s security measures. The platform’s failure to flag this activity adds to its growing list of vulnerabilities. So far, the victim has not come forward, making it harder to gather details about how the breach occurred.

The National Assembly has decided to postpone all crypto-related legislative work for now, meaning any major changes in the sector will likely be delayed until at least mid-2025. Crypto Tax Delay: Almost 2 Years One of the biggest decisions to come from this delay is the pushback of crypto taxes. The National Assembly voted to delay a new tax on crypto profits until 2027. The tax, which was originally set to be imposed in January 2025, would have taxed a 22% on profits over $1,750. This decision was passed just before the martial law announcement, which meant the tax law was saved from becoming a reality as planned. Meanwhile, the news of martial law caused a big drop in Bitcoin prices on Upbit, South Korea’s largest exchange. The price of Bitcoin fell sharply by 30% , dropping from ₩88,266,000 ($61,600) to ₩127,000,000 ($88,600) within 30 minutes. No Progress on Key Crypto Laws With martial law in place, the National Assembly has decided to stop all work on important crypto issues. This includes reviewing South Korea’s ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs), deciding whether companies can buy crypto for their balance sheets, and looking at whether crypto-based securities will be allowed. These issues will not be addressed until at least mid-2025. There are growing concerns that more blockchain and crypto companies may leave South Korea for countries with clearer rules. Many crypto businesses are asking the government to set clearer guidelines soon to avoid losing investment to other nations. A Ray of Hope: (FSC) While the government has stopped work on many crypto laws, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) has managed to create some basic rules for corporate crypto accounts. While these guidelines could provide some relief to companies, but the bigger legislative issues, such as STOs and ICOs, will likely remain unresolved until 2025. Although, experts like Kim Gap-rae of the Capital Market Research Institute warn of missed opportunities, especially as global powers like the U.S. make strides in crypto policies.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-11 07:42:38

Your turn at a glance WazirX, once a giant in the Indian crypto market, gets caught up in rumours of strategic departures led by its co-founder Nischal Shetty . Despite the fact that there has not been an official confirmation, the listed moves suggest the tactful process of planning an exit in which users are left to their fate. The Binance-Wazirx Saga: A Dispute Without Resolution At the center of all these is the WazirX ownership controversy with Binance which has raged on without much explanation. While both parties are publicly connected, neither has moved to enforce legal separation and the future solvency of WazirX remains decidedly unclear. This stalemate comes at the same time the Indian authorities have stepped up the heat with investigations through the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to further the exchange’s agony. Red Flags: Nischal Shetty’s New Ventures Some skeptics are giving more recent projects of Nischal Shetty such as Shardeum and Pi42 as clear indication of planning in advance for a shift paradigm. Unlike other giants like the Binance where most activities are centralized, Shetty has decided to create multiple platforms, making WazirX users wonder whether he is still committed to his own startup. Critics say such actions are part of a broader plan to start afresh, possibly moving on to a DEX and washing off hands from WazirX emanating liabilities. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : WazirX Proposes Settlement Plan to Recover From Hack: Will Creditors Approve? , What’s the Endgame? Rumours suggest a troubling scenario where there are few possibilities; New DEX and token schemes: First, WazirX customers could be redirected to a new DEX with “recovery tokens” and bonus perks like the WRX token did earlier. Partial fund recovery: It meant that users could get only a part of the claims, to let WazirX declare the best of all states. Indian crypto enthusiasts are calling for alertness, they want WazirX’s top personnel to come clean about their operations. These developments could prove disastrous to India’s fast-growing crypto industry , especially if the crypto giant is on the brink of bankruptcy. As of now, WazirX future still remains questionable and the Indian crypto community closely observes the events taking place. If these are rumors, how far will they go penetrating the industry, or is this another wave of rumor mills? Time will tell. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address – C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-11 07:51:00

Users reported a series of issues, including a buggy mobile app and a convoluted claiming process. Its token, Magic Eden (ME), dropped in value by about 67% merely hours after launch. The newly launched token experienced a sharp decline in the early hours of December 11, as users of the non-fungible token (NFT) platform Magic Eden voiced frustrations over technical glitches in the mobile app and a widely frustrating claiming process. According to market tracker DexScreener data , ME, launched on December 10 at an initial price of $6.70, briefly rallied to $13.10 before plummeting by 67% to a low of $4.30. The token is currently trading at $5.6, still down by more than 50% from recent highs after its debut. Source: DexScreener The token launch, promoted as a major milestone for the NFT platform, was overshadowed by user frustration. Many participants took to social media to complain about the difficulties in claiming their allocated airdrops. ME token struggles amid issues on airdrop token allocation To receive tokens from the airdrop, users were prompted to download Magic Eden’s mobile app, scan a QR code on a desktop device, link their wallets, and then claim the tokens. According to several crypto enthusiasts on X, the procedure is seen as overly complicated and the mobile app was glitchy and difficult to navigate. “ My app is stuck, can’t claim, people dumping ME like hot cakes. Awesome ,” one user complained. The initial trading activity for the $ME token saw its fully diluted valuation (FDV) reach $15 billion in the early minutes of trading. However, as more users successfully processed their airdrops and some chose to sell, the FDV sharply declined, eventually stabilizing at around $5 billion. The Magic Eden $ME token has lost over $9 billion in market cap in about 90 minutes, a decline of nearly 69%. What went wrong? https://t.co/STbf0r2a7K pic.twitter.com/rTVEsQbFS5 — Franklin (@franklinisbored) December 10, 2024 Some users reported losing funds during the claiming process, alleging that their wallets were drained as they navigated the platform’s convoluted steps. Meanwhile, others who managed to claim and sell their tokens celebrated their gains, dismissing criticism as complaints from those who missed out on the opportunity. Industry insiders criticized the airdrop process, suggesting that it deviated from security best practices. Moreover, wallet security experts at Coindesk found that Magic Eden wallets retain users’ recovery phrases and private keys within the app without providing a clear option to delete this sensitive information. “It’s a very bad idea to store this stuff” anywhere digitally, be it locally on one’s own device or – even worse – remotely on a company’s servers,” one crypto-security sleuth going by the pseudonym Ogle remarked. Magic Eden token: What is it? The ME Foundation, which backs the Magic Eden platform, announced that the $ME token went live at 9 a.m. ET on December 10. As the official token for the Magic Eden ecosystem, $ME aims to enhance user engagement across Solana, Bitcoin, and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains. The token is designed to reward users and drive participation in the expanding Magic Eden ecosystem. “We’re incredibly excited for today’s launch and the opportunity to foster a passionate, cross-chain community of users,” said Matt Szenics, Director of the ME Foundation. Today’s the day you’ve been waiting for. $ME is here. Don’t guess — Watch this video below and learn how to claim in mere minutes. You have until February 1st 2025 to claim, any unclaimed tokens will be distributed to stakers. More info on this later. pic.twitter.com/NWFmnCaSEv — Magic Eden 🪄 (@MagicEden) December 10, 2024 “ The $ME token represents the power of on-chain trading applications, and there will be innovative incentives rewarding users for trading all assets on all chains. $ME is becoming a token for on-chain maxis everywhere,” he continued. The token’s total supply is capped at 1 billion, with 12.5% allocated to the airdrop. This initial distribution of 125 million tokens will remain available to users until February 1, 2024. Additionally, 50% of the total supply has been reserved for community incentives, while the remaining 37.5% is allocated to contributors and strategic participants.

Some of these European funds have been active for over two decades, yet they lag far behind IBIT’s rapid growth, which highlights the increasing acceptance of cryptocurrency in the financial sector. Bitcoin ETFs have seen record inflows recently, with BlackRock dominating the market. IBIT now holds nearly half of all Bitcoin ETF assets , making it the largest player in the sector. Since its launch in January, IBIT has consistently broken records, even surpassing the firm’s gold-based ETF in value. This success reflects a growing institutional embrace of Bitcoin. In November alone, Bitcoin ETFs recorded their highest net inflows ever, totaling billions, with the majority attributed to IBIT. The trend has continued into December, with BlackRock maintaining its lead as the top purchaser of Bitcoin among ETF providers. Analysts have pointed out that European ETFs, by contrast, are struggling to compete , with declining inflows and underwhelming performance over the years. This lack of growth is attributed to the region’s tougher stance on cryptocurrency, including regulatory suggestions like price controls for Bitcoin . In comparison, the U.S. market shows greater enthusiasm for crypto investments, driven by firms like BlackRock. As Bitcoin ETFs grow, they symbolize a shift in the financial world, where institutions hesitant to adapt risk being left behind.

Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer Bitwise is projecting that Coinbase shares (COIN) in the U.S. stock market will double to $700 next year, which now only traded about $302. These bullish projections also came with a vision that this exchange will rise as the world’s most valuable brokerage, exceeding Charles Schwab by next year. “Our prediction: Coinbase stock will trade above $700 per share in 2025 (more than doubling today’s price). That would make them as the most valuable brokerage in the world, surpassing Charles Schwab. The reason? It is more than just a brokerage,” Bitwise stated on the released report The collaboration between Coinbase and USDC has had a positive impact on the company, accounting for $162 million in revenue or an increase of 31%. This projection will continue to rise. A new Layer 2 ( L2 ) network named Base, which builds on the Ethereum blockchain, is now a leader in both transaction and total value lock, with 131 transactions per second (TPS) and $12.9 billion, respectively. Through this L2 project, Base generates revenue of more than tens of millions of dollars every quarter as the capital and ecosystem are expected to grow. Bitwise also noted that staking and custody services are also promising for the company’s future, with $589 million generated revenue. It is expected that both business revenues will rise up to $1 billion. However, Charles Schwab has also raise d their concern about emerging digital assets, which has now led the company to enter the crypto spot market.

Some investors worry about the Altcoin’s short-term performance as the crypto market pulls back. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees First Close Above $100,000, But Is A Big Correction Coming? Solana Drops To Lowest Level In A Month Solana has been one of the leading cryptocurrencies this cycle, outperforming most of the market and stealing the headlines. Unlike most altcoins, the cryptocurrency outperformed during the Q2 and Q3 retraces, holding above pre-bull run levels. As Q4 started, Solana continued to hover within the $110-$180 price range, breaking above this range after the market’s post-election pump. SOL’s momentum propelled the token past its yearly high and successfully reclaimed the $200 barrier. The token continued to climb higher until its new ATH of $263 on November 23. Since then, Solana hovered between the $245-$220 price range, fueling investors’ optimism about the altcoin’s next “price discovery” move. Nonetheless, SOL’s price has taken a blow in the past day alongside Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market. Solana saw an 8.7% correction in the last 24 hours, falling to the $210 support level before dropping below it. The cryptocurrency is now retesting the key $200-$210 zone as support for the first time since breaking past it, falling below the $205 level on Tuesday morning. Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa shared a possible bearish outlook for SOL’s short-term performance based on the ongoing price retest. Per the post, “SOL weakness has been pretty obvious, and it’s being reflected in the sol shitcoin price action as well.” The analysts explained that the current price action looks seemingly underwhelming, suggesting that holding the $200-$210 region is crucial. Failing to hold this zone would likely send the price to the pre-election resistance level of $180, which has not been tested as support since breaking above it over a month ago. SOL Eyes Higher Targets Similarly, Crypto Jack forecasted a potential fall to the $180-$160 range if SOL fails its retest of the $200 mark as support. However, he considers the over 10% drop a “buy the dip” opportunity for investors. According to his potential play for Solana, the cryptocurrency would bounce to its ATH levels and attempt to break past them. Other market watchers pointed out that SOL is currently retesting the weekly and monthly timeframe resistance as support, which could see Solana go higher “as long as it holds.” Crypto analyst Jelle reaffirmed his $600 target for the cryptocurrency, noting that it “performed incredibly during the first year of the cycle” and will “be a winner again in the coming months.” Related Reading: Cardano Follows 2020 Bullish Pattern – Top Analyst Plans To Take Profits Between $4 And $6 Meanwhile, Bitwise’s latest report predicted that SOL could rally over 200% in 2025. The asset manager’s CIO, Matt Hougan, and Head of Research, Ryan Rasmussen, consider that the altcoin’s momentum “is just beginning to build,” predicting it will hit $750 next year. At the time of writing, Solana is trading at $204, an 8.5% and 3.1% decline in the daily and monthly timeframe.

As a result, these tokens lag behind their respective ATHs while the others form a new one. Now that the Bitcoin price rally has kicked off above the psychological barrier at $100K, these top memecoins have begun to swell. In due course, the SHIB price has encountered massive selloffs after reaching a pivotal resistance, which could be a matter of concern. The current price action suggests the SHIB price has surged above critical resistance at around $0.000027; a valid breakout could trigger short-term upward momentum. Meanwhile, the bulls are offering enough support by backing the rally with enough buying pressure. However, the seller’s dominance continues to remain higher, which could probably push the token under bearish clouds. Given that the Shiba INU price remains within a decisive phase, will the bulls manage to kick off a strong upswing to the resistance above $0.000035? Currently, two major bearish crossovers are about to occur, which may intensify the ongoing bearish trend. Firstly, the base & conversion lines of the Ichimoku cloud are heading for a bearish crossover and secondly, the +Di & -Di of the DMI levels. The ADX & RSI are both decremental, while the MACD indicates the selling pressure is slowly mounting up. Adding more substance to the bearish momentum, the OBV—the volume-based indicators also plunge, suggesting a massive drop in the volume. However, the higher targets for the SHIB price rally remain above $0.000045; however, the token is required to sustain above $0.000035 to validate a bullish move. Meanwhile, a sharp drop in the Shiba Inu price following the BTC correction could be a good signal as the investors show interest. This suggests a rise in demand for the token, which may turn the sentiments of the token from bearish to bullish. If the market correction widens, the Shiba Inu price is expected to drop below $0.000025; otherwise, a rebound, which is more likely to happen, may revive a rise above $0.00003, trying to close the yearly trade above $0.000035.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-11 08:01:14

In a new Kitco News interview, Jack Mallers says he expects the incoming Trump administration to boost the economy by making it clear that the government is pro-growth, pro-business and pro-innovation. He also says the US can deal with its fiscal issues by building a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Mallers highlights that the move would be a huge positive for retail investors, corporations and institutions that already own BTC without negatively impacting those without skin in the game. “We realize we have a deficit problem and a debt problem. We want to back our future promises with the future, with the fastest-growing asset. We want to give confidence to the people that we acknowledge the problem, and we’re building toward it. This acts in the best interest of the public. It’s not we’re taking your stuff, it’s not we’re debasing your stuff, it’s not we’re taking the side of the banks. The large supply of this asset is owned by the general public. This is a move that acts in the best interest of the people, this is a move that acts in the best interest of business. This is pro-business, this is pro-labor, this is pro-energy, this is pro-industry.” In July, Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming said she would announce a bill to establish a BTC reserve as a means of securing the value of the US dollar amid a record-breaking national debt. The legislation would drive the US government to accumulate one million BTC or 5% of BTC’s total supply in five years. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $96,801, down over 1% on the day.

They have captured the attention of the wider crypto market, thanks to its combination of humor, community engagement and speculative nature. AdaDeng , a new community-driven meme coin has suddenly burst on to the Cardano scene with an ongoing presale and in just 5 days of the presale going live, has raised over 70,000 $ADA. This places the project’s fully diluted valuation at around 100,000 $ADA Inspired by the infectious spirit of “Moo Deng”, there is a lot of expectation that AdaDeng will become the next big thing in the Cardano meme coin scene. AdaDeng is the latest community-driven meme coin to come out of the Cardano ecosystem. With a mission to build a humorous, creative and decentralized community, it has arrived on the scene with a kind of a cult following. AdaDeng is inspired by Moo Deng, a lovable, fun-loving hippo who has a passion for mischief. It is a great mascot to represent the project’s playfulness and fun-loving nature. $ADENG, the utility token of AdaDeng is built on Cardano and enjoys the robust network offered by Cardano. This ensures that the project will remain stable for years to come, compared to other blockchains which may be fast but suffer frequent setbacks. With a vibrant community backing it, this meme coin has more chances of being adapted by early investors as a massive 70% of its token supply is available to the public during its presale. Simple Steps To Join The Adadeng Community Getting involved with the AdaDeng project is very simple. To begin, follow these steps mentioned below. Acquire and hold tokens during the presale This is the simplest way to support the Adadeng project, simply by buying and holding $ADENG tokens and can also trade it once it gets launched on decentralized exchanges. Create Memes Memes are at the core of the AdaDeng project. Participants can simply create the funniest memes they can imagine featuring Moo Deng. They can then share it across social media. Community Challenges AdaDeng presents numerous community challenges for users to participate in. There are events where one can participate in meme contests, art competitions and earn $ADENG tokens for their efforts. Buying $ADENG Tokens Buying $ADENG tokens is the simplest thing ever. Start with purchasing $ADA from any exchange of your choice, such as Binance or Bybit. Next, set up a Cardano wallet. Transfer the ADA you purchased from the exchange using either Nami or Eternl wallets. Finally, visit the official website of AdaDeng. Click on buy $ADENG and copy the presale address shown. To complete the process, click on send ADA. The Tokenomics Behind AdaDeng’s Community-Focused Distribution and Growth The Tokenomics of AdaDeng or “Dengnomics” is where we get information about the structure and distribution of the meme coin. The team behind the project has focused on rewarding the community and early birds while ensuring everyone has an opportunity to join. The allocation of $ADENG tokens are as follows: Maximum Supply : 100,000,000 $ADENG Community Presale : 70,000,000 $ADENG Liquidity : 20,000,000 $ADENG Marketing : 3,000,000 $ADENG Deng Team : 3,000,000 $ADENG Charity & Airdrop : 4,000,000 $ADENG Most of the tokens will go to the community through the presale event and certain airdrop campaigns. After the presale, the raised tokens will be paired with the LP allocation. This is done to supply Minswap with LP, ensuring smooth trading on decentralized exchanges.

This sharp decline points to changing market dynamics surrounding the cryptocurrency. Recent data indicates that 25% of Toncoin wallets are now operating at a loss, while 11% are breaking even. This downturn underscores the heightened market volatility impacting Toncoin’s price, leading to reduced profitability for its holders. A breakdown of wallet ownership reveals that the majority of Toncoin holders—85%—have been invested for less than a year. Among them, 12% acquired the coin within the last month, and only 3% have held Toncoin for over a year. This data highlights a trend of short-term speculation among most investors. Transaction patterns show that 61% of Toncoin trades occur during Western trading hours, with the remaining 39% happening during Eastern trading hours. Toncoin TON Price Action To Monitor High-value transactions have been a notable feature over the past week, with over $51.97 billion in transfers exceeding $100,000.

Speaking during an interview on the Cardano-focused YouTube channel Big Pey, Hoskinson disclosed details about his recent discussions with Ripple executives Brad Garlinghouse and David Schwartz. Hoskinson described the meeting as constructive, marking a notable improvement in their relationship. He emphasized that both parties have moved past prior tensions, fostering an atmosphere conducive to meaningful dialogue. Exploring a Partnership Between Cardano and XRP The discussions centered on the distinctive roles that Cardano and XRP play within the broader cryptocurrency space and possible synergies between the two ecosystems. According to Hoskinson, the conversation delved into areas where collaboration could promote innovation and wider adoption of blockchain technologies. Key elements of the proposed partnership include leveraging Cardano’s Midnight and Marlowe technologies. Midnight is a privacy-focused sidechain within the Cardano ecosystem, while Marlowe provides a suite of tools designed to simplify the creation of smart contracts on Cardano. XRP’s Potential Role in Midnight and Marlowe Hoskinson revealed that XRP could be integrated into Cardano’s Midnight sidechain, potentially enhancing the platform’s overall utility. Midnight operates on a dual-token model featuring two core tokens: NIGHT, used for transactions, and DUST, the governance and staking token. If realized, XRP could become a third token within the Midnight framework, offering alternative functionality. Hoskinson suggested that XRP could serve as a supplementary transaction token, though he clarified that these plans are yet to be finalized. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In addition to Midnight, the integration of XRP with Marlowe was also explored. Hoskinson hinted that Marlowe might align better with XRP’s use case compared to ADA, Cardano’s native cryptocurrency. Cardano’s Interest in Ripple Stablecoin Beyond Midnight and Marlowe, Hoskinson expressed interest in Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin, RLUSD. This digital asset, recently approved by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), is set to launch on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum. Hoskinson stated that Cardano would like to play a role in the stablecoin’s ecosystem. This could potentially involve Ripple deploying RLUSD on Cardano at a later stage, following its initial launch. A Shift in Relations Between Cardano and Ripple Speculation about collaboration between Cardano and Ripple has been circulating in the crypto community for weeks. The turning point came on November 10, when Hoskinson issued a public apology to the XRP community , signaling an end to years of hostility. Shortly after, Hoskinson met with Garlinghouse and Schwartz to explore opportunities for cooperation. He underscored the importance of moving beyond past conflicts to focus on advancing blockchain technology and creating value for their respective ecosystems. While no official announcements have been made, the discussions between Cardano and Ripple executives hint at promising possibilities for collaboration soon.

In 2025, it will range between $66.22 and $84.78, with an average price of $69.49. In 2030, it will range between $416.79 and $530.07, with an average price of $512.69. AVAX exhibited wild price swings in 2024. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked this year. It later reversed, shedding all profits made earlier in the year. While the Avalanche ecosystem has been making strides, AVAX has particularly left investors questioning its trajectory. Will AVAX go up? Is AVAX a good investment? Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2024 to 2030.

Its trading volume dropped by 43.42% in 24 hours. Avalanche’s bullish market signals Avalanche TVL and Stablecoin market cap . Image source: DefiLlama Avalanche’s total value locked (TVL) continually dropped until 2024, from a high of $10.18 billion in 2021, when it started recovering. It now stands at $1.475 billion. TVL is the amount of funds locked up by an ecosystem’s decentralized applications. A rise in TVL suggests that users deposit their assets into the protocol as interest grows. The protocol’s stablecoin market cap rose over the same period to $2.14 billion at press time. The statistics point to growing user interest in the protocol’s stablecoin market, which provides stability in a highly volatile market. Avalanche open interest . Image source: Coinglass Open interest and active positions in the derivative market have risen alongside the price over the last month. When both rise, they signal that traders with long positions are entering the market. This often occurs in bullish markets, indicating new money entering the market and a potential bullish continuation. AVAX/USD 1-day chart analysis AVAX/USD 1-day chart. Image source: TradingView AVAX traded in a descending channel in the third quarter of 2024 after it reached a high of $0.26. At first, the drop was drastic, but began recovering in mid-September, before pumping in November after breaking out from a head-shoulder pattern.

The combination of technical indicators and chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is bullish and currently gearing up for a closer move to $50. Moreover, the William Alligator trendlines, which measure volatility, are sleeping, indicating declining volatility. Is AVAX a good investment? AVAX’s impressive performance in the first quarter of 2024 reversed in the second quarter; and bullish in the last. Explore Cryptopolitan’s price prediction to learn about the coin’s trajectory from 2024 to 2030. Why is AVAX up? AVAX is recovering from its lowest this year; the crypto market capitalization is also rising. The rise in Avax value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Will AVAX reach $50? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX crossed the $50 mark in 2024 as Bitcoin broke above $100,000. Will AVAX reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach $100 in 2026, with a maximum price of $121.27 for the year. Will AVAX reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2030. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Does Avalanche have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, AVAX will trade higher in years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory.

Subsequently, 1.117 million WLD were deposited back to OKX at an average price of $2.86, yielding $3.19 million, with transactions occurring on November 26 and December 3, 2024. A whale took chances to withdraw 1.242M $WLD ($3.48M) from #OKX 5 hours ago, after the price plunged by 25% during the crash. This increased the whale’s WLD holdings to 2.69M $WLD ($7.52M).

However, the recent price drop could present new challenges or opportunities for the whale’s trading strategy. WLD’s sharp 25.10% price decline over the past day underscores the heightened volatility in the market. As whale activity often influences token liquidity and sentiment, this latest move may have contributed to the downward pressure on WLD. With significant holdings and a clear profit-driven approach, whale 0xad7 remains a key player in the WLD market. Their ongoing activity will likely continue to attract attention as traders monitor the impact on price movements and market stability. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

According to a Dec. 12 announcement , the exchange said it would delist spot trading for DCR/BTC, PEPE/TUSD, and ZEN/ETH, with Trading set to cease on Dec. 13 at 03:00 (UTC). The move is a part of the exchange’s periodic review, where it assesses trading pairs for factors such as liquidity, trading volume, and overall market quality, removing those that no longer meet its standards. “Users are strongly advised to update and/or cancel their Spot Trading Bots prior to the cessation of Spot Trading Bots services to avoid any potential losses,” the announcement noted. At press time, the PEPE/TUSD trading pair had a 24-hour trading volume of 120,279 TUSD, while the ZEN/ETH trading pair had a trading volume of just 16.81 ETH, while the DCR/BTC pair had a 24-hour volume of 1.41 BTC. Binance further clarified that the removal of these trading pairs does not indicate that the tokens themselves are being delisted from the platform. Users will still be able to trade the assets through other available trading pairs.

Meanwhile, Binance has continued to expand its offerings with new listings. The exchange recently launched the Perpetual trading for the popular SPX6900 meme coin. As a tier-1 exchange, listings on Binance are often followed by significant price appreciation for the associated tokens. Lately, meme coins have been among the biggest beneficiaries of this trend. Last month, two Solana-based meme coins, ACT and PNUT, underwent explosive growth following their Binance listings, with their market caps surging by 1,199% and 208%, respectively. In some cases, even the announcement of a Binance listing is enough to send tokens rallying, as was the case with ACX, the native token of Across Protocol, on Dec. 6, which surged roughly 150% after the exchange announced it would list the token.

President-elect Donald Trump recently announced the nomination of pro-crypto Paul Atkins to chair the US SEC after Gary Gensler announced the end of his tenure. However, Commissioner Crenshaw has faced some heat from the crypto industry as they have labeled her even more anti-crypto than Gensler. Ripple’s CLO slams SEC’s Crenshaw Stuart Alderoty, in an X post, agreed that “Crenshaw is, in some ways, even more rogue than Gensler.” He mentioned that Gary Gensler backed down after a court declared that blocking Bitcoin (BTC) spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) was “arbitrary and capricious.” Ripple’s CLO stated that Crenshaw continued to vote “no” and insisted that the court got it wrong in her dissent. He expressed his sentiment over the situation and declared that “Unelected bureaucrats are not above the law.” Data shows that the freshly launched Bitcoin ETFs have added more than 1.1 million BTC. This tally has exceeded the holdings of the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. The biggest of them all, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) holds $51.5 billion worth of Bitcoins. It owns nearly 528K BTC. Grayscale’s Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) and the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) both hold between 241k BTC. KING OF THE HILL: The US spot ETFs have just passed Satoshi in total bitcoin held, now hold more than 1.1m, more than anyone in the world, and they’re not even a year old yet, literally babies still.

It set an all-time high of $103,900 on December 5. The global crypto market has seen a minor decline over the last 24 hours. The cumulative digital assets market cap stands at $3.45 trillion with a trading volume of $276 billion. Crypto groups push to block the re-nomination As Crenshaw faces a Senate Banking Committee hearing on her re-nomination, crypto lobbying groups are urging lawmakers to reject her. Groups like the Blockchain Association have cited her strong anti-crypto stance. In a post, the Blockchain Association brought up that divergence in perspective on regulatory matters integral to crypto in the country is more troubling. It mentioned that Crenshaw was out of step with the prior Congress and will be even more so with the 119th. The group urged the Senate to reject this nomination and asked for an SEC leadership that is aligned with Congress and the Commissioner in good faith. Crenshaw is set to become the SEC’s lone Democrat next year. She has labeled crypto markets as a “petri dish of fraud.” Meanwhile, Senators stand in a split as Sherrod Brown, the outgoing chair of the Senate Banking Committee, has supported stricter crypto regulations. On the other hand, Republican Senator Tim Scott has urged Biden to withdraw all pending nominations.

The broader market is also witnessing heightened whale activity, with over $25 million worth of assets like $WBTC, $UNI, $ENA, and $LINK being transferred to centralized exchanges. These movements underscore the growing trend of large-scale liquidations and potential market positioning amid the evolving crypto landscape.

They unveiled collaboration during the Abu Dhabi Finance Week. The recently announced alliance reportedly is part of Binance’s strategy, as the world’s largest crypto exchange by user base, to integrate Circle’s stablecoin, USD Coin (USDC), into its corporate treasury and suite of services. #Binance is thrilled to announce a strategic partnership with @Circle to enhance our ecosystem and bring more value to our users. Stay tuned for more updates! $USDC Read more here ⤵️ https://t.co/toHpPg70ta pic.twitter.com/cVTkrI8oGF — Binance (@binance) December 11, 2024 Circle is expected to benefit from Binance’s extensive user base of 240 million customers who could potentially use its USDC for trading, saving, and transactions. Through this collaboration, Circle could provide advanced tools and liquidity while also supplying innovative technology to enhance user trust and facilitate broader adoption of digital assets. The partnership signals Binance’s departure from its traditionally limited stablecoin offerings, which have largely focused on Tether (USDT) and FUSD. Circle seeks to leverage Binance’s large user base Circle’s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, lauded Binance’s approach to innovation and its focus on user experience. “ I have long admired Binance for their relentless commitment to product quality, innovation, and user-centricity, which is evident in their massive and loyal global community of more than 240 million users, ” he said. Binance CEO Richard Teng echoed these sentiments, emphasizing the partnership’s transformative potential. “ This collaboration will materially advance the rapidly maturing digital financial system, ” Teng stated. USDC’s integration into Binance’s ecosystem aligns with the exchange’s efforts to enhance its regulatory compliance and position itself as a leader in the stablecoin market. For Binance, the partnership also represents an opportunity to expand its influence in the global financial and commercial sectors, with Circle playing a key role in fostering these connections. Seeking to rival Tether’s dominance The partnership comes at a critical juncture for the stablecoin market, which is undergoing significant shifts. While Tether’s USDT has long dominated the sector, boasting a market capitalization of $138 billion compared to USDC’s $40 billion, cracks have begun to appear in Tether’s dominance. The company’s decision not to comply with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations has created opportunities for competitors like USDC to gain traction, particularly in the EU bloc. Despite its reputation as one of the most regulated and transparent stablecoins, USDC has struggled to achieve market dominance over Tether’s USDT. However, the collaboration with Binance could be a turning point. By integrating USDC across its services, the exchange is looking to provide a platform for the stablecoin issuer to increase its market presence and compete with Tether. Circle, known for its focus on regulatory compliance and transparency, offers the leading crypto exchange a stable and compliant alternative in an environment increasingly shaped by regulatory scrutiny. This strategic alignment could allow USDC to challenge Tether’s long-standing supremacy in the stablecoin industry. Jeremy Allaire highlighted the significance of stablecoin adoption in the partnership’s announcement, describing it as “core to the future financial system.” Circle’s focus on compliance and innovation positions USDC as a preferred choice for exchanges looking to adapt to evolving regulations, particularly in key markets like the European Union. Binance to bolster strength as a key industry player Through its partnership with Circle, Binance could further enhance its ability to maintain market dominance while offering its users a compliant and transparent stablecoin alternative. The collaboration is expected to strengthen Binance’s reputation as a leader in the crypto industry, particularly as it works to meet the demands of an evolving regulatory environment. Circle and Binance also revealed significant developments during Abu Dhabi Finance Week. The former announced the establishment of an entity within the Abu Dhabi Global Market and a partnership with LuLu Financial Holdings to streamline cross-border payments and remittances using USDC.

Justin Sun ridiculed the company’s decision of watching BTC grow on the sidelines. Donald Trump wants Bitcoin at $150,000 during his presidency. Microsoft’s Bitcoin rejection has drawn criticism from the digital asset community after shareholders voted against a proposal to invest in Bitcoin. Titled “ Assessment of Investing in Bitcoin ,” the proposal was to allocate 1% of Microsoft’s total assets into Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. Despite the rising interest in corporate cryptocurrency adoption, Microsoft’s board opposed the proposal, citing Bitcoin’s volatility and the need to prioritize stable investments for liquidity and operational funding. Critics argue that this conservative stance may result in missed opportunities, especially as companies like MicroStrategy continue to embrace Bitcoin.

The parallel stack, a robust, open-source framework designed for crafting rollups and layer 2s that harness parallel processing, is now on SEI V2. The stack enhances Ethereum ’s performance by targeting most bottlenecks that Layer 2 blockchains face. Such developments are anticipated to drive SEI value over the long term.

Our analysis shows the current sentiment is neutral, with the fear and greed index showing greed among investors. The sentiment comes as SEI shows signs of declining volatility. Is SEI a good investment? SEI has growing utility, and its EVM compatibility helps it steal a share of Ethereum’s dominance.

SEI has been bullish over the last two weeks, and its TVL is at annual highs, indicating rising interest in its DeFi market, which in turn is affecting its price. Will SEI reach $1? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, SEI will rise above $1 in 2025, when the coin will average at $1.06. Will SEI reach $10? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, SEI is unlikely to reach $10 before 2030. Will SEI reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, SEI is unlikely to reach $100 before 2030. Does SEI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, SEI will trade higher in years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory.

Most altcoins are also projected to experience a downtrend through early 2025. Bitcoin is also still volatile, but analysts predict possible short squeezes and upward moves in Q1 of 2025. Meanwhile, Bitwise's 2025 predictions were revealed earlier today, and suggest that Bitcoin could surpass $200,000. Bitwise also thinks it is possible for Ethereum to reach $7,000 next year, while the stablecoin market could expand to $400 billion. Ethereum's Path to $5000 Faces Uncertainty Ethereum's potential to reach the very anticipated $5,000 milestone by the end of 2024 seems very slim, according to data from on-chain options protocol Derive . Despite decent inflows into spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which hint at a looming “supply-side crisis,” the likelihood of ETH hitting the target dropped significantly. Sean Dawson, Derive’s head of research, revealed in a Dec. 10 market report that the probability of ETH reaching $5,000 by Dec. 27 peaked at 16% but has since declined to just over 8%. CoinMarketCap data shows ETH will need a 37% surge from its current price to achieve this target. ETH’s probability of hitting $5K before the end of 2024 (Source: Derive ) However, not everyone shares this cautious outlook. Pseudonymous crypto trader CoinMamba shared in a Dec. 10 post on X that they are still optimistic that ETH could hit $5,000 by year-end. Adding to the bullish sentiment, Ethereum contributor Eric Conner pointed out the $305 million in daily inflows into Ether ETFs on Dec. 10, and believes this is evidence of an impending supply shortage. Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano agreed with this, and shared that traditional finance institutions are “gobbling up the cheap ETH.” The Fidelity Ethereum Fund accounted for $202.2 million of these inflows, according to data from Farside . The conversation around Ethereum’s price potential also drew some attention from more well known voices in the crypto community. Bankless podcast host Ryan Adams suggested on Dec. 9 that ETH could hit a new all-time high within a week. The current ETH high was set in November of 2021, and stands at $4,878. Meanwhile, crypto trader Pentoshi shared ETH's structural changes in a Dec. 9 post. They also revealed that ETH recently achieved its highest weekly close of the year and predicted that a retest of its all-time high could happen sooner than expected. Overall, the outlook for ETH is uncertain. While bullish traders foresee a potential breakout, the data-driven perspective suggests a more tempered trajectory for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Altcoins Face Prolonged Downtrend Not just Ethereum, but the altcoin market in general appears to be facing continued downward pressure. In fact, the majority of tokens will very likely remain in a downtrend until the end of January of 2025, according to Felix Hartmann , the founder of Hartmann Capital. In a Dec. 10 X post, Hartmann stated that while some altcoins might experience brief upward movements, the overall trend for most will involve slow bleeding or consolidation over the next two to six weeks. Hartmann advised traders against chasing recent altcoin gains, as many already peaked after dramatic 2–3x surges in a week. Despite the bearish outlook for altcoins, Hartmann is still cautiously optimistic about the broader market. He suggested that it might be a reasonable time to reintroduce a long bias, as waiting for further ideal levels might result in missed opportunities. His comments were made after a huge decline in the altcoin market, which saw approximately $481.6 million in long positions liquidated over 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass . Crypto trader Mister Crypto suggested that the latest market dip could be the “final shakeout” before exponential breakouts. Among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, some of the largest declines hit tokens like Ethena (ENA), Pepe (PEPE), and Bonk (BONK) , according to CoinMarketCap . Bitcoin also saw some heightened volatility. At press time, BTC was trading hands at $97,996.69 after its price managed a slight 0.65% climb over the past 24 hours. The crypto has also stayed below the $100,000 psychological threshold since Dec. 9, despite reaching six figures for the first time on Dec. 5. Hartmann believes that Bitcoin has a “fair chance” of retesting $99,000, mainly due to the potential for short squeezes. If Bitcoin were to climb the 2+% above the $99,000 level, around $1.53 billion in short positions could face liquidation. Market participants are, however, still divided on the path forward. CryptoSea co-founder Daan de Rover hinted that major developments could be around the corner for the Bitcoin market, and stated, “We all know what’s next.” Meanwhile, Daan Crypto Trades pointed out Bitcoin’s historical patterns of moving 30–50% after long periods of consolidation. He suggested that the next consolidation phase could be shorter than usual, and could also set the stage for a new upward leg in Q1. For now, it seems like traders adopted a short-term mindset during this cycle, according to Syncracy Capital co-founder Daniel Cheung . Crypto analysis firm Santiment also warned that retail traders reacting fearfully and selling off their crypto too quickly could paradoxically trigger a sharp recovery. Bitwise Reveals Its Crypto Predictions for 2025 Bitwise released its 2025 crypto predictions , and projected some groundbreaking milestones for Bitcoin, tokenized assets, and regulatory advancements. The report forecasts that Bitcoin’s price could surpass $200,000 in 2025, and even has the potential to exceed $500,000 if the U.S. government establishes a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoins. Ethereum and Solana are also expected to see impressive growth, with projections of Ethereum reaching $7,000 and Solana (SOL) climbing to $750. As the market matures, Bitcoin ETFs are expected to experience record-breaking inflows, surpassing even the high 2024 levels. These inflows will likely be driven by increased regulatory clarity and institutional interest. Sovereign adoption of Bitcoin is also expected to rise, with the number of countries holding the cryptocurrency predicted to double. The report suggests that the U.S.’s consideration of a strategic Bitcoin reserve could spark a global race among governments to accumulate Bitcoin before scarcity drives prices even higher. In the broader industry, Bitwise projects that Coinbase’s stock will soar above $700 per share, fueled by widespread crypto adoption and its growing dominance in the market. The company is expected to surpass Charles Schwab as the most valuable brokerage and join the S&P 500. MicroStrategy is also predicted to enter the Nasdaq-100 by 2025. Bitwise anticipates at least five crypto unicorns going public in the U.S. as well, and named Circle, Figure, Kraken, Anchorage, and Chainalysis as top IPO candidates. The stablecoin market is expected to expand a lot, too, and could reach $400 billion in assets, supported by anticipated U.S. legislation offering a clearer regulatory framework. Looking further ahead, Bitwise predicts Bitcoin will surpass gold’s $18 trillion market cap by 2029, trading above $1 million per coin.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-11 09:46:25

Speaking on the Matt Kohrs Show, he expressed optimism about Bitcoin's potential due to the favorable macroeconomic environment and the growing interest in digital assets. Data from financial research firm Luthold Group suggests that riskier assets including Bitcoin and gold are likely to outperform traditional 60/40 stock and bond portfolios through 2024. Kohrs, known for his in-depth study of market trends, laid out two potential scenarios for the future of Bitcoin: It solidifies itself as the best store of value ever produced. It collapses in a bubble similar to historical speculative manias. But Kohrs remains bullish, arguing that BTC will likely continue to climb. “I don’t think there’s any middle ground,” he said, adding: “It’s either going to zero or we’re going to continue to climb higher.” Kohrs told participants to adopt a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy by regularly purchasing small amounts of Bitcoin regardless of price fluctuations. He noted that the devaluation of the US dollar, combined with Bitcoin’s limited supply, makes BTC an attractive long-term investment. Related News: JUST IN: Coinbase Announces the Listing of Two New Altcoins “I always speculate that the US dollar will fall,” he said, noting that Bitcoin’s rise is related to the dollar falling rather than the asset’s intrinsic value increasing. Looking ahead, Kohrs identified $250,000 as the next major psychological turning point for Bitcoin, which he predicted could occur within the next calendar year. Key catalysts include regulatory clarity and a growing overall cryptocurrency market cap, which he predicts could reach $2.5 trillion. *This is not investment advice.

Sarah Friar joined OpenAI as the company’s first CFO six months ago after a stint with Nextdoor. In an interview at the ReutersNEXT conference, she said Trump would be the “President of this AI generation.” Friar says he will be at the beginning of AGI progression in which technology can outperform human capabilities across the most valuable tasks. She also waved off any strong warnings against OpenAI from Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser. Friar said that she trusts Musk, a competitor, to respect national interests and play fair. Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, has consistently disagreed with changes at the company that whittled down the nonprofit board’s control. Since then, he has gone on to become a top adviser to Trump during the transition and is now heading up a rival artificial intelligence firm, xAI. Musk, along with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, will lead a team of Trump’s choosing in an effort to reduce government spending and waste. OpenAI CFO expects technology advancement to surprise people Friar added that OpenAI’s newly launched video tool, Sora, caused a big stir during the launch week. She also said that new account sign-ups were put on hold after its release and did not say when they would resume. She said part of the reason is the need for more capacity. Another is caution—the tool is only being used by a tiny fraction of customers, so the company can “listen and learn.” She added that this is a different approach from how it handled ChatGPT. Fiar said, “There are places where we will go a little slower to make sure that we are constantly putting safety first as well.” OpenAI is expected to roll out more AI agents or autonomous tools assisted by base models with better reasoning capabilities for everyday tasks. These tools could hit the market in the upcoming year. Friar added that people will be surprised by how fast technology advances. She also thinks there will be a lot of progress next year.

Source: Coinstats According to Coinmarketcap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November rising above the $35 mark and crossed in December trading at $48.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|ORDI,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-11 09:58:42

Airdrop’s Massive Participation & ME Price’s Surge and Drop: What You Should Know The ME token airdrop was one of the largest events from the cryptocurrency sector in the year 2024. The ME Foundation confirms that at least 70,000 users claimed over 69 million ME tokens within the first hour of the launch. At a point yesterday, the price of ME touched a peak of $17.00. It took no time for the market to face a massive drop of around 73.88%. In the last 24-hours, the ME price has declined by nearly 69%. In the last hour alone, the price slipped by around 5.9%. Data indicate that those who benefited from the launch were the ones who claimed their tokens early. Challenges in the ME Airdrop Claim Process Why could many users not properly time the market? To claim tokens, users were supposed to download the Magic Eden Wallet app, scan a QR code, and maintain a minimum wallet balance of $10. Reports suggest that not many were able to complete the process in a timely manner as they faced serious technical errors. Shockingly, reports also note that some even got confirmations without the actual tokens being awarded. Users’ Creative Strategies to Earn ME Tokens When many users dropped the attempt after facing errors during the claim process, some used creative strategies, like exploring fee mechanisms, to overcome the problem. Market Lessons from ME and HYPE Airdrops Experts point out that the airdrop of Magic Eden mirrored the HYPE event of Hyperliquid. They note that in both the scenarios, initial excitement slowly faded due to price drops. There are many who strongly believe that Magic Eden is far different from Hyperliquid. If Magic Eden puts effort into building utility and trust, the price of ME could go up again – even beyond the peak of $17. In conclusion, the ME airdrop showcased Magic Eden’s popularity but highlighted the challenges of large-scale crypto airdrops.",News|airdrop,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-11 10:00:58

The altcoins are still mostly in the red, aside from XRP, SOL, and TON, from the larger caps, which have posted impressive gains. BTC Targets $98K BTC’s inability to decisively conquer the $100,000 level during the weekend resulted in a few consecutive leg downs that harmed the asset’s price movements. It all started on Monday when BTC went to a daily high of $100,400 but just hours later found itself dumping to under $94,400. After leaving billions of dollars in liquidations, the cryptocurrency started to recover on Tuesday and spiked to $98,400. However, the same scenario repeated once again as BTC slumped hard to the same support level of $94,400. Since then, the asset has been recovering, surging to $94,400 once again hours ago. Nevertheless, it has been unable to continue its upswing, and now the community wonders whether another rejection will follow. For now, though, bitcoin’s price means that its market cap has neared $1.940 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alternative coins stands tall above 53%. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 11.12.2024. Source: TradingView XPR in Recovery Mode Ripple’s cross-border token was among the poorest performers during the correction in the past few days. However, it has bounced off from under $2 and now trades above $2.3 amid positive developments around the company’s upcoming stablecoin. Solana, Toncoin, and Shiba Inu are the other notable gainers from the larger-cap alts. In contrast, DOGE, ETH, BNB, AVAX, and TRX are in the red. PEPE has slumped ever harder, dropping by 7% from its latest all-time high. Bitget’s native token is today’s top performer, having surged by over 22% in the past 24 hours. Overall, the total crypto market cap has recovered over $150 billion since its low yesterday and now sits at $3.650 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

The tweet suggests that a Kraken listing could be on the way. A mysterious post recently made on X by the official account of MAGA Memecoin has set off a breakout of TRUMP ( TRUMP ), a token in the MAGA ecosystem. The post claimed that Kraken, a well-known cryptocurrency exchange, is interested in listing the token and caused ripples in the token community. The post included a photo showing Kraken branding adjacent to the caption, “Whose ready?” sparking speculation about the token’s listing on the exchange. Steven Steele , MAGA Marketing Exec, stoked the hype even more. However, neither Kraken nor the MAGA team has released an official statement on the listing.

TRUMP’s appearance on the list could signal an imminent listing, especially as MAGA ‘s marketing team is gearing up for some action. TRUMP has started to pump with community engagement Recent price action shows increasing interest in the TRUMP token, as there has been a decline in transfer count after Dec. 8., anticipating people in the community to expect a Kraken listing. Coupled with this, a significant divergence has been seen between active addresses and the price of the TRUMP token, since Dec. 9. As the price dropped from Dec. 9 to Dec. 10, the number of active addresses started to rise again after a short dip.

Newly opened addresses signal an expanding user base, demonstrating increased community interest in the token. At the same time, the ever-present holders are still playing well with their coins, whether it be trading, staking, or something else. This correlation between new and active addresses indicates that TRUMP is not only drawing fresh attention but also sustaining activity within its own community.

33767162,[object Object],1733916118,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Dogecoin Millionaires: 5 Other Meme Coins with 100x Potential,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-millionaires-5-memecoins-100x-potential/,"Among meme coins, Dogecoin ($DOGE) reigns supreme. With Elon Musk behind it (and a government department named after it), there’s no other meme coin quite like Dogecoin. It’s got a $57B market cap and has grown 285% over the past year. But it’s not the only big-money play in town. The meme coin market is particularly volatile, even for crypto, with new winners emerging every day. $DOGE turned ordinary investors into millionaires, but the big question is – what’s next? To help answer that, here are five other meme coins with 100x potential. These are all great projects with solid teams and big buzz in different stages of the launch cycle from presale onwards. Wall Street Pepe Crypto All-Stars Popcat Flockerz Peanut the Squirrel Time to see what could turn these projects into winners and 100x your investment. Wall Street Pepe – Wall-Street Savvy With Meme Coin Power Pepecoin is a proven meme coin winner, a green frog that has powered its way to the number 3 position among meme coins and a top-20 position overall by crypto market cap. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) plans to build on that success. It’s the same green frog but with added utility in the form of a vibrant investment community that aims to trade insights and secrets to power their investment success. Frog-based meme coins are having their day in the sun; while the original $PEPE continues to find success, rivals like Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) launched to great fanfare on the back of an astonishing $73M, sold-out presale. $WEPE aims to follow in the same footsteps, with an impressive $3.7M raised so far. Crypto All-Stars – Combining High-Powered Meme Coins Into One With MemeVault Buy Crypto All-Stars ($STARS), stake $STARS, profit. With a 211% APY for presale staking and over $11M raised so far, that’s the premise of Crypto All-Stars. The project unifies various high-powered meme coins, from Dogecoin to Pepe, with multi-token, multi-chain meme coin staking. It’s an opportunity for meme coin holders anywhere and everywhere to stake their tokens in a single protocol. And by buying and holding $STARS, investors can boost their meme coin rewards. Crypto All-Stars is still in presale, with 1 $STARS = $0.0016782. Popcat – Cat-Themed Meme Coin with $1B Market Cap Popcat purred to life in March 2024 and has grown an astounding 6530% since its launch. It’s a meme coin based on the popular Solana blockchain, which has recently experienced its own resurgence. Like all meme coins, Popcat’s price and market cap are both highly volatile. But the token is experiencing high trading volume on top of significant price appreciation, good signs for the future. The internet’s love affair with cats is ongoing, and Popcat joins the frogs and dogs on the list of meme coins with incredible earnings potential. Flockerz – Vote and Earn with the Flock Flockerz ($FLOCK) brings power to the people with a revolutionary vote-to-earn mechanism. Once launched, voting on community proposals will earn investors more $FLOCK tokens. The mechanism promises to drive community involvement and increase interest and momentum. Flockerz is already drawing attention, with $5.5M raised in presale. The current price is $0.0063247. The Flock, Flockerz community adds the vote-to-earn mechanism to the existing concept of a DAO. It’s an inventive take on a proven crypto innovation with incredible potential for $FLOCK and the broader crypto economy. That innovation, coupled with meme coin momentum, could let $FLOCK soar high in the meme coin ranks. $PNUT – Climb the Meme Coin Ranks with Crypto’s Favorite Squirrel Meme coins bank on memorability, momentum, and the current mood. And also animals. Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT) is a prime example. The real-life Peanut the Squirrel had over 500K followers on social media earlier this year. After being euthanized by New York authorities, the Squirrel’s meme coin – $PNUT – skyrocketed to $2.29 amid a surge of interest. While down considerably since then, the $PNUT token is still up 1739% since launch. It’s listed on major exchanges like Binance and has huge potential. The Search for 100x Each of these five meme coins has a major upside. But be warned – not every presale project ends in success. This isn’t financial or investment advice. It’s critical that you do your own research and be sure to check on a given project’s team, track record, roadmap, and any potential utility before buying in.

After losing his reputation with the Ripple Labs XRP case, Genser was given his marching orders by incoming President Trump, and Gensler confirmed he would resign on inauguration day. The problem is that Gensler, as a last act of defiance, rejected Solana ETFs. This is a massive relief for ADA investors as Cardano whales will unlikely be lured to Solana just yet. However, Rollblock’s ongoing presale may be cause for excitement among even Cardano whales as this GambleFi token heats up. Rollblock (RBLK): A Whale’s Opportunity in the Making Rollblock isn’t just another token in the market —it’s a tour de force. Designed as a GambleFi platform, Rollblock blends the excitement of online gambling with the sustainability of decentralized finance. Unlike the fleeting hype of typical presale tokens, Rollblock offers tangible value through profit-sharing mechanisms, ensuring investors earn dividends weekly. With its deflationary model and community-driven governance, Rollblock positions itself as an asset built for longevity, not just speculation. For whales looking to diversify their portfolios or maximize returns, Rollblock’s steady rise and $7 million liquidity milestone suggest it’s a project worth exploring. In a market full of quick gains and even quicker losses, Rollblock promises not just potential but staying power—a rare find in today’s volatile landscape. Cardano (ADA): Cardano Whales Not Ready To Jump Ship Just Yet If you’re a Cardano whale, you are swimming in the balmy waters of insane profits. Cardano has made a comeback like those French poets write verses about. Regarded by many as yesterday’s news, Cardano probed the $0.25 mark a year ago, and its market cap was a shadow of what it once was. Yet, Cardano whales remained steadfast in their commitment to the token. These Cardano whales are having the last laugh, as Cardano is now trading at way over a dollar and has delivered nearly 250x on the 90-day candle. The question is, can Carano whales take some of the profit and re-invest it somewhere else? The way Rollblock is going, the answer may be yes. Solana (SOL): Solana Etfs Denied Their Moment In The Sun In what critics call a final act of defiance, outgoing SEC chair Gary Gensler indicated he would not approve Solana ETFs, citing concerns about Solana’s status as a security. The non-approval of Solana ETFs is arguably a non-event, as incoming SEC chair Paul Atkins is sure to rubber stamp Solana ETF approval as a matter of course. But will it make a difference? Neither the Bitcoin nor Ethereum ETFs have made much of an impact, with many investors asking why to hold an ETF when you can just hold the token. It’s a good point, but the Solana ETF will give legitimacy to the coin, and it could be a bona fide asset, and that can only be good for Solana. Conclusion Solana ETFs may have been shot down by Gensler, but it’s only a temporary setback before the new SEC chair pushes through the application, and this will lend legitimacy to Solana as an asset. Cardano whales, however, may be looking at other avenues to invest in. That opportunity may just be the Rollblock presale. Rollblock is now available at $0.041.

Hedera ( HBAR ) is leading with a 494% rally in the mentioned timeframe. For the altseason to fully kick in, over 75% of the leading 50 digital assets would have to outperform Bitcoin. At this point, Bitcoin has a market dominance of 53.1% with a market cap of $1.94 trillion. The altcoin market cap dropped from $1.89 trillion on Dec. 9 to $1.68 trillion today amid the market-wide correction, according to data from CoinGecko.

The fast growth of the crypto sector is pushing Hong Kong to reconsider its regulations, with talks focused on speeding up changes to meet growing industry needs. A proposal raised in the Legislative Council on Dec. 11 highlights the pressure on the government to keep up with the global rise in crypto investments. In a written response, Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Joseph Chan, admitted that while the virtual assets sector offers financial innovation opportunities, it also presents new “complexities to the financial system.” He emphasized Hong Kong’s commitment to keep up with international standards, noting that the city “has key influence in the regulation and development of VA.” However, Chan didn’t go into detail on how or when Hong Kong plans to adjust its crypto regulations to stay competitive.

In the meantime, Chan pointed out that crypto-assets are not currently a target asset for Hong Kong’s Exchange Fund. “It cannot be ruled out that there may be investments involving crypto-assets during the investment operations of the external managers at different points of time, but the relevant proportion is minimal,” Chan said.

Accordingly, VanEck analysts said that as the altcoin index rises, the rise for Bitcoin will continue. VanEck analysts have published a report stating that the Altcoin Seasonal Index has increased by 53% over the past 30 days. At this point, analysts said they believe the altcoin seasonal index is showing signs of reaching its peak, which could lead to strong gains for Bitcoin in the coming months. Citing historical data, analysts noted that when the Altcoin Seasonal Index crosses 60, Bitcoin tends to deliver positive returns in the following months. Analysts who are quite optimistic about Bitcoin added that the recent strong performance of altcoins points to a potential BTC rally. “The Altcoin Season Index measures the percentage of the top 50 cryptocurrencies that have outperformed Bitcoin over a 90-day period. A value above 60 indicates a historically strong altcoin season and is a bullish signal for BTC. As a result, Bitcoin generally drives up altcoin prices.

For a long time, Tether has dominated the stablecoin sector in the crypto industry. In particular due to its high liquidity and exchanging volume, overperforming even Bitcoin ( BTC ) in this aspect. As of this writing, USDC has less than one-third of USDT’s capitalization, with $40.86 billion against $138.65 billion. The volume difference is even more impressive, with Tether’s stablecoin having $1.84 trillion exchanged in the last seven days and Circle’s token only $120.77 billion. Tether USDT and Circle USDC market capitalization and volume. Source: CoinMarketCap However, this is mostly due to USDT’s presence in centralized exchanges and corporate treasuries. USDC is already the most used stablecoin in the decentralized finance ( DeFi ) ecosystem and has a larger presence in blockchains. Therefore, if Circle manages to tackle and improve USDC’s presence in a place currently dominated by Tether, it is possible that USDC could challenge USDT’s throne as the leading stablecoin. Tether already holds more US treasury bonds than powerful economies like Germany, Australia, and the UAE. This evidences how challenging it will be for Circle to increase its market share despite having more regulatory clarity . In the meantime, decentralized stablecoin alternatives to both USDC and USDT are already surging and consolidating in the cryptocurrency space.

It suggests that major players are positioning themselves ahead of anticipated developments, such as a potential Ripple IPO and the launch of a Ripple-backed stablecoin. Catalysts driving XRP’s momentum Several factors are contributing to this surge in interest. XRP’s recent legal clarity—thanks to a landmark ruling that declared it not a security—has removed a significant regulatory cloud hanging over Ripple. Additionally, with the likelihood of a more crypto-friendly U.S. administration taking office, market optimism for assets like XRP is surging. While whale accumulation and favorable macro conditions paint a bullish picture, XRP’s price remains volatile. The token is currently trading above the critical $2.23 support level, with a psychological resistance level at $3 in sight, should XRP manage to break past $2.94.

While major altcoins crashed double-digits, PEPE held its own and is already on a recovery rally. The frog-based crypto Pepe Coin’s one-month gains sit at 77% and analysts believe this resistance is what makes PEPE the next king of memes and how it could shoot up soon. Pepe Price Action Hints It’s Next Hot Meme Coin Although the recent crash caused $1.7 billion positions to be liquidated Pepe Coin’s resilience sparks optimism among its holders. PEPE has been leading the market with its strong performers in the meme coin category.

The meme coin PEPE boasts a 77% gain over the month, ranking it 11th among top-performing altcoins . Market analysts suggest this strong performance underlines investor confidence in PEPE’s potential for explosive growth. As meme coins thrive on community sentiment and speculation, Pepe’s ability to weather market volatility may position it as the next breakout asset. The Pepe coin price has seen a rise in the market cap after hitting $9.76 billion.

On-chain data spotlighted by a top crypto analyst on Wednesday revealed that whales accumulated over 100 million XRP via exchanges as the market witnessed a crash recently. As a response, market sentiments of further gains looming for the crypto prevail in light of the phenomenal buying. Ripple Whales Bag 100M XRP Amid Market Dip Sparking Optimism According to an X post by top crypto analyst Ali Martinez, as of December 11, Ripple Whales acquired over 100 million tokens as the market crashed. This remarkable buying has paved a bullish path for the crypto, underlining increased market interest. For context, the whales’ action mirrored a buy-the-dip sentiment as the crypto market crashed recently. CoinGape Media reported that altcoins bore the brunt of heightened crypto liquidations , worth over $1.76 billion liquidated. The increased liquidations resulted in a market crash, aligning with the recent buy-the-dip action illustrated by whales. Besides, another on-chain metric has sparked contrasting market sentiments over the crypto’s future movements. Over the past 30 days, whales have moved more than 2.66 billion XRP to Binance , raising concerns as the exchange supply increases. Altogether, the buying and dump to exchanges birthed uncertainty, emerging as notable XRP news in the market. What’s Next For The Coin? XRP price today gained 6% intraday and is currently sitting at $2.369. Its 24-hour low and high were $1.912 and $2.411, respectively. Notably, the coin appears to be recovering against the backdrop of heightened buying after slipping back to the $1 level recently. Simultaneously, a recent XRP price analysis by CoinGape Media pointed out a bullish market technical that indicates remarkable gains imminent. The Ripple-backed coin broke out of a bullish pennant or bull flag pattern that spanned over eight years, signaling the potential for a massive upward move. Additionally, Ripple Labs gained NYDFS approva l for RLUSD stablecoin, adding a layer of optimism to the American blockchain firm’s crypto endeavors. Market watchers continue to eye the token for further price shifts amid Ripple whale movements and ecosystem developments.

The Crypto.com card powered by MasterCard allows users to fund their cards through the Crypto.com application using e-money wallets or third-party-issued credit and debit cards. The payment product will be available across all five Crypto.com card tiers, including Black Obsidian. The card will be denominated in USD and offers rewards of up to 8% on spending. Kingdom of Bahrain received Crypto.com’s COO The President and Chief Operating Officer of Crypto.com, Eric Anziani, was at Gudaibiya Palace when he presented His Royal Highness with the company’s new Mastercard prototype, one that is regarded as the first of its kind in the Middle East. During the meeting, HRH Prince Salman bin Hamad emphasized the Kingdom’s commitment to advancing the financial services and digital technology sectors, both of which are priorities that contribute to supporting the Kingdom’s comprehensive development under the leadership of His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. He also reaffirmed the Kingdom of Bahrain’s commitment to attracting international companies across promising sectors, strengthening its regional and international position, and expanding growth across various industries. The Minister of Finance and National Economy, HE Shaikh Salman bin Khalifa Al Khalifa, and the Governor of Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB), HE Khalid Ebrahim Humaidan, also attended the meeting.

Since early November, SOL has gained significant momentum, breaking key resistance levels amid a wider crypto rally. Over the past year, its value has surged by 218%, reflecting strong investor confidence. Despite minor dips, analysts suggest Solana’s price could climb higher, with some projecting an ambitious target of $4,000. Can Solana Price Hit $400 According to Analyst A prominent crypto analyst has tweeted a bold price prediction for Solana, citing a “cup and handle” chart pattern. According to the analysis, Solana could potentially reach $4,000 in the near future if the bullish structure materializes. The analyst shared a monthly chart showcasing the formation of a classic “cup and handle” pattern. The chart suggests that Solana has been consolidating within a critical resistance zone around $260. A breakout from this range could validate the bullish thesis. The prediction assumes Solana will break through its current resistance and rally toward higher Fibonacci extension levels. Notably, the 1.618 and 1.786 extensions, often used in technical analysis, indicate potential targets of $2,236 and $4,013, respectively. The ultimate price goal of $4,000 represents a staggering 1,861% increase from current levels. Source: X The Solana price could skyrocket, driven by growing interest in Solana meme coins like WIF and a potential ETF approval. Grayscale’s recent Solana ETF filing with the SEC has boosted investor enthusiasm, aligning with rising demand across altcoin markets. Bitcoin’s strong resistance above key levels and a resurgent crypto market fuel optimism for SOL. The upcoming U.S. presidential inauguration in January could create additional market momentum. Speculation surrounding an altcoin season, alongside increased investor activity, positions Solana as a standout performer. These factors could push SOL closer to its ambitious $4,000 target. Solana Price Eyes More Bullish Ahead Over the past month, the Solana price has seen a slight surge in its value. At the time of writing, the SOL price is hovering at $223.49, marking a 2.78% gain over the past 24 hours. This recent performance showcases a gradual upward trend amid fluctuating market conditions. Despite the signs of recovery, the Solana price prediction faces challenges in overcoming the critical $262 resistance level. A breakout above this zone could pave the way for further gains, while failure to breach it might lead to a retest of the $200 support zone. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator has risen to 0.05, suggesting increasing buying pressure and capital inflow into the asset. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) presents a bullish crossover, with the MACD line climbing above the signal line.

This highlights an increase in the selling pressure for the altcoin in the crypto space.

If the bulls regain momentum, the XRP coin price will retest its resistance level of $2.50. Maintaining its price above that level could push the price of this altcoin toward its new 52-week high this month.

Initially, I wasn't sure the report matters anymore. Obsessing over prices feels so 2022, when inflation was through the roof and the Fed squarely focused on interest-rate hikes to tame the beast. Recently, though, CPI has been below 3% and the Fed has cut rates, focusing on balancing employment and price stability. The November report is expected to show a slight uptick in price pressures and there are two reasons to keep an eye on it. Firstly, BTC bulls and bears are having a showdown near the all-important $100,000 level and might look to fundamental/macro news to reassert themselves. A softer-than-expected inflation print will likely validate Fed rate cut bets, potentially strengthening the bull grip for a sustained move above $100K. ETH might see bigger gains, having experienced a classic ""throwback,"" or a bullish retest of a breakout point, near $3,600 in the last 24 hours. But if the data comes in hotter than estimated, especially the core figure, it could add to the dollar's bull momentum and energize bitcoin bears, who have an advantage heading into the data release. Data shared by Hyblock Capital overnight showed a 50% order-book imbalance, with more limit sells than buys. Cardano's ADA is also feeling the pinch, with slippage spikes hinting at worsening liquidity. The second reason is that the U.S. Treasury market has been a picture of calm recently, with its volatility gauge, MOVE, plunging to 85 from 136. So, what better than CPI to stir it up again, sending ripples across financial markets. Let's see how it goes. Bank of America said it expects the report to breed equity market volatility. Looking past inflation, I want to reiterate the importance of watching the Far-East. Reuters reports that China could allow the yuan to depreciate next year in response to President-elect Donald Trump's poposed tariffs. While that may drive Chinese investors toward crypto, as the popular narrative says, a rapid decline might force the PBOC to intervene, inadvertently strengthening the dollar and tightening global financial conditions. That's typically not great news for risk assets like BTC. Elsewhere, Bloomberg's observers said that Nasdaq might add MicroStrategy (MSTR) to its index, which might inject $2.1 billion of buying demand into the stock. MSTR has been literally borrowing dollars to buy BTC, becoming a leveraged bet on the cryptocurrency. But remember, leverage works both ways; what goes up faster can also come down harder. That's plenty of macros to chew on today. Stay alert! What to Watch Crypto: Dec. 13: The annual Nasdaq-100 reconstitution. Changes to the index, if any, are announced on this day.

Raydium captured over 60% of the daily total DEX volume last month. A significant portion, peaking at 65%, came from trading in memecoins, according to a Messari report released Tuesday. This growth mirrors a larger shift in the market, with Solana's daily DEX volume overtaking Ethereum's. In November, Solana commanded nearly 50% of the DEX activity across all blockchains; Ethereum captured 18%. Memecoins on Solana are known for their high volatility, attracting traders looking for quick gains, and their speculative nature has led to significant trading volumes. For more on memecoins and Solana, check out the profile of Ansem, the Memecoin King , in CoinDesk's Most Influential 2024 . The latest trend is AI agents, or meme tokens that claim to use AI for products such as financial research or music creation. Tokens like AI16Z and ZEREBRO have run to market caps in excess of $300 million from under under $10,000 in a few weeks. Memecoins often start trading on Raydium after hitting market cap thresholds on launch platforms like Pump.fun — the most-used token issuance platform and another of CoinDesk's most influential — giving it a stream of new tokens every day.Such activity has minted Raydium developers' revenue of over $25 million since October, more than $500 million since January. That's 10 times the $44 million the DEX made in 2023 , DefLLama data shows.A few people are probably wishing the frenzy never ends. Derivatives Positioning Perpetual funding rates in small-cap tokens, often considered a proxy for speculative frenzy, are no longer overheated and have normalized to levels seen in bitcoin and ether. BTC options flows continue to lean bullish, with notable activity in calls at the $130,000 and $150,000 strikes expiring in February and March, respectively. Strong uptake has been seen for ETH $3,300 put expiring Dec. 20 and $3,750 call expiring Dec. 13.

This pullback, though significant, reflects broader market conditions as Bitcoin and altcoins enter a phase of indecision. The market is currently searching for support and consolidating below critical levels, with investors closely monitoring whether this phase will lead to recovery or further downside. Related Reading: Cardano Follows 2020 Bullish Pattern – Top Analyst Plans To Take Profits Between $4 And $6 Top analyst Jelle recently shared a technical analysis on X, suggesting that Solana holds promising upside potential. According to Jelle, if Solana can reclaim the $222 level in the coming days, it will likely trigger a quick and substantial surge. This key price point is a critical threshold that could shift sentiment and reignite bullish momentum for the popular altcoin. While the broader market remains uncertain, Solana’s ability to recover and build momentum above $222 could set the stage for a decisive breakout. However, failure to reclaim this level could prolong its consolidation or lead to further retracement. Solana remains a closely watched asset, with retail and institutional investors waiting for clearer signals on its next direction. Will it recover its bullish trajectory or face continued selling pressure? The coming days are likely to provide answers. Solana Finding Support In Previous Resistance Solana has retraced to test crucial liquidity levels between $200 and $210, an area that previously acted as resistance but is now being evaluated as support. This zone holds significant importance for SOL’s price action, as it could determine whether the asset continues its bullish momentum or faces further consolidation. Related Reading: Dogecoin Pressing Range Highs – Can Bulls Push DOGE To ATH? Solana’s price action is in a consolidation phase with no definitive direction, but the signs of a potential breakout are becoming clearer. The asset appears poised to make a decisive move, particularly if it reclaims key levels in the coming sessions. Analyst Jelle recently shared insights on X, emphasizing the critical importance of the $222 level. Jelle noted, “Reclaim $222, and SOL quickly steps back into the spotlight. Deviate those lows and send it higher.” This suggests that if Solana successfully reclaims this key level, it could re-enter price discovery, triggering a massive breakout and attracting renewed attention from retail and institutional investors. Should Solana achieve this, it may set the stage for a rally that mirrors its earlier impressive performance, reaffirming its position as one of the top-performing altcoins in the market. Conversely, failure to hold the $200-$210 support range could lead to further consolidation or a deeper correction. Solana remains a focal point in the market, with investors eagerly awaiting its next move. SOL Testing Crucial Demand Solana (SOL) is trading at $220, showing resilience after tagging the $203 level twice in the past week. This area has proven to be a strong support zone, as buyers stepped in to prevent further declines. The price now hovers near a critical juncture, with market participants closely watching for the next major move. If SOL can hold above the $203 support and reclaim the $238 resistance area, a quick recovery could follow, potentially paving the way for a renewed bullish trend. Reclaiming $238 would signal strength and attract fresh buying interest, pushing SOL back into higher trading ranges. However, this recovery may take time as the broader crypto market consolidates in indecision. Bitcoin and other major altcoins also move sideways, adding to the uncertainty around Solana’s immediate price action. Until a breakout or breakdown occurs, SOL is likely to remain range-bound.

In recent years, non-fungible tokens have sparked a lively debate in both the art world and broader cultural discussions. From their role in high-value digital art sales to their perceived association with speculative bubbles, NFTs are often viewed through a polarized lens. You might also like: Museums, AI-generated art, blockchain, and NFTs | Opinion Yet, beneath the buzz and controversy lies a transformative technology that revolutionizes how we preserve, authenticate, and engage with art and culture. NFTs provide a tamper-proof ledger that ensures trust, transparency, and the preservation of cultural heritage—fundamental components for understanding art’s true value. Importance of authenticity and provenance Authenticity is the cornerstone of art valuation. For example, a painting attributed to Leonardo da Vinci could fetch hundreds of millions of dollars, whereas the price of a copy from his contemporary could drop by more than 99%. However, a reproduction of the original in today would not be considered as art in the same way. This stark difference in value lies in the authenticity of the work. Provenance, while perhaps less familiar to those outside the art world, is just as crucial. It refers to the documented history of an artwork, tracing its journey from creation through various owners to its present-day status. When an artwork’s provenance includes renowned collectors or dealers, it confirms an artwork’s authenticity and adds historical context and significance, further enhancing its value. Traditionally, authenticity and provenance have relied on physical records such as catalogues, inventories, or certificates, all of which are vulnerable to loss, damage, or manipulation. These gaps in historical documentation can make it challenging to assess an artefact’s true value. NFTs provide a solution by creating immutable records, ensuring the preservation of critical information, and offering a transparent and secure way to track provenance. Tokenization: A new path for art? Despite the potential of NFTs in documentation and preservation, many traditional methods of publication, digitization, archiving, and database management remain in place. Experts in the field of art and culture have not yet felt the need to integrate NFTs into these established practices. However, the most common and tangible application of NFTs in the art world today is tokenization. This involves creating digital versions of artworks certified by respected institutions. For instance, in 2021, the British Museum issued over 200 NFTs of 19th-century drawings by Japanese artist Hokusai, and the Belvedere Museum in Vienna turned Gustav Klimt’s The Kiss into 10,000 NFTs in the following year. Such initiatives offer the public an innovative way to engage with cultural treasures. Instead of purchasing a postcard or souvenir at the end of a museum visit, visitors can now buy a piece of digital history that connects them to iconic works of art. This not only fosters deeper connections with cultural artefacts but also helps fund the preservation and conservation of the physical artworks through proceeds from the sale of these digital versions. Private collectors have also embraced tokenization, often with investment goals in mind, offering fractional ownership of artworks through NFTs as digital proofs of shares. However, this approach raises fundamental questions about the relationship between the physical artwork and its digital counterpart. For instance, if you own an NFT share of an artwork, what rights does this confer? Can you display the artwork physically or digitally? When will the market infrastructure mature enough to support the trading of these digital shares effectively? Even in museum-led initiatives, how does an NFT’s value and significance compare to a freely available high-resolution photo of the artwork? These questions directly impact the perceived value and liquidity of such NFTs, whether they are treated as digital derivatives or as representations of tangible ownership. Although tokenization offers many benefits in terms of education, engagement, and raising awareness, the digital representations of art will likely remain secondary to their physical originals. In the long term, the true value of art lies in its physical presence, and preservation efforts must continue to focus on ensuring the material integrity of cultural artefacts. Museums, collectors, and cultural institutions will still need to invest in the protection and conservation of these objects in controlled environments, using a range of technologies beyond NFTs. NFTs: The future of cultural preservation and reinterpretation So, what is the best application of NFTs in preserving historical art and culture? Artworks are manifestations of human creativity and cultural identity, and their preservation can take two complementary paths. One is to safeguard the physical artefacts created by those who came before us, ensuring that they remain intact and accessible for future generations. The other path is to capture the essence of these works, reinterpreting them in innovative ways that blend creativity with technology, bringing art and culture into the future. NFTs offer a unique opportunity to bridge these two paths. They not only document and digitize historical artefacts but also enable artists to reimagine cultural heritage in novel forms. By leveraging technology, we ensure that the stories of our past resonate with audiences of the future. An example of NFTs being used meaningfully and respectfully for cultural preservation is Refik Anadol’s collaboration with the Yawanawá people of Brazil—composed of a central video artwork and a collection of 1,000 unique and dynamically evolving NFT data paintings. The project Winds of Yawanawá blends artworks created by local people, Amazon rainforest data, AI technology, and immersive digital displays to create a data-driven art experience. This project not only celebrates Indigenous heritage but also raises awareness about the ecological importance of the Amazon, generating funds to support both cultural and environmental conservation. Such projects set a precedent for how NFTs can be used not only as static tokens of ownership but as dynamic platforms for storytelling, advocacy, and cultural preservation. By combining traditional art forms with environmental and technological data, NFTs can create immersive, educational experiences that amplify Indigenous voices and foster cultural pride. Embracing the future of art & culture For now, contemporary artists are the primary beneficiaries of NFT technology. NFTs can document provenance and verify authenticity from the moment of creation, providing future collectors with confidence in the artwork’s origins. Moreover, NFTs can serve as comprehensive digital archives, capturing details about sponsors, editions, exhibition histories, and transparent pricing. We must remember that we are constantly creating history. The art of today will become the “ancient art” of tomorrow. Culture is a continuum, and our relationship with time and its impact on art is inherently fluid. By embracing NFTs, we ensure that today’s artistic narratives will be preserved for future generations. I believe that everything begins in the mind. As humans, we generate ideas and transform them into physical objects, attaching meanings and interpretations to them. In today’s digital age, we are increasingly valuing intangible assets like digital experiences and virtual spaces. Rather than simply replicating physical objects digitally, we should continue to tap into our creativity to craft new forms and experiences that will define the future. This is how art and culture evolve, adapting to the times while maintaining the essence of human expression.

The Bitcoin trendline is holding, and so is the $95,000 horizontal support. How far can this bounce go? Two flash crashes in succession wipe out leverage The last crypto flash crash is still very much in the minds of many, and certainly in the minds of those who were liquidated , as Bitcoin fell heavily once again on Monday and Tuesday. It also needs to be borne in mind that the huge $12,000 BTC crash from top to bottom was only a week ago. If these two crashes did anything, they certainly cleared out most of the leverage in the system, giving the market a clean slate with which to go forward. Strong buying continues With Bitcoin now looking to be fully embarked on its recovery, the impact from the huge MicroStrategy buy of $2.1 billion in BTC could now be permeating through the market. That the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs bought a further 4.51K BTC on Tuesday should also help. Can Willow quantum computing chip threaten Bitcoin? The introduction by Google of their Willow quantum computing chip perhaps brings some slight nervousness to the market. This chip of 105 qubits has been demonstrated to solve tasks in minutes that supercomputers would take a huge amount of time to complete. That said, while this is another big step forward in quantum computing, a chip with the amount of qubits required to break the encryption of Bitcoin must still be quite a way off. Estimates as to the amount of qubits needed for this would be in the millions, or even billions of qubits. Major support holds for $BTC Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for $BTC displays how the price is still continuing to respect the ascending trendline, and the candle wicks below are testament to the strong buying coming into Bitcoin when any sign of trouble appears. The $BTC price has entered resistance now, but it is likely that the bulls will try to push the price up and through the 0.618 Fibonacci at $99,000. Above this is the 0.786 Fibonacci at a price of $101,000. If the bulls can force the price up through these levels it could be game-on again. $BTC triangle breakout? Source: TradingView Looking a bit further out into the 12-hour time frame, it can be observed that the $BTC price could be bouncing within a triangle pattern. If the price can continue to the top of the triangle, and the Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart would point to this being a distinct possibility, a breakout would have a measured move to around $111,000.

At the recent Bitcoin Conference in Abu Dhabi, Trump remarked that the current banking system is quite ‘antiquated.’ If you want a loan for your dream house, it’ll take at least 90 days. But by then, your dream house might be sold. However, blockchain can solve this issue with its faster, more efficient process. He also added that blockchain can do everything that a traditional banking system can, only faster, better, and at a cheaper price. Trump’s Stance On Cryptocurrency It looks like Eric Trump shares his father’s vision. From the beginning of his re-election campaign, Donald Trump has been quite vocal about his support for crypto. He accepted donations for his campaign in crypto, appeared at several industry events, pledged to promote the crypto industry with fair regulations, and promised to make the USA ‘the crypto capital of the planet.’ That’s because he believes that crypto is the future of the world. Slowly but surely, every country will embrace this new currency, so it’s better that the USA leads the revolution. ‘If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted, and made in the USA,’ he had said. The Impact of Trump’s Crypto-friendly Approach on the Overall Market Crypto investors might have noticed that over the last few weeks, the market has been on the rise. Many popular currencies, such as Bitcoin and Dogecoin, and a few new entries on presale, like Flockerz , have been gaining ground at rocket speed. Bitcoin recently crossed the $100K valuation mark. The spike started on November 6 when it seemed Trump would win the election. In a single day, Bitcoin’s value jumped up by $6K. A week later, its total value hit $90K; on December 5, Bitcoin crossed $100K . The same happened with Dogecoin. After Trump’s victory, its per-token price more than doubled, going from $0.16 per token to almost $0.38. Today (December 11), it’s listed at just over $0.39. It’s having one of the best years since 2021. Flockerz, which is currently in presale, has managed to raise $4M so far. According to experts, when the token finally launches, the big investors might become millionaires overnight as they expect it to give a 4000x return. Chasing the (New) American Dream Analysts believe Trump’s victory in the presidential election is one of the reasons for this sudden growth. Trump has promised to reduce restrictions on crypto trading, lower taxes, create favorable policies, and even appoint a crypto-friendly chairperson to the SEC. This has given new investors the much-needed confidence to finally dip their toes in the market. Seasoned investors are also looking to increase their investments. However, bear in mind that this isn’t financial or investment advice and it’s critical you do your own research before investing. So if the market does continue to grow at this pace, Trump’s prediction will come true – crypto will become the future and overtake traditional baking systems.",Cryptocurrency Market News|bitcoin|crypto|Eric trump,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-11 12:06:01

Its retreat has mirrored that of other altcoins like Ethereum and Cardano. Still, some analysts believe that the LINK price will bounce back, and possibly move to $100 when this shakeout ends. Crypto Analyst Explains Why Chainlink Price Will Hit $100 LINK price was trading at $22.65 on Wednesday, down by about 17% from its highest level this month. In an X post, WSB Trader Rocko , a popular crypto analyst, maintained his view that Chainlink was still on a path toward $100 in this bull run. If this view is accurate, it would imply a 354% increase from the current level Rocko pointed to the latest news that Chainlink was selected to provide oracle technology to Coinbase, the biggest exchange in the United States. He then noted that Chainlink was also selected by other large organizations like Swift, DTCC, BNP Paribas, Citi, Franklin Templeton, UBS, and Vontobel. A potential catalyst for the LINK price, according to another analyst , is that Chainlink will be incorporated into Swift’s network. Global banks own SWIFT Network, which handles over $150 trillion each year. That analyst expects that Chainlink’s market cap will get to over $500 billion in the long term. Meanwhile, the amount of Chainlink balances in exchanges is falling. This is a sign that many investors are holding it in their wallets or staking it. Chainlink Balances on Balances LINK Price Analysis: Target $40 Before Hitting $100 The weekly chart shows that Chainlink price has strong technicals and that its bullish trend will continue. It formed a cup pattern whose upper side was at $22.64. A C&H pattern is made up of a cup, which happens when there is a rounded bottom. LINK price has also completed the handle section. A profit target in a C&H pattern is established by first measuring the cup’s depth. One then taking the same distance from the upper side of the cup. In this case, measuring 77% from the cup brings the target to $40.8, which also coincides with the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level. For the LINK price to move to $100, it needs to first cross that level. It will then need to flip its all-time high at $52.90.

The famous billionaire shared that debt will affect major economies around the world, which is why he prefers gold and Bitcoin over other assets. Speaking at a financial conference in Abu Dhabi, Dalio said he was staying away from debt assets such as bonds and turning to harder currencies such as gold and Bitcoin. “The debt of all major economies except Germany is at unprecedented levels and continues to rise. It is almost certain that countries will experience a debt crisis in the coming years, leading to a major devaluation of their currencies. So I want to stay away from debt assets like bonds and have some hard money like gold and Bitcoin.” Famous billionaire Ray Dalio previously believed that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin would not be as successful as people hoped, but in recent years he has emerged as a big BTC supporter. *This is not investment advice.

The billionaire, who now serves as Bridgewater Associates’ investment chief, is more interested in the precious metal and cryptocurrency because they are “hard money.” On the other hand, debt assets like bonds are to be avoided because major economies are bound to face debt crises in the coming years, leading to a decline in their value. BTC and Gold Over Debt Assets According to a report from the South China Morning Post, Dalio dropped his remarks on BTC and gold during a speech on December 10 at the Abu Dhabi Finance Week (ADFW). He stated that all major economies, including the United States, China, and, excluding Germany, are seeing their indebtedness surge to unprecedented levels. Unfortunately, these levels are unsustainable, and there could be a debt money problem in the future. “I believe that there would likely be a pending debt money problem. I want to steer away from debt assets like bonds and debt and have some hard money like gold and bitcoin,” Dalio said. The billionaire further explained that debt, money, the economy, acts of nature, and the invention of new technologies are the forces driving everything in the world. Other factors, such as countries’ political and external geopolitical orders, could contribute significantly. Judging by Dalio’s preference for BTC and gold, he believes these assets are the best for preserving wealth as the world reacts to these forces. “Don’t get too caught up on the twists and turns of the day-to-day headlines, and instead, think more about the big forces. Think strategically as well as tactically, taking a global perspective while recognizing that what you don’t know about the future is more than what you do know,” the Bridgewater founder added. BTC Exceeds Dalio’s Expectations Dalio used to be a Bitcoin critic a few years ago. In 2020, he opined that the crypto asset is unlikely to perform as remarkably as people hoped. Bitcoin was worth around $15,000 at the time. Four years later, Dalio has become a Bitcoin advocate and now considers the cryptocurrency a better option than debt assets, especially with BTC crossing $100,000 for the first time.

Developed by the CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium (C4), this certification represents a new benchmark in cryptocurrency platform security. This accomplishment places WhiteBIT among the top-tier platforms recognized for superior security. The CCSS is an industry-standard security framework designed to ensure robust protection for cryptocurrency systems. It complements existing ICT security frameworks like ISO 27001 and PCI DSS by introducing specific guidance for best practices in securing cryptocurrencies. The standard includes three levels of certification, with Level 3 representing the highest benchmark, requiring advanced security measures such as multi-signature wallets, access controls, disaster recovery planning, as well as rigorous penetration testing and detailed audit trails for sensitive processes like data sensitization policies. WhiteBIT ’s successful certification was conducted by Hacken, a leading cybersecurity firm accredited by C4 to audit organizations for CCSS compliance. The auditor carried out an extensive review of WhiteBIT’s security infrastructure, following 3 years of preparation. The 2.5-month audit included in-depth inspections of both cold and hot wallets, dozens of hours of interviews with WhiteBIT personnel, and the submission of over 100 artifacts detailing the exchange’s policies, procedures, and security protocols. The final 97-page report reflected rigorous testing and hundreds of questions addressed throughout the process, ensuring full compliance with the stringent requirements of CCSS Level 3. ""This certification is a proof of our strong commitment to safeguarding our users' assets,"" says Volodymyr Nosov, Owner and CEO of WhiteBIT. ""In an industry where trust must be earned every day, we have embraced rigorous security protocols that set new benchmarks for excellence. Our goal isn’t just to drive innovation but to ensure that these advancements are built on a secure foundation. The CCSS certification underscores our dedication to providing a safer experience for our global user base of over 5,5 million."" WhiteBIT’s CCSS certification delivers significant benefits to users: Enhanced Security. CCSS ensures robust protections for user funds and private keys, minimizing risks of hacks or theft through advanced technologies like multisignature wallets. Reduced Risks. The standard mitigates human errors and ensures only authorized personnel can access sensitive systems, safeguarding user assets. Emergency Preparedness. WhiteBIT has recovery systems in place to protect user assets during unforeseen events, providing a safer trading experience. For WhiteBIT, this accomplishment aligns with its overarching strategy of promoting mass adoption through trust and transparency. Earlier this year, the company also achieved prominence by securing the highest level of PCI DSS certification for payment data protection—a further indication of its dedication towards comprehensive protection measures. About WhiteBIT WhiteBIT is one of the largest European centralized crypto exchanges founded in 2018. The exchange offers 600+ trading pairs, 300+ digital assets, and 9 state currencies. The company is an official partner of FC Barcelona, FC Trabzonspor, ESL Faceit, and VISA. The goal of WhiteBIT is the mass implementation of blockchain technology worldwide.

President Milei has also expressed his desire to make his country a central hub for artificial intelligence. On his official X account, Tesla CEO Elon Musk expressed his delight at Argentina’s economic stabilization one year after President Javier Milei took office. Musk and President-elect Donald Trump had high expectations for the country’s leader, as this was the first time a self-described “anarcho-capitalist” had been elected to the country’s highest office. Wow, congratulations @JMilei 🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷 https://t.co/XtuVMZnfAt — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 11, 2024 Musk has publicly supported President Milei since he was elected. He also revealed that his companies, Tesla and Space X, were exploring ways to invest in Argentina. According to a CNBC report , the Argentine President became the first foreign leader to visit U.S. President-elect Donald Trump following his second-term election victory. Milei attended a November gala dinner at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where he served as a VIP speaker. During the event, Milei praised Trump’s re-election, describing it as “the greatest political comeback in all of history” and commending Trump for defying the political establishment despite personal risks. He reportedly remarked that Trump’s victory marked a positive shift for global freedom. Milei also acknowledged Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who was in attendance, applauding Musk’s contributions to humanity. Speaking through an interpreter, he credited Musk for his efforts to “save humanity.” Argentina’s economy improves under Milei Argentina’s economy has undergone a dramatic turnaround under President Javier Milei, whose swift actions to balance the budget have reshaped the nation’s financial outlook. Inheriting a 5% GDP deficit, Milei achieved a financial surplus in the first quarter of his term and has maintained this trajectory. The country has experienced budget deficits in 113 of the past 123 years. While spending cuts primarily targeting pensioners and public employees have sparked debate over their long-term sustainability, the speed of fiscal stabilization stands as Milei’s most notable achievement. In a recent press briefing, Milei said that in 2023, a member of the previous administration he termed a “degenerate” printed 13% of GDP to win an election, which heightened inflation rates. According to the president’s recent press statements, the abrupt end to money printing has bolstered the Argentine peso, reversing years of depreciation. Inflation, which soared to a world-leading 211% in 2023, has also plummeted. Monthly inflation rates dropped from 25% last December to 2.7% in October, the lowest figure since late 2021, marking a significant step toward economic stability. Rent decontrol policies have nearly tripled the supply of apartments while reducing real prices by up to 40%. Additionally, the introduction of new satellite internet providers is expected to revolutionize agriculture by facilitating greater technological adoption. Milei’s policies have inspired Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, co-heads of the US government spending control authority Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), who stated that they would use Argentina’s model to minimize the USA’s federal budget . Argentine government vows to make the country an AI powerhouse President Javier Milei is determined to transform Argentina into a major player in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector despite the country’s current position as one of the least advanced in AI adoption on the continent. Milei sees his nation’s abundant, low-cost electricity and its highly skilled workforce as key assets in achieving this ambitious goal. “ We have everything, everything, to become an AI powerhouse ,” Milei stated, emphasizing the country’s potential to develop a thriving AI industry. He highlighted Argentina’s capacity to meet the energy demands of data centers, which are crucial for AI development, pointing to the country’s reliable energy infrastructure. Milei also echoed the importance of cold weather for data centers to function efficiently, suggesting that Argentina’s southern regions, with their vast land and cooler climate, could provide an ideal environment for this type of high-energy infrastructure. During recent trips to the U.S., Milei met with high-profile tech leaders such as Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, presenting Argentina as “practically the last truly liberal country in the world.” According to Alexander Ditzend, president of Argentina’s AI Society, these meetings were part of Milei’s efforts to attract global investors to the country’s emerging AI sector.

Drawing comparisons to XRP’s explosive 5x rally, a seasoned investor highlights why these tokens, both trading under $0.50, could be hidden gems. With growing adoption, innovative use cases, and undervalued market positions, TRX and RXS are poised for a breakout. As excitement builds, many are wondering if now is the perfect time to act, before these altcoins potentially surge to new heights. Tron (TRX): A Bullish Surge with Promising Momentum Tron (TRX) has witnessed a sharp rally in the past month, surging by over 94% from $0.1637 to $0.3178, as shown in the chart. The price gained significant momentum due to growing adoption and market confidence in the ecosystem. TRX recently hit a peak of $0.40 before retracing to consolidate around $0.32, indicating healthy profit-taking and potential support at this level. The spike in 24-hour trading volumes earlier in the month, followed by a current 54% decline, suggests cooling activity but a strong long-term bullish sentiment. This aligns with the view that Tron’s momentum resembles the early stages of XRP’s recent rally. For investors eyeing undervalued opportunities, TRX’s technical setup signals potential for further growth. #Tron #TRX will explode in the next 48 hours. Price target $0.60.

Scams using social engineering and malicious bots are evolving to compromise crypto wallets and sensitive data through platforms like Telegram and fake meeting apps. Meanwhile, the sentencing of former Celsius executive Roni Cohen-Pavon has been postponed to 2025 to potentially help in the prosecution of ex-CEO Alex Mashinsky. Pastor Faces CFTC Lawsuit Over Crypto Fraud The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a lawsuit against Francier Obando Pinillo, a pastor that is accused of orchestrating a $6 million cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme targeting more than 1,500 people. Some of his victims include members of his congregation in Washington state. The CFTC announced the legal action on Dec. 10, and the regulator alleges that Pinillo engaged in fraud and misappropriation through a multilevel marketing scheme under the guise of cryptocurrency trading and staking services. According to the complaint that was filed in a Spokane federal court, Pinillo presented himself as the CEO of Solanofi, Solano Partners Ltd., and Solano Capital Investments. He claimed that he developed a ”Solano ecosystem” that utilized advanced crypto trading platforms. Between November of 2021 and December of 2023, Pinillo allegedly convinced customers that his operations traded popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE). He also promised monthly profits of up to 34.9% through a proprietary trading bot and software. The workings of a Ponzi scheme (Source: Dimond Kaplan & Rothstein ) The scheme also included a staking service branded as Solanofi 2.0, which guaranteed profits. To encourage participation even more, users were provided with an online dashboard showing fabricated account statements and were offered a 15% referral fee for recruiting others. The CFTC's investigation revealed that these claims were entirely fraudulent. There was no automated trading program, no actual customer accounts, and no trading activities or profits. Instead, Pinillo misappropriated all of the funds that were transferred by customers. The CFTC revealed that Pinillo targeted unsophisticated people with very minimal knowledge of crypto transactions. He also took advantage of his position as a pastor and communicated predominantly in Spanish to gain their trust. The regulator is seeking restitution for the affected victims, the forfeiture of the funds that were generated through the scheme, a permanent trading ban, and an injunction to prevent any future violations. Another New Scam Targets Crypto Wallets Unfortunately, the latest crypto scam stories do not stop with Ponzi schemes. Scammers are also increasingly using a combination of social engineering and fake Telegram verification bots to deploy crypto-stealing malware, according to blockchain security firm Scam Sniffer . In a recent post on X, Scam Sniffer shared some details about a new scam tactic involving fake X accounts impersonating popular crypto influencers . These accounts lure victims into Telegram groups with promises of exclusive investment insights. Once users join these groups, they are asked to verify themselves through a fraudulent bot called “OfficiaISafeguardBot.” This bot uses urgency tactics, like short verification windows, to pressure users into compliance. During the verification process, the bot injects malicious PowerShell code that downloads and executes malware that is designed to compromise computer systems and crypto wallets. According to Scam Sniffer, this malware has been responsible for large amounts of private key thefts that allowed scammers to raid wallets. The firm acknowledged that while malware targeting crypto users has been around for years now, the sophistication of these scams advanced rapidly. Successful heists encouraged the evolution of scams into a “scam-as-a-service” model, where tools like wallet-draining software are rented out to phishing operators. This particular combination of fake X accounts, Telegram channels, and malicious bots, however, is a newer development. The firm also reported a rise in impersonation scams on X. Its monitoring systems identified an average of 300 fake accounts daily in December, compared to 160 in November. At least two victims reportedly lost more than $3 million after interacting with malicious links and signing transactions prompted by these fake accounts. The threat extends beyond just Telegram and X. Scammers Target Web3 Workers Web3 workers are also facing targeted attacks from scammers using fake meeting apps to inject malware and steal sensitive information, according to a report by Cado Security Labs. The campaign involves scammers posing as legitimate companies by creating realistic websites and social media accounts by using artificial intelligence. They contact potential victims, often through platforms like Telegram, and prompt them to download a meeting app named ”Meeten,” which frequently changes its name to evade detection. Some of its previous aliases include ”Meetio,” ”Clusee.com,” ”Cuesee,” ”Meeten.gg,” ”Meeten.us,” and ”Meetone.gg.” The app contains the Realst info stealer that is designed to extract critical data like Telegram logins, banking card details, and crypto wallet information. After this information is gathered, it is sent back to the attackers. It can also harvest browser cookies, autofill credentials from applications like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, as well as data from Ledger, Trezor, and Binance wallets. Example of one of the fake meeting apps (Source: Cado Security ) Scammers employ very sophisticated social engineering techniques, including impersonating known contacts to discuss fake business opportunities. In one case, an attacker sent a victim an investment presentation from their own company. Others reported being on Web3-related calls, downloading the malicious software, and subsequently losing their cryptocurrency holdings. The attackers increase their credibility even more by setting up AI-generated company websites with blogs, product descriptions, and active social media profiles on platforms like X and Medium. These websites often contain Javascript that is capable of stealing crypto stored in web browsers, even before the malware is installed. Variants of the malware exist for both macOS and Windows. It is estimated that the scheme has been active for around four months. Former Celsius Executive's Sentencing Delayed In other crypto crime related news, Roni Cohen-Pavon, the former chief revenue officer of the collapsed crypto lending platform Celsius, will not face sentencing on Dec. 11 after an agreement between United States prosecutors and former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky. In a Dec. 9 court filing, Judge John Koeltl approved a request to delay Cohen-Pavon’s sentencing until after Mashinsky’s, which is scheduled for April of 2025. Prosecutors suggested that Cohen-Pavon’s cooperation might provide valuable information relevant to Mashinsky’s case. Cohen-Pavon pleaded guilty to four felony charges, including conspiracy to commit price manipulation, securities fraud, and wire fraud, and has been awaiting sentencing since his arrest in September of 2023. He initially pleaded not guilty but changed his plea after being indicted in July 2023 for misleading Celsius users and profiting from price manipulation alongside Mashinsky. Both parties are expected to report back to the court on April 18, 2025, when Judge Koeltl could decide Cohen-Pavon’s fate. Roni Cohen-Pavon Mashinsky, the former CEO, agreed to plead guilty to two charges earlier this month as part of a deal with prosecutors. He admitted to misleading users about regulatory approvals and concealing sales of his CEL token holdings. He also agreed to forfeit $48 million in proceeds from the fraudulent scheme. If convicted, Mashinsky could face up to 30 years in prison. The Celsius platform filed for bankruptcy in 2022 due to a massive market downturn that left millions of users unable to access billions of dollars in their accounts. The company’s collapse was one of the largest in the crypto space. In November, a bankruptcy court approved a reorganization plan that allows Celsius to distribute approximately $2 billion to creditors starting in 2025. Cohen-Pavon was allowed to travel between New York and Israel under a $500,000 bond and was permitted to travel to Singapore in September. The potential impact of his guilty plea and cooperation on Mashinsky’s sentencing is still unclear, but it could influence the court’s decision.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-11 13:30:33

According to local media outlet On CC , Hong Kong Councilor Johnny Ng suggested that the government should consider adding cryptocurrencies into its fiscal reserves. Ng said that the government could use the Hong Kong Exchange Fund to hold and buy crypto assets . Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Joseph Chan responded to Ng’s request with a written letter, explaining that crypto assets are not the “target asset” for Hong Kong Exchange Fund investments. However, Chan does confirm at the Legislative Council meeting that the Hong Kong Exchange Fund does hold a small amount of crypto assets through external investment managers. Though, he said the proportion is “very small.” You might also like: Hong Kong looks to speed up crypto regulation amid rising sector demands The Hong Kong Monetary Authority external investment managers often diversify the fund’s asset classes and markets with assets and stocks from around the world, depending on the asset performance evaluated by external investment managers at different times. Chan pointed out that authorities issued the “Policy Declaration on the Development of Virtual Assets in Hong Kong” in October 2022, indicating that the government and regulatory agencies adhere to the same principle of “same business, same risks, same rules” when it comes to virtual assets. In addition, authorities have introduced a licensing system for virtual asset service providers through amendments to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance Bill to ensure that crypto trading platforms comply with international standards. As previously reported by crypto.news , the Hong Kong government is looking for ways to speed up the making of crypto regulations in order to keep up with the rapidly evolving global crypto industry. Chan did not elaborate on how the Hong Kong government plans to fast-track its crypto regulations.

Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon has said that the investment banking major would evaluate trading cryptocurrencies should US regulations permit the bank to do so. “At the moment, as a regulated banking institution, we’re not allowed to own a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin as a principal,” he said at a Reuters Next conference , held on Tuesday, 10 December. “We give our clients advice around a variety of these technologies and these issues, and will continue to do that. But for the moment our ability to act in these markets is extremely limited from a regulatory perspective.” Interestingly, Goldman Sachs disclosed in its recent US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 13F filing that the company holds more than $700M in eight Bitcoin ETFs, as of September 20, 2024. So, it would appear that at long last, corporate attitudes to crypto are finally changing. Even US President-elect Donald Trump has positioned himself as a champion of cryptocurrency. The launch of a strategic national crypto stockpile was among the promises made by Trump in the run-up to the 2024 election. Removing Gary Gensler – the nemesis of crypto companies due to his aggressive approach to crypto regulation – from his position as SEC Chairman was another. A Green Light for Ripple’s Stablecoin Means Meme Coins Pump The big news for the cryptocurrency economy keeps on rolling, as Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently announced that its $RLUSD stablecoin has been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services to go live. Pegged to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio, $RLUSD will be supported by a combination of US dollar reserves, short-term US Treasury securities, and other liquid assets, mirroring Tether’s approach to backing. $RLUSD is set to be launched on the XRP ledger in Ethereum. In all, the latest developments are great news for the economy, cryptocurrency holders, and the likes of Best Wallet. Powered by Best Wallet’s $BEST token – currently in presale with an impressive $3.34M already raised – Best Wallet plans to capture 40% of the crypto wallet market share by end-2026. Best Wallet is mobile-first, fully non-custodial app supports thousands of cryptocurrencies, including the best meme coins , across 50 major blockchains. But it’s that non-custodial aspect that sets Best Wallet apart. Most crypto wallets are controlled by centralized companies or exchanges, whereas Best Wallet gives users full control over their wallet. And that’s in addition to reduced transaction fees, early access to presales, and airdrops. It’s also the first crypto wallet to use Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP wallet technology, which adds high security, zero counterparty risk, and multi-blockchain support. All things considered, we believe $BEST is worthwhile looking into. Investors have just under two days to secure $BEST at its current price of $0.23075 before the next price increase.

Dogecoin ( DOGE ), the largest meme coin in the crypto industry, rebounded to $0.40 after falling to $0.36 a day earlier. This recovery occurred as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and most altcoins attempted to regain ground. Bitcoin rose to $98,500 after bottoming at $94,200 earlier in the week. Similarly, altcoins such as Ethereum and Solana also posted slight recoveries. Cryptocurrency analysts remain optimistic about Dogecoin, noting that it is still in a strong bull run. In an X post, Scofield, a popular crypto analyst with over 80,000 followers, noted that it was the last opportunity to buy the coin before a significant rally. He pointed to the fact that it was sitting at a key support level on the four-hour chart Meanwhile, Ali Martinez, another prominent analyst, predicted that Dogecoin’s price could eventually rise to $3 during this bullish cycle.

If Bitcoin achieves this, it is likely to trigger a strong bullish breakout for DOGE. Another potential driver is the incoming Donald Trump administration, which is anticipated to adopt a crypto-friendly stance. In the long term, the approval of a spot DOGE ETF could also lead to increased demand for the token. Dogecoin price needs to flip $0.4843 DOGE price chart | source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that DOGE has been in a strong uptrend for the past several weeks, rising for eight consecutive weeks. This explains its temporary breather this week, as assets often pull back after extended gains. Dogecoin price remains above the 50-week and 200-week moving averages and the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level. It has also moved to the ultimate resistance of the Murrey Math Lines. Therefore, for DOGE to rise and hit $1, bulls will need to push it above the key resistance point at $0.4843, the year-to-date high. If this happens, the next vital price to watch in its path to $1 will be $0.7500, its all-time high.

Although multiple coins excel in compatibility, Rexas Finance (RXS), Toncoin, Ripple (XRP), and Tron (TRX) always reign supreme owing to their specific use cases and ability to expand reach. Let’s take a closer look at how these four crypto coins are the missing pieces in your quest to reach a fortune of $500,000. 4 Crypto Coins That Could Potentially Turn $500 into $500,000 in 2025 Rexas Finance (RXS), Toncoin, Ripple (XRP), and Tron (TRX) are high-potential crypto coins that could transform your investment from $500 to $500,000. Let’s dive deep into more details. 1. Rexas Finance (RXS): Crypto Coin Revolutionizing Real-World Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance (RXS) is taking the crypto space by storm with its functionality of tokenizing real-world assets like real estate, art, and even commodities. This evolution not only permits individual investors to seek opportunities that were previously only targeted at institutional markets, but also allows the wealth of such assets to be built along with the people. The RXS presale has ended successfully, with over $23 million being realized and over 335 million tokens sold out. It is currently at stage nine and priced at $0.125. Current investors will still have made a modest gain if the price rises to $0.40 when the RWA token is listed on big exchanges in 2025. Long-term growth without losing sustainability is the central focus of the project’s tokenomics model. The ICO will distribute over 42.5% of its total issuance of one billion tokens, while the rest will be allocated towards staking, liquidity, marketing, and other requirements across the ecosystem. These allocations assist in achieving an active market presence and constant growth. Rexas Finance (RXS) Tokenomics Rexas Finance’s customers need to feel secure and enjoy transparency, so the platform has undergone a rigorous CertiK audit. This certification provides information on the project’s security and integrity, allowing investors to have confidence in the project. The total amount for the ongoing giveaway is $1 million, which proves RXS’s focus on community building. With an incentive for early adoption in mind, participants are aware how the giveaway works and how many people will win it—20 people will win 50,000 RXS each. Crypto analysts predict the early-stage cryptocurrency to rise to $17, given its fundamentals. 2. Toncoin (TON): The Blockchain Built for Speed Toncoin is a blockchain project that evolved out of the Telegram Open Network. One of its main features is speed. The blockchain’s architecture allows for instant transactions, making it best suited for Dapps and payment systems. At $6.16 and a market capitalization of $15.7 billion, Toncoin is gaining traction among users due to its seamless integration with Telegram, which has a considerable user base worldwide. This provides a viable and scalable use case and distinguishes Toncoin from many competitors. Areas with potential for exponential growth in Toncoin include adoption, which is being assisted by more developers and businesses starting to appreciate it. With its sound technical background and practical usage, TON makes a potential crypto to buy for investors hungry for high returns. 3. Ripple (XRP): Crypto Coins to Buy Transforming Cross-Border Transactions For quite some time, Ripple’s XRP has been one of the favorites among crypto addicts, thanks to its cross-border payments. It boasts a market cap of nearly $135.83 billion and currently trading at $2.38, thus remaining one of top contenders in the crypto industry today. However, the legal tussle with the SEC remains unresolved, creating opportunities and challenges for Ripple. Nevertheless, rumors of a positive nexus conclusion and much anticipated XRP ETF approval, have boosted investor confidence. Many analysts think XRP is absorbed in a big bullish run, where the money should currently be earned, suggesting that this is the ideal moment to consider investing in the project. Additionally, with multiple console partnerships, Ripple holds a leading position in the digital payments sector. The more the platform is accepted and utilized, the more evident the XRP price will continue to rise, a momentum that is poised to persist within the next several years. 4. Tron (TRX): The Cornerstone of Decentralized Content Creation Developers and users enjoy Tron because of its extremely low transaction costs and capability to facilitate scalable growth. TRX has shown not only adaptability but has also performed steadily in a harsh and competitive marketplace. With a market value of over $24 billion, the token is trading today at $0.2784, after recording nearly 68% in gains, over the past month. The platform seems to be on track for sustainable development since it focuses on Decentralized Applications and Decentralized Finance solutions, as the demand for decentralized platforms increases. Tron has a pathway of active development rounds and partnerships, which makes it stand out for investors. It has shown sustained growth and an expanding ecosystem, making it an appealing option for those aiming to catch the next bull run. Final Thoughts Creating a $500,000 net worth out of a $500 investment demands targeting cryptocurrencies with the potential to grow in the market. It is clear that Toncoin, Ripple, and Tron fulfill pause as high potential crypto coins to buy to turn $500 to $500,000. On the other hand, Rexas Finance, stands out as a promising investment for its innovative vision for asset tokenization, active and well-structured tokenomics, and a focus on community development. Considering the crypto market’s development, these four tokens have the potential for steady growth along with explosive drive, making them must-haves in an investment portfolio.

The incoming administration has drawn up plans to integrate cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence, and Silicon Valley’s fast-paced ethos into the very core of Washington. Trump’s approach to Bitcoin is straightforward: no overregulation, no stifling, and a strong push for America to dominate. Eric Trump, speaking at the Bitcoin MENA 2024 conference in the United Arab Emirates, set the tone by declaring that his father’s administration would be “the most pro-crypto presidency in history.” He celebrated Bitcoin’s milestone of hitting $100,000, also crediting his father’s decision to appoint a crypto-friendly SEC chair. Silicon Valley lands in Washington It’s pretty clear that Trump’s second term will be about reshaping the U.S. government with Silicon Valley’s biggest disruptors. David Sacks, a veteran of the “PayPal Mafia,” has been tapped as the new White House AI and crypto czar. “We want to make America the clear global leader in both areas,” he has said, outlining plans to overhaul federal crypto policies. Elon Musk, Trump’s biggest donor this election cycle and his partner in overhauling government priorities, will wield unprecedented influence. From living at Mar-a-Lago to accompanying the president-elect on global visits, Elon is now co-architect of the new administration, pushing for radical changes in spending and personnel. Under Trump, Elon-backed projects are set to receive a significant boost, including a reshaped NASA led by tech billionaire Jared Isaacman, who famously partnered with SpaceX for a private spacewalk. Then there’s the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE—yes, named after Dogecoin. Co-founded by biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon, DOGE’s goal is to streamline government processes, eliminating what Musk calls “old-school inefficiency.” Crypto ties trigger ethical questions Eric’s was a business move. The president’s family’s new cryptocurrency platform, World Liberty Financial, was heavily promoted during the event. “The system turned on us, and crypto turned us back on,” he said, pointing directly at JPMorgan Chase and other banks that distanced themselves from the Trump Organization. During the conference, Eric and Steve Witkoff, Trump’s new Middle East envoy and longtime real estate associate, met with Justin Sun, a crypto executive facing fraud charges from the SEC right now. The ethical questions don’t end there. Witkoff, while working on a Middle East peace deal, also promoted World Liberty Financial at the event. His dual role as a government official and business promoter is fueling concerns over blurred lines between public service and private profit. The rise of Trump’s tech dynasty Beyond crypto, Trump’s administration is poised to be a tech-driven machine. Peter Thiel, another “PayPal Mafia” alum and longtime ally, has secured key positions for his network. Jim O’Neill, former CEO of the Thiel Foundation, is stepping in as deputy secretary of Health and Human Services. Vice President-elect JD Vance, a former venture capitalist mentored by Thiel, is expected to champion tech-friendly policies. Marc Andreessen, an internet pioneer and crypto elite, has also joined the fray, interviewing candidates for top government positions alongside Elon. Even Jeff Bezos, Elon’s famously acclaimed top rival, appears aligned with Trump’s vision. At the same time, Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman and a convicted felon pardoned during the president’s first term, is back in the mix. Speaking at Bitcoin MENA, Manafort celebrated Bitcoin’s rise and hinted at even higher prices under Trump’s leadership. “This is just the beginning,” he told the crowd.

However, even more interestingly, once the bull run kicked off in November, the digital asset experienced a huge move to the upside, with prices moving from roughly $0.5 to a high of $2.71 At press time, XRP was trading at $2.38 — marking a 305.84% gain on the monthly chart that has brought year-to-date (YTD) returns up to 287.19%. With this latest move, XRP has become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalization — ahead of Solana ( SOL ). XRP price monthly and YTD charts. Source: Finbold Although the upswing has seen a small correction, numerous analysts are quite bullish on the digital asset, with some predicting that it could even reach prices as high as $48 for a 1,888% rally . XRP is one of the cryptocurrencies with the best returns in 2024, barring meme coins — and although it occasionally sees sharp corrections, like when Ripple Labs clarified that, rumors aside, it would not be launching its long-awaited stablecoin on December 4, it remains an attractive investment. In order to get a more holistic sense of where XRP price could be headed as we reach the end of 2024, Finbold consulted one of the most powerful publicly available large language models — OpenAI’ s ChatGPT-4o for additional clarity. ChatGPT outlined the bullish and bearish factors affecting XRP When queried, the artificial intelligence tool noted four bullish factors and just as many bearish ones. In terms of potential catalysts for further growth, ChatGPT highlighted the recent approval of Ripple Labs’ stablecoin, RLUSD , which is to be pegged to the U.S. dollar as a development that could enhance utility and broaden the wider ecosystem’s appeal. The large language model also reflected on President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins, widely seen as a pro-crypto choice, for chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as an event that could lead to the dismissal of the regulatory body’s ongoing lawsuit against Ripple Labs. Finally, ChatGPT indicated that increased institutional adoption and the post-election rally were likewise bullish factors. Bullish factors affecting XRP. Source: OpenAI In contrast, on the bearish side of the aisle, OpenAI’s model observed that recent developments in the SEC case were not to Ripple’s advantage and that this fact could negatively impact XRP’s price stability. To boot, it pointed out increased volatility and short-term price declines on account of profit-taking, as well as indicators of market saturation as factors that could stymie further growth or even cause XRP prices to decrease. Bearish factors affecting XRP. Source: OpenAI Once everything was said and done, ChatGPT laid out two price targets. According to the AI model, if the bullish factors prove dominant, by the end of the year, XRP prices could reach levels as high as $3.84, which would represent a 61% upside. Conversely, in case the bearish factors prove to be stronger, ChatGPT set a price at the $2 support level, which would equate to a 16% drop from the current price of XRP.

Source: OpenAI Analysts point to promising technical analysis signals that herald more gains for XRP While interesting, it should be noted that the output of large language models — even ones as advanced as ChatGPT-4o, should not be given the same level of credence that expert analysis and personal due diligence warrant. With that in mind, cryptocurrency analysts seem to broadly agree with the AI model’s bullish assessment. On December 11, expert technical analyst Crypto Lalit pointed out the formation of a bullish flag pattern on XRP’s daily chart in an X post , which suggests that renowned bullish momentum is coming.

That's the message from the price chart and options market. The payments-focused cryptocurrency is down 10% this week. The pullback, however, has taken the shape of a bull flag. This technical analysis pattern usually slopes in the opposite direction of the preceding sharp uptrend and, more often than not, recharges bulls' engines for further gains. ""The breakout should be expected in the direction of the preceding trend, provided it is steep and sharp,"" Charles Kirkpatrick, a chartered market technician and the president of Kirkpatrick & Company, Inc, said in the book ""Technical Analysis, the Complete Resource For Finance Market Technicians."" ""Flags preceded by a rise of 90% or more have almost zero failure rate and an average return of 69%,"" Kirkpatrick added. XRP is forming a bull flag after a rally of nearly 500% to $2.9 in the four weeks to Dec. 3. An eventual breakout would mean scope for a rally to $5. The potential level is identified by adding the magnitude of the preceding uptrend to the breakout point, currently at around $2.5 in what is known as a measured height method in technical analysis terminology. Interestingly, activity is heating up in the $5 strike call options on Deribit, offering an asymmetric upside to buyers on a potential move above that level. The $5 call is the second-most traded XRP option of the past 24 hours, with a volume of 1.7 million contracts, according to data source Amberdata. (One contract represents 1 XRP). Besides, Deribit data shows the $5 call is the most popular out-of-the-money or higher strike call option with a notional open interest of $1.25 million. The increased activity indicates a bullish positioning, assuming the buyers are traders, not market makers. Still, readers might want to note that technical analysis patterns do not always work as intended, and options market positioning can flip quickly per evolving price trends. As such, tracking the broader market sentiment is pivotal.",Markets|XRP|Options|Technical Analysis,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-11 13:50:13

Popcat ( POPCAT ), the third-largest meme coin on the Solana ( SOL ) network, retreated to $1.0342, its lowest level since Oct. 24. Data from Nansen shows that the volume of Popcat coins on exchanges has increased by 7.7% over the last seven days, rising to over 223.94 million. This increase brings the total supply on exchanges to about 22.8%. Most of these coins are held on exchanges like Bybit, Kraken, Gate, and Raydium. An increase in the number of coins on exchanges is often considered a bearish signal for a cryptocurrency, as it suggests that holders may be preparing to sell. Further Nansen data reveals that the number of smart money investors holding Popcat has dropped significantly, from 85 a few months ago to 40 today. Popcat Smart Money Holdings | Source: Nansen The total balances held by these smart money investors have decreased from 2.196 million in September to 2.17 million currently, indicating that many savvy investors are taking profits or reallocating to other cryptocurrencies. Additional data shows that the number of Popcat holders is not growing. According to CoinCarp , it had 116,400 holders on Dec. 11, a small increase from a day earlier. These actions are happening as traders embrace a wait-and-see approach now that cryptocurrency prices have lost momentum. Most Solana meme coins have fallen, with the market cap for these tokens dipping from $20 billion last week to $17 billion.

Notably, the price action suggests the formation of a head-and-shoulders pattern, a commonly recognized bearish indicator. The MACD and the Relative Strength Index have tilted downwards and moved below their neutral levels. As a result, the token may continue to decline, with sellers potentially targeting the psychological level of $0.50—a drop of approximately 58% from the current price.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Ethereum’s rise continues to dominate headlines, but the spotlight is also shifting to 1Fuel, a crypto wallet redefining digital asset trading with its smart features and presale success. Table of Contents 1Fuel might just be the crypto trading platform of the future High market activity, increased network adoption boost ETH Conclusion As Ethereum continues its impressive surge, fueled by increased adoption of Layer-2 solutions, the crypto landscape is witnessing exciting new developments. Amid this backdrop, investors are buzzing about the emergence of a new crypto wallet called 1Fuel, which is redefining how digital assets are traded. With 1Fuel already capturing the attention of the majority of the DeFi market’s users with its features and fast-growing crypto presale, let’s explore why users should capitalize on this investment opportunity. 1Fuel might just be the crypto trading platform of the future Most crypto users dream of a world where trading cryptocurrency is as simple as a single click, no wallets to juggle, no hidden fees. That’s the future 1Fuel is creating. Designed for seamless and cross-chain transactions, 1Fuel takes the hassle out of trading by handling swaps in the background thereby allowing users to focus entirely on their earning goals. The platform also features a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange, allowing direct user trades without traditional fees and providing access to diverse assets. For spending, 1Fuel offers secure crypto debit cards, enabling instant crypto-to-fiat conversions and simplifying everyday purchases. Moreover, 1Fuel includes advanced privacy features such as disposable wallets and an integrated mixer for safe crypto transactions. Cold storage solutions safeguard substantial assets with secure element chips and multi-signature protocols, reducing financial risk. To power its ecosystem, 1Fuel utilizes its unique utility token, OFT, which incentivizes users. Four percent of the total supply of OFT tokens is reserved for staking rewards, allowing 1Fuel to offer up to 30% APR to enhance network security and reward long-term holders. Liquidity providers and active traders will also benefit from dedicated token allocations. High market activity, increased network adoption boost ETH Since President-elect Donald Trump’s win was announced in November 2024, Ethereum, like most other cryptos, has been witnessing green charts and high market activity. The recent spike in activity on Ethereum is a result of both technical and situational factors. On the technical side, CryptoQuant expert Burak Kesmeci reports that active addresses on the Ethereum network rose by 36% from 306,000 to 417,000 in just one month. As a result, within that month, Ethereum’s price went from $3,193 to its current value of about $3,638 (at time of writing). But the rise in active addresses is just one indicator contributing to the growing optimism surrounding Ethereum. Situational factors also play a role, particularly the increased adoption of Layer-2 networks in the crypto space. As Ethereum is a major player in this sector, the growing interest from investors in adding it to their crypto wallets and portfolios is likely driving its value upward. Conclusion While Ethereum is witnessing a good run in today’s market, many investors are already taking advantage of 1Fuel’s crypto presale and grabbing OFT tokens at just $0.01 each. Join the presale now and become part of the next generation of secure and cross-chain crypto transactions. To learn more about 1Fuel, visit the presale website, Telegram , and Twitter .

Recent developments have enhanced the network’s visibility, reliability, and overall usability, thereby contributing to the growth of the Parex ecosystem. CMC Verification: Enhancing Transparency and Accessibility Parex Network has completed the official verification process on CoinMarketCap (CMC), one of the most trusted platforms in the cryptocurrency market. Recognized for its importance in reliability and accessibility, CMC is used by millions of users worldwide to track and analyze digital assets. The CMC verification ensures that accurate, transparent information about the PRX token is readily available to everyone. Users and interested parties can easily access PRX-related data, review it, and verify its accuracy. This development reinforces Parex Network’s commitment to transparency and credibility. In addition, this verification expands Parex Network’s reach, making PRX tokens more easily trackable, analyzable, and understandable on a global scale. As a result, both the existing community and potential investors can gain clearer insights into the project. PEP20 Integration: Ease of Use and Broader Accessibility Parex Network’s PEP20 network is now active on the MEXC exchange. This integration makes PRX token transactions faster and more cost-effective, streamlining deposit and withdrawal processes for users. By prioritizing user experience, this initiative aims to increase participation within the Parex ecosystem.

The Proof of Stake mechanism of Cardano ADA has helped it host a lot of dApps and add a rigorous academic approach to its path. The real-world use cases of Cardano ADA have also helped expand its reach in the market. But in the last week, Cardano ADA has performed opposite to the climb other altcoins like Bitgert ’s $BRISE coin have taken. While Bitgert’s $BRISE coin was up by nearly 18%, Cardano ADA showed a depreciation of 20% in just a week. People are now choosing Bitgert’s $BRISE coin over Cardano ADA; let’s find out why. The Foundation of Cardano ADA Launched in 2017 by Charles Hoskinson, Cardano ADA quickly formed an image as a sustainable and innovative blockchain in the world. The hosting of dApps and the adoption of smart contracts made Cardano ADA a neck-to-neck competitor to Ethereum. The Alonzo hard fork and Shelley upgrade also helped in carving the success of Cardano ADA in the market. However, the current approach of Cardano ADA has not been as innovation-hungry and rapid as it was earlier. Cardano ADA struggles with transaction speed issues, while Bitgert’s BRISE chain seems to have solved them. Let’s see how Bitgert has overtaken Cardano ADA in its own game. Bitgert’s Rise and Forming a Strong Community While Cardano ADA has been struggling in the market, Bitgert’s $BRISE coin has dropped a zero in its pricing in just a few days. Bitgert’s growing popularity is fueled by its community and strong ecosystem. Bitgert ’s BRISE chain offers transactions at a near-zero fee and a 100k TPS speed. Also, in-house projects like PayBrise, Web3 Real Estate Marketplace, P2P marketplace, BrisePump, AI Audit Platform, etc., add more users and audiences to the network. Bitgert handles over 2.5k transactions daily, with more than 189k holders of Bitgert’s $BRISE coin. The numbers for Bitgert’s $BRISE coin are rising in every sense, with a hike of about 43% in pricing. Bitgert also takes care of its community by answering their queries on their handles and organizing innovative competitions for user engagement. Conclusion Bitgert’s $BRISE coin is performing stupendously as opposed to the current performance of Cardano ADA. According to the current analytics, Bitgert’s $BRISE coin may even give 100x gains to investors, as it did for early-stage investors. Bitgert’s $BRISE coin is getting strong support from the market, which its RSI index, MACD level, and the moving average suggest. So, if you are wondering which token to invest in at the current stage, then going with Bitgert’s $BRISE coin over Cardano ADA will be a profitable choice. Grab your own $BRISE token at Gate.io , KuCoin , MEXC , and Pancakeswap ! Step 1: Register on the exchange Step 2: Choose your payment method Step 3: Buy $BRISE For more info, visit bitgert.com .

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address – C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-11 14:11:00

Table of Contents Lightchain AI vs. the new altcoin solution What’s the appeal of the altcoin? Potential insights Lightchain AI sets the bar higher Final thoughts Cryptocurrency is no stranger to innovation, and the search for the “next Bitcoin” is ongoing. A new coin enters the conversation. But is it truly the game-changer it claims to be, or is there a deeper story to uncover? Before we get to that, let’s talk about Lightchain AI, an ecosystem already redefining blockchain innovation and artificial intelligence. Lightchain AI Presale is now live. Lightchain AI has brought major improvements to blockchain technology, combining artificial intelligence innovations like the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). Unlike anything else in the market, Lightchain AI doesn’t just accelerate blockchain adoption; it magnifies its functionality with real-world AI applications. With tools actively transforming decentralized governance, scalability, and privacy-focused AI tasks, this is a key player. But let’s explore the potential of the hidden gem while comparing it to the capabilities already offered by Lightchain AI. Lightchain AI vs. the new altcoin solution The altcoin we’re reviewing today is making waves for its application of unique tokenomics. However, while it has captured attention with its speculative trading markets and a small but enthusiastic developer backing, it’s hard to overlook the ecosystem Lightchain AI is building. Lightchain AI creates a foundation that addresses scalability, security, and AI-specific tasks, areas where many new altcoins fall short. Why Lightchain AI stands out: Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Unlike standard Proof of Stake or Proof of Work mechanisms, PoI rewards nodes for contributing AI computations like model training and inference, offering far more real-world value. AI Virtual Machine (AIVM): A next-gen computational layer enabling developers to build advanced dApps with ease, none of the clunky hurdles other altcoins experience. Transparent and Auditable AI Frameworks: Ensures trust and accountability for AI governance decisions within a decentralized network. With these core mechanisms in mind, Lightchain AI fosters an ecosystem where utility outpaces hype in defining value. You might also like: Solana hits new highs as Lightchain AI aims to be the next big contender What’s the appeal of the altcoin? The altcoin gem we’ve come across primarily markets itself as an alternative store of value rather than a direct Bitcoin competitor. Its limited supply and attention from influencers in the crypto space have led to a price surge that is turning heads. For traders looking for short-term gains, this altcoin is an attractive speculative option. However, outside of its scarcity model and dedicated community marketing, its fundamental utility compared to platforms like Lightchain AI is limited. While Lightchain AI operates with foresight into practical application and governance frameworks, this altcoin remains a speculative play with unresolved scalability issues. Key weaknesses of the altcoin Scalability challenges: The network experiences bottlenecks, potentially leading to performance issues if adoption grows rapidly. Limited use cases: Apart from trading, real-world applications remain elusive, something Lightchain AI has already resolved with AIVM and AI-driven dApp capabilities. Uncertain longevity: Unlike Lightchain AI’s developer-focused ecosystem with long-term roadmaps, this altcoin lacks depth in its operational vision. Potential insights Here’s something to ponder—investors should always align their crypto investments with tangible utility. This altcoin, while intriguing, raises questions about whether it offers anything new long-term or if it’s another fleeting sensation. Consider opportunities like Lightchain AI, which champions innovation over speculation, ensuring it serves both tech-focused developers and value-seeking investors alike. Now is the perfect time to review where users’ crypto portfolio is headed. Explore the Lightchain AI Presale and secure discounted tokens before the first stage ends. It’s an investment into the future possibilities of blockchain intertwined with AI-functional applications.

Consider this: Altcoins can dazzle with marketing but fade in utility. Projects like Lightchain AI are building frameworks that make blockchain genuinely indispensable. Final thoughts It’s indisputable that cryptocurrency is an exciting and volatile field. While altcoins like this latest “hidden gem” can entice with soaring short-term gains, the long-term potential often lies with platforms driving innovation and solving real-world problems—just like Lightchain AI.

Speaking during the Abu Dhabi Finance Week in the United Arab Emirates, the founder of the world’s biggest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, warned about the unsustainable amounts of debt in major economies, stressing his preference for “hard money” such as Bitcoin and gold. “I want to steer away from debt assets like bonds and debt and have some hard money like gold and Bitcoin,” he quipped, as reported on Dec. 10 by the South China Morning Post . Dalio argued that besides Germany, other nations like the US and China have witnessed indebtedness grow at “unprecedented levels”. In his opinion, it’s “impossible for these countries to be able to not have a debt crisis” in the coming years that will lead to a huge money devaluation. Ray Dalio’s Complicated Relationship With Bitcoin Dalio, one of the globe’s wealthiest men, has historically held both positive and negative sentiments about BTC. “I don’t think digital currencies will succeed in the way people hope they would,” he posited in 2020, citing inherent volatility, limited use cases, and a lack of government control. He first admitted owning some Bitcoin back in May 2021. But despite describing Bitcoin as “one hell of an invention”, Dalio claimed that the flagship crypto could end up being killed by the government if it became too successful . Later the same year, the billionaire’s stance softened somewhat as he asserted that Bitcoin was “the younger generation’s alternative” to gold. In 2022, the billionaire investor recommended a 1% to 2% Bitcoin allocation for investor portfolios. Back then, Dalio lauded BTC for its resilience against hacks and stated that it had no better challenger in the market. But in Feb. 2023, he said during a CNBC interview that he doesn’t like Bitcoin. “It’s not going to be an effective money,” he opined at the time, adding: “It’s not an effective storehold of wealth. It’s not an effective medium of exchange.” Bitcoin hit an all-time high last week of $103,679 after breaching the long-anticipated $100,000 milestone .

BTC's value dropped from over $100,000 to $92,000 within 12 hours on Monday, erasing $1.7 billion in leveraged positions from nearly 584,000 traders . However, it has since rebounded, trading above $98,000, with a 2% increase today to $98,661. Bitcoin Market Seeing Drop in LeverageAmid the recovery, market data indicates a slowdown in volatility and a notable reduction in leverage across exchanges. According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, the BTC-USDT perpetual futures estimated leverage ratio has been steadily declining. https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1866787839901569380This ratio, which measures the amount of leverage used in futures trading, fell from 0.511 on Dec. 8 to the current figure of 0.462. The recent ratio further represents a 24% drop from the 0.608 peak recorded on Nov. 21. BTC Estimated Futures Leverage Ratio for the USDT Pair Across All Exchanges BTC Estimated Futures Leverage Ratio for the USDT Pair Across All Exchanges Ju noted that open interest in BTC-USDT futures has decreased by 7% from its recent high, while exchange-held USDT balances have risen by 32% over the past month. Additionally, data shows that ERC-20 USDT tokens on exchanges have surged by 68% since Nov. 1, growing from 23.27 billion to 39.17 billion. This inflow of USDT on exchanges could provide more collateral if market participants use it for futures trading.Notably, the recent reduction in leverage implies fewer high-risk positions, decreasing the likelihood of sharp price swings from liquidations. Meanwhile, the influx of USDT suggests increased buying power, which could fuel further price gains as traders deploy funds.Liquidation Trends Reflect Price RecoveryIn addition, recent data from Coinglass shows that liquidation volumes are declining, with short positions now facing more liquidations than long positions. Liquidation Data Coinglass Liquidation Data | Coinglass Over the last 12 hours, $92.41 million worth of positions were liquidated, with short positions accounting for 60.8% of this amount, or $56.21 million. In contrast, long positions accounted for $36.20 million. This suggests a market recovery, as bullish sentiment begins to strengthen.Analysts Hold Mixed Bitcoin Recovery OutlooksMeanwhile, market analysts and traders hold varying perspectives on Bitcoin's next moves. Ali Martinez, a prominent analyst, pointed out a cup-and-handle pattern on Bitcoin's weekly chart. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1866517510268330035He has maintained his optimism, predicting that Bitcoin could reach $275,000 if this pattern plays out. The analyst advised traders to buy dips and avoid excessive leverage to minimize risk.Meanwhile, crypto trader XO stressed the importance of Bitcoin holding the $90,000–$91,000 range. He suggested that losing this range could lead to a pullback to $85,000–$87,000. However, XO leans toward continued price compression in the near term.Interestingly, as BTC looks to recover, CryptoQuant analyst Mignolet highlighted that Coinbase's spot market dominance remains relatively low, despite the exchange's major role earlier this year. Following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January, Coinbase saw increased dominance, driving market gains during that period. However, during the latest rally in September and October, Coinbase's influence declined, and it has not rebounded massively since.Mignolet emphasized that while Coinbase liquidity remains important, Binance appears to be the more critical source of market liquidity driving the current rally.",Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2024-12-11 15:22:11

Solana Analysis, Trends, and New Rival JetBolt",https://nulltx.com/solana-price-forecast-sol-to-400-solana-analysis-trends-and-new-rival-jetbolt/,"Solana (SOL) currently trades at $219.75 after a sharp pullback from its all-time high of $263.83, sparking debates on whether SOL is headed for a $400 breakout. As Solana’s staking activity surpasses 400 million tokens, the confidence in its network remains. Meanwhile, a next-gen altcoin is also headlining recent crypto news: JetBolt (JBOLT), with its successful presale turning heads and whales snapping up tokens. Will Solana’s next move break the $400 barrier, or will SOL stall below key resistance levels as new competitors like JetBolt heat up the crypto race? What’s driving JetBolt’s meteoric rise? Let’s dive into the numbers and trends behind Solana and JetBolt, and what it means for these two major crypto players. Solana’s $400 Question: Is SOL Headed for Breakout or Breakdown? Breaking news in the crypto world focuses on Solana (SOL) and its ability to break the $400 mark. Currently trading at $219.75, Solana has faced sharp corrections from its monthly high of $263.83, which was achieved just a few weeks ago. Over the past week, Solana has experienced a sharp drop from $240 to near $210, followed by a modest recovery to $219. 7-day Solana (SOL) price chart from CoinMarketCap showing a drop from $240 to $210 and recovery to $219 Crypto analysts are also eyeing these key technical insights for SOL : Resistance Levels Immediate resistance at $240. Secondary resistance at $280 and $300. Support Levels Critical support at $210. Lower support zones at $194 and $183. Indicators Breaking the 26-day EMA at $229 could signal bullish momentum. A failure to hold above $210 could lead to further declines. Meanwhile, Solana’s ecosystem shows strong resilience, with over 400 million tokens staked, totaling nearly $100 billion in value. Additionally, Solana’s DEX trading volume recently surpassed $100 billion in a single month, doubling Ethereum’s during the same period. Regulatory prospects also add intrigue, as discussions around a spot Solana ETF gain momentum. Although approvals remain pending, expectations are high for possible regulatory clarity in 2025, which could provide a major boost to Solana’s market appeal. While Solana’s long-term outlook remains bullish, whether it can reach $400 depends on favorable market conditions and continued ecosystem growth. For now, Solana holders remain cautiously optimistic. Meanwhile, JetBolt (JBOLT) is making waves on its own in the crypto world with its groundbreaking technology and impressive blockchain capabilities, igniting excitement across the market.

Bitcoin's performance in the ongoing cycle, which began after hitting bottom in November 2022, shows notable changes in return on investment (ROI) and market volatility, according to data shared by the on-chain analytics firm.The data compares the current cycle with the previous two bull markets, highlighting a transition in Bitcoin's behavior as it matures into a larger, more stable asset class.Bitcoin Seeing Least ROIFor example, from Bitcoin's bottom in 2015 to the end of the cycle in 2018, it registered a 5.90X (590%) growth during that bull season.The subsequent cycle, from 2018 to 2022, saw even more impressive gains, with Bitcoin registering a 10.47X (1,047%) price growth from the lows to the highs.In contrast, in the current cycle, where Bitcoin bottomed at around $15K in late 2022, it has so far registered a 598% price growth, based on its recent all-time high of $104K. According to Glassnode, this cycle is 26.94% below the average growth of the last two cycles.Bitcoin Volatility Eases, Experiencing the Least Volatile CycleMeanwhile, regarding market volatility, the current cycle also stands out for its relative stability. When comparing drawdowns or peak-to-trough declines in price, Bitcoin's volatility has significantly decreased. For instance, the average drawdown in the current cycle is -7.68%, much lower than the -16.24% average across all cycles.Likewise, the maximum drawdown has been -26.25% since 2022, compared to a dramatic -71.15% drawdown during the 2011-2013 cycle.This marks Bitcoin's least volatile cycle to date, suggesting that the market is becoming more resilient and less prone to extreme price swings.Bitcoin Seen as a More Stable and Institutionalized Asset ClassAccording to Glassnode, the combination of lower ROI and smaller drawdowns points to Bitcoin's gradual transformation into a more stable, institutionalized asset. These metrics suggest that Bitcoin is no longer as volatile as it once was, a crucial factor for attracting traditional investors and institutional players who demand more stability. https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1866787722377171408Essentially, Glassnode's analysis underscores Bitcoin's growing maturity as an asset class. While it may not produce the astronomical returns of previous cycles, it demonstrates resilience amid an increasingly standardized and regulated market environment.",Market|Trending Now|Bitcoin Price Prediction|BTC|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2024-12-11 15:24:27

Ripple All Set To Storm Stablecoin Market The regulatory green light, as Ripple boss Brad Garlinghouse revealed, follows months of review, positioning Ripple for the impending mainnet launch of RLUSD. In a post on X, Garlinghouse announced, “This just in… we have final approval from NYDFS for $RLUSD!” This just means that the highly-anticipated dollar-pegged token will soon be listed on major exchanges. Ripple first announced plans for the stablecoin back in April to directly challenge the dominance of Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. Notably, USDT and USDC currently dominate the nearly $200 billion stablecoin sector. Ripple executives projected the stablecoin could reach a market capitalization of $2 trillion by 2028. RLUSD, designed as a 1:1 US dollar-backed stablecoin, will be backed by USD deposits, short-term US government treasuries, and other cash equivalents. The company started testing RLUSD on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August. Then, in October, Ripple announced partnerships with exchanges, including Uphold, Bitstamp, Bitso, MoonPay, CoinMENA, and Bullish. Ripple strives to leverage both RLUSD and XRP to boost its cross-border payment solutions. Garlinghouse said in September that Ripple planned to have RLUSD focus on institutional players. The price of XRP jumped 10% following the RLUSD approval announcement, erasing Tuesday’s losses where it slipped below $2 for the first time since Dec. 1. The forth-largest cryptocurrency was trading hands for $2.34 as of publication time, according to CoinGecko . Besides helping Ripple enter the fast-growing stablecoin market, RLUSD could also help boost XRP’s price to the much-coveted $5 threshold. It’s currently down just over 31% from its all-time high of $3.40, set in January 2018.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|USDT|XRP|USDC,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-11 15:25:37

Tron eyes bullish reversal after significant price dump Tron suffered price stagnation for the longest time in the crypto space. However, Tron was able to find its momentum when the market was generally pumping. The altcoin set a $0.4407 all-time high recently, yielding over 100% profit within a month. However, Tron has failed to defend this price gain. The altcoin has fallen significantly below its all-time high, with the latest crypto news putting Tron’s dump at 41% since hitting a new all-time high. Tron trades at $0.25 currently but hopes to return to the $0.40 price zone again. The crypto coin will have to overcome current downward pressure before it can experience any bullish run. The market is expected to recover in Q1 2025, and Tron may recover as well. However, analysts do not expect Tron to set a new all-time high in the first quarter of the new year, even though it may rally toward $0.40. SUI eyes $5 in Q1 2025 despite current bear run At some point this year, SUI was listed among the best crypto purchases in 2024. The crypto coin performed excellently this year, moving from an under $1 token in Q1 to a $4.47 all-time in Q4. SUI reached a new all-time high on the 6th of December, but currently battles bear pressure. The token dipped 19% from its peak price, currently trading around $3.64. Despite the current dip, investors are still bullish on SUI . They believe SUI is a high-performing altcoin when the market conditions are good. Hence, many have decided to HODL. Analysis shows that SUI could reward investors’ patience in Q1 2025. SUI could hit $5 soon, making it one to watch out for. Conclusion Tron and SUI look to regain their bullish momentum, but investors are more optimistic about SUI . However, experts have placed 1Fuel above both altcoins, naming it a potential high-rewarding token. 1Fuel is projected to do 1000x by 2025, and investors can gain from it by joining the presale now.

Meanwhile, the Mean Dollar Invested Age is quietly pointing to heightened network activity, often seen as a precursor to extended bullish trends. Despite a market-wide retracement this week, the Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA) – an often-overlooked crypto metric – signals potential bullish momentum across key assets. Bitcoin’s MDIA has dropped 31% over the past 60 weeks, currently standing at 439 days. XRP’s MDIA has decreased by 22% in just 14 weeks, now at 865 days. Meanwhile, Dogecoin shows the sharpest decline, with its MDIA falling 31% to 370 days over the past eight weeks. This downward trend in MDIA highlights increasing activity from dormant wallets, particularly those of large stakeholders, as older coins re-enter circulation. Historically, this trend has preceded sustained bull markets, with similar patterns observed before the 2017 and 2021 rallies. While short-term price fluctuations are inevitable, this metric lends confidence to mid and long-term bullish outlooks for the crypto market. “Dormant coins are still moving aggressively, validating long-term bull market is still active.. especially for Bitcoin, XRP, and Dogecoin.” What’s Next For Bitcoin and Dogecoin? The MDIA figures follow a period of significant turbulence for Bitcoin, marked by billions of dollars in liquidations. The retail selling spree during this period, however, coincided with aggressive institutional buying, especially by the US investors, which signaled a bullish sentiment despite the crypto trading below the coveted $100,000 mark. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is trading near $0.42 after a 4% surge over the past day. Experts suggest that the OG meme coin could finally kick off an uptrend following the latest pullback. Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez, for one, has shared an optimistic outlook on Dogecoin’s bull cycle, suggesting it is still in its early stages. He said that the base target remains at $3 and a more ambitious projection of $18 if market conditions become extraordinarily bullish. What’s Going to Drive XRP? According to Arthur Azizov, CEO of B2BINPAY, getting final approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services to launch RLUSD is a game-changer. This could potentially attract even greater investor interest in XRP. In a conversation with CryptoPotato , the exec said, “Already, RLUSD is being viewed as a potential competitor to USDT and USDC. If, as planned, RLUSD is issued on the XRP Ledger, it could provide an additional boost to XRP’s growth. Ripple’s distributed ledger technology is increasingly being recognized by banks and financial institutions, driving new partnerships and a growing demand for its solutions. Given Ripple’s trajectory and the potential of XRP, I anticipate that XRP could trade within the range of $5 to $7 during the first half of 2025.” The post What Does MDIA Tell Us About XRP, DOGE, and BTC’s Upcoming Trends? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|DOGEBTC|DOGEUSD|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Dogecoin|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-11 15:27:11

Notably, the sentiment was originally shared by Digital G, a market commentator, amid the ongoing market turbulence. For context, XRP has been a victim of the latest market correction, which wiped out over $1.7 billion in leverage positions from nearly 584,000 traders .Data suggests that XRP faced one of the worst selloff campaigns for any cryptocurrency, especially on Coinbase. This triggered a massive 14.87% price collapse on Monday, with the altcoin closing the day at the lower end of the $2 price region.XRP Represents an Opportunity for Generational WealthAmid these troubles, XRP has shown impressive resilience, which has helped to maintain optimism around it. As confidence in its potential prevails, Digital G, who was a regulated fund manager in the U.K., recently pointed out the importance of an investment in XRP.He admitted that XRP represents one of the greatest opportunities for any investor to secure generational wealth. Moreover, he believes the two other cryptocurrencies with such potential are Stellar (XLM), an XRP rival, and XDC Network (XDC).Interestingly, Wall Street analyst Linda P. Jones, a vocal XRP proponent, agreed with the commentary. According to her, she authored a book on the assets and how such investments could help investors build life-changing wealth. The wealth mentor was possibly referring to her bestseller “3 Steps to Quantum Wealth.”https://twitter.com/LindaPJones/status/1866095076033646939Interestingly, all three assets focus on helping retail and institutions carry out efficient cross-border payments and financial transactions by providing fast, low-cost, and scalable solutions for transferring value.XRP, XLM and XDC Potential Digital G’s sentiment is possibly due to the fact that these cryptocurrencies, especially XRP, have ecosystems looking to solve real-world problems in finance, such as remittances and settlement, and have partnerships with banks, governments, and enterprises.While they underperformed in previous years, their recent price action confirms the potential for growth. For instance, XRP is up by more than 303% since November, while XLM has gained 448%. Also, XDC has skyrocketed 175% within the same timeframe.As a result, several market analysts have presented lofty targets for these tokens. Recently, market analyst EGRAG argued that XRP was following Tesla’s 2018 trajectory, forecasting a 50% dump before a 3,500% uptick above $40. Meanwhile, last month, Charting Guy, a market commentator, called attention to a bullish price structure on the 1-month XLM chart which he believes could lead to a rally to $5. Earlier this month, Javon Marks set a breakout target of $0.1814 for XDC.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XDC|XLM News|XRP Price Prediction,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XLM|XRP|XDC,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2024-12-11 15:28:25

In a new interview on Fox Business, Peirce argues that the first step is to stop trying to prevent crypto from accessing the services it needs to move forward, like custody. “Point two is provide clarity around which things are not within the SEC’s ambit. So which things are not securities and which people don’t have to think about the SEC’s regulatory framework.” Peirce, a Republican, says the third step is for regulators to work with crypto firms to determine where existing regulations apply and “where adjustments need to be made.” “And that needs to be a group exercise. That needs to be done in the public so that everyone can participate in it. And I think we can get to a good place and do that relatively quickly. I mean all of these things do take time, but I think if we put our minds to it we can get to a better place, and I’m hoping that won’t take too long.” Peirce and fellow Republican SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda have often criticized SEC Chair Gary Gensler for his active approach toward the crypto sector. Both have also dissented against multiple SEC enforcement actions. Under Gensler’s leadership, the securities watchdog launched high-profile enforcement actions against many crypto firms, including industry giants Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, Ripple Labs, Uniswap Labs and Consensys. After Donald Trump’s election victory last month, Gensler announced he would step down in January, on the president-elect’s inauguration day. The SEC chair’s term was set to run until 2026.

Crying Kamala (CRYKAMA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CRYKAMA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Crying Kamala can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crying Kamala could become the next viral memecoin. Crying Kamala launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crying Kamala on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crying Kamala by entering its contract address – 5eCJhSGBUN4YwJHLU9ZcWjrjmoufVznjzNBHfo4TN1P7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRYKAMA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-11 15:49:39

The resolution sets out to unify the region’s crypto asset regulation in conformity with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. Hon Ng, Bitget’s Chief Legal Officer, explained his goal asserting, “By establishing a hub in the European Union, we are demonstrating our strong commitment to uphold the highest standards of security and compliance.” Bitget’s European expansions follow a recent UK partnership. It also holds licenses in major markets such as Poland, Australia, and Italy. Bitget European entry preparation in detail The company has stated that it is currently preparing for compliance with the MiCA framework. Part of the plans is to establish an office in Lithuania and recruit compliance and operations personnel. Additionally, the organization stated that it intends to establish a close partnership with European regulators to guarantee that its products satisfy all regulatory mandates. As the MiCA framework is implemented, Bitget’s preparations will enable it to grow quickly as a compliant exchange. Hon Ng made a statement, “We truly appreciate EU regulatory authorities for their leadership and vision for nurturing a secure and vibrant environment for digital innovation.” He added, “Our vision for Europe goes beyond business expansion. The continent is at the forefront of the crypto revolution, and we are committed to contributing to its growing ecosystem of crypto startups.” Bitget’s crypto registration is now secured in Lithuania, which indicates its commitment to operating securely and transparently within Europe. Bitget’s goals for the Europe and MiCA initiative The European Union’s community policies are quite advantageous for traders. When the requisite precautions are taken, they are also suitable for crypto platforms. According to Bitget, MiCA will enhance the legitimacy and stability of crypto markets by establishing more transparent regulations. This would allow companies to develop new crypto technologies and services with greater confidence, potentially positioning the EU as a global innovation center in the blockchain and crypto sector. The EU’s regulations have included measures to safeguard consumers from fraud, schemes, and market manipulation. These will ultimately promote a greater sense of confidence in the crypto markets, thereby encouraging more individuals to invest and participate. However, there will be restrictions on certain stablecoins, which could affect the liquidity of the crypto market. Still, one outcome of this trend could be the euro’s potential expansion on crypto exchanges or the introduction of new stablecoins on the euro, such as EUR Convertible (EURCV) by Société Générale, which has already been introduced on the European exchange, Bitstamp. Ultimately, a significant number of European investors and speculators may opt for authorized platforms that are more in compliance with regulations, particularly if crypto assets begin to appear on well-known stock trading platforms. Lastly, it is important to note that this has not yet occurred, as Switzerland, which is not a member of the EU, has been the primary European center for the crypto industry. Bitget’s pending operations Bitget stated that it is currently in the process of obtaining regulatory approvals in over 15 jurisdictions worldwide. Recently, Bitget established a strategy to settle in the US under President-elect Donald Trump. BitGet CEO Gracy Chen said , “We are revisiting a US strategy, although we have not decided on anything yet.” Although Trump’s crypto regulations are not clear in the US, newcomers still have the anxiety to deal with a mess of state-based licenses and different government agencies. Gracy Chen explained a solution they could consider, “If we had a local partner who has many of those licenses already, then we could do a joint venture, for example.

Fwog, SPX6900 and Goatseus Maximus are not available in NL, ES, IE, BE, IT, DE . Here’s some more information about this asset: Fwog ( FWOG ) is a frog-themed memecoin, born out of the rebrand of a failing project (Flog the Frog, or FLOG). When the original team fell out of favor with the community, the community took it upon themselves to relaunch the project. The Solana-based FWOG token has little utility, deriving its value primarily from the strength of its community and memetic appeal. SPX6900 ( SPX ) is a memecoin rallying against the S&P500, on a mission to overtake this traditional financial index. Traders can access the SPX6900 token across several blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Solana and Base. Like other memecoins, the SPX token does not have any ‘official’ utility — though it can be transferred and held on all supported chains. Goatseus Maximus ( GOAT ) is a memecoin created by an autonomous AI agent ( Truth Terminal ) that developed an obsession with the obscure “goatse” Internet meme. Launched on Solana with the help of the agent’s founder, the token hit a market capitalization of over $1b in a month. The GOAT token has no utility, but it can be transferred between Solana wallets.

Bitcoin has had a volatile week, briefly peaking at $100,400 on Monday before dropping below $94,400. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is recovering toward the $100K level again, highlighting ongoing market fluctuations.Remarkably, large-scale Bitcoin holders, commonly known as whales, demonstrated notable activity amid this price movement.342 New Bitcoin Wallets Created by Whales Amid DipMarket data revealed that 342 new wallets holding more than 100 Bitcoin were created during the recent price decline. In particular, these wallets emerged as Bitcoin dropped from $104,000 to the $90K region. Analysts observed that this trend aligns with the broader behavior of whales, who historically capitalize on price dips to bolster their holdings. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1866829285815882134Despite market volatility, the stable proportion of Bitcoin held by whales, as indicated in a chart by IntoTheBlock , points to long-term confidence among these investors. According to the market intelligence platform, whale holdings remained unchanged over the past 30 days.Mixed Activity Among Investors and RetailMeanwhile, the investor category saw significant activity growth over the past month, with holdings among mid-tier investors increasing by 2.69%. This suggests growing market participation and accumulation by these holders.In contrast, retail participants, who dominate Bitcoin's ecosystem, experienced a slight decline in holdings. Their share decreased by 0.23%, indicating reduced activity or minor sell-offs among smaller holders. Bitcoin Addresses Activity Bullish Patterns and Price ProjectionsAmid these developments, technical analysis provided a positive outlook for Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Ali Martinez highlighted a bullish cup-and-handle pattern, a known precursor to significant price breakouts. The chart depicted Bitcoin’s gradual recovery from its 2022 low of $15,200 to its recent highs, completing the cup formation. The subsequent consolidation between $50,000 and $70,000 formed the handle, culminating in a breakout above $69,000 in late 2024. Martinez’s analysis projected Bitcoin’s price to reach $275,000 based on this pattern.Separately, Messari founder Ryan Selkis cited Bitcoin’s MVRV z-score to signal further upside potential. The current z-score of 3, well below the historical market top range of 7-10, supports Selkis’s assertion of significant room for growth. Specifically, Selkis stated he would not consider selling Bitcoin until it hits. $180K",Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|BTC|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2024-12-11 15:52:44

Altcoins could use a Christmas miracle,https://blockworks.co/news/hope-for-altcoin-santa-rally,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Brutal week so far for altcoins. In the stock market, you generally look for a Santa Claus rally at the end of December into early January as a nice, green way to close out the year and welcome a new chapter. Whether we could see a similar thing in crypto is still up in the air. Right now it’s looking iffy. On the upside, altcoin leverage managed to hold through Dec. 5, but Monday saw the biggest daily long liquidation event since May 2021, as K33 analysts noted. Ouch. “Ever since the election, long bets have been rewarded. This dynamic allowed open interest to accumulate with a steadily growing long concentration. This growth is evident by looking at total open interest in altcoins relative to the total altcoin market cap,” they wrote. “This metric grew from 3.57% to 4.42% from the election until December 9, amidst a very high funding rate environment in December. [Monday’s] liquidation cascade saw altcoin leverage plunge by $12.8bn, reducing the relative altcoin leverage to 3.96%.” A look at open interest in altcoins To put those metrics into perspective, altcoin open interest marked the “biggest relative decline in altcoin leverage since the FTX collapse.” BitOoda analysts, following Monday’s sell-off, said that they expect more “sideways trading through year-end marked by periods of low liquidity and choppy price action.” And we very well may see that given the highly leveraged products and “exaggerated” price action moves. The good news, however, is that while this is a decently sized bump in the road, it doesn’t sound like it’s impacting the bullish 2025 outlook shared lately by many.

Another State Takes Action on Bitcoin (BTC) Reserves!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/states-in-the-us-are-competing-another-state-takes-action-on-bitcoin-btc-reserves/,"As we wonder whether Donald Trump will deliver on his promise of a strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve for the United States, the idea of adopting Bitcoin at the state level is gaining momentum. At this point the last news came from Alabama. Alabama state auditor Andrew Sorrell has proposed the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Sorrell urged Alabama residents to adopt the BTC reserve to protect them from inflation and the economic risks of global de-dollarization. Sorrell said that Bitcoin's value is not affected by the US dollar, that it will strengthen the US balance sheet and that it can be used as collateral for future debt issuances. “A well-balanced portfolio should include exposure to many different asset classes. As of now, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are a $3 trillion asset class that the state has zero exposure to. “It is also the fastest growing asset class with the greatest potential for price appreciation. Investing in Treasuries and bonds is certainly worthwhile. But earning 4% when inflation is 2.7% is only a clean slate.” Satoshi Action Fund co-founder Dennis Porter explained the potential consequences of such a move from Alabama and the US in particular: “The adoption of a strategic Bitcoin reserve would greatly escalate the supply-demand crisis. As more institutions and governments compete for Bitcoin, supply will continue to decrease, putting upward pressure on prices.” Porter also stated that he predicted that a ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’ would be created by a G7 member country and a BRICS member country by the end of 2025. Porter stated that in 2026, the remaining members will fall like dominoes regarding the Bitcoin reserve. https://twitter.com/Dennis_Porter_/status/1866679906484326544 *This is not investment advice.

Alchemy Pay ( ACH ) notes that the layer-1 blockchain will be dubbed Alchemy Chain and built on the Solana (SOL) Virtual Machine architecture. Per an announcement on Dec. 11, the new L1 will offer a payment system allowing users to transact with fiat and crypto. The platform will also offer a user-friendly ecosystem bridging on-chain and off-chain processes, chain abstraction, a stablecoin revenue mechanism, and yield generation. Additionally, the blockchain network will integrate a layer-2 solution, as outlined in the company’s blog post.

Such a setup, for all the optimism, might make finding the right digital assets to invest in in 2025 tougher as across-the-board higher prices indicate that – barring a true parabolic market-wide rally – many cryptocurrencies are likely to offer far more modest gains. Still, many will likely continue surging, with even the biggest names in the sector, such as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and XRP , likely generating millionaires, particularly should they hit some of their most bullish price targets of $250,000 and $48 , respectively. Assuming 2025 proves another strong year, however, savvy investors might find even more wealth trading some of the slightly more overlooked digital assets, and Finbold elected to examine two strong trades for the New Year. Hedera (HBAR) Hedera ( HBAR ), the token of a platform focused on providing somewhat unconventional solutions to the issues of blockchain transaction speed, security, and scalability using the ‘ Hashgraph’ consensus algorithm, had recorded massive gains since early November. The surge, though on a hiatus at press time, is likely to continue into 2025 due to numerous recent positive developments, including Canary Capital’s November filing for a spot exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) and an active role in real-world asset tokenization. The ETF could prove a particularly powerful catalyst, as the mere act of filing raised the cryptocurrency’s prominence, and recent electoral and regulatory developments indicate approval is relatively likely to come next year. Furthermore, HBAR’s recent performance – a 20.74% correction from the December 6 highs near $0.37 to the press time price of $0.29 – that followed an extraordinarily 433.91% rise in the last 30 days demonstrates both the token’s rally potential and the fact traders are likely, at press time, facing a ‘buy the dip’ opportunity making it easier to turn $100 into $1,000. HBAR 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold Stellar (XLM) Stellar ( XLM ) has been in the news more and more in recent weeks for a good reason: its swings are remarkably similar yet stronger than those of XRP. Specifically, XLM first experienced a 500.84% rally between early November and December, taking it from $0.09307 to $0.5592. Within the same time frame, XRP rocketed 346.27% from $0.51314 to $2.29. Furthermore, the subsequent correction has also been greater as Stellar dropped 10.43% in the last 7 days to its press time price of $0.43188, while XRP’s downturn amounted to 4.33%. XLM 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold Much like HBAR, investors seeking to enter an XLM position may have a great opportunity on December 11 as the recent downturn not only means the cryptocurrency is relatively cheap compared to recent highs but has significantly cooled off its relative strength index ( RSI ), from ‘overbought’ peaks above 90 to 53.68. Also similar to Hedera, Stellar is benefitting from increased institutional exposure through Grayscale Investments LLC’s Stellar Lumens Trust – a tailwind that has been strong in late 2024 and is likely to grow stronger in 2025 given the general trend toward greater digital assets acceptance and adoption. Finally, should XLM continue outperforming XRP by a similar margin – and should XRP reach the most bullish of expert expectations – a rally all the way up to $9 could illuminate the token in 2025.

Notably, top cryptocurrencies like Near protocol (NEAR) and Litecoin (LTC) have made quite some progress in the past month with both registering over 60% price surge. However, established altcoins are not the only beneficiary of the current bull market as there has been a growing interest in the presale market. Specifically, fast-rising presale stars like Lunex network (LNEX) have gained recognition for their innovation and rapid adoption. With nearly $5M raised so far, Lunex Network has been projected to complete a 100x price rally during this bull cycle. Lunex Network’s Rapid Presale Progress Attracts Growing Interests Given its rapid progression in the presale market, Lunex Network (LNEX) has become a centre of attraction for many crypto investors. However, more importantly, Lunex network is gaining recognition because of its innovative DeFi iteration that streamlines the transaction processes involved in cross-chain crypto transactions. Essentially, the DeFi platform allows users to swap and transfer over 50K crypto assets in a single process. Beyond the ease of transaction, Lunex Network ensures that users do not require any KYC nor third-party wallets, thus enhancing both security and convenience for all users. Moreso, the DeFi protocol adopts a revenue-sharing mechanism that allocates a portion of the platform’s revenue to active community members and token holders. Furthermore, Lunex Network aims to revolutionize the DeFi market by providing RPC nodes for Web3 development. This distinct innovation, coupled with its institutional-grade B2B merchant payment gateway and portfolio tracking features has bolstered investor confidence in its ability to actually rally 100x this bull run. Currently, $LNEX, Lunex Network’s native token is currently selling at $0.0038 per token, with projection to reach $0.50 this bull cycle. Near Protocol Attempts to Stabilize Above $8 Amid Price Rally Near Protocol (NEAR) ranks among the list of top crypto gainers during this bull cycle, having surged from a monthly entry price of $4.3 to briefly trade above the $8 price mark. Although, NEAR token is now trading slightly below this mark with a weekly price range of $6.6 and $7.1, it has made a significant move to the upside in the past month. While it attempts to stabilize above the resistance level at $8, Near protocol’s technical analysis suggests that the recent retracement is a minor setback. Notably, NEAR token’s moving averages , including its 20, 100, and 200 SMA and EMAs signals a strong buy which ultimately suggests a sustained bull momentum. As a result, NEAR price is projected to soon surpass its previous year-to-date high of $8.8 and possibly revisit the all-time high price of $20.4. Litecoin Registers Yearly ATH, Maintains Bullish Momentum Like Near protocol, Litecoin (LTC) has also recorded quite an impressive price movement in the past month, registering about a 70% increase in the past month. While the recent surge contributed significantly to LTC token’s year-to-date price recovery, it also pushed it to register a new YTD ATH around $144. Currently trading within a weekly price range of $119 and $125, Litecoin price reflects slightly above nearly 2% increase, a modest increase compared to the previous week. Meanwhile, the recent price surge has further bolstered investors’ confidence as 85% of over 23K Coinmarketcap community members voted in favor of a bullish price trajectory. This positive sentiment, coupled with bullish technical metrics including 50, 100, and 200 EMA and SMAs points at a sustained momentum. If that be the case, LTC price could push above the next resistance level around $257, and eventually surpass its ATH price of $412 in the near future. Can Lunex Network Outpace Litecoin and Near Protocol? Both Litecoin and Near Protocol have had a fair run during the ongoing bull market. However, with projections for a sustained bullish momentum, these top altcoins are expected to perform even better in the coming weeks, potentially securing more gains for token holders. While this is not only true for established altcoins alone, fast-rising presale stars like Lunex network have also been tipped for enormous price rally. Besides its ICO status which makes it a more stable choice for long term investors, Lunex Network’s institutional features also positions it as a major contender during this bull cycle.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) has had an impressive performance since it plunged to around $0.000013 in early August. Recall that crypto prices tanked heavily in August due to rising geopolitical tension in the Middle East. As reported earlier, Shiba Inu was not spared in the bloodbath as it plunged below the $0.000013 price mark. Here’s When SHIB Will Hit $0.0001, $0.001, and $0.01 Interestingly, this collapse has become a thing of the past, following SHIB’s 133.15% surge to $0.00003031 in early November. This movement has affected the timelines set for Shiba Inu’s potential rally to $0.0001, $0.001, and $0.01. Consequently, The Crypto Basic consulted multiple entities, such as Changelly and ChatGPT, to ascertain when SHIB could reach these targets. Shiba Inu Potential Rally to $0.0001 $0.0001 is modest among the aforementioned targets, as it requires SHIB to surge 266.97% from its current price. This target is 13.05% higher than Shiba Inu’s previous all-time high (ATH) of $0.00008845, set on October 28, 2021. At $0.0001, Shiba Inu’s market cap would rise to $58.92 billion from the current value of $16.04 billion. This estimation assumes that Shiba Inu’s circulating supply of 589.25 trillion tokens remains fairly stable. According to Changelly experts, Shiba Inu will hit the $0.0001 target by 2027, three years from now. In 2027, the experts expect SHIB to trade at a minimum target of $0.000103, an average price of $0.000107, and a maximum price of $0.000127. ChatGPT, a popular AI chatbot, issued three timelines for SHIB’s surge to $0.0001. First, it expects SHIB to hit the target between 2025 and 2026, noting that the milestone would be driven by widespread adoption, hefty token burns, and a strong bull market. The second timeline would see SHIB clinch $0.0001 in 2 - 4 years, specifically between 2026 and 2028. Achieving the target within this timeline requires SHIB to witness increased utility through Shiba Inu’s L2 blockchain Shibarium and steady economic growth. Lastly, ChatGPT sees the $0.0001 target becoming a reality by 2029 or beyond due to a lack of solid adoption. Shiba Inu to $0.001 Hitting the $0.001 target requires a rise of 3,559% from the current price. Upon clinching this target, Shiba Inu’s market cap would soar to $589.25 billion from the current value, assuming the circulating supply remains fairly stable. Experts at Changelly see the $0.001 target becoming a reality by 2033, which would mark SHIB’s maximum price by then. In addition, ChatGPT issued its prediction for Shiba Inu’s potential surge to $0.001 under three different timelines. The outlooks are optimistic, moderate, and pessimistic. For the optimistic forecast, ChatGPT expects SHIB to clinch $0.001 between 2030 and 2034. This rise will be driven by several factors, ranging from massive token burns to rapid institutional interest in SHIB. The moderate forecast estimates that SHIB would trade at $0.001 between 2035 and 2040, highlighting factors like long-term growth in adoption as a potential driver. The pessimistic outlook does not expect Shiba Inu to reach this target without aggressive burns. Hence, ChatGPT did not set a particular timeline for this scenario. Shiba Inu to $0.01 Amid Shiba Inu’s 133.51% surge, we consulted Changelly and ChatGPT to find out the updated timeline for SHIB’s rally to the one-cent ($0.01) dream. With Shiba Inu currently trading at $0.2725, the token must register a surge of 36,597% to reach the $0.01 target . At this price, Shiba Inu’s market cap would climb to an astounding $5.89 trillion, surpassing Bitcoin’s current valuation. Despite the massive growth rate required for Shiba Inu to surge to $0.01, Changelly experts believe the one-cent dream is realistic for SHIB. According to them, Shiba Inu would likely hit the target by October 2040, marking SHIB’s maximum price by then. Furthermore, ChatGPT set an optimistic timeline of 2035 - 2045 for Shiba Inu’s potential surge to $0.01. It speculated that SHIB could achieve the one-cent dream within this period by incinerating 95-99% of the circulating supply. For the moderate and pessimistic outlooks, ChatGPT does not see Shiba Inu soaring to $0.01 over the next few decades. While the $0.0001 target is moderate, Shiba Inu’s potential surge to $0.001 and $0.01 seems audacious, as it requires the asset to surge by thousands of percentages. Achieving these milestones within a short period would necessitate the alignment of several factors, ranging from strong institutional demand to massive burn.",Market|Latest Shiba Inu (SHIB) News Today|Shiba Inu Price Prediction,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2024-12-11 16:11:47
