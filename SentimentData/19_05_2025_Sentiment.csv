According to a May 16 letter from Storm's attorneys to Judge Katherine Polk Failla, the FinCEN documents show that non-custodial crypto mixers do not fall under the legal definition of a ""money transmitting business"" and that prosecutors have known this since at least 2023. Despite having knowledge of the FinCEN guidance on crypto mixers, state prosecutors still proceeded with cases against the Samourai Wallet developers and Tornado Cash, the attorneys alleged. Letter sent by Roman Storm’s attorneys to Judge Failla. Source: Court Listener US prosecutors denied they withheld the evidence , claiming they submitted the FinCEN communications within the stipulated timeframe to produce the documents for the defense and the court during legal discovery. Storm's defense cited the same legal documents and the same argument the Samourai Wallet developer’s attorneys posed to the court in a May 5 legal letter . Storm's attorneys wrote: ""The disclosures in the Samourai case reveal that the government, at the very least, played fast and loose and, at worst, affirmatively misled this Court with its arguments about FinCEN guidance when responding to the motions to dismiss and to compel discovery."" The letter went on to argue that although the government continues to claim that the cases bear only ""superficial similarities"" to each other, they share the core characteristics of cryptocurrency mixers under the law, thus making the FinCEN documents salient to dismissing the case against Storm.

Despite this, US federal prosecutors still moved ahead with the case against Storm although the charges have been modified.

While Cardano continues to dominate conversations with its robust ecosystem and ambitious roadmap, a rising coin, Mutuum Finance, is performing well by offering innovative DeFi solutions that could challenge the status quo. At $0.025 per token in Presale Phase 4, Mutuum Finance already has more than 10,000 investors and collected a total of $8.6 million. There are fast moving adopters in this phase with more than 85% of Phase 4 already sold. If you invest in phase 4, your investment will grow by 20% by phase 5 and up to 140% at launch. For traders focused on quick gains and smart entries, understanding how MUTM stacks up against Cardano could be key to unlocking profitable opportunities. If you’re wondering which crypto to buy today for short-term success, this clash of titans might just shape your next move. Cardano’s Rise: A Journey from Promise to Power Cardano’s ascension to the top of the cryptocurrency sector has been marked by its focus on research-driven development and scalability, earning it a reputation as one of the most promising blockchain platforms in a relatively short period. Its innovative proof-of-stake consensus and commitment to sustainability saw ADA attract institutional investment and a passionate community that craved long-term growth. While its rise has been progressive and rooted in practical applications, Cardano continues to be the benchmark for fearless altcoins eager to disrupt the market. While the environment is shifting, innovative projects like Mutuum Finance are rising up to challenge established brands and offer up new prospects for investors seeking to buy the current best altcoin. Mutuum Finance Gathers Steam Investor interest in Mutuum Finance is rising fast as its presale gains serious traction. At the current price of $0.025, buyers are positioning themselves for a 20% gain when Phase 5 launches and pushes the token to $0.03. With a planned market launch at $0.06, Phase 4 investors are eyeing a potential 140% ROI. Over $8.6 million has already poured into the project from more than 10,000 backers, and that number continues to grow. The platform diverges a lot from traditional methods since it embraces its buy and distribute strategy. Using this strategy, Mutuum Finance receives the market tokens allocated to stakers, which slowly helps to increase participation as well as improving overall project economics. Besides, a constant flow of incentives is provided in order to encourage ongoing engagement. Leaderboard Rewards System Boosts Engagement The Mutuum Finance platform now has a real-time leaderboard used to showcase the top 50 MUTM holders and community engagement. Keeping their position, gives users additional motivations, thus fuelling the atmosphere of rivalry as well as loyalty which increases the overall community involvement. Security continues to be a vital objective among the team behind Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance has tapped in blockchain security pioneer CertiK to carry out a comprehensive audit of the smart contracts. After the audit is complete, it will be possible to see on Mutuum’s social networks all results, providing the users to see for themselves the safety and credibility of their investments. Mutuum Finance is rapidly gaining traction as one of the most compelling altcoins for short-term gains in 2025. At a presale price of just $0.025, with over 85% of Phase 4 sold out and $8.6 million raised from more than 10,000 investors, momentum is accelerating fast.

Chainlink Eyes $20 While Cardano Drops,https://thecoinrise.com/analysts-are-calling-web3-ai-the-best-crypto-since-bitcoin-chainlink-eyes-20-while-cardano-drops/,"A 3% drop in Cardano (ADA) hasn’t rattled the market much, as trading signals still suggest a potential recovery. On-chain metrics hint at a rebound while the sentiment holds steady. Meanwhile, Chainlink (LINK) is showing strong upside potential, with trading volume rising and resistance weakening. Analysts now suggest a $20 breakout is on the table as momentum continues to build. Away from these familiar names, Web3 ai is gaining traction among analysts who see it as a serious contender for the best-performing crypto by 2025. Unlike others still in development, Web3 ai already offers live features such as trading insights, optimized portfolio strategies, and accurate price projections. Its $WAI coin is being recognized not for speculation, but for its practical application. With $4.5 million already raised and predictions suggesting it could exceed $1, Web3 ai is now being considered for entry into the top 50 crypto projects. Web3 ai’s $WAI Eyes $1 Target Amid Growing Analyst Attention Focused on delivering AI-based solutions for traders, Web3 ai offers a unified interface where tools like real-time signals, portfolio tuning, and price forecasts come together. While others are still figuring out their direction, Web3 ai has rolled out a fully functional platform. Analysts highlight this readiness as the reason behind the growing interest in $WAI. The project is currently in stage 5 of a 50-stage presale. At present, the coin is priced at $0.000365, increasing to $0.003267 in the final stage, before listing at $0.005242. This path outlines a return of 1747% by the time of listing, prompting many to rethink their long-term crypto picks for 2025. What stands out most is that the rise in value isn’t driven by hype alone. The tools are developed for real use: smart trading moves, better timing, and stronger portfolio strategy. Rather than being a general AI project, Web3 ai zeroes in on giving crypto users real advantages. With the trend shifting to usefulness and focused AI tools, $WAI is seen by experts as a future top-tier asset. Some forecasts now place it above $1 with a strong chance of entering the top 50 cryptos. For those who follow fundamentals and utility, Web3 ai is becoming hard to ignore. Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis Shows Strong $20 Push Chainlink (LINK) is approaching a key breakout level, with leading analysts such as Michaël van de Poppe identifying $20 as a near-term target. Currently trading around $14.70, the asset has picked up momentum. RSI has reached 62, volume is up by 15%, and a 12% weekly increase in on-chain activity points to an incoming move. The broader market tailwind also supports LINK’s move. As the Nasdaq shows positive performance, digital assets like Chainlink benefit from renewed enthusiasm. If LINK breaks through the $16.50 mark, a move to $20 could come quickly. Chainlink continues to hold a key role in DeFi infrastructure, and that’s drawing increased attention from larger market players. Cardano (ADA) Sees Pullback, But Optimism Persists Cardano (ADA)’s recent 3% decline is seen more as a pause than a reversal. Many metrics suggest holders are not rushing to exit, which often points to reduced selling pressure. According to Santiment, ADA’s weighted sentiment remains positive at 1.33, indicating growing optimism. The price is currently ranging between $0.76 and $0.84. Though resistance is proving tough to break, continued positive sentiment and lower selling could push ADA above $0.84, with $0.92 as the next resistance. Those tracking mid-term gains are keeping ADA in their sights as a potential rebound story. Final Say! Although Cardano still shows signs of a rebound and Chainlink is aiming at $20 with rising support, Web3 ai’s crypto presale is what’s sparking wider interest. Priced at $0.000365 currently and heading toward $0.005242 at listing, the projected 1747% return is generating serious discussion. Its AI-led solutions offer real support for trading efficiency, price analysis, and risk-managed strategies. Web3 ai isn’t just a speculative play. Analysts now suggest $WAI could exceed $1 and claim a spot in the top 50, as the platform brings meaningful advantages in a noisy market. It’s shaping up as one of the rare presales grounded in actual use.

As more major coins enter consolidation zones, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing accelerated demand — and many analysts are calling this the last major entry window before listings take the price discovery public . JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Seeing Pre-Listing Accumulation MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the few remaining presale tokens with both clear structure and strategic upside . With a fixed listing target of $0.007 , and Stage 8 already nearing completion, traders are viewing this as the last clean shot at early-cycle positioning . Key factors driving MAGA’s momentum: Projected 25x–35x growth from current levels Distinct political narrative and identity-based branding Transparent tokenomics and imminent exchange visibility What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is not hype — it’s clarity . For Bitcoin, Cardano, and XRP holders looking for higher risk/reward ratios, MAGA offers exactly what’s missing from the large caps right now: entry-level positioning with real upside potential . Bitcoin Holds Steady as Investors Hunt for Altcoin Multipliers Bitcoin (BTC) continues to maintain its dominance in the market, consolidating above $103K with strong support. While ETF flows remain consistent and long-term targets still range between $150K and $250K , BTC’s short-term movement has flattened. For this reason, many BTC holders are reallocating portions of their portfolios into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE to balance stability with speculative opportunity . Bitcoin builds confidence — MAGA builds exponential potential. Cardano (ADA) Prepares for a Potential Breakout Cardano (ADA) is currently trading around $0.75–$0.80 , and analysts are watching closely as it nears a possible breakout above the psychological $1.00 mark. Recent updates to the network have enhanced performance and scalability, and Cardano remains a favorite among long-term blockchain investors. However, ADA is not known for rapid moves — which is why some ADA holders are moving capital into shorter-term high-reward plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE . SEI: Stable, But Yet to Ignite SEI has built a strong presence in the Cosmos ecosystem and continues to be seen as a reliable platform. While the broader infrastructure thesis remains intact, SEI has yet to ignite a full bull-phase move , and is trading in a tight range. Investors seeking faster upside are taking profits from SEI and shifting into earlier-stage tokens that still have room to run — with MAGA becoming one of the primary destinations for that capital. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE is no longer a secret — and with Stage 9 approaching fast, traders from all sides of the market are taking positions. Bitcoin holders are rotating small stacks. ADA and XRP communities are diversifying. SEI investors are looking for speed. Among all of them, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as one of the final early-stage plays with structured ROI, clear timing, and high-conviction sentiment . This may be the last low-level entry before listings go live — and those watching closely are already making their move.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Ethereum, and Solana Are Leading the Surge",https://thecoinrise.com/the-next-big-crypto-move-magacoin-finance-ethereum-and-solana-are-leading-the-surge/,"Introduction Crypto markets are showing renewed momentum, and a clear shift is underway. While Bitcoin holds its ground, a new set of projects is emerging as leaders in the next big move — including MAGACOIN FINANCE, Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX) . Each of these assets is capturing attention for different reasons: early-stage potential, institutional support, infrastructure dominance, or network innovation. Together, they’re creating the surge that analysts say could define the rest of the 2025 cycle. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Driving Early-Stage Capital Right Now MAGACOIN FINANCE is taking center stage as Stage 9 approaches , with investors viewing it as one of the few tokens still offering clear 25x–35x upside potential ahead of listings. Key reasons it’s leading the surge: A set listing price of $0.007 , creating price clarity Early-stage momentum while other assets consolidate A narrative and brand identity that separates it from technical Layer-1s While Ethereum and Solana handle scalability and DeFi, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out a high-return niche based on early access, timing, and exponential potential . With its presale stages nearly over, it’s gaining ground fast — and the final entry window is closing. Ethereum (ETH) Is Gearing Up for Its Institutional Phase Ethereum (ETH) remains the smart contract standard — but now it’s also preparing to become a favorite for traditional finance. With ETF discussions progressing and recent upgrades like Pectra improving scalability, ETH is set to lead the market’s infrastructure layer well into 2026. Price currently holds near $2,600 , but projections show upside to $4,000–$6,000 if inflows increase and Layer-2 adoption continues to rise. Ethereum’s role in this surge? It’s the foundation — and everything is being built on top of it. Solana (SOL) Keeps Its Momentum as the Fastest L1 Solana (SOL) is not slowing down. Currently trading around $165–$180 , it has emerged as the fastest-growing Layer-1 with a developer ecosystem that rivals Ethereum in both speed and volume. What’s driving its place in the surge: Low fees and lightning-fast throughput DeFi and NFT expansion Consistent upside potential toward $250–$400 Solana continues to attract attention from retail and institutional capital — making it a core asset for anyone betting on smart contract infrastructure during the next bull wave. Avalanche (AVAX) Rebounds on Real-World Partnerships Avalanche (AVAX) is rallying on real utility — and that’s what puts it on the top gainers list for this cycle. Recently trading around $28.35 , AVAX is gaining momentum from strong institutional interest , including partnerships with brands like MapleStory and developments involving BlackRock . Its unique subnets architecture allows for scalable enterprise adoption, and the Avalanche Summit 2025 reaffirmed its vision for on-chain innovation. Analysts see AVAX targeting the $45–$70 range if network volume continues to expand. STAGE ALMOST FULL — ACT NOW Conclusion Ethereum powers the base layer. Solana drives high-speed adoption. Avalanche brings in real-world utility. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is the one offering the final early-stage upside before listings change the equation. For those looking to catch the next big crypto move before it’s priced in, MAGACOIN FINANCE may be the only token left with both narrative strength and unclaimed ROI. With Stage 9 just ahead, smart capital is already moving — the question is, will you be ahead of the curve?

Analysts Are Positive it Will Reach $2.00 During Altcoin Season,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-ruvi-ai-ruvi-outshine-shiba-inus-shib-positive-momentum-analysts-are-positive-it-will-reach-2-00-during-altcoin-season/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB), one of the most popular meme coins, is making waves in the market again. $0.000014 , SHIB has gone up 18.59% in the last month and many are hoping it will delete a zero and reach the coveted $0.0001 mark . While SHIB tries to recreate the past, a new project is catching the attention of smart investors. Meet Ruvi , a coin that will revolutionize the market by combining blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI ). Can Ruvi be the next big thing to rival Shiba Inu? Shiba Inu’s Recent Run SHIB’s recent performance shows its strength in the crypto market: Big Jump SHIB has gone up 30% in the last month due to growing interest and adoption as part of the broader crypto hype. The Push to $0.0001 To reach this milestone, SHIB needs to go up 553.59% , a big task but many believe it can do it over time. Its path includes overcoming a massive supply of 589 trillion tokens , making its market cap a key factor. Historical Performances SHIB has gone up millions of percent in its 2021 bull run, one of the most epic stories in crypto history. While Shiba Inu continues to fight to get back to its highs, Ruvi is a project that offers unique value, different from meme coins. Introducing Ruvi Unlike Shiba Inu, Ruvi combines blockchain with AI to create practical solutions for industries like logistics, healthcare and finance. It brings functionality to the forefront instead of being driven by market hype. Why Ruvi Stands Out AI Features Ruvi has AI for predictive analytics and decision making optimization, real world value across multiple sectors. Deflationary Model With a hard cap of 5 billion tokens , Ruvi is designed to grow in scarcity, long term value for its holders. Fast Adoption Ruvi addresses key inefficiencies in traditional systems, relevance and demand beyond speculative trading.This unique approach puts Ruvi in a league of its own, for investors who want innovation and practicality. High Returns with Ruvi Ruvi has already made a strong start, completed presale phase 1 , sold over 100 million tokens , and raised $1 million . The presale has attracted more than 1,000 investors , and phase 2 is live now with tokens at $0.015 . Investment Opportunities With Ruvi’s exclusive presale bonuses, early investors can maximize their returns. Here’s how: Entry-Level Investment ($600) Tokens at $0.015 = 40,000 Bonus Tokens (20%) = 8,000 Total Tokens = 48,000 Value at $1 = $48,000 Mid-Level Investment ($2,000) Tokens at $0.015 = 133,333 Bonus Tokens (60%) = 80,000 Total Tokens = 213,333 Value at $2 = $426,666 High-Level Investment ($12,000) Tokens at $0.015 = 800,000 Bonus Tokens (100%) = 800,000 Total Tokens = 1.6 million Value at $3 = $4.8 million Ruvi has a clear and lucrative path for investors to ride the next crypto wave. Ruvi vs Shiba Inu While Shiba Inu thrives on its community and price rallies, Ruvi tackles real world problems with its AI. Shiba Inu’s quest to delete a zero is cool, but Ruvi’s all round approach makes it a cryptocurrency with longevity and transformational potential. Act Now, Don’t Miss Out Shiba Inu’s momentum is a testament to how far a cryptocurrency driven by community and market can go. But Ruvi is the next step in crypto, combining practical applications with high returns.

Bitcoin is reclaiming dominance, XRP is breaking out on regulatory clarity, and a new wave of investors is zeroing in on MAGACOIN FINANCE-a rising political altcoin that could become this year’s biggest early-stage win. With HBAR gaining traction through enterprise partnerships, the big question now: Could a $100 bet today really grow into $1 million this cycle? Let’s break down the leaders catching the market’s attention and the altcoin that’s turning heads before listings go live. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Bitcoin’s Institutional Demand Fuels $200K Ambitions Bitcoin (BTC) is holding strong above $104,000, with analysts projecting a run to $200,000 by the end of 2025. The bullish outlook is powered by a supply crunch-annual production is capped at 165,000 BTC while institutional demand, especially from ETFs and sovereign wealth funds, already exceeds new supply. Major institutions like VanEck and Standard Chartered see BTC as the anchor of the next bull cycle, with macroeconomic uncertainty and regulatory clarity driving further adoption. As miners’ reserves dwindle and retail activity softens, institutional accumulation is setting the stage for MAGACOIN FINANCE, a potential parabolic move in the months ahead . Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Early-Stage Play of 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is redefining early-stage ROI in 2025, with over $8 million raised and a presale price still under $0.001. Its capped 100 billion token supply and 45% presale allocation create real scarcity, while a viral political meme narrative and more than 20,000 holders drive organic growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE is backed by audited smart contracts and real on-chain conviction, highlighted by the largest whale presale buy of the year. Analysts are calling for a conservative 35x return, with some models suggesting 50x or more if momentum continues. Key highlights: Over $8 million raised and 20,000+ holders before listing Scarcity-driven model: 100 billion max supply, 45% in presale Audited by HashEx and backed by a fast-growing, engaged community As listings approach and each stage sells out faster, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the most talked-about presale of the cycle. For investors seeking asymmetric upside and a shot at the next breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a rare ground-floor opportunity. XRP Surges on ETF Hype and Legal Clarity XRP has surged to $2.60, marking a 20% monthly gain as the resolution of Ripple’s SEC lawsuit and speculation around a potential XRP ETF fuel investor optimism. Technical breakouts above $2.40 and rising trading volumes are driving bullish momentum, with Standard Chartered and other analysts projecting targets as high as $5.50 by year-end if ETF approval and adoption accelerate. However, XRP is not known for rapid moves — which is why some ADA holders are moving capital into shorter-term high-reward plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE . HBAR’s Enterprise Surge and Bullish Forecasts Hedera (HBAR) is gaining momentum in 2025, driven by a surge in corporate adoption and major partnerships with giants like IBM and Standard Bank. The network has processed over 20 billion transactions this year, pushing HBAR’s price forecasts as high as $0.47–$0.78 for 2025, with some analysts eyeing $1 in the long term. HBAR is positioning itself as an enterprise-grade blockchain for real-world use while investors seeking faster upside are taking profits from HBAR and shifting into MAGACOIN FINANCE, an earlier-stage token that still has room to run . JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Final Thoughts Between Bitcoin’s supply-driven rally, XRP’s regulatory breakthrough, HBAR’s enterprise adoption, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive presale, the crypto market’s next cycle is already taking shape. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the only early-stage entry still offering ground-floor potential. With strong investor demand, a clear roadmap, and listings on the horizon, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as the last 50x shot of 2025 and smart investors are already taking notice.

While meme tokens like Pepe Coin (PEPE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Dogecoin (DOGE) remain trending, a new project is steadily climbing the ranks. BlockDAG, a layer 1 blockchain network offering actual utility and infrastructure, is quickly becoming one of the top crypto coins to buy now. A mix of EVM smart contract compatibility, completed CertiK audits, and viral presale progress has helped BlockDAG stand out. Its fundamentals and delivery timeline are drawing increasing attention. BlockDAG’s presale price is locked at $0.0020 until June 13, with a confirmed launch price of $0.05. This price gap has caught the eye of early-stage buyers. With the perfect mix of media buzz and substance, BlockDAG is widely being seen as one of the top crypto coins to buy now. BlockDAG: Building a Real Use Case That Draws Attention BlockDAG has raised over $254.5 million and sold 20.7 billion BDAG coins, making it one of the most discussed launches of the year. With real utility backing it, unlike most meme tokens, BlockDAG supports EVM-based smart contracts, allowing seamless dApp migration. These capabilities place it among the top crypto coins to buy now. Following its successful CertiK audit, confidence in the project’s contract security has grown. Sales of over 17,500 miners have generated $7 million, proving that real adoption is already underway. Its current presale price of $0.0020 could lead to a 2,400% return once it lists at $0.05. This locked price is valid only until June 13, when BlockDAG (BDAG) will reveal 20 exchange names. Long-term projections suggest BDAG could reach $1, positioning it firmly among the top crypto coins to buy now. Pepe Coin (PEPE): Riding the Meme Rally with Strong Growth Pepe Coin has shown unexpected gains, with a 6% jump in the last 24 hours, and is now priced near $0.0000143. Its market cap has surged from $2.7 billion to $5.4 billion in just 30 days. Current sentiment is positive, with forecasts pointing toward $0.00004905 by month-end, potentially a 243% rise. Though speculative, its trend strength has pushed PEPE into discussions about top crypto coins to buy now for high-risk rewards. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Holding Up Against Market Swings SHIB is currently near $0.00001628 and has gained modestly over the last day. Technical indicators show bullish signs, with a potential breakout if the $0.00001750 resistance is broken. A further rise to $0.00002026 is seen as likely. Despite its volatility, SHIB’s loyal user base and positive technical signals maintain its position as one of the top crypto coins to buy now. Dogecoin (DOGE): Renewed Momentum Fuels Optimism DOGE is trading close to $0.24 after an 8% gain in 24 hours. A confirmed head and shoulders pattern, alongside a futures open interest above $1.6 billion, is fueling optimism. If upward volume continues, DOGE might approach the $0.30 mark soon. With its wide recognition and improving charts, DOGE remains among the top crypto coins to buy now for momentum seekers. Final Thoughts: Which Are the Top Crypto Coins to Buy Now? Although PEPE, SHIB, and DOGE dominate meme headlines, BlockDAG is quietly constructing a foundation for long-term relevance. From a completed CertiK audit to EVM compatibility, $7M in miner sales, and a rising user base, BlockDAG goes beyond presale hype. Priced at $0.0020 with a set listing at $0.05 and an exchange reveal scheduled for June 13, the project provides a rare opening. Those evaluating the top crypto coins to buy now should take note, BlockDAG offers both solid fundamentals and timing.

Speaking on “Fox News Sunday” Johnson said his team is “on track, working around the clock to deliver this nation-shaping legislation for the American people as soon as possible.” He noted that all 11 committees have completed their work and that they “spent less and saved more than even we’ve projected initially.” He called the bill “a once in a generation opportunity.” Source: Fox News Once the budget committee approves the measure, Johnson plans to send it to the House Rules Committee by mid-week. From there, he expects to bring it to the full House floor before the week’s end so that lawmakers can “meet our original Memorial Day deadline.” Johnson emphasized why the tight timetable matters so much. “This is the vehicle through which we will deliver on the mandate the American people gave us during the last election,” he said. He promised “historic savings for the American people, historic tax relief for American workers, [and] historic investments in border security.” He added “At the same time, we’re restoring American energy dominance, and we’re rebuilding the defense industrial base, and we’re ensuring that programs like Medicaid and SNAP are strengthened for U.S. citizens who need and deserve them and not being squandered away by illegal aliens and persons who are ineligible to receive them and are cheating the system.” Johnson stressed the importance of making Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent by 2026. He pointed out that the package would eliminate taxes on overtime and tips, fulfilling a 2024 Trump campaign pledge, and would introduce fresh tax relief for Social Security recipients. He also said it would cut taxes on “job creators,” thereby encouraging American manufacturing and production across the country. “This is a big thing. We cannot fail, and we’ll get it done for the American people,” Johnson declared. Mike Johnson faces disagreement from members of his party South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman and Texas Rep. Chip Roy have criticized Johnson for not moving faster on spending cuts. They’ve called for work requirements for able-bodied adult Medicaid recipients to start well before 2029. Johnson said that he shares their goal but worries about whether states can “retool their systems and ensure the verification process” is strong enough. “We’re working through all those details, and we’ll get it done,” he said, adding, “but I’ll tell you what, this is the largest spending reduction in at least three decades, probably longer. It’s historic.” He noted support from Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought and from “nearly 500 organizations across the conservative spectrum” that back restrictive spending. Johnson urged, “We are. This is our opportunity to do it. It’s once in a generation, as I’ve said, and we can’t squander it.” He expressed confidence that a compromise on the Medicaid work requirement would satisfy internal critics but conceded that not a single Democrat is expected to support the bill. “Which means that they will be on record apparently supporting the largest tax increase in U.S. history, which is what will happen by default after the end of this year if we do not get this job done,” Johnson said. “We have to accomplish this mission, and we will.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-18 23:04:56

Whether it was Bitcoin in 2013, Ethereum before DeFi exploded, or Immutable X during its sudden breakout moment — the pain of missed opportunities hits harder when you see where those assets are today. Immutable X delivered one of those unforgettable moments when it shifted from a niche layer-2 project to a widely adopted name in NFT scalability. Many ignored it at the start, and by the time it captured the headlines, the early gains were already claimed. It’s these kinds of missed plays that leave people hunting for the next standout — the next breakout to enter before it earns mainstream validation. That conversation today is starting to revolve around Qubetics . Qubetics is being quietly listed alongside the best performing crypto contenders of 2025 — and for good reason. It’s built not just for short-term price action, but with a structural vision that targets real blockchain limitations. Designed as a modular layer-1 blockchain, it combines developer accessibility with powerful performance. Its current presale structure adds another layer of urgency, making it clear this opportunity may not stay open much longer. The Qubetics presale is already attracting attention across trading forums and serious blockchain communities — and those watching closely see why it’s being flagged as a top crypto presale before mainnet deployment in Q2 2025. Qubetics Is Becoming the Best Performing Crypto — And You Still Have a Chance Those who got in during the initial Qubetics phase secured $TICS tokens at just $0.01 when the presale opened in September 2024. Since then, multiple early stages have passed, each representing a price point many now wish they had taken seriously. Fortunately, this isn’t one of those “too late” moments. The project is now in Stage 34, and while the price has climbed to $0.2532, the presale still sits within accessible reach for those who recognize the strategic value early. With over $17 million raised, more than 512 million tokens sold, and over 26,400 holders backing it, Qubetics is delivering metrics that validate its growing reputation as the best performing crypto prospect of the year. For participants entering now, the potential ROI scenario remains aggressive. At the current stage price, $TICS offers projected returns of 294.84% at just $1, jumping to 1,874.21% at $5, and pushing up to 2,269.05% if the asset reaches $6 post-presale. If the token hits $10 following its Q2 mainnet launch — a milestone that seems increasingly achievable — ROI would surge to 3,848.42%. For example, a $2,000 investment in Stage 34 secures approximately 7,896 tokens. If the token reaches just $6, that turns into a potential return of $47,376. With Qubetics still considered a top crypto presale, that’s a calculated bet many are now taking seriously as one of the best performing crypto setups in 2025. Beyond the metrics, Qubetics delivers value through real-world utility. The QubeQode IDE, one of its core features, empowers developers from all skill levels to build on-chain solutions. A marketing agency, for instance, can use drag-and-drop components to build token reward systems for brand loyalty campaigns without needing deep blockchain coding. Meanwhile, small businesses can use the form-based configuration to deploy secure contracts for customer subscriptions. Even educational platforms are integrating Qubetics tools using its snippet library to token-gate content and manage digital certifications — all without writing complex code. That practical edge is precisely what positions Qubetics ahead of generic blockchain narratives. It’s built for execution, not just expectation. Immutable X Proved Its Strength — But Only After the Early Stage Was Gone Immutable X emerged from the digital shadows at a time when scalability was a key problem for NFT ecosystems. Launched as a layer-2 solution to ease congestion on Ethereum, the project introduced a zero-gas-fee minting model that quickly turned heads. But its presale was mostly quiet, and only a few understood its full potential early on. At its initial price of $0.15, those who backed Immutable X during its early token generation phase saw explosive gains when it climbed past its all-time high. The token eventually peaked at over 3,000% returns during its breakout season, earning Immutable X a reputation as one of the stealth wins in blockchain scalability. Throughout its journey, Immutable X consistently expanded its ecosystem by onboarding major partners and launching integrations that validated its technical framework. From GameStop’s NFT platform to integrations with leading marketplaces, its market stance was cemented.

The story of Immutable X is a reminder of what happens when technological merit meets late-stage hype — and how easily the early participants walk away with the biggest wins.

However, they say that the new rules would not preclude Russian firms from using USDT or other stablecoins as payment or settlement tools in cross-border trade deals. USDT Trading in Russia: Under Threat? The media outlet RBC reported that the bank has issued rules ahead of its approval of trading within its crypto sandbox. The rules are set to come into force on May 26. The USDT market cap over the past month. (Source: CoinGecko) The sandbox was established with the view of allowing Russian firms to use crypto in international trade deals. It operates under the Central Bank’s supervision. Moscow is preparing to expand this sandbox in the coming weeks. This will see qualified or “super- qualified” investors given permission to trade crypto on Central Bank-approved exchange platforms. However, the bank’s latest rules set out parameters for the kind of coins investors will be allowed to trade. These rules note that coins “must not be related to securities issued by hostile issuers.” They also make note of the need to deal with projects with a foothold in “friendly countries.” Here, “hostile” refers to countries that have imposed or adhere to sanctions regimes on Russia. And “friendly” refers to nations who take a neutral stance toward Moscow. The rules also include clauses that appear to ban the use of coins that could “possibly be blocked by either the issuers themselves or the payment agents or individuals who control them.” This also appears to refer to the possibility that operators could be ordered to burn tokens belonging to Russians. A meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy could take place if the two sides come to certain agreements, Interfax reported https://t.co/KykMbJbU2I — Bloomberg (@business) May 17, 2025 Other Stablecoins Also Under Threat? The Central Bank did not explicitly name any cryptoassets in its rules, nor did it speak directly about a possible USDT ban. But experts concur that most popular USD-pegged stablecoins would not fit the bank’s requirements. Georgy Gukasyan, Director of the Tax and Legal Department at DRT (formerly Deloitte’s Russian Branch), said that the Central Bank’s definitions were “quite broad and may cover some stablecoins.” Mikhail Uspensky, a member of Russia’s expert council on crypto regulation, said USDT “does not meet the bank’s new criteria, meaning it will not be able to circulate in Russia.” Uspensky added that the bank has been working on the regulations for some time. And he also noted that “the use of stablecoins in international settlements is not prohibited.” Elvira Nabiullina, Governor of the Russian Central Bank. (Source: Bank of Russia/YouTube/Screenshot) KYC Complications Gukasyan, meanwhile, explained that Tether’s obligations to provide fiat US dollars to USDT holders “only exist for a certain group of token holders.” He explained that in order to claim dollars, USDT token holders must pass Know-Your-Customer and Anti-Money Laundering protocols. But these same protocols, Gukasyan said, are “fully compliant” with sanctions imposed on Russia. He said that this means that Tether, “at its sole discretion,” could “refuse to redeem” coins belonging to people who fail to pass its verification checks. Gukasyan said that the USDT issuer also has the ability to block tokens located “in the wallet of any user, at its sole discretion, at any time.” The expert pointed at the case of the Russian Garantex crypto exchange as an example. In March this year, American authorities took control of Garantex’s domains and froze $26 million worth of funds . Tether cooperated with the Washington crackdown, freezing millions of USDT tokens held in Garantex wallets.

MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Surging as Ethereum, Solana, and XRP Stall",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/2025s-must-have-crypto-magacoin-finance-is-surging-as-ethereum-solana-and-xrp-stall/,"Introduction Crypto markets are heating up – and with Bitcoin’s recent breakout, altcoins are riding the wave. But beneath the headlines, a new batch of tokens is beginning to gain real traction ahead of the next explosive cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE, Ethereum, Solana, and TON are all drawing serious attention as momentum builds across both established leaders and bold new contenders. With each project showing signs of strategic positioning, technical strength, or early-stage investor demand, the next moonshot might already be in play. Here’s a breakdown of the four coins analysts are tracking now. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW Ethereum’s Growth Slows as Investors Seek Higher Multiples Ethereum is trading around $1,826 and continues to attract institutional capital, but its growth has cooled compared to previous cycles. While ETH remains a core holding for many, retail and high-risk investors are increasingly shifting to projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE in search of higher returns. Analysts expect moderate gains for Ethereum this quarter, but the spotlight is clearly shifting toward early-stage opportunities with stronger upside potential. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Be the Breakout of the Year MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most talked-about early-stage entries of 2025. Built around a politically charged, pro-investor narrative, it has already secured a wave of demand – and Stage 8 is now reaching peak activity. With a clear listing target of $0.007 and a structure designed for long-term ROI, MAGACOIN FINANCE is no meme – it’s a message, and investors are responding. Key drivers include sharp price potential and limited entry time, strategic branding that connects with a passionate market base, and growing analyst support pointing to 25x–35x upside. As early access narrows, insiders are treating MAGACOIN FINANCE as a serious shot at breakout-level gains before exchanges go live. For those seeking asymmetric returns, this is where speculation meets structure. Solana Holds Steady Amid DeFi Expansion Solana (SOL) is consolidating near $147, reflecting a steady climb but facing resistance at $150. The network’s DeFi ecosystem and developer activity remain strong, yet the pace of gains has slowed as traders look for more aggressive growth elsewhere. If Solana can break above $150, targets of $155–$160 are in play, but for now, the most dramatic momentum is happening outside the top Layer-1s. TON (Toncoin) Quietly Climbs Into the Spotlight Toncoin (TON) is trading just above $3 and maintaining a bullish trend, supported by its integration with Telegram and a growing user base. Technical indicators suggest a breakout could push TON toward the $4–$6 range in the coming months. While not as loud as other narratives, TON’s steady progress and ecosystem expansion have analysts calling it a sleeper candidate for a major run-up in 2025. CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST Conclusion With Bitcoin setting the tone, the altcoin space is becoming increasingly competitive – and focused. Projects like Solana and Ethereum offer strength through ecosystem maturity and institutional growth, while TON and MAGACOIN FINANCE offer high-upside opportunities for those looking earlier in the curve. MAGACOIN FINANCE is rising as one of the most aggressive early entries, capturing momentum, attention, and serious buyer interest just as Stage 8 heats up. For those watching the market closely, the next moonshot may already be taking shape – and this could be the moment to catch it.

Traders lift their end-of-year Bitcoin price targets to $200,000 based on technical factors and institutional investor adoption. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has been stuck in a narrow range for the past few days, but the rally above $105,500 on May 18 increases the possibility of an upside breakout. Popular trader Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin could soar to $116,000 early next week. Another bullish voice was that of Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. While speaking to Cointelegraph, Hougan said that a supply shock due to increased institutional demand could propel Bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of 2025. He expects seller exhaustion to occur at the $100,000 level. Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360 Although Bitcoin remains strong, select analysts are shifting their focus to altcoins as they believe an altcoin season could be around the corner . Crypto analyst Javon Marks said in a post on X that altcoins, excluding Ether ( ETH ), could “deliver one of their most powerful runs since 2017!” Could Bitcoin and altcoins continue their move higher? Let’s look at the cryptocurrencies that are showing strength on the charts. Bitcoin price prediction Bitcoin remains stuck in a range, but the bulls are trying to overcome the overhead resistance at $105,820. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Both moving averages are sloping up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the overbought zone, signaling that the buyers hold the edge. A break and close above $105,820 increases the likelihood of a retest of the $109,588 level. Sellers will try to defend the $109,588 resistance, but if the bulls prevail, the BTC/USDT pair could skyrocket to $130,000. Alternatively, a sharp drop below $100,000 signals that the bears have seized control. That may tempt several short-term bulls to book profits, pulling the pair toward the 50-day simple moving average ($91,447). BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair has broken out of the symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart, indicating that buyers are in control. There is resistance at $105,820, but it is likely to be crossed. If that happens, the pair could march toward the all-time high of $109,588 and thereafter to the pattern target of $110,922. Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to pull the price back into the triangle. If that happens, the aggressive bulls may get trapped, pulling the pair to $100,000. If this level also cracks, the drop could extend to the target objective of $95,616. Ether price prediction Ether dipped back below the breakout level of $2,550, but the bears are struggling to sustain the lower levels. ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($2,275) and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the price closes above $2,550, the bulls will try to strengthen their position by pushing the ETH/USDT pair above $2,739. If they manage to do that, the pair could surge toward $3,000. The first sign of weakness will be a break below the $2,400 level. That could pull the pair to the 20-day EMA, which is a critical level to watch out for. A break below the 20-day EMA suggests the bulls are losing their grip. ETH/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls pushed the price above the moving averages, indicating demand at lower levels. If buyers pierce the downtrend line, the up move could reach $2,739. A break and close above $2,739 could resume the uptrend. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the downtrend line and breaks below $2,400, it signals that the bulls are rushing to the exit. That could start a deeper correction to $2,270 and then to $2,111. Hyperliquid price prediction Hyperliquid (HYPE) is facing resistance at $28.50, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded much ground to the bears. HYPE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone indicate that the buyers are in command. A break and close above $28.50 could catapult the HYPE/USDT pair toward $35.73. If the price turns down sharply from $28.50, it signals that the bears are aggressively defending the level. The pair could then slide to the 20-day EMA ($23.52), which is likely to attract buyers. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will strive to clear the overhead resistance. HYPE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair is finding support at the 50-SMA on the 4-hour chart, indicating buying on dips. The bulls will try to strengthen their position by pushing the price above the $28.50 level. If they do that, the pair could rally to $31.33. Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-SMA, it implies that the bulls are booking profits in a hurry. That could sink the pair to $24 and later to the solid support at $23.

XMR/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The shallow pullback of the past few days shows that the bulls are hanging onto their positions as they anticipate another leg higher. If the price continues higher and breaks above $353, the XMR/USDT pair could skyrocket to $391 and then to the target objective of $422. The immediate support on the downside is at $331. A break and close below $331 could pull the pair down to the 20-day EMA ($308). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend. XMR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair is finding support at the 50-SMA, but the bulls are struggling to push the price above the overhead resistance at $353. If the price turns down and breaks below the 50-SMA, the pair could start a deeper correction to $317 and then to $300. On the contrary, a break and close above $353 signals the resumption of the uptrend. The pair could march toward $391, where the bears are expected to step in. Aave price prediction Aave ( AAVE ) is facing resistance at the $240 level, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip to the 20-day EMA ($206). That suggests buying on every minor dip. AAVE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price closes above $240, the AAVE/USDT pair could start the next leg of the up move. The pair could rise to $280, which may act as a resistance, but if the bulls persist, the next stop could be $300. Sellers will have to drag the price below the 20-day EMA to prevent the upside. If they can pull it off, the pair could tumble to the crucial support at $196. Buyers are expected to vigorously defend the $196 level. AAVE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair has been consolidating between $217 and $240 for some time. The 20-EMA has started to turn up, and the RSI has risen into the positive zone, signaling an advantage to buyers. A break and close above $240 could drive the pair to $267. On the other hand, if the price turns down from $240, it suggests that the bears are fiercely defending the level. That could keep the pair stuck between $240 and $217 for some time. Sellers will have to tug the price below $217 to signal a comeback. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Some projects are making waves with AI upgrades, strong price trends, and huge giveaways. From presales with potential 600x returns to blockchains hitting new usage records, this list includes four of the top crypto coins gaining attention now. Each one has its own strength, some stand out due to advanced tech, others through strong trading activity. But Unstaked seems to be leading the pack. With over $6.1 million raised and a $1 million reward campaign, it’s drawing serious attention. Here’s why these four names are being counted among the top crypto coins this May, and why Unstaked may be the one everyone remembers. 1. Unstaked: $1M Giveaway and a 600x Upside Unstaked is getting a lot of attention as one of the top crypto coins this month. Now in Stage 12 of its presale, Unstaked ($UNSD) is priced at $0.008997 and expected to list at $0.1819, pointing to a base 20x return. But that’s just the start, analysts see long-term value reaching $5, offering a possible 600x gain for early participants. The hype isn’t just price-driven. Unstaked is powered by a “Proof of Intelligence” system, where users set up AI agents to work across Telegram, X, and other platforms. These agents earn $UNSD based on how well they perform. And here’s the kicker: these AI agents will go live after launch. What’s unique is that 60% of the supply is open to the public, no private allocations or VC control. Plus, Unstaked is running a $1 million giveaway. Anyone buying $100+ worth of $UNSD and completing simple social tasks gets entered to win one of 20 prizes worth $50,000 in tokens. So far, over $6.1 million has been raised. The last $2 million came in just 48 hours. Add a working AI setup and $20 million planned for launch liquidity, and it’s clear why Unstaked is leading the top crypto coins right now. 2. Toncoin: Whale Activity Signals Gains Toncoin is trading at $3.29 after hitting $3.54 earlier in May. It might seem quiet, but whales are buying again. A big shift also happened, the Toncoin Bridge, which let users move TON to Ethereum and BNB Chain, officially shut down on May 10. This move signals renewed focus on its native chain and may lead to key updates. Experts now expect a move to $4.35 by May 17, which would be a 30% gain. That makes Toncoin one of the top crypto coins for short-term trades. With active on-chain metrics and a strong developer base, Toncoin is showing signs of another upward trend. 3. Arbitrum: Token Unlock in Sight Arbitrum has had a bumpy ride. The price of ARB sits at $0.42 after a sharp drop this year, but it just jumped 51% in a few days. As one of the largest Layer 2 networks with over $11.49 billion in TVL, it still holds strong. New apps like PlayElumia continue launching on the platform. The big news? On May 16, 92.65 million ARB tokens worth about $43 million will unlock. This could cause volatility, but some traders are eyeing $0.58 next, a 29% move up. Despite short-term swings, Arbitrum remains one of the top crypto coins for Layer 2 scaling thanks to real usage and a growing app base. 4. Avalanche: Strong Breakout and Record Use Avalanche is breaking out in both price and network activity. After months of quiet trading, AVAX surged 40% this week and now sits at $24.08. It broke out of a cup-and-handle pattern, with $32 as the next resistance level. What’s more impressive? On May 11, Avalanche hit 10.8 million daily transactions and 950,000 active addresses, the highest in almost two years. This spike comes from DeFi platforms, NFTs, and games all building on the chain. Some traders are watching for a pullback to $22.20, but many are calling AVAX one of the top crypto coins this cycle. Its strong activity and clear growth make it hard to ignore. Unstaked Leads the Pack Toncoin is shifting focus to its main chain. Arbitrum is approaching a major token unlock. Avalanche is breaking records in traffic and usage. But among these top crypto coins , Unstaked still stands out. At $0.008997, with long-term forecasts aiming at $5, the upside is clear. The platform offers more than price growth, it features real AI tools, a presale open to all, and a $1 million giveaway pulling in fresh buyers daily. Its Proof of Intelligence model and post-launch AI agent utility make it more than just a presale project, it’s a working product with traction. If you’re watching the top crypto coins right now, Unstaked may be your front-runner. Don’t wait too long, its stages won’t last forever.

Pseudonymous analyst Inmortal tells his 232,300 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum’s market structure on the three-day chart looks very similar to its early 2020 price action. Five years ago, ETH traded between $100 and $200 before the Covid-induced panic ignited a crash to around $86. The downside deviation subsequently triggered a massive rally that sent Ethereum to its all-time high of $4,868. Says Inmortal, “History rhymes, sometimes.” Source: Inmortal/X Looking closer at ETH, Inmortal predicts that Ethereum will continue to consolidate at current levels before sparking surges to $3,800 next month. “Remember who you are, ETH.” Source: Inmortal/X At time of writing, ETH is trading for $2,479. Turning to Ethereum rival Solana, the trader thinks that SOL will take a breather in the coming weeks before launching a rally to a new record high of $320 in July. “$180 is the line on the sand, but it won’t take long to get through it. After that, $320.” Source: Inmortal/X At time of writing, SOL is trading for $165. Inmortal is also outlining Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) potential path to a new all-time high. “$102,000 [to] $96,000 [to] $120,000” Source: Inmortal/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $103,244.

The Zamoskvoretsky District Court of Moscow approved a request from investigators to keep Smerkis in custody while he is being investigated, Russian state-owned news outlet TASS reported on May 18. Smerkis — who previously ran operations for Binance in Russia — is suspected of committing fraud on a “large scale,” pursuant to Article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, violations of which can result in imprisonment ranging from two to 12 years. It isn’t clear if charges have been filed against Smerkis. Russian news outlet Mash tied the fraud allegations against Smerkis to his involvement in The Token Fund and Tokenbox crypto ventures that he co-founded in 2017, where investors reportedly suffered combined losses of around $15 million. Blum, which is not involved in The Token Fund and Tokenbox ventures, wrote to X on May 18 that Smerkis resigned from his role as the firm’s chief marketing officer and would no longer be involved in the project in any capacity. Source: Blum Blum said its team remains fully committed and focused on its goals and that its day-to-day operations would continue as usual. Blum is a crypto project that integrates a decentralized exchange into Telegram Mini Apps, enabling users to trade crypto, earn rewards and participate in token airdrops. No Smerkis, no BLUM token? The incident sparked concerns that Blum’s token airdrop won’t follow through as planned. In an April 3 X post, Blum hinted at a potential BLUM token listing in the third quarter of this year. Blum users could receive BLUM tokens by earning Blum points in its newly launched Drop Game, where users tap on snowflakes falling from their mobile phone screen, and convert those points into tokens during the project’s slated token generation event . Related: Pavel Durov rejects EU pressure to censor Romanian election content However, the news of Smerkis’ arrest appears to have shaken community confidence that the BLUM token airdrop will happen. “Blum owes its users a clarification on the planned airdrop,” one X user and Blum community member said , while crypto influencer RK Gupta added : “No airdrop.

XRP, Ethereum, and MAGACOIN FINANCE Are Pulling in the Smartest Capital",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/100-to-1-million-xrp-ethereum-and-magacoin-finance-are-pulling-in-the-smartest-capital/,"Introduction As capital rotates across the crypto landscape in 2025, seasoned investors are focusing on the assets with the clearest upside and strongest narratives. While Bitcoin’s dominance remains unchallenged, the real growth stories are unfolding in the altcoin space, where the smartest capital is now flowing. At the top of that shortlist: Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and early-stage contender MAGACOIN FINANC E , each offering a unique angle on infrastructure, payments, and high-momentum entry. NEAR Protocol is also beginning to attract attention as it quietly builds out its ecosystem and developer base. In a market defined by selectivity and structure, these are the projects analysts say could deliver the next wave of exponential returns. STAGE ALMOST FULL — ACT NOW XRP: Institutional Liquidity and Real-World Payments XRP remains above $2.30, supported by legal clarity, growing adoption in global payments, and the potential for CME futures integration. Analysts now view XRP as the infrastructure layer for digital liquidity, with price targets ranging from $5 to $15 in the short term, and even higher if ETF approval and institutional inflows accelerate. As one of the few large caps with both regulatory clarity and real-world use, XRP is a cornerstone for investors seeking both credibility and upside. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Being Called the Final Major Entry of 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as a top watchlist pick for early-stage investors as Stage 8 nears completion and exchange listings draw closer. With a locked listing price of $0.007, offering something rare in today’s market: a transparent upside model, a capped 100 billion token supply, and a politically charged brand that’s fueling real demand. Analysts are projecting a 25x–35x ROI from current entry, with some models suggesting even greater potential if momentum continues. Unlike large caps, MAGACOIN still gives investors the chance to enter before major catalysts, mirroring early DOGE or SHIBA entry mechanics but with tighter supply and price clarity. As capital rotates out of slower moving majors, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as one of the only tokens still offering 2021 style breakout potential in a more mature 2025 landscape. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Strength and ETF Momentum Ethereum (ETH) continues to serve as the backbone of crypto’s technical infrastructure. With recent upgrades like Pectra and ongoing ETF speculation, ETH is trading near $2,600, with analysts targeting a move to $4,000–$6,000 in the coming months. Ethereum’s utility spans DeFi, NFTs, and Layer-2s, making it indispensable for both retail and institutional portfolios. As institutional access edges closer to reality, ETH is poised to move in tandem with Bitcoin’s next leg up, while also serving as a springboard for capital into higher-risk, higher-reward projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. NEAR Protocol Quietly Builds Momentum NEAR Protocol is quietly gaining traction in 2025, as its developer ecosystem expands and new integrations drive user growth. While not yet in the spotlight like ETH or XRP, NEAR’s scalable architecture and focus on usability are positioning it as a sleeper candidate for the next breakout. Analysts are watching for a potential surge as more capital seeks out undervalued, high-utility networks. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST Conclusion The smartest capital in crypto is moving beyond Bitcoin, seeking the next wave of exponential returns in tokens with clear narratives and strong fundamentals. Ethereum and XRP offer scale and stability, while NEAR provides a quietly growing alternative. But among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the only token currently offering true early-stage upside, a transparent growth path, and price levels that haven’t yet caught up with market potential. With Stage 8 nearly full and listings approaching, this may be the final major entry point before MAGACOIN FINANCE joins the top tier of traded tokens.

The meeting occurs as both economies feel the strain of rising trade barriers and shifting global alliances. Vance’s office said the two leaders spoke candidly about restoring fair trade between our countries. Canada has groused about new US levies on agricultural goods and metals, and the United States has lashed out at Canada over tech and dairy. Carney’s office did not comment on whether the leaders spoke and said they discussed efforts to work toward a ‘balanced’ economic relationship and a trading system based on rules. The two sides said they would continue to consult and look for ways to reduce trade friction. The trade dispute rattling manufacturers and exporters on both sides of the border is merely one element of a broader cross-border pattern of global economic anxiety. Sunday’s meeting was a step toward de-escalation, but no specific policies were released. Vance and Carney address security and border issues The Rome meetings were about more than just trade. In a united front response to key regional and world issues, Vance and Carney also addressed border security, the opioid crisis, and military spending . Among the topics of discussion was the increase in fentanyl trafficking. The two pledged more cooperation in the interception of drug shipments and dismantling smuggling networks. The United States has experienced a surge in fentanyl-related deaths, and there have been urgent appeals for international action. Defense and security cooperation was also a focus. Carney and Vance reaffirmed their country’s commitment to NATO and discussed boosting defense spending as global tensions have mounted- from Eastern Europe to the Indo-Pacific. Both countries are exploring opportunities to modernize their militaries to help Ukraine and deter aggression from authoritarian states. Migration and border control were also addressed. Both leaders recognized the need to secure their common border without impacting trade and people’s movement. There are said to be discussions on joint patrols and data sharing. Leaders use Vatican gatherings to advance talks The encounter between Vance and Carney occurred on the periphery of a historical religious and diplomatic event: the first mass of Pope Leo XIV celebrated in St Peter’s Basilica. The ceremony attracted heads of state, diplomats, and religious leaders worldwide, offering an ideal environment for hushed side encounters and renewed conversation. Vance also met in Rome and held talks with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who is trying to mediate between the United States and the European Union. The discussions focused on global trade realignment, sustainable development, and financing climate. A large dose of multilateral diplomacy has come around this weekend, allowing the leaders to align their positions ahead of the G7 summit in June. The Vance-Carney encounter is part of a North American leader’s push to show a united front on trade, security, and global cooperation. While no immediate breakthroughs came out of Sunday’s meeting, it underscored the importance of diplomacy and dialogue. Negotiators for both sides said that follow-up talks would occur in the coming weeks and could lead to formal negotiations.

Here’s Another Cheap Token Under $0.05 to Invest in Now,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/already-a-shiba-inu-holder-heres-another-cheap-token-under-0-05-to-invest-in-now/,"Shiba Inu holders have already seen the power of low-cost tokens delivering massive returns. As the crypto market trends upward once again, attention is shifting to a new batch of cheap cryptocurrencies that are showing strong setups, growing communities, and early adoption potential. Mutuum Finance is currently in Presale Phase 4 which is over 85% sold out, already raking in over $8.6 million with over 10,000 investors participating. Investors have less time before this phase concludes. With a public launch price of $0.06 after upcoming stages, phase 4 investors at the current price of $0.025 are in line for potential gains of 140% by the time the token hits exchanges. MUTM is quietly building momentum while remaining accessible to retail investors looking to maximize upside without breaking the bank. Mutuum Finance: Genuine Innovation in DeFi Lending Different from the legacy tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) distinguishes itself through its innovative dual-lending model, combining Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality. With P2C, users can freeze stablecoins in smart contract pools where interest rates adjust dynamically. The P2P model, by contrast, removes intermediaries, giving users full control over their lending agreements. This combination creates a flexible and efficient lending system, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a strong coin for those considering what crypto to invest in or looking for the best crypto to invest in within the changing DeFi market. Security and transparency are built into the core of the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being third-party audited, and their open-source smart contracts are secure in design while creating trust among users. The platform Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also set to be compatible with non-EVM and EVM blockchains, and the gates swing wider with more liquidity in other ecosystems. Presale Momentum At today’s $0.025, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token is of huge interest to early investors. A Phase 20% price jump in phase 5 will give the token a boost to $0.03. With a listing price of $0.06 and some analysts predicting post-launch prices of up to $3, there’s plenty of room for early investors to make a profit. This has made Mutuum Finance (MUTM) one of the most-watched low-market-price DeFi plays. Gamified Ecosystem and Community Incentives Mutuum Finance is also gamifying the user interface with a leaderboard of the top 50 holders of tokens, who are to be rewarded with additional MUTM tokens. On top of that, there is a $100,000 giveaway going on, with ten winners selected to each receive $10,000 in tokens. There is also a referral program running, which rewards users for helping to grow the platform through organic, grassroots outreach. Shiba Inu may have sparked the meme coin movement, but savvy investors are already eyeing the next wave of high-upside, low-cost tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Now in Phase 4 of its presale, this DeFi project has raised over $8.6 million from 10,000+ investors, and more than 85% of tokens in this round are already sold. At $0.025, early buyers could see up to 140% gains by the time it hits its $0.06 launch price, and that’s before potential upside beyond launch.

MAGACOIN FINANCE is accelerating rapidly, with Stage 8 of its presale nearly sold out and investor interest at an all-time high. As capital rotates out of consolidating majors, Kaspa (KAS) is also emerging as a project to watch. Here’s why investors are shifting their focus – and where the next breakout could come from. Bitcoin: Steady as the Market’s Anchor Bitcoin (BTC) remains the foundation of the crypto market, currently trading in a tight range above $104,000. While ETF inflows and institutional demand continue to provide support, price action has been subdued as the market awaits a clear catalyst. Historically, these periods of consolidation have preceded major moves, but for now, BTC’s stability is encouraging capital to explore more dynamic opportunities. THE MOST-WATCHED PRESALE OF 2025 – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Stage 8 Demand Surges as Market Rotates As the broader crypto market cools, MAGACOIN FINANCE is experiencing a surge in momentum. With its listing price set at $0.007 and Stage 8 nearing its limit, the project is quickly being recognized as a premier early-stage opportunity for those seeking substantial returns in 2025. What’s fueling this rapid rise: Clearly structured tokenomics and a limited window for early participation Confident positioning ahead of upcoming exchange launches A distinctive brand and narrative, setting it apart from the typical meme and Layer-1 tokens MAGACOIN FINANCE’s growth is driven by more than just hype – its robust design is attracting capital from slower-moving assets. As Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP continue to consolidate, investors are seeking out projects with greater near-term upside, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as the standout option. Ethereum: Awaiting Its Next Big Move Ethereum (ETH) is also in a holding pattern, trading near $2,600 as investors look for the next catalyst. The recent Pectra upgrade and ongoing ETF speculation have strengthened ETH’s long-term outlook, but short-term momentum has slowed. As a result, some capital is rotating into earlier-stage projects with sharper growth potential, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. Kaspa: Quietly Gaining Ground Kaspa (KAS) is quietly building momentum, with its efficient proof-of-work model and growing developer ecosystem drawing new attention. Trading near $0.13, KAS is being watched as a potential breakout candidate, especially as more investors seek alternatives to the large caps currently consolidating. PRICE COULD SKYROCKET 35x FROM HERE – ACT NOW Final Thoughts With the majors in a consolidation phase, the spotlight is turning to projects with clear upside and strong fundamentals. MAGACOIN FINANCE is taking off as Stage 8 nears completion, offering a rare early-stage entry point as listings approach. As capital continues to rotate, smart investors are positioning themselves ahead of the next wave. The opportunity is narrowing – and those watching closely know now is the time to act.

In the days leading up to the Consensus event, Pi Network saw a speculative rally, jumping more than 150% to $1.50 amid rumors of a major ecosystem announcement scheduled for May 14. However, when no big update was delivered, the token’s value quickly reversed course. As of this writing, Pi has dropped more than 70% from its peak. Daily trading volume also declined by over 44%, suggesting reduced buying interest. Analysts warn that without a major catalyst, Pi could return to its historical low of $0.40. Adding to investor frustration was the announcement of Pi Network Ventures, a $100 million investment initiative aimed at funding decentralized applications and ecosystem projects. While this was initially viewed as a positive step, community confidence waned when the Pi Core Team stated that the fund could be paused or canceled at any time. Transparency and Accountability Needed According to Dr. Altcoin, a crypto analyst, the issue lies in unclear communication and repeated delays by the Pi Core Team. “The promise of 100 DApps was not just a bonus—it was essential,” Dr. Altcoin said. “Without real utility, Pi risks becoming just another overhyped token.” He stressed the difference between speculative “memecoins” and functional ecosystems, urging the Pi team to shift from promotion to performance. The analyst estimates it may take another 2.5 to 5 years for Pi Network to fully deliver on its ecosystem goals. While he remains positive about the project’s long-term success, he stresses that it won’t happen on the original timeline the community expected.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-19 01:31:10

XRP and Solana are showing strength. But the real buzz among sharp investors right now isn’t about large caps — it’s about the one project they believe still offers life-changing upside before listings : MAGACOIN FINANCE . With Stage 9 on the horizon and a structured listing model targeting $0.007 , MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming the preferred early-stage entry for those rotating out of Bitcoin (BTC), XRP, Solana (SOL) , and even TRON (TRX) . The goal? High-conviction positioning before the next leg of this bull cycle erupts. PRICE COULD SKYROCKET 35x FROM HERE – ACT NOW MAGACOINFINANCE Is Emerging as the Last Life-Changing Play MAGACOIN FINANCE has now crossed from “new altcoin” status to top early-stage candidate for those seeking 25x–35x returns . As capital moves out of high-market-cap assets and into presale opportunities, MAGA has become the go-to choice. Why smart money is rotating into MAGA: Clearly defined listing target at $0.007 Stage-based growth aligned with predictable tokenomics Bold, narrative-driven branding that cuts through market noise With Stage 9 approaching and major listings looming, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers one of the last true early-stage setups left in the current market cycle. Bitcoin (BTC) Strengthens the Base Layer Bitcoin is holding above $103K , and ETF demand continues to drive institutional flows. While Bitcoin’s trajectory toward $150K–$250K is intact, its role in investor portfolios is shifting — from high-growth to foundational stability . Investors who saw huge returns from BTC in past cycles are now rotating a portion of that capital into more aggressive positions like MAGACOIN FINANCE, aiming to leverage BTC’s strength to fund high-upside altcoin plays . XRP Is Breaking Out, but Capital Is Seeking Higher Multipliers XRP remains one of the strongest payment utility tokens on the market, with price maintaining above $2.30 and projections stretching toward $10–$15 . Its long-term credibility is now reinforced by regulatory clarity and upcoming CME futures integration . That said, many XRP holders are looking beyond 5x or 10x returns , and instead are targeting the kind of 20x–30x potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is offering right now — especially before listings limit that upside. Solana (SOL) Continues to Climb, But Entry Is Tightening Solana (SOL) continues to be one of the most powerful Layer-1 performers in 2025, trading in the $170–$180 range. But after a strong multi-month run, new buyers are facing limited near-term upside. For that reason, Solana investors are looking for fresh presale entries , and MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the structure, timing, and explosive potential to complement their infrastructure-heavy holdings. TRON (TRX) Holds Strong, But Momentum Is Elsewhere TRON (TRX) has quietly maintained stability in the $0.27 range, primarily due to its strong presence in the stablecoin and DeFi transfer markets. While consistent, it’s not offering the kind of breakout upside seen in early-stage projects. TRX holders are now reallocating into MAGA to capture exposure to higher-velocity growth , especially before Stage 9 shifts the price curve even higher. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE Conclusion The strategy is clear: use the strength and profits from Bitcoin, XRP, Solana, and TRON — and rotate into the only early-stage altcoin still offering life-changing potential . MAGACOIN FINANCE is no longer under the radar . With a set listing price, clean tokenomics, and a rising market narrative, this project is being embraced by smart investors as the final window to capture a 25x–35x before listings go live.

The technical setup supports more gains, but only if this resistance level turns into a base. The Stellar (XLM) price forecast is also gaining attention, with XLM up more than 50% since April. A potential rise to $0.64 is in view, although it depends on sustained momentum and the outcome of ETF speculation. While both projects are reacting to current conditions, BlockDAG (BDAG) is building in a different way. Now in the final presale stages, BDAG has raised more than $254.5 million. Its Buyer Battles distribute 150 million BDAG daily, rewarding the top participant with the unsold share. With 20 exchange listings confirmed and the $0.0020 price ending June 13, BlockDAG is shaping how many are answering the question: which crypto to buy today. HYPE Price Surge Pushes Toward a Breakout Beyond $26.50 The recent 170% climb in the Hyperliquid (HYPE) price surge has brought renewed interest to the token. Now trading just under $26.50, HYPE has returned to levels not seen since its 2024 high, sparking new speculation about a possible breakout. Market indicators are supporting the trend. Both RSI and MACD show bullish signals, and the chart setup points to continued momentum. This Hyperliquid (HYPE) price surge also fits a broader impulsive move, which may still be developing. If HYPE can flip the $26.50 level into solid support, analysts see a path toward $35.30. Stellar (XLM) Price Forecast Projects 105% Rise If Momentum Continues The Stellar (XLM) price forecast has turned strongly positive as price action lines up with increasing market interest. Now trading around $0.32, XLM has jumped more than 50% from its April low. The move has broken a falling wedge and crossed neckline resistance in an inverse head and shoulders pattern. Analysts now point to a possible rise to $0.64, marking a 105% increase from current levels, assuming support stays firm. This Stellar (XLM) price forecast is backed by network activity, more stablecoin use, and growing talk of a potential XLM ETF. As long as $0.20 support holds, both technical and market signals suggest more upside may be on the way. Why 150M BDAG Is Moving Daily: What’s Driving Buyers to BlockDAG Most crypto presales move slowly. BlockDAG has changed that pattern. Its Buyer Battles system puts a daily amount of BDAG into play. If all coins are not bought within 24 hours, the leftover amount goes to the day’s highest buyer. The daily pool has now been raised to 150 million BDAG, responding directly to growing interest. That volume does not shift unless demand is real. And clearly, it is. With $254.5 million raised and 20.6 billion coins sold so far, BlockDAG’s presale is moving faster than expected. Every day offers a new start. And the timeline matters more now. With 20 exchange listings scheduled to be revealed on June 13, more participants are joining each round. That same date also marks the end of the $0.0020 fixed price, which is far lower than the current $0.0262 rate in batch 28. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles are not random rewards. They are built to create consistent activity. As the project nears a public launch, the chance to gain from this model is narrowing. Some forecasts see BDAG reaching $1, then $5, and eventually $10. But even without those long-term targets, the current math shows that those moving early in each cycle are already gaining an edge. Which Crypto to Buy Today? Compare the Structures Behind the Hype Gains are not only about price spikes. They also depend on how systems are set up. The 170% Hyperliquid (HYPE) price surge has brought attention to its $26.50 resistance level. Meanwhile, the Stellar (XLM) price forecast shows over 50% growth since April, with another 105% rise possible if it hits $0.64. Both of these coins are being driven by short-term price patterns and momentum. BlockDAG offers a different answer to the question, which crypto to buy today . With Buyer Battles allocating 150 million BDAG every day, the setup creates a race where the top buyer receives any unsold coins. With $254.5 million raised already and the $0.0020 fixed price ending on June 13, BlockDAG’s approach is not based on guesswork. It follows a process, and that structure is what is now drawing attention.

At the time of writing, HBAR is trading at $0.19. The HBAR price chart has possibly formed a five-wave upward pattern starting from the April low. In simple terms, this means the price made five moves up in a sequence — a pattern that often suggests a strong market trend. A larger market correction may have ended around April 7. Since then, the price appears to have moved higher, beginning a new uptrend. This recent rise could be wave 1 of a bigger bullish move. Correction Phase Likely Underway After this upward movement, it seems that HBAR has entered a correction phase. This is a normal part of price action, where markets take a short pause or pull back before deciding their next direction. This correction could follow a common ABC pattern, which is a typical way markets adjust after a rally. The support area for this correction is currently between 0.142 and 0.169. So far, HBAR has managed to hold above the higher end of this range, which is a positive sign. Market Outlook: What to Watch Next At the moment, there’s no clear sign that buyers are stepping in for a strong bullish reversal. However, the pace of the decline has started to slow down, which might be an early indication that the market is stabilizing. There’s also a more bullish scenario being considered, where HBAR could attempt a quicker move to the upside without falling much further. But for now, this outlook needs confirmation. Investors and traders should keep a close eye on the support levels. If the price stays above this zone, it could increase the chances of a new upward move in the coming sessions.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|HBAR,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-19 02:02:43
44791768,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=730403,1747620204,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44791768.jpeg,Crypto community rallies as Telegram founder Pavel Durov rejects EU censorship,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-backs-durov-against-eu-censorship/,"Telegram founder Pavel Durov has publicly rejected a request from a Western European government to censor conservative voices on the platform ahead of Romania’s presidential runoff election. In a Telegram post on May 18, Durov emphasized the importance of free speech and fair elections, stating, “You can’t ‘defend democracy’ by destroying democracy. You can’t ‘fight election interference’ by interfering with elections. You either have freedom of speech and fair elections — or you don’t. And the Romanian people deserve both.” Durov did not identify the government. But his deployment of a baguette emoji was broadly interpreted as invoking France. The timing raised concern, as Romania was amid a heated presidential election. There are also reports that the censorship request was designed to quash conservative commentary contrary to the official narrative. France’s foreign ministry has denied any involvement. It called for “respecting the democratic process” in Romania, a statement released by Reuters said. Despite this, many cheered Durov’s stand — particularly in the global crypto and tech communities. Crypto leaders praise Durov’s defiance Several leaders in the cryptocurrency community praised Mr. Durov’s defiance. Telegram has become a respected platform within crypto circles. He is viewed as a guardian of digital freedom — promoting privacy, encryption, and the freedom of expression. His Telegram app is popular with crypto developers, traders, and privacy advocates. The crypto community rallied around him after his May 18 post. Other tech leaders reposted his message, applauding him for taking a stand against government pressure. Some expressed the nudge as a “gold standard” to which other platforms should aspire during politically fraught times. Others cited Telegram’s history. While other platforms often cooperate with government takedown requests, Telegram has largely held out, keeping a hands-off approach — particularly around political speech. The platform has become a lifeline for independent voices in countries where media freedom is sagging. Durov’s position only reinforces that perception. Chris Pavlovski, the CEO of the free-speech video platform Rumble, also expressed his support. He said that more tech founders who were willing to take such a stand were needed. Freedom of speech and decentralization are two sides of the same coin, crypto advocates say. To them, Durov is not simply the steward of a messaging app — he is the defender of the communications infrastructure of free thought in the digital age. Durov’s arrest sparked free-speech debate Durov has had a tumultuous relationship with European governments. In August 2024, Durov was arrested at a Paris airport . French police alleged the arrest was connected to a criminal inquiry into the sharing of illegal content over Telegram, including alleged drug sales and extremism propaganda. The arrest sparked outrage. It was broadly viewed as a politically motivated push. Critics said France pressured Telegram to force the app to implement tighter controls and more censorship. On August 26, French President Emmanuel Macron denied these allegations, affirming France’s commitment to freedom of expression and communication. However, his statements did little to convince leaders in the crypto community. The chief executive of Helius Labs, Mert Mumtaz, said it was hypocritical for founders to be held personally responsible and face a potential 20-year prison sentence for failure to moderate speech while at the same time professing to care greatly about freedom of expression. Durov subsequently said that Telegram responds to valid law enforcement requests. The company has a lawyer in France and responds to such requests there. What was concerning, he said, was that authorities skirted this system and issued an arrest warrant instead. He called it not an attack on him but on the most fundamental values of law and justice.

The AFP-led Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT) said in a May 18 statement that it seized nearly 25 Bitcoin ( BTC ), alongside the mansion and car, which are together worth a total of 4.5 million Australian dollars ($2.88 million). The AFP said its investigation began in September 2018 after law enforcement in Luxembourg shared information about suspicious Bitcoin transactions that the agency claimed were connected to the Queensland man, who was previously convicted of hacking a US gaming company. A waterfront mansion in Queensland was confiscated under the allegation that it's linked to the theft of 950 Bitcoin. Source: Australian Federal Police The AFP claimed its investigation also linked the man to the theft of 950 Bitcoin stolen from a French crypto exchange in 2013. No criminal charges were laid over the Bitcoin theft; however, the AFP obtained a court forfeiture order of the property, car and Bitcoin in April under the claim that they could not be linked with “identifiable legitimate earnings.” AFP uses “unique powers” to seize assets Local media outlet 7NEWS reported that the owner of the confiscated assets is Shane Stephen Duffy , who pleaded guilty to fraud and computer hacking in 2016 for selling the personal data of League of Legends players. A cyberattack on League of Legends developer Riot Games in 2011 saw hackers obtain the details of more than 5 million users; Duffy was not accused of being involved in the hack, with prosecutors saying he got a copy of the data online and sold it for profit. Duffy was also accused of hacking the X account of Riot Games president Marc Merrill to publicize his data-selling business, which offered to sell access to the accounts of other League of Legends players. Related: Aussies lost $122 million to crypto scams in the last 12 months: AFP AFP Commander Jason Kennedy said in a statement that the agency has “unique powers” under the Proceeds of Crime Act to “restrain and forfeit” assets it suspects to be proceeds of crime, including cybercrime . Source: Australian Federal Police “The profits derived from criminal activities are also often used to fund further criminal acts, which is why the AFP works closely with our partners in the CACT to target the proceeds of crime and ensure they are reinvested in the community,” he said. The proceeds from selling the assets will be sent to a special purpose fund that supports crime prevention and law enforcement-related measures, the AFP said. Since July 2019, the CACT has used its power to restrain over $1.2 billion in assets, including houses, cars, yachts, crypto and fine art.

CME is one of the most respected derivatives exchanges in the world, and this move is a big milestone for XRP. As excitement builds around this announcement, let’s take a look at the latest price action for XRP and what traders should be watching in the days ahead. XRP Price Holding Key Support On the three-day chart, XRP is currently holding support just above the $2.30 level, specifically between $2.33 and $2.34. This area has been acting as a strong floor for the price in recent days. In the short term, as long as XRP remains above this support, there’s room for stability. However, if the price starts closing candles below $2.30, there’s a risk of a further decline. In that case, the next important support zone lies between $2.12 and $2.15. Resistance Levels to Watch If XRP manages to bounce from current levels, the next strong resistance between $2.56 and $2.62. This zone, known as a golden pocket resistance area, has historically acted as a barrier for upward moves. It will be a critical level to watch if the price attempts a recovery. Could a Bullish Pattern Be Forming? Despite the skeptical short-term outlook, there could be a bullish setup developing. If XRP drops further towards $2.12 — and then stages a solid rebound, it might form a large inverse head and shoulders pattern. This is a classic bullish chart formation that, if confirmed, could signal a significant upward move in the future. However, it’s important to note that this pattern has not yet formed or confirmed. It would require a further pullback, a clear bounce, and a breakout above the $2.56–$2.62 resistance zone to be considered valid.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-19 02:57:57

As institutional capital continues to pour into BTC and broader market sentiment strengthens, a handful of traders have been quietly accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE — and it’s now being dubbed 2025’s stealth breakout . THE MOST-WATCHED PRESALE OF 2025 – ACT NOW Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Quietly Leading the Altcoin Market MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned as one of the last remaining pre-listing altcoins with serious ROI potential , and investors are now recognizing it as the most overlooked outperformer of the cycle . With a fixed listing target of $0.007 and Stage 9 imminent , MAGA has already outpaced the growth of larger-cap coins in recent months — and many analysts expect this trend to continue post-listing. What’s fueling its outperformance: A clean, early-stage entry model with defined ROI estimates A cultural and political identity that resonates with its community Aggressive capital inflow ahead of listing-driven demand While SOL and XRP have made modest gains, MAGA is proving that pre-launch positioning still delivers unmatched results when done at the right time . Bitcoin’s Meteoric Rise Is Powering the Whole Market Bitcoin (BTC) is setting the tone for the 2025 bull cycle. Trading well above $103K , BTC is holding momentum from ETF inflows, macro hedge narratives, and widespread adoption from institutional finance. Price targets for Bitcoin now range between $150K and $250K , and its steady rise is laying the foundation for capital to flow into higher-risk, high-reward altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE . BTC may dominate the headlines — but the real growth opportunities are showing up in the altcoins riding that wave. Solana (SOL) Cools After a Strong Q1 Rally Solana (SOL) remains one of the most technically impressive Layer-1 chains in the ecosystem. But after a significant Q1 run, SOL is now consolidating in the $165–$180 range — giving up momentum to newer, faster-moving tokens. While analysts still maintain long-term targets above $250 , short-term upside appears limited — and many investors are rotating a portion of their SOL holdings into smaller-cap entries like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capitalize on faster gains. Stellar (XLM) Moves Slowly Despite Market Strength Stellar (XLM) continues to follow market trends but remains one of the slower-moving assets in 2025. Despite its solid utility in payments and interoperability, XLM is still ranging near $0.23–$0.25 , lagging far behind other altcoins in terms of return potential. While XLM may serve as a steady hold, it’s not drawing breakout-level capital — and for investors seeking 10x+ growth, attention is shifting toward early-stage momentum coins like MAGACOIN FINANCE . MASSIVE DEMAND, LIMITED SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise is real. But it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that is delivering the kind of performance altcoin traders dream about — outpacing Solana and XRP by 10x , with more room to run. With Stage 9 on the horizon and listing targets locked in, MAGA is quickly becoming the highest-performing altcoin of the cycle so far , and one of the last remaining entries with realistic exponential upside still on the table.

Meanwhile, BONK price is sitting at a tipping point, where a breakout could lead to a 155% climb. As both handle market uncertainty, BlockDAG (BDAG) is moving differently. BlockDAG has sold 20.6 billion coins and locked in a price of $0.0020 until June 13. Its Buyer Battles, which now distribute 150 million coins daily, have helped draw in over 170,000 unique holders. This system is turning heads among those watching for market-moving opportunities. Monero (XMR) Price Projection 2025: Can It Hit $767 or Drop to $255? The Monero (XMR) price projection for 2025 reflects uncertainty. Analysts expect a possible dip to $255.84 if conditions stay weak, while a stronger market could lift it to $767.51. That puts the average Monero (XMR) price projection at $511.67, offering a midpoint between downside risk and growth potential. Looking further ahead to 2030, the forecast turns more optimistic. Projections range from a low of $1,942.76 to a high of $5,828.30, with an average near $3,885.53. These figures underline Monero’s appeal for long-term tracking, even as short-term swings remain part of the picture. BONK Price Holds Steady, but Can It Beat the Downtrend? BONK price is now testing a key supply area, a zone that has previously led to downward movement. Past reactions at this level have caused lower highs and longer declines, similar to the recent six-day pullback. If this pattern holds, a further dip could follow. Still, a clear breakout above this resistance could flip the outlook. If momentum builds, BONK price may rise to $0.00003689 for a 51% gain, or even $0.00006230 for a 155% move. Despite $4 million in sell pressure, the Open Interest Weighted Funding Rate has stayed positive for 20 straight days. That signals buyer strength and continued support for BONK’s recovery path. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battle Turns Up the Heat with 150M Coin Race What began as a reward initiative has now become one of the fastest-moving events in the crypto space. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles have turned into a fierce daily challenge, with the largest BDAG buyer of the day claiming whatever is left of a 150 million coin pool. No extra steps or sign-ups, just a race where one top buyer walks away with the prize. This approach has helped BlockDAG pass $254.5 million in presale funds and move more than 20.6 billion coins. The community is also growing, with more than 170,000 unique participants involved. The current price is fixed at $0.0020 until June 13. That’s a big deal considering the listing price is set at $0.05, and the presale has already jumped from $0.001 in Batch 1 to $0.0262 in Batch 28, reflecting a 2520% gain so far. Five exchanges have already been named, and 15 more will be announced soon. With short-term forecasts placing BDAG at $1 and long-range estimates going as high as $10, the interest surrounding this daily coin competition is growing fast. The countdown is on, and the daily Buyer Battles are adding real-time pressure to act before the final stage closes. The Bottom Line The Monero (XMR) price projection for 2025 covers a wide range. It could fall to $255.84 if conditions worsen or rise to $767.51 if the market moves in its favor. The average estimate sits at $511.67. Looking out to 2030, forecasts stretch from $1,942.76 to $5,828.30, giving it plenty of room for future gains if the trend continues. Meanwhile, BONK price is sitting at a critical resistance zone. This area has previously led to downturns, but if BONK can push past it, the upside could reach 155%. The first short-term target is $0.00003689, with $0.00006230 in view if the breakout holds. Despite a $4 million sell-off recently, bullish sentiment remains strong, supported by positive funding data for more than 20 days. While both Monero and BONK are navigating their own paths within the list of popular crypto coins, BlockDAG is gaining traction with its unique crypto presale strategy and daily competition structure.

ETH is now struggling and might decline toward the $2,220 support zone. Ethereum started a correction from the $2,580 zone and tested $2,320. The price is trading below $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,540 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain strength if it clears the $2,550 resistance in the near term. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price struggled to clear the $2,520 resistance and started a downside correction, unlike Bitcoin . ETH traded below the $2,500 and $2,440 support levels. The bears were able to push the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,308 swing low to the $2,509 high. The price even spiked below the $2,440 level, but the bulls were active near the $2,400 zone. The price is stable above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,308 swing low to the $2,509 high. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,540 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. If there is another increase, the price could face resistance near the $2,460 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,500 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,550 level and the trend line. A clear move above the $2,550 resistance might send the price toward the $2,580 resistance. An upside break above the $2,580 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,700 resistance zone or even $2,780 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,500 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,400 level. The first major support sits near the $2,350 zone. A clear move below the $2,350 support might push the price toward the $2,320 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,220 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,120.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) has closed at a weekly gain for the past six weeks in a row, and its most recent close at midnight UTC on May 18 was its highest weekly close ever at just below $106,500, according to TradingView. Its last highest weekly close was in December when it reached $104,400. It later went on to reach an all-time high of $109,358 on Jan. 20, according to TradingView. Bitcoin is now less than 3% away from its peak price and has gained 2% over the past 24 hours to trade around $104,730 at the time of writing. Bitcoin also posted its highest-ever close in a 24-hour period on May 18. However, this is not the largest daily gain Bitcoin has made. “Bitcoin just had its highest daily candle close... ever,” investor Scott Melker posted to X on May 19. With a daily close above $105,000, “Bitcoin will develop a brand new higher high,” said analyst Rekt Capital. BTC/USD weekly timeframe. Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s weekly gains over the past six weeks are mirroring its gains in November when it added $30,000 in three of its largest weekly candles ever. It has added around $12,000 so far in May, climbing from $94,000 to over $106,000 before it pulled back to around $105,400. Related: BTC price to $116K next?

The “strength of this bid on a Sunday night feels strange,” they said, adding its “possible someone knows some important news dropping next week.” Bitcoin’s CAGR cools down On May 18, analyst Willy Woo dived into Bitcoin’s compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ), noting that it was trending downward as the network continues to store more capital. “BTC is now traded as the newest macro asset in 150 years, it'll continue to absorb capital until it reaches its equilibrium,” he said. Woo compared it to long-term monetary expansion of 5% and GDP growth of 3%, estimating that Bitcoin’s annual growth rate will be around 8% in around 15 to 20 years when it has settled. “Until then, enjoy the ride because almost no publicly investable product can match BTC performance long term, even as BTC's CAGR continues to erode.” Bitcoin annualized growth rate.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Solana, and XRP Could Be the Best Trio to Ride This Wave",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-to-1m-magacoin-finance-solana-and-xrp-could-be-the-best-trio-to-ride-this-wave/,"Introduction The crypto market is once again flirting with a bold possibility — Bitcoin reaching $1 million . Whether it’s hyperinflation, institutional accumulation, or ETF-driven demand, the scenario is no longer far-fetched. But while Bitcoin sets the macro tone, smart investors are turning their focus to a trio of altcoins that could ride that momentum with 10x, 50x, or even 100x multipliers . The top names on that list? MAGACOIN FINANCE , Solana, and XRP — joined by politically charged tokens like OFFICIALTRUMP as a rising narrative force. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Being Viewed as the Smartest Asymmetric Play MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a core early-stage allocation among traders seeking pre-listing upside with real structure behind it. With a listing price of $0.007 and Stage 9 now imminent , MAGA offers one of the few clear-cut high-momentum entries remaining in the 2025 cycle. Here’s why MAGA could outperform even in a Bitcoin-driven run: Projected 25x–35x return window from current presale levels Cultural and political alignment that appeals to a distinct retail base A structured, time-sensitive model that mirrors early DOGE and SHIBA patterns — but with a fixed listing roadmap As Bitcoin drives capital into crypto at scale, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be one of the most leveraged plays in the altcoin landscape — and with listings coming, that window is narrowing. Solana (SOL) Continues to Outperform the Layer-1 Sector Solana (SOL) is trading firmly in the $165–$180 range and continues to be one of the most technically competitive Layer-1 platforms in crypto. As institutional interest rotates from Ethereum into faster ecosystems, Solana is leading that trend. SOL is: Dominating DeFi growth metrics Powering NFT and Web3 apps Scaling with real user activity Analysts are now projecting $250–$400 price targets for Solana this year — with some even calling for a shot at $600 if capital rotation and L2 congestion on Ethereum persist. For those following the Bitcoin wave, Solana is a must-have in the infrastructure category . CLICK HERE – SECURE YOUR SPOT BEFORE 25x DISAPPEARS XRP Remains the Institutional Gateway to Blockchain Finance XRP holds its value as a bridge asset — and its upcoming CME futures launch is set to amplify liquidity, visibility, and use case relevance. Trading above $2.30 , XRP has emerged from legal battles stronger than ever. Key drivers: U.S. regulatory clarity Ongoing real-world payment integrations Speculation around a potential XRP-based ETF With targets of $5–$15 in the near term, XRP continues to be the institutional altcoin of choice — and smart portfolios are building positions as capital flows out of the sidelines and into payment-based infrastructure tokens. OFFICIALTRUMP and the Rise of Narrative-Driven Crypto OFFICIALTRUMP represents a new wave of politically aligned crypto assets that blend identity, ideology, and meme-level virality . While not a utility coin, it has gathered momentum among retail traders seeking narrative-backed exposure. It’s part of a broader trend: crypto is no longer just about infrastructure — it’s about movements, branding, and timing . That’s exactly why many are pairing OFFICIALTRUMP with MAGACOIN FINANCE — two tokens that could capitalize on political cycles and viral attention simultaneously . Conclusion Bitcoin might be on a path to $1 million — but the most dramatic gains will come from altcoins that ride the wave early, fast, and loud . Solana brings infrastructure speed. XRP delivers global payments reach. OFFICIALTRUMP fuels political momentum. And MAGACOIN FINANCE? That’s the undiscovered multiplier. As Stage 9 nears and listings become the next big catalyst, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the most strategic asymmetric bet of the entire 2025 cycle .

Is a new all-time high coming this week?",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-logged-its-highest-weekly-close-ever/,"Bitcoin just made history. For the first time, it closed a weekly candle above $107,000, briefly reaching that price before easing back to $105,000. The rally puts it less than 3% away from its all-time high, and right now, it’s trading around $104,300, according to data from CoinGecko. Over the past six weeks, Bitcoin has added serious gains, similar to the November 2021 run where three massive candles pushed it up $30,000. In May alone, it’s already gained $13,000, rising from $94,000 to over $107,000. This breakout comes as Metaplanet, the Japanese public company that follows Strategy’s strategy, confirmed a fresh purchase of 1,004 Bitcoin for $104 million. That brings its total holdings to 7,800 BTC, now worth approximately $812 million, as the company has publicly been stacking for months. Arthur Hayes explains why more upside is likely Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, told Fortune that the US government is quietly spending more than it’s officially disclosing. He said the Treasury General Account dropped from $750 billion to $450 billion this quarter because of so-called “extraordinary measures” that let the government spend without technically raising new debt. “It’s confusing,” Arthur said, “because we are in a period of the debt ceiling. So the US government cannot borrow net more money. There are various different ways in which they can spend money and still remain underneath the debt ceiling.” He also pointed out that from January to March 2025, Treasury borrowing was up 22% compared to the same period last year. “The deficit is higher,” he added. Arthur believes the Treasury Secretary, Janet Bessent, will need to issue even more debt going forward. “Therefore he needs to find a way for these individuals to obtain as much leverage as possible through the banking system and ultimately that means that there’s more dollars floating around in the world because the US government is spending more money on stuff.” Arthur added that this rise in liquidity is exactly why Bitcoin bottomed on April 9th and why he expects prices to go much higher. “I think Bitcoin needs to go above $110K and increasing volumes reach $150K–$200K,” Arthur said. “I think that happens sometimes in the summer or early third quarter and then the rotation starts into various altcoins.” He doesn’t expect altcoins to perform like they did in 2021 though. “We’ll have a new narrative,” he said, “but the old dino coins in your portfolio that aren’t moving probably aren’t moving for a reason. I think a lot of those coins have high FDV, low float, no customers, no revenue, just some CEX listings. That went down 95%. I don’t really see why those should do well in the next cycle.” Realized Cap hits new record as ETFs push higher Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s realized capitalization just broke its record again. For the fourth straight week, the total value of all UTXOs is now at $906 billion as of May 18, up from $891.6 billion just ten days earlier. That’s a 1.61% increase, driven by the ton of new capital entering the market. Source: CryptoQuant Over the same period, Bitcoin has been consolidating around $104,731, a key resistance level. Once that wall is cleared, the next stop is $107,757, and after that, a possible break into new highs. During this 10-day range, the largest growth came from addresses holding 100 to 1000 BTC. These wallets increased their stash by 122,540 BTC, going from 5.56 million BTC to 5.68 million BTC—a 2.2% gain. That kind of growth in that band signals mid-sized whales are still actively accumulating, not selling. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US are also pulling serious weight. Net inflows for the week hit $608 million, building on the momentum from previous weeks. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust led the charge, with inflows over $840 million, more than every other ETF combined. While some ETFs trimmed their positions or held steady, BlackRock stood out. It was the only major fund to increase its Bitcoin holdings, going from 621,600 BTC to 631,902 BTC. That’s an addition of 10,302 BTC, which equals a 1.66% increase.

The price is now consolidating and might extend losses below the $2.320 support zone. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.520 zone. The price is now trading below $2.480 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.3550 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if it stays above the $2.350 support. XRP Price Dips Again XRP price attempted a fresh increase above the $2.350 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . However, the bears were active near the $2.450 zone. A high was formed at $2.4495 and the price is now moving lower. There was a drop below the $2.40 support level. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.299 swing low to the $2.449 high. However, the bulls are now active near the $2.350 support. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.3550 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair.

The first major resistance is near the $2.450 level. The next resistance is $2.50. A clear move above the $2.50 resistance might send the price toward the $2.60 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance or even $2.680 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.80. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.450 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.3550 level. The next major support is near the $2.320 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.320 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.20 support. The next major support sits near the $2.120 zone.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Ethereum Are Gearing Up for a Massive Run",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/hidden-crypto-treasure-magacoin-finance-xrp-and-ethereum-are-gearing-up-for-a-massive-run/,"Introduction In every crypto cycle, there’s a handful of tokens that deliver quietly at first — then erupt. As 2025 heats up, all signs are pointing toward Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Cosmos (ATOM), and MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) as the projects gearing up for a major run . While ETH and XRP are preparing for institutional momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is catching attention as a hidden early-stage altcoin that may soon exit obscurity and enter the spotlight — with price action to match. THE MOST-WATCHED PRESALE OF 2025 – ACT NOW Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Being Called a Hidden Gem MAGACOIN FINANCE is rising fast through the ranks of speculative investor watchlists — and for good reason. With a listing price target of $0.007 and Stage 9 now imminent , MAGA is being positioned as one of the final undiscovered altcoins with realistic 25x–35x upside still available in the presale phase. Why analysts see MAGA as a “crypto treasure”: Undervalued in market exposure, but structured for maximum ROI Politically bold positioning that gives it viral potential Transparent listing mechanics and clean tokenomics As other coins consolidate or chase headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly securing capital — and preparing to make its move just before listings rewrite its valuation. XRP Builds Toward Utility-Driven Breakout XRP continues to show strength above $2.30 , with institutional narratives driving momentum. Following U.S. legal clarity, XRP is now widely seen as the core payment infrastructure token for blockchain-based financial networks. Its next leg up could be triggered by: The launch of CME futures Expanding on-chain settlement adoption Speculation around future ETF integrations Forecasts range from $5 to $15 , and many XRP holders are taking parallel positions in MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture upside from both ends of the risk curve. Ethereum Remains the Infrastructure Giant Ethereum (ETH) still leads the market in smart contract and Layer-2 infrastructure — and as ETF conversations escalate, ETH’s positioning only grows stronger. Currently trading near $2,600 , Ethereum is widely expected to move toward $4,000–$6,000 , with Layer-2 scaling and institutional flows adding fuel. Its importance? Ethereum is the network backbone — and the coin that institutional investors trust most when entering crypto. But for exponential ROI, many are complementing their ETH positions with earlier-phase assets like MAGA. Cosmos (ATOM) Returns to the Conversation Cosmos (ATOM) has quietly re-entered the altcoin narrative, as multichain infrastructure and app-chain development pick up. Trading near the $4–$4.75 range, ATOM is benefiting from renewed developer interest and Layer-0 relevance. Cosmos enables sovereign blockchains to interoperate, and with the next phase of DeFi and gaming moving cross-chain, ATOM could become a foundational layer for the ecosystem’s expansion. While it may not 50x, it provides long-term conviction — and analysts see it as a strong pair with more speculative entries like MAGACOIN FINANCE. MASSIVE DEMAND, LIMITED SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Not all top performers shout the loudest — some rise quietly, building momentum behind the scenes before exploding into view. That’s the case for MAGACOIN FINANCE , a project that many are now calling one of the last hidden treasures in the 2025 cycle . Alongside heavyweights like Ethereum, XRP, and Cosmos, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining serious ground — and with listings coming soon, it may not be hidden for much longer.

If all goes as planned, this could be a game-changer for XRP, drawing in institutional money and paving the way for spot XRP ETFs. XRP ETF Approval Odds Increase Polymarket traders have also raised their bets on an XRP ETF approval this year to 83%, despite the recent bearish sentiment. Bloomberg analysts have also raised the odds of approval to 85%, over rising institutional interest and a fair regulatory environment. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) launching XRP futures contracts could be seen as a major step toward institutional adoption.

BREAKING: CME $XRP FUTURES GO LIVE TOMORROW! pic.twitter.com/1Hc4BMEIo7 — Good Morning Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) May 18, 2025 The launch of XRP futures would allow financial firms to create ETFs that track XRP prices, similar to the ProShares Bitcoin ETF, which tracks CME Bitcoin futures. But some are concerned that since no one’s actually holding XRP in futures contracts, the price is not going to move. Nevertheless, today’s launch is expected to increase the market liquidity and attract institutions towards trading and hedging XRP in a regulated manner. Also, regulated futures are often a prerequisite for spot ETF approvals. The added visibility from a CME listing could further boost its market position. New XRP ETF Shows Huge Inflows Despite Price Drop The recently launched Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF (XXRP) has been showing steady growth, with over $106 million in assets since its April debut, data from ETF.com shows.

Alibaba’s stock fell as much as 4% on Monday in Hong Kong. Officials are concerned about what user data might be shared with Alibaba and whether the company has made commitments with Chinese regulators. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd stock price. Source: Google Finance Lawmakers are publicly pressing Apple for details of the Alibaba deal Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, called Alibaba “a poster child for the Chinese Communist Party’s military-civil fusion strategy.” He said it was “extremely disturbing” that Apple “has not been transparent about its agreement.” Only Alibaba has confirmed the deal in public. Apple has remained silent, and the scrutiny adds to the many ways rising U.S.–China tensions threaten the iPhone maker’s business. The dispute lands at a rough moment for Alibaba. The e-commerce giant’s shares had already been sliding after its latest quarterly revenue missed analyst expectations, denting enthusiasm that earlier framed the company as a leader in the DeepSeek-fueled AI surge. Back in February, Chairman Joseph Tsai told investors that future iPhones would use Alibaba’s AI tools, a comment that helped power a sharp rally at the time. His remarks boosted confidence that domestic AI champions could work with global consumer brands. The overall Asian market drifted lower Asian equities broadly weakened on Monday as investors weighed mixed signals from the world’s largest economies. Regional risk appetite remained notably cautious. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 moved modestly, with traders waiting for Tuesday’s Reserve Bank of Australia decision. Economists expect the RBA to trim its benchmark rate by 25 basis points amid cooling inflation, though they also predict a cautious tone on further cuts because of lingering domestic and global risks. Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.3 percent and the broader TOPIX edged down 0.1 percent, extending losses that began after a weak gross domestic product reading on Friday. Markets are now watching April consumer-price figures, due later this week, for guidance on the Bank of Japan’s next move on interest rates. South Korea’s KOSPI dropped 0.7 percent, while Singapore’s Straits Times Index fell 0.3 percent.

Since then ADA price has quietly shown strength again, and continues to consolidate sideways, while prominent analyst Ali Martinez believes that the Cardano price could push towards $1 soon , fueling the bullish sentiment in the market. Interestingly, big ADA holders are still buying more ADA. This comes as market excitement grows due to a possible DeFi partnership between Cardano and Litecoin, and growing hopes of an ETF approval. Cardano Price Eyes the $1 According to Ali, ADA pulled back slightly after reaching a high near $0.88, but it found strong support around $0.74, right at the lower end of its upward channel. This zone has acted like a safety net, as ADA has been moving within a rising channel since mid-April. For traders, this setup is often seen as a sign that the token might be preparing for another leg up. Ali noted that if ADA can stay above $0.74 and continue following the trend channel, there’s a chance it could retest previous highs of $0.88 or even aim beyond $1. If the current structure on #Cardano $ADA is an ascending channel, holding above $0.72 could pave the way for an upswing toward $0.92. pic.twitter.com/vgNNfuudPd — Ali (@ali_charts) May 18, 2025 Whales Are Buying Big Backing the technical setup is a wave of whale activity. In just the past 48 hours, large wallets have purchased over 80 million ADA , according to blockchain platform Santiment. When whales start buying, it often means something big is coming. As of now, Cardano’s price is trading around $0.725, reflecting a drop of 2% seen in the last 24 hours, with a market cap of $23.5 billion. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction: Will XRP Remain Consolidated Below $2.5 Throughout Q2 2025? , Cardano and Litecoin Working Together? Another reason for the excitement is a possible DeFi partnership between Cardano and Litecoin. Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, confirmed his support for the Litecoin community and hinted at a new collaboration. This could happen through Cardano’s upcoming privacy-focused project called Midnight . If confirmed, this would be a rare and powerful cross-chain partnership between two well-established blockchains. ETF Hopes to Lift Sentiment Meanwhile, Cardano’s regulatory outlook is improving. According to Polymarket, the chances of a Cardano spot ETF being approved this year have jumped from 45% to 64% in just one day. This shows that investors believe Cardano could soon be part of the traditional financial world. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ripple Effect Teaser Triggers Speculation On May 17, BitMEX posted a GIF showing ripple effects with the caption, “news that’s gonna have a @ripple effect on the market.” The X post has racked up nearly half a million views, fueling speculation that a major Ripple announcement is around the corner. While no details have been confirmed, the wordplay strongly suggests more than marketing banter. XRP Derivatives Coming to BitMEX? The post has led many traders to believe BitMEX might soon integrate XRP or launch new derivative products tied to the asset. Known for pioneering leveraged crypto trading, BitMEX’s entering the XRP market could attract fresh trader interest and lend additional legitimacy to Ripple’s ecosystem. With XRP currently trading between $2.3 and $2.45, a confirmed BitMEX-Ripple tie-up could trigger a bullish breakout. Market interest in XRP has already been on the rise following Ripple’s improved legal standing in the U.S., and a new partnership could amplify that momentum. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Spot ETF News: Odds Rise To 83%, SEC Decision in June? , XRP Price Analysis Analyst Egrag Crypto believes XRP could skyrocket to $27, citing Fibonacci levels and chart breakouts as proof of a bullish long-term setup. More grounded predictions from traders suggest levels like $6.22 and $7.68 as achievable milestones. While those figures are ambitious, short-term targets like $3 seem well within reach if bullish sentiment holds. With speculation mounting and the official details still under wraps, the XRP market is on high alert. A real collaboration announcement could be the spark bulls are waiting for. On the other hand, crypto analyst CryptoGeek believes that if XRP succeeds in capturing the $27 trillion U.S. Treasury bill market, its price could soar to $482.48 per coin. This would represent a staggering 790x surge from current levels. While highly speculative, the post highlights the growing bullish sentiment around XRP’s potential role in global finance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

His comments come as the Bitcoin community debates the growing strain of embedded data like JPEGs on the network’s efficiency. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is seeing renewed price optimism, with analysts such as Scott Melker forecasting a potential run to $250,000 by year-end. Saifedean Ammous Supports Fight Against Bitcoin Spam Inscriptions as Developer Tensions Escalate A heated debate has reignited in the Bitcoin development community over the persistent rise of spam inscriptions on the network — with prominent economist and Bitcoin advocate Saifedean Ammous now offering to contribute financially to efforts aimed at curbing the controversial practice. The dispute centers on a proposal that would enable node operators to more easily filter non-financial inscriptions, often used to embed JPEGs and other arbitrary data, which critics argue bloat the Bitcoin blockchain and distort its purpose as a monetary protocol. The conversation began when pseudonymous developer GrassFedBitcoin called attention to pull request #28408 in Bitcoin Core’s GitHub repository. The pull request, if merged, would allow node operators to reject certain inscription formats by default, giving users more granular control over what their node relays. GrassFedBitcoin didn’t mince words in his assessment of the problem: “No one running a node wants to relay inscriptions,” he wrote on X. He criticized the historical decisions that increased Bitcoin’s OP_RETURN limits, which are now being exploited to store arbitrary files such as NFTs, and argued that the feature was abused under “false assumptions” that it would not lead to significant blockchain bloat. For inscription critics like GrassFedBitcoin, the trend undermines Bitcoin’s primary value proposition — a global, decentralized settlement layer optimized for sound money, not digital artwork. Ammous: “It’s Worth Trying to Bankrupt the Spammers” Enter Saifedean Ammous, a vocal advocate for Bitcoin minimalism and the author of the widely cited book The Bitcoin Standard. Ammous publicly endorsed the initiative, declaring that he would “throw in a few sats” to fund a full-time developer whose job is to make inscription-based spam “more difficult and expensive.” Saifedean Ammous shares his take (Source: X) Drawing a parallel to email spam, Ammous stated, “It’s not easy, but it’s worth trying to help bankrupt the spammers faster.” Crucially, he refuted the notion that inscription filtering amounts to censorship. “Fighting spam is not censorship,” he emphasized, noting that full node operators already choose to reject invalid or non-standard transactions as a matter of policy. His controversial stance even went so far as to advocate hiring external developers to overwhelm spam-producing systems and “deprecate” the work of those enabling or building around non-monetary use cases for Bitcoin. Not all thought leaders are aligned on the path forward. Adam Back, CEO of Bitcoin infrastructure company Blockstream, offered a stark rebuttal. Back warned that any attempt to filter inscriptions will result in a perpetual “arms race,” as spam developers find ever-more creative ways to embed their data within valid Bitcoin transactions. His concerns reflect a core tension in Bitcoin's architecture: the desire for permissionless innovation versus the imperative to preserve the network’s long-term efficiency and integrity. Community Sentiment: Unwilling QA Engineers? The escalating rhetoric sparked a wave of community reactions. One participant in the discussion likened the developers behind inscription tools to “unwilling QA engineers” — essentially helping Bitcoin Core harden its software by discovering new attack vectors. Another user quipped that developers working on spam inscription projects should be treated as bug reporters, with every trick they employ being swiftly “unstandardized.” The implication is clear: rather than engaging in a moral or philosophical debate over whether JPEGs belong on Bitcoin, some believe the answer lies in relentless code hardening, neutralizing spam through technical superiority rather than ideological consensus. The urgency of the debate is underscored by hard data. According to a Feb. 4 report from Mempool Research, widespread adoption of inscriptions could drive Bitcoin’s average block size as high as 4 megabytes per block, which is more than double the current average of 1.5 MB. In practical terms, this increased load could lead to longer confirmation times and higher fees, especially during peak network activity. This block size inflation also revives concerns from the “block size wars” of the past decade, when the community famously split over whether to increase Bitcoin’s block size to accommodate more data, resulting in the creation of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Inscriptions, Ordinals, and Bitcoin’s Future The broader issue ties directly into the Bitcoin Ordinals phenomenon, a practice popularized in 2023 that allows users to inscribe data directly onto individual satoshis. While many celebrate Ordinals for enabling NFT-like capabilities on Bitcoin, others see them as a parasitic use case that undermines scalability and clutters the blockchain with non-essential data. Ammous and his supporters argue that allowing Bitcoin’s blockspace to be consumed by inscriptions threatens its role as the world’s most robust and secure monetary protocol. In their view, every byte used for non-financial data increases the cost of running a full node and puts undue pressure on users who want to use Bitcoin purely for economic exchange. For now, pull request #28408 remains unmerged, and the future of inscription filtering hangs in the balance. But with prominent voices like Ammous escalating the pressure and likening the problem to an existential threat akin to email spam, the issue seems unlikely to fade quietly. Bitcoin to $250K in 2025? Analyst Scott Melker Says It’s ‘Totally Possible’ as Institutional Momentum Grows In related news, Bitcoin may be poised for a parabolic move toward $250,000 by the end of 2025, according to prominent crypto analyst Scott Melker, who believes a rare confluence of macro and market dynamics could trigger the next explosive rally. Known for hosting The Wolf of All Streets podcast, Melker offered the bold prediction in a recent interview, pointing to Bitcoin’s maturing volatility profile and deepening institutional adoption as catalysts. “$250K this year? Totally possible,” Melker asserted , suggesting that while such a surge might seem extreme to outsiders, it’s well within the bounds of historical crypto price behavior. With Bitcoin currently trading above $100K, that would imply a more-than-double price increase within the next seven months. But Melker argues the conditions for such a move are increasingly falling into place. Bitcoin price chart (Source: CoinMarketCap) One of Melker’s key observations is that Bitcoin’s historic volatility, long viewed as a double-edged sword, is quietly fading. “It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times,” he explained. This reduction in volatility, he said, is not accidental. It's the result of deeper integration with traditional finance. From pension funds to major asset managers, long-term institutional holders are entering the Bitcoin market in greater numbers, leading to more stable price action and long-term accumulation. Melker emphasized that this is not merely anecdotal. The launch and success of Bitcoin spot ETFs, alongside broader Wall Street participation, are actively reshaping Bitcoin’s behavior as a financial asset. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the more long-term holders get involved, the less volatility there’s going to be,” he said. 2025 Off to a Strong Start for Crypto Markets So far, 2025 has validated Melker’s bullish tone. Bitcoin has climbed beyond $103,000, and Ethereum has rebounded above $2,600. The market-wide strength is not limited to the majors either, altcoins have started to gain traction, driven by rising trading volume and risk appetite. One of the biggest milestones of the year came when Coinbase was added to the S&P 500, not just as a constituent but among the top 50 companies by market cap. Melker flagged this development as a game-changer, reinforcing how deeply embedded crypto firms have become in global financial systems. He also highlighted recent public listings from companies like Galaxy Digital and eToro, signaling renewed confidence in regulatory clarity and policy tailwinds. Melker’s optimism is further bolstered by recent regulatory easing in the United States. The SEC’s decision to drop several lawsuits against major crypto firms, along with favorable executive orders aimed at fostering blockchain innovation, have helped restore investor confidence. This shift, he argues, is a major departure from the regulatory headwinds that plagued previous market cycles, and it sets the stage for more sustainable capital inflows into the space. While Bitcoin remains the flagship asset, Melker noted that Ethereum and smaller-cap altcoins have started to outperform, which is a sign that “new money” may be entering the market. The ETH/BTC ratio has ticked upward, and tokens across decentralized finance (DeFi), artificial intelligence (AI), and layer-2 scaling solutions have begun posting double-digit percentage gains — typical of early-stage bull markets. This altcoin resurgence, Melker suggested, reflects a broader market confidence that Bitcoin’s rise is not isolated but part of a wider crypto ecosystem rally. $250K Still a Long Shot — But Not Unprecedented Despite the bullish case, Melker tempered his forecast with a dose of realism, saying that most experts are forecasting highs between $120K and $150K. However, he was quick to point out that crypto markets are no stranger to explosive surges. “From the 2020 lows to the last bull market, Bitcoin went from $3,000 to $69,000. A 2.5x from here wouldn’t be a big deal.” Other analysts agree that a six-figure Bitcoin is within reach. On May 16, the analytics account Apsk32 shared projections that Bitcoin has a “decent chance” of hitting $250K or more in 2025, especially as macroeconomic instability pushes investors toward ”digital gold” hedging strategies. Even Presto’s head of research Peter Chung has doubled down on his $210K prediction, while Standard Chartered and Intellectia AI analysts have echoed similar sentiments, citing rising ETF inflows and a global appetite for alternative stores of value. A Perfect Storm for Bitcoin? With diminishing volatility, deepening institutional interest, favorable regulatory shifts, and growing altcoin momentum, the pieces appear to be aligning for a massive move upward in crypto markets. Melker’s $250,000 prediction might not be consensus, but it’s gaining traction among a growing list of analysts.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-19 05:00:00

The token has been range-bound between $2.32 and $2.62 for the past week and is currently holding steady at $2.37, up just 0.7% in the last day. Even though the price has been moving sideways, market activity has risen dramatically. The 24-hour trading volume of XRP ( XRP ) increased 46.8% to $3.2 billion, showing renewed interest among traders. Meanwhile, open interest has decreased by 0.26%, but derivatives volume is up by 48%, as per Coinglass data . This discrepancy points to a rise in short-term positioning without long-term conviction, perhaps in preparation for the upcoming derivatives launch. CME Group, the world’s largest regulated derivatives marketplace, plans to introduce XRP and Micro XRP futures contracts on May 19, pending final regulatory approval. According to CME Group’s notice on April 24, each contract will be cash-settled based on the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate and represent 50,000 and 2,500 XRP, respectively.

As the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, XRP’s inclusion in CME’s portfolio may pave the way for greater institutional involvement. From a technical perspective, XRP is currently in a consolidation stage. With no discernible momentum in either direction, key indicators such as the relative strength index and the MACD point to a neutral trend. The longer-term trend is still in place as XRP is still above the majority of its mid- and long-term moving averages, including the 50-day and 200-day averages. XRP price analysis.

On the upside, resistance is forming around $2.60. A breakout could lead to a retest of the highs from April above $2.80. Traders are keeping a close eye on whether institutional demand through CME will provide the momentum required to end XRP’s current consolidation, with volatility expected to return amid the launch.

While Blum clarified that Smerkis is no longer involved in the project, his arrest caused a lot of community concerns over the project's anticipated BLUM token airdrop. Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, police dismantled a $15 million cross-border crypto laundering ring involving more than 500 bank accounts and 12 arrests. In the US, Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm is pushing back against federal charges by arguing prosecutors withheld crucial FinCEN evidence that suggests non-custodial mixers like Tornado Cash do not qualify as money transmitters. Vladimir Smerkis Arrested in Moscow Vladimir Smerkis, the co-founder of the Telegram-based crypto project Blum, was arrested in Moscow on suspicion of large-scale fraud. The Zamoskvoretsky District Court approved a request to detain Smerkis while investigations continue. The charges fall under Article 159 of the Russian Criminal Code, which could carry a prison sentence of 2 to 12 years. Russian state media outlet TASS reported the news on May 18, though it's still unclear whether formal charges have been filed. Smerkis previously led Binance's operations in Russia, and is allegedly linked to investor losses totaling around $15 million from his earlier ventures, The Token Fund and Tokenbox, which were both launched in 2017. According to Russian news outlet Mash , these projects are the focus of the fraud investigation, not Blum. In response, Blum publicly confirmed on X that Smerkis stepped down from his position as chief marketing officer and is no longer involved with the project in any way. Despite the controversy, Blum stated that it is still committed to its development roadmap and that day-to-day operations will continue as usual. The project integrates a decentralized exchange directly into Telegram Mini Apps, which makes it possible for users to trade crypto, earn rewards, and participate in token airdrops However, Smerkis' arrest cast doubt over the fate of Blum's anticipated BLUM token airdrop. Community members are very concerned that the project may no longer follow through with its token distribution. Blum previously hinted at a Q3 token listing, and users were accumulating Blum points in the project’s Drop Game in hopes of converting them into BLUM tokens during the upcoming token generation event. Thanks to the silence from the project's team on the matter, frustration is growing in the community. “Blum owes its users a clarification on the planned airdrop,” one user stated on X, while crypto influencer RK Gupta agreed with the sentiment by saying, “No airdrop. No updates. Just silence. Was it all for nothing?” Crypto Laundering Ring Busted in Hong Kong In Hong Kong, police have dismantled a major cross-border money laundering operation that funneled HK$118 million, or approximately $15 million, through cryptocurrency and over 500 stooge bank accounts. The bust took place on May 15, and it led to the arrest of 12 individuals — nine men and three women — across Hong Kong and mainland China. According to local media reports , including the Hong Kong Commercial Daily, the criminal network allegedly recruited others to open bank accounts that were used to collect illicit funds from fraud cases. These funds were then converted into crypto at local exchange shops as part of the laundering process. The syndicate operated out of a rented apartment in Mong Kok, where they planned and executed their activities. Surveillance on the day of the arrests caught two syndicate members in the act: one visiting a bank, the other using an ATM, before both proceeded to convert the cash into cryptocurrency at a shop in Tsim Sha Tsui. Authorities intervened before the laundering could be completed, and seized around HK$770,000 ($98,540) in cash. The remaining suspects, aged between 20 and 41, were apprehended shortly after. Some items confiscated by authorities In total, police confiscated approximately HK$1.05 million ($134,370) in cash, over 560 ATM cards, numerous mobile phones, banking documents, and records of crypto transactions. Senior Inspector Tse Ka-lun of the Commercial Crime Bureau said that many of the stooge accounts that were used in the scheme belonged to friends or family of those involved. This incident is part of the growing problem in Hong Kong, where fraud-related crimes increased by 12% year-on-year in 2024. Authorities have made more than 10,000 arrests connected to fraud this year already, with almost three-quarters involving people who held bank accounts used for laundering. (Source: IC3 ) The crackdown is taking place at a time when Hong Kong is actively refining its cryptocurrency regulatory landscape. The Securities and Futures Commission introduced new rules in April requiring crypto exchanges offering staking services to comply with stricter oversight. In February, the regulator also launched a roadmap to enhance market access, improve compliance, broaden product offerings, bolster crypto infrastructure, and foster stronger industry partnerships. Roman Storm Fights Back In the US, attorneys for the developer of the crypto mixing protocol Tornado Cash, Roman Storm, filed a motion urging the court to reconsider its previous decision not to dismiss the case against him. The motion was submitted to Judge Katherine Polk Failla, and argues that the prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence involving communications with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that date back to 2023. Roman Storm According to Storm’s legal team, the documents in question show that FinCEN does not consider non-custodial crypto mixers like Tornado Cash to fall under the legal definition of a “money transmitting business.” This is a crucial distinction that undermines the basis for many of the charges. Storm’s attorneys claimed that the government knew this since at least 2023 and yet still proceeded with cases against Tornado Cash and the developers of Samourai Wallet. They allege this is a case of either the government misleading the court or playing “fast and loose” with the facts during its initial arguments against motions to dismiss and compel discovery. Part of the letter that was sent to Judge Failla In a May 16 letter , Storm’s defense pointed to disclosures made in the Samourai Wallet case, which also included FinCEN documents and similar legal arguments. Prosecutors, however, denied any wrongdoing by stating that the FinCEN communications were submitted during the legal discovery process in the court’s required timeframe. The motion now adds to growing scrutiny of the legal strategy being used by US authorities to prosecute developers of non-custodial crypto privacy tools. Roman Storm’s trial is moving forward even after Federal Judge Robert Pitman ruled in April that the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) cannot reimpose sanctions on Tornado Cash. Although prosecutors modified the charges against Storm, the continued pursuit of the case raised some important questions about the government’s interpretation of FinCEN’s own guidance and its approach to crypto regulation.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-19 05:05:20

Plaintiffs Scott Bernstein, Gina Greeder and James Lonergan claimed in the May 13 lawsuit filed in a federal court that Coinbase’s “wholesale collection” of faceprints for its Know Your Customer requirements violates BIPA, as they weren’t notified. The group claimed Coinbase failed to notify users in writing of the collection, storage, or sharing of their biometric data and the purpose and retention schedule for their data. “Coinbase does not publicly provide a retention schedule or guidelines for permanently destroying Plaintiffs’ biometric identifiers as specified by BIPA,” they alleged. The complaint said Coinbase requires users to verify their identity by uploading a government-issued photo ID and a selfie, which is then sent to a third-party facial recognition software to scan and extract facial geometry. This process captures biometric identifiers without users’ informed written consent, which the suit claimed violates BIPA. Coinbase ID verification procedures. Source: CourtListener Additionally, the group claimed Coinbase violated the law by sharing biometric data without users’ consent to third-party verification vendors such as Jumio, Onfido, Au10tix and Solaris. “Coinbase ‘obtains’ biometric data in violation of [BIPA] because it explicitly directed the Third Party Verification Providers to use its software to verify and authenticate users, including Plaintiffs, and its software does so by collecting biometric data,” the complaint read. The group claimed that more than 10,000 individuals have filed demands for arbitration over these issues with the American Arbitration Association, which Coinbase has allegedly refused to pay the required arbitration fees, causing them to be dismissed. Related: Alabama drops staking lawsuit against Coinbase The suit brings three claims of violating state biometric privacy laws and one for consumer fraud under the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act. The group is seeking relief of $5,000 per willful or reckless violation found, $1,000 per negligent violation found, along with injunctive relief and litigation costs. Coinbase has also recently been hit with at least six lawsuits over its May 15 disclosure that some of its customer support agents were bribed to leak users' data. Past BIPA violation suit sent to arbitration In May 2023, a group of Coinbase users sued the exchange under similar accusations of BIPA violations. A judge later allowed that lawsuit to pause pending arbitration and dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice on Feb. 3 after Coinbase and the group of users agreed to drop the action.

The weaker-than-expected readings on CPI and inflation expectations keep markets buoyed, while the Trump administration’s Middle East deals were a boon for the AI sector. Additionally, US Treasury yields are surging again. “Trade deals, recession worries, lower inflation, and slowing GDP all can’t get lower yields,” said the Kobeissi Letter, which added, “Meanwhile, Fed Chair Powell remains adamant on not cutting rates.” Moody’s downgrade of the US credit rating on Friday was also good news for store-of-value assets such as Bitcoin and gold.

Hackers approached customer support agents with bribery offers and detailed instructions for contacting attackers through Telegram, Bloomberg reports citing people familiar with the matter. Both exchanges managed to block the attempts without losing any customer data. The exchanges faced tactics mirroring those used against Coinbase (COIN), which earlier this week revealed it expects to pay $180 million to $400 million in remediation costs and customer reimbursements after attackers gained access to their personal information. That breach led to a $20 million ransom demand after the attackers managed to bribe Coinbase’s overseas employees/contractors to get customer information. The exchange has fired the staff involved and has contacted law enforcement. At Binance, internal systems including artificial intelligence bots helped detect bribery-related messages, shutting down conversations before they escalated. Policies that limit access to customer data unless users initiate contact also helped mitigate risk. Coinbase’s reportedly started seeing unusual activity in January, and last December, rival exchanges had begun warning the company about unusual activity targeting its largest clients.",Web3|Binance|Kraken|Security|News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-19 05:15:32

Over the last few years, meme coins have taken the crypto world by storm, leading to massive gains for early investors. With a community-driven spirit, high volatility, and the potential for astronomical returns, coins like Arctic Pablo Coin, Book of Meme, Neiro, Snek, and Pepe Coin have all captured the attention of investors eager for the next big thing. But which one stands out among the rest? Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) has been making waves recently, and it’s clear that it has the potential to offer more than just meme status. While Book of Meme, Neiro, Snek, and Pepe Coin have unique qualities, Arctic Pablo Coin is one to watch for anyone looking for a game-changing opportunity. This article will take you through the developments, features, and updates on all these coins, but first, let’s dive deeper into Arctic Pablo Coin and why it’s taking the lead in the race. 1. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Deflationary Powerhouse What makes Arctic Pablo Coin a standout investment opportunity? Let’s start with its deflationary mechanism. APC incorporates a unique token burn process to boost scarcity and value, unlike many other tokens. Weekly token burns are carried out during the presale, permanently removing unsold tokens from circulation. This burn mechanism is not just a marketing gimmick but a crucial element in creating long-term sustainability and increasing investor value. After the presale concludes, all remaining unsold tokens will be burned, reducing the supply. These transactions are recorded on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring transparency and trust. The deflationary model is designed to create a rarer and more valuable token over time, meaning that as the presale continues, early investors may see their investment grow exponentially. With fewer tokens in circulation, the value of each APC could increase, making it a potentially lucrative investment. Presale Excitement – A Journey to Massive Returns Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale strategy is unique and thrilling for investors. Instead of being broken into predictable stages, the meme coin presale is divided by locations as the coin “travels.” Right now, it’s in the Penguin Paradise stage, where the current price is $0.000165. This means early investors still have an opportunity to buy into APC at a highly affordable price before it reaches its launch price of $0.008. The total raised is over $2.53 million, and the potential ROI is staggering – early investors can expect 4,748.48% ROI from the 23rd presale stage to the launch price. If you invest $500 now, you will receive 3,030,300 APCs. When the coin is listed at $0.008, your investment could skyrocket to $24,242.40. That’s not just a return; it’s an opportunity for massive growth. Arctic Pablo Coin is quickly gaining recognition as one of the best meme coins to invest in May 2025 . But time is ticking – the presale is progressing fast, and the window of opportunity won’t last forever. Don’t miss the chance to be part of a coin on a journey toward significant growth. 2. Book of Meme – A Tale of Creativity and Community Book of Meme has quickly gained traction with its unique, narrative-driven concept in the meme coin space. Designed to bring together creators, fans, and meme enthusiasts, this coin aims to build a vibrant community that values creativity. While it may not offer the same deflationary mechanics as Arctic Pablo Coin, Book of Meme has seen impressive growth thanks to its storytelling aspect, engaging users in a way few other meme coins can. If you believe in the power of community-driven projects, this coin could be a fun, long-term investment. Book of Meme made it to this list thanks to its engaging community and creative concept. 3. Neiro – A Rising Star in the Meme Coin Space Neiro is a relatively new coin that is steadily carving its niche in the meme coin market. It has the unique feature of combining both memes and artificial intelligence, creating a buzz among tech-savvy crypto enthusiasts. Neiro promises high growth potential, though it still has a long way to go in mass adoption. What makes Neiro intriguing is its cross-platform utility, allowing users to integrate memes into various apps and platforms. Neiro has earned its place on this list due to its potential to tap into the AI and meme sectors simultaneously. 4. Snek – Slithering Towards Success Snek is a meme coin that’s garnered attention thanks to its quirky branding and fun, playful nature. Snek offers a low entry point for those who want to dip their toes into the meme coin market without taking a significant risk. The coin has a strong community of followers who love its whimsical approach to cryptocurrency, and its future seems promising. The Snek community continues to grow, and with its fun-loving spirit, it’s likely to maintain its spot in the meme coin scene for the foreseeable future. Snek earned its spot due to its strong, enthusiastic community and unique branding. 5. Pepe Coin – A Meme Coin with Endless Potential Pepe Coin has been around for a while, leveraging the popularity of the iconic Pepe the Frog meme. While it’s not as innovative as some other meme coins, it still has a massive fan base. Pepe Coin’s value lies in its brand recognition and ability to tap into the enormous popularity of internet memes. Investors looking for a meme coin with a solid community and history may find value in Pepe Coin. Its staying power in the meme coin world places it firmly on this list. Final Verdict: Why Arctic Pablo Coin is the Meme Coin to Invest in May 2025 Based on the latest research, Arctic Pablo Coin is among the Best Meme Coins to invest in May 2025. From its deflationary mechanics and unique presale structure to its massive potential for ROI, APC stands out from the crowd. The other coins – Book of Meme, Neiro, Snek, and Pepe Coin – have their merits, but none offer the same blend of excitement, scarcity, and growth potential as Arctic Pablo Coin. If you want to get in early on the next big thing in crypto, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale presents an opportunity you won’t want to miss. Investing now could lead to exponential returns, with APC’s potential for growth and scarcity driving up its value over time. Don’t wait until it’s too late – take advantage of this presale opportunity before it’s gone. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ FAQs Why is Arctic Pablo Coin’s deflationary mechanism so important? The deflationary token burn ensures that the supply of APC is limited, which can lead to a higher value for holders as fewer tokens circulate. How does Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale differ from other coins? APC’s presale is divided by locations rather than stages, offering a unique approach and ensuring excitement as it “travels.” What is the ROI potential for Arctic Pablo Coin from presale to launch? Investors can expect up to 4,748.48% ROI from the 23rd presale stage to the launch price. Is Arctic Pablo Coin a safe investment? While all investments carry risk, APC’s deflationary mechanics and impressive presale results make it a strong contender for long-term growth. How can I participate in the Arctic Pablo Coin presale? Simply purchase tokens during the presale to secure your position before the coin officially launches at a higher price. What makes Arctic Pablo Coin different from other meme coins? Its innovative burn mechanism, transparency through Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and unique presale structure set it apart from others in the meme coin market. When is the best time to invest in Arctic Pablo Coin? The best time is now – during the presale, before the price rises significantly at launch.

These businesses include a Chinese energy company, a healthcare group, and a Shanghai-based biotech company. The companies are also exploring share placements or dual listings. People familiar with the matter said the move is part of a broader push by Chinese firms to gain a foothold in Southeast Asia. They attempt to find alternative markets as the trade war between China and the United States rages on. The US and China have long been locked in a tit-for-tat tariff war. Towards the peak of the trade war, the US slapped tariffs of up to 145% on certain Chinese goods while China issued tariffs of up to 125% on American imports. Although the two sides recently agreed to a temporary 90-day break, questions linger about the future of the trade relationship. Analysts say this uncertainty is leading Chinese companies to seek new gateways to global markets, with Singapore rising to the top of the list. Singapore Exchange draws major Chinese firms for listings The Singapore Exchange has been unable to contest Hong Kong’s reign of listing the best and most profitable IPOs. So far this year, SGX has seen just four listings. In comparison, 71 new listings have been issued in Hong Kong since the start of 2024 (which still holds its title as the largest market in Asia for IPOs). Jason Saw, head of investment banking at CGS International Securities, said that Chinese interest could change the current situation. He explained that after the US raised tariffs on China, inquiries about Singapore Exchange (SGX) listings had “shot through the roof.” Pol de Win, senior managing director at SGX, echoed the sentiment, adding that Singapore’s role as a regional hub is increasingly valuable for companies seeking stable, neutral markets outside the US and Hong Kong. Singapore boosts market to attract global companies Singapore is taking steps to develop its stock market better to lure more foreign companies . Earlier this year, the government unveiled a 20% tax rebate for primary listings to cut costs and make companies more likely to opt for SGX. Additional measures to encourage listings and trading volumes will likely be implemented later this year. Those efforts are part of Singapore’s broader push to position itself as Southeast Asia’s preeminent financial hub. Singapore’s political stability, which may be a potentially attractive draw for companies cautious of geopolitical risk, would be an additional factor in its favor, EY’s Asia Pacific IPO Leader, Ringo Choi, said. Still, challenges remain. Singapore’s stricter listing requirements and conservative investor base could hold it back from narrowing the gap with Hong Kong. A Singapore-based tech executive, speaking anonymously, said the country needs to streamline its listing process, particularly for tech startups. The executive added that most regional startups are also based in Singapore, which makes sense for an IPO. However, the executive continued that the current constraints would have to be relaxed for this to happen. China has long pushed for closer economic ties with the region, especially as it feuds with Washington on multiple fronts. Chinese firms see Southeast Asia as a fast-growing market that is home to a growing middle class and an expanding appetite for consumer goods. Listing in Singapore allows Chinese companies to raise money locally and increase their brand name. This twofold incentive is what makes Singapore so appealing. Hong Kong is still the preferred offshore destination among Chinese companies, but Singapore’s incremental reforms and offerings make it increasingly attractive for big players.

While Russian firms may still be able to use stablecoins like Tether for cross-border settlements, domestic investor access to USDT appears increasingly at risk. No Explicit Ban, but All Signs Point to Trouble for USDT Following the freeze of USDT wallets last month, the Central Bank of Russia has introduced new rules before launching its regulated crypto sandbox on May 26. The sandbox is designed to let firms use crypto in global trade, but with tight restrictions on what tokens are allowed. While the bank avoids naming specific assets, experts believe these regulations are effectively engineered to exclude USDT and most other USD-backed stablecoins. Under the new framework, only tokens from “friendly countries” can be traded, those not support sanctions against Russia. Moreover, the rules target coins that could be “blocked” or deactivated by issuers, a clause analysts say directly points at Tether, which has the ability to freeze wallets and deny redemptions. A meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy could take place if the two sides come to certain agreements, Interfax reported https://t.co/KykMbJbU2I — Bloomberg (@business) May 17, 2025 Experts Say USDT Doesn’t Qualify Mikhail Uspensky, a crypto regulatory advisor in Russia, confirmed that USDT likely doesn’t meet the new requirements and would be barred from domestic circulation. Georgy Gukasyan, legal director at DRT, further explained that Tether’s compliance with U.S. sanctions gives it the power to deny redemptions and freeze assets, leaving Russian holders vulnerable. Stablecoin Use Abroad Still Open Despite the restrictions, both experts agree that using USDT for cross-border settlements will remain legal. The sandbox’s core intent is to support international trade, not individual investors. But for traders and crypto investors in Russia, the writing on the wall is clear— USDT is on its way out. With Tether already cooperating with U.S. authorities in past enforcement actions, such as freezing wallets linked to Russian exchange Garantex, confidence in USDT’s usability within Russia is eroding fast. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : GENIUS Act Vote on May 19: Will the U.S. Finally Regulate Stablecoins? , Other Alternate Ways Russia is also advancing two pilot programs for cross-border payments using digital assets.

For 2025, analysts are increasingly pointing to Bitcoin (BTC), XRP , and the rising political altcoin MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) as the three that could define this next breakout era. Joining them in a more strategic role is Polkadot (DOT) — a scalable Layer-0 that’s set to power multi-chain infrastructure in the background. This time around, it’s not just about technology or hype. It’s about positioning, timing, and capital rotation. And this trio appears ready to take the lead. CLICK HERE – SECURE YOUR SPOT BEFORE 25x DISAPPEARS MAGACOINFINANCE Is Emerging as the Final Undervalued Entry MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing early-stage attention like no other altcoin in Q2 2025. With Stage 8 nearly complete and a firm listing target of $0.007 , the project is now being labeled by analysts as the final high-upside altcoin with defined ROI mechanics before listings begin . What’s driving investor momentum: A realistic 25x–35x growth model Strong narrative identity with market differentiation Transparent price targeting — unlike most meme tokens or Layer-1s While BTC and XRP may lead from the front, MAGACOIN FINANCE is where many early movers are focusing for true exponential upside . Once it lists, this entry window disappears — and large players are already loading in before Stage 9 begins. Bitcoin Remains the Macro King Bitcoin (BTC) remains the centerpiece of the crypto economy. Trading in the $103K–$104K range , it has absorbed institutional inflows through ETFs and is being treated globally as a macro hedge against inflation and monetary instability . Analysts project targets of $150K to $250K over the next 12–18 months, especially as capital continues to move from traditional markets into hard digital assets. Bitcoin will not provide 100x returns, but it is still the foundation. And that foundation is now enabling the capital flow into breakout altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP Returns to Institutional Relevance XRP has reclaimed its spot on the top-tier watchlists following U.S. legal clarity and the anticipated launch of CME futures . Trading above $2.30 , XRP is not only a speculative asset — it’s now a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain settlements . Forecasts point to $5–$15 in the near term, with longer-term views reaching above $30 , depending on global adoption. XRP’s role in the 2025 cycle? To move big capital across borders while opening the floodgates to institutional flows . It’s now part of the cycle’s core trio — and many are pairing it with early-stage entries like MAGA to build both depth and potential in their portfolios. Polkadot (DOT) Is Quietly Building Cross-Chain Infrastructure Polkadot (DOT) doesn’t grab headlines, but it’s playing a major strategic role in powering multi-chain functionality. DOT enables blockchains to communicate and scale without fragmentation — a critical component as Web3 applications expand. Currently trading under $10, DOT is widely expected to regain strength later in the cycle, especially as developers build on parachain infrastructure and inter-chain activity increases. While not a high-volatility moonshot, DOT acts as a core utility layer that supports projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE as they move into multi-network adoption. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Conclusion The 2025 cycle is forming — and with it, the trio that could dominate headlines, capital flows, and investor portfolios. Bitcoin holds the macro foundation. XRP opens the doors for institutions. MAGACOIN FINANCE delivers the aggressive early-stage opportunity. Add Polkadot to the mix as a strategic infrastructure layer, and you have the full spectrum of this cycle’s most-watched assets . As Stage 9 nears and listings approach, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains the only asset in this group that hasn’t fully moved yet — and smart capital is taking advantage before that changes.

While analysts maintain the “calm before the storm” narrative, Official Trump ($TRUMP) appears on the verge of upside breakouts as bullish catalysts loom. The meme token formed a symmetrical triangle formation, and this week’s dinner between top TRUMP holders and the US president could support the impending bullish breakouts. The triangle’s measured move suggests extended gains to $28.63. That would mean an approximately 124% upswing from current prices of $12.78. $TRUMP holders to dine with the US president According to Invezz , the top 220 investors of TRUMP meme crypto will attend a private dinner with the pro-crypto United States president this Thursday, May 22. Furthermore, the top 25 holders will access even more perks, including touring the White House and an exclusive session with the president before the meal. drout @droutdrout · Follow Finna crashout at the trump dinner 6:06 PM · May 12, 2025 32 Reply Copy link Read 5 replies $TRUMP, launched a few days before the January 20 presidential inauguration, has been a key for the Trump family’s venture into the crypto market. Real-world events like the upcoming dinner reflect the project’s dedication to blending loyalty, political identity, and financial speculations. The occasion, representing the most audacious connection between politics and cryptocurrencies, has grabbed the digital asset community’s attention. Meanwhile, that has triggered speculations about $TRUMP’s potential price reactions and future performance. The Thursday event might catalyze significant uptrends, especially if media coverage and key announcements follow. Narrative remains paramount in meme assets, and Trump’s power and prestige positions the alt for impressive price actions. $TRUMP price outlook: technical pattern meets political event As the alt anticipates bullish moves, analyst Rose Signals identified a vital price pattern. $TRUMP’s 1-day chart has tightened within a textbook symmetrical triangle formation for weeks. Source – Rose Signals The pattern remains vital as it often heralds a swift price move in either direction. Meanwhile, $TRUMP price coils around the triangle’s apex, with eyes on the charts and Thursday’s dinner table. The daily chart shows the triangle setup maintained crucial support and resistance zones in the past three weeks. Meanwhile, looming upside catalysts signal imminent rallies. Meanwhile, enthusiasts should watch for breakouts beyond the triangle’s upper boundary and closing above $13 to confirm extended gains. $TRUMP hovers at $12.78 after sliding from yesterday’s high of $13.49. Chart by Coinmarketcap Bulls will target the initial resistance at $16.90 before exploring $23.64. Broad-based rallies could support gains toward the measured target of $28.63, translating to a 124% surge from current prices. Surged volume driven by positive announcements and media coverage during this week’s dinner could support the potential breakout. However, nothing is a guarantee in the crypto space. You probably remember how Dogecoin disappointed after Elon Musk’s SNL appearance in 2021. Possible bearish sentiments around the much-awaited meeting with Donald Trump could catalyze bearish price actions. That might catalyze a downside breach of the triangle, with price dips below $10.12 invalidating the bullish pattern. Panic selling might trigger corrections to $8 – a nearly 38% dip from $TRUMP’s current price.

Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis , of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin ( BTC ), and effectively split Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units. It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create “bits,” representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin. However, Carvalho said Song’s approach would still require Bitcoin users to think about decimals and “shifts complexity rather than eliminating it.” Block Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey is among those calling for the change, saying in a May 18 X post that satoshis, or sats, are too confusing for newcomers. “Bits of Bitcoin is better, and just Bitcoin is best,” Dorsey said. Dorsey pointed to a December 2024 discussion on the topic where Stevie Lee, product lead of Bitcoin infrastructure firm Spiral, argued that not enough people know or care about what satoshis are. “Everyone knows Bitcoin, no one knows sats, people just want to send and receive Bitcoin,” Lee said, recalling past conversations where people thought satoshis were an entirely new token, unrelated to Bitcoin. He added that the Bitcoin community shouldn’t be too concerned with the change, as they know the underlying economics of Bitcoin would remain intact. Related: DOJ charges 12 more gamer-turned $263M Bitcoin robbers Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten and Byte Federal director of product Michelle Weekley were among those who opposed the change. “People understand cents in a dollar, they will understand sats in a Bitcoin,” Weekley said on X. Magdalena Gronowska, a self-described Bitcoin consultant, claimed that the change could make some people think that Bitcoin abruptly crashed from its current price of around $100,000 and that its “supply has massively inflated.” Zaprite business development lead Parker Lewis argued that sats were easier to understand. Source: Parker Lewis Bitcoin creator was open to the idea Robin Linus, the creator of the Bitcoin Virtual Machine (BitVM), highlighted that even Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, was open to changing how Bitcoin’s units are displayed for the purpose of usability. “If it gets tiresome working with small numbers, we could change where the display shows the decimal point,” Satoshi said in a February 2010 post before vanishing the following year. “Same amount of money, just different convention,” Satoshi added.

Pyth Network’s ( PYTH ) price has fallen 7% in the past 24 hours to $0.1449. The token has now declined over 21% in the past seven days and is trading 87.65% below its all-time high of $1.20. Despite the downturn, market activity has picked up. PYTH’s 24-hour trading volume rose 45.3% to $38.5 million, and derivatives volume surged 58%, as per Coinglass data . A rise in open interest by 0.71% suggests that new positions are being added rather than closed, reflecting cautious positioning as traders anticipate volatility from the upcoming unlock. According to Tokenomist data , roughly 2.13 billion PYTH tokens, worth approximately $313 million, are set to be unlocked on Monday, May 19. This represents a massive 58.62% of the circulating supply, with only 36% of total tokens unlocked so far. When so much supply is released at once, token unlocks frequently result in strong sell -side pressure, which may affect price movement if recipients decide to sell off tokens.

Credit: crypto.news Most indicators are displaying signals that range from neutral to negative. The moving average convergence divergence level is slightly negative, and momentum is likewise in sell territory. All major moving averages, from 10-day to 200-day, both simple and exponential, show sell signals, with the 10-day EMA now at $0.1616, well above the current price. A move toward the lower support at $0.1134 is possible as PYTH has broken its immediate $0.1504 support. On the other hand, PYTH might stabilize and even rise if the market smoothly absorbs the $313M unlock with little selling from recipients. A post-unlock recovery could be front-run by traders, particularly if the price falls toward important psychological support between $0.12 and $0.13.

Bitcoin has now closed at a weekly gain for the past six consecutive weeks as bulls dominate the market.

While the previous all-time high rally may have been a result of enthusiasm around Donald Trump’s inauguration and retail speculation, this time Bitcion’s rally has much to do with consistent spot ETF inflows and the impact of macro factors. With uncertainity around inflation, tariff deals, and other major economic factors, investors could be turning to safe assets like Bitcoin and Gold. Between May 12 and May 16 (ET), spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a cumulative net inflow of $604 million, extending their streak of positive weekly inflows to five straight weeks.

He emphasized that XRP is being chosen not for hype, but because of its practical, technical advantages in payment systems. Ripple News: Why XRP Is Winning Institutional Trust Let’s dive into what makes XRP the go-to choice for institutions in 2025. Spoiler: It’s all about speed, cost, and scalability. 1/ Ultra-low Fees Each XRP transaction costs just $0.00002 — and that fee stays consistent even… — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) May 17, 2025 Why Are Institutions Turning Toward XRP One of XRP’s strongest selling points is its predictable fee structure. Transactions cost just $0.00002, even during times of high network demand. Brett noted that even if XRP reached $1,000 in value, the transaction fee would still only be 0.00001 XRP. This fee stability gives institutions the certainty they need when operating at scale. Another advantage is that XRP doesn’t rely on miners or validator incentives. Instead, it uses a consensus mechanism that eliminates variable costs tied to network usage. Without rewards to chase or gas fees to compete, XRP avoids congestion that slows other blockchains down or makes them prohibitively expensive. Unlike other networks that take hours to settle, transactions on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) settle in under three seconds. Due to block production times, there is no need for multiple confirmations or delays. This speed is critical for enterprises where delayed settlement can impact liquidity, compliance, or customer experience. XRP’s deflationary model also appeals to institutions. Each transaction destroys a small amount of XRP, permanently removing it from circulation. This burn mechanism reduces spam and gradually lowers the total supply, contributing to long-term value without relying on artificial scarcity. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Brett also noted that the XRP network can handle 1,500 transactions per second, consistently and without slowdown. While other networks often see performance dips under load, XRP’s throughput remains stable, making it suitable for high-frequency operations in real-world environments. Institutional Benefits That Matter Brett highlighted several features that appeal directly to institutional users: real-time confirmations, no need for pre-funded accounts in cross-border payments, and a flat, low-fee structure. Together, these characteristics position XRP as a serious infrastructure layer for modern payments. “No one wants to pay $30 to send $30,” Brett remarked, pointing out the impracticality of networks with high and variable fees. XRP avoids that problem entirely, and Michael Arrington, founder of TechCrunch, recently showed the asset’s advantages with a $50 million transaction that cost $0.3 and was completed in a few seconds. XRP was not designed for speculation but for efficient, scalable payments. XRP’s design choices are proving well-suited for institutions seeking speed, reliability, and cost-efficiency in their operations, and the growing institutional adoption shows its superiority to other assets.

The assets, valued at 4.5 million Australian dollars ($2.88 million), were seized following a court forfeiture order secured by the Australian Federal Police (AFP). In a statement issued on May 18 , the AFP said the action was taken under the Proceeds of Crime Act after the Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT) determined the property could not be tied to any legitimate income. Bitcoin Trail From Luxembourg Sparks 2018 Investigation The investigation into Bitcoin crime began in 2018 when law enforcement officials in Luxembourg flagged suspicious transactions. According to the AFP, these transactions led back to the Queensland resident, who was previously convicted of cybercrime in the United States. Local reports have identified the man as Shane Stephen Duffy, known for his role in a high-profile hacking and fraud case. Duffy pleaded guilty in 2016 to selling the personal data of League of Legends players. While he was not directly involved in the 2011 cyberattack on Riot Games, which exposed the personal details of over five million users, he allegedly obtained the data through online channels and profited from its sale. Authorities further linked Duffy to a 2013 theft of 950 Bitcoin from a French cryptocurrency exchange. Although no criminal charges were brought in connection to that case, the AFP argued that the recovered assets, including the Bitcoin, may have stemmed from the incident or other illicit activities. The AFP-led Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT) has secured the forfeiture of more than $4.5 million worth of assets, including a Queensland waterfront mansion, luxury car and Bitcoin, after identifying them as suspected proceeds of crime. https://t.co/Wglk0m5K50 — AFP (@AusFedPolice) May 17, 2025 AFP Commander Jason Kennedy stated that the agency’s mandate includes not only prosecuting cybercrime but also stripping criminals of their gains. “The profits derived from criminal activities are also often used to fund further criminal acts,” Kennedy said, adding that the funds recovered from such operations are redirected to support community crime prevention and law enforcement efforts. The seized assets will be liquidated, with the proceeds funneled into a special-purpose fund dedicated to supporting law enforcement and crime deterrence programs across the country. Since mid-2019, the CACT has restrained over $1.2 billion in assets ranging from luxury homes and vehicles to cryptocurrency and fine art, reflecting a broader crackdown on digital and financial crimes in Australia. Australia Cracks Down on Inactive Crypto Exchanges Last month, Australia’s financial intelligence agency said it is stepping up efforts to tighten oversight of crypto exchanges , warning that inactive platforms risk deregistration if they fail to voluntarily withdraw. At the time, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) said many registered digital currency exchange providers appear to have ceased operations but remain listed, potentially exposing the system to criminal exploitation. AUSTRAC stated it has begun contacting exchanges that no longer seem active, out of the 427 businesses currently registered. “Businesses registered with AUSTRAC are required to keep their details up to date; this includes details about services that are no longer provided,” the agency said.

At least six lawsuits were filed against Coinbase between May 15 and May 16, which all made various claims that the exchange failed to keep stringent security protocols to protect user data and handled the data breach aftermath poorly. In one of the lawsuits, filed in a New York federal court on May 16, plaintiff Paul Bender argued that Coinbase failed to protect the sensitive personal information of millions of users during the data breach. Users are suing Coinbase, alleging the exchange failed to protect their sensitive data. Source: PACER Coinbase reported on May 15 that four days earlier it had been hit with a $20 million extortion attempt after cybercriminals bribed several of its customer support agents to access internal systems and steal a limited amount of user account data. The stolen data included names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, some bank account identifiers, driver’s licenses, passports and some account data, such as balance snapshots and transaction history. Bender claimed that “Coinbase failed to implement and maintain reasonable security safeguards,” which exposed users to “serious and ongoing risks.” The suit also claimed Coinbase’s response to the incident was “inadequate, fragmented, and delayed.” “Users were not promptly or fully informed of the compromise, and Coinbase did not immediately take meaningful steps to mitigate further harm, provide identity protection services, or offer actionable guidance to affected individuals,” the complaint claimed. The lawsuit claimed users could face “substantial, immediate, and ongoing threat of identity theft and financial fraud” and that the consequences of the breach could be long-term or “potentially permanent” because the compromised information can’t be recovered or made secure once exposed. Flurry of lawsuits make similar allegations Two other lawsuits filed in a New York federal court made similar claims against Coinbase, while a fourth lawsuit added the allegation of unjust enrichment, arguing that Coinbase didn’t spend enough on data security measures. All four complaints ask for damages and other measures to help protect the plaintiff’s sensitive data. Meanwhile, a fifth lawsuit filed in a California federal court on May 15 made similar claims against Coinbase, but asked the court to order Coinbase to purge all sensitive data it holds about the plaintiffs and hire third-party security auditors to test its security systems, among other requests. A Coinbase spokesperson did not comment on the lawsuits and instead pointed Cointelegraph to a blog post it shared regarding the data breaches. Coinbase said it refused to pay the $20 million ransom and has flagged plans to reimburse users tricked into sending crypto to phishing scammers due to the data breach. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the exchange said it expects reimbursement expenses ranging from $180 million to $400 million. Related: Retired artist loses $2M in crypto to Coinbase impersonator The exchange also reportedly fired a group of customer support agents based in India following their alleged involvement in social engineering attacks on users. Coinbase (COIN) shares dipped 7% and dropped to $244 after it disclosed the data breach along with an ongoing SEC probe over misstated user numbers in 2021. The stock has since staged a comeback, spiking 9% and hitting $266 by the closing bell on May 16, according to Google Finance. Coinbase has climbed even higher following the data breach.

After the Consensus hype, the coin is now sitting around $0.70. Amid growing investor frustration, a new twist has emerged around Pi Network’s founder. Analyst Mr Spock recently shared a speculation, leaving everyone confused. Could Nikolas Kokkalis actually be Satoshi Nakamoto? Although it sounds wild, there are some reasons that he cited to back this speculation. Let’s find out what made him say that. Satoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, the world’s first decentralised cryptocurrency. He contributed to Bitcoin’s code and development until 2010, before he disappeared from the public. His identity still remains a mystery. Following the Clues: Kraken, Coinbase, and the Satoshi Connection Pi Network co-founder Kokkalis follows only a handful of exchanges on X—Coinbase, Kraken, and OKX. Kraken is associated with the last known transaction linked to Satoshi Nakamoto, one of the very exchanges that Nicholas follows. But how does that prove he is Satoshi? Here’s where things get more interesting. A Coinbase executive also believes that Kraken might hold information about Satoshi’s identity because their research suggests a connection between Satoshi-linked wallets and Cavirtex, a Canadian exchange later acquired by Kraken. This is not a coincidence, but precision, he says. While the community awaits a Binance listing overseas to boost Pi Network’s visibility, this analyst is thinking even bigger. He believes that once Pi launches on Coinbase, the U.S. could become a major driver of Pi’s real-world value. In response to the post, one of the users imagined a wild scenario and wrote that, if Pi Network’s founder is Satoshi, then when Satoshi sells off their Bitcoin, it could cause problems for governments. And after that, Pi could become the new global currency with early users benefiting the most. Experts Point to Strange Coincidences Kokkalis has a PhD in blockchain technology, which is the kind of expertise someone would expect from Bitcoin’s creator. Like Satoshi Nakamoto, he seems detached from money, building Pi Network by distributing tokens without asking investors for cash. Analyst Dr Altcoin had also taken a close look at Nicholas’ academic work and had found that Nicholas has an impressive background in computer science with noteworthy publications. “What’s clear is that Pi Network is an innovative project built on Nicolas’ expertise, making it one of the most promising crypto ventures today,” he said. However, there is no concrete evidence to back these claims. But still, this has captured the attention of many in the crypto community.",Uncategorized|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-19 06:11:27

That’s as it approaches a technically significant formation known as the golden cross . That’s when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day average. Many people see that as a long-term bullish sign. It did, after all, precede Bitcoin’s big rally in 2023, when prices surged from $70,000 to over $100,000. Analysts are watching closely to see if history repeats itself. Bitcoin Nears Golden Cross Weeks After 'Trapping Bears' as U.S. Debt Concerns Mount https://t.co/kpJ4tIVH65 — Nature of Crypto (@AICryptoNewsNow) May 19, 2025 One reason for that interest is the state of the U.S. economy. Moody’s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating has investors looking for alternative stores of value. With U.S. national debt topping $36 trillion and Treasury yields climbing, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a hedge against fiscal instability. That’s a big deal. Bitcoin Outlook: Bearish Warning in BTC’s Short-Term Structure Despite all those bullish macro undercurrents, Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish as short-term structure is actually pretty fragile. On the 2-hour chart, you can see BTC breaking below its 50-EMA (around $103,698) and an ascending trendline. That’s a sign of weakening momentum. The MACD has flipped bearish too—histogram bars are deepening in the red and signal lines are diverging. That’s classic selling pressure. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Immediate support lies at $102,750. Below that, next support targets are $100,782 and $99,188. Reclaiming $103,698 and that broken trendline would shift sentiment bullish again. Resistance zones include $104,319 and $105,539. For newer traders, think of moving averages like guide rails. BTC just dipped beneath one. Until it reclaims those levels, price risks remain tilted to the downside. Seized Bitcoin Case Highlights Law Enforcement’s Reach Australian authorities seized $2.88 million in assets—including 25 Bitcoin and a luxury mansion—from a suspect linked to a 2013 crypto exchange hack. No theft charges were filed, but the court ruled for asset forfeiture under Australia’s Proceeds of Crime Act. Federal Police have swooped on a convicted computer hacker by seizing his waterfront home, luxury car and dozens of Bitcoin. This has been seven years in the making. https://t.co/VZ3A1cHvFd @_jordanquinn #7NEWS pic.twitter.com/KJ91nzu7qk — 7NEWS Queensland (@7NewsBrisbane) May 18, 2025 That case is alarming for some, but it also signals growing regulatory sophistication. For Bitcoin, it reinforces the idea that crypto is traceable and subject to legal oversight. That bolsters long-term trust among institutions—even if it causes short-term unease among privacy-focused holders. Dubai’s Crypto Push Bolsters Global Sentiment Ripple’s president praised Dubai’s proactive crypto stance during the Dubai Fintech Summit , citing its clear regulatory environment as a global benchmark. As Dubai cements its status as a leading blockchain hub, that institutional backing lends credibility to the broader crypto ecosystem—including Bitcoin. Our President @MonicaLongSF had the honor of meeting with His Highness Ahmed bin Saeed at @DubaiFintechSum . We continue to be impressed with the leadership demonstrated by Dubai as it establishes itself as one of the world’s leading hubs for digital assets. https://t.co/w9pd0cq1y7 — Ripple (@Ripple) May 14, 2025 Countries and cities providing transparent regulation attract serious capital and development. That institutional interest feeds back into market stability and could ultimately help support Bitcoin’s next leg higher. BTC Bull Token Nears $6.84M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Drives Demand As BTC holding near $102K, investor focus is shifting toward yield-generating altcoins—none more so than BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The token has now raised $5.87 million out of its $6.84 million presale goal, with a price increase looming as it enters its final funding stretch. What sets BTCBULL apart is its flexible staking model, offering an estimated 71% annual yield with no lockups or withdrawal penalties. This approach gives investors the freedom to earn passive income while maintaining full liquidity—an attractive alternative to traditional DeFi staking protocols. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $5,919,969.28/ $6,844,387 Token Price: $0.002515 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: 71% APY BTCBULL merges the viral appeal of meme tokens with the real-world utility of DeFi, making it a standout pick for those looking to capitalize on the 2025 crypto cycle. With under $1 million left before the next price tier, entry at current levels is limited—fueling urgency among retail investors seeking early access to passive yield.

However, the price is rising strongly today, somehow counterintuitively to the market’s overall tone. In the past 24 hours, EOS has gained 6.2% after World Liberty Financial, the Trump-backed decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol , purchased around $3 million worth of the token. Trump's World Liberty( @worldlibertyfi ) just spent 3M $USDT to buy 3.64M $EOS at $0.824. https://t.co/SUBbhLzmJr pic.twitter.com/nzpwkmPvi4 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 16, 2025 Lookonchain reported the purchase through its X account earlier today. Although WLFI invests in a significant number of cryptocurrencies, EOS has now become the 10th largest holding in its portfolio according to data from Arkham Intelligence . This is also the first time that WLFI makes a meaningful investment in this layer-one blockchain. The nature or scope of this transaction was not disclosed by any of the parties involved. Although it is a small purchase for a token with a market cap of $1.32 billion, the fact that WLFI hand-picked this token for such a large purchase may have improved investors’ EOS price prediction. The move also comes two days after EOS effectively launched Vaulta (A), the project’s new rebranded token. EOS holders can swap their assets for A with a 1:1 ratio and zero fees involved. Can this acquisition be considered a bullish signal for EOS? EOS Price Prediction: Break of Structure Could Result in a Reversion to the Mean The daily chart shows that, despite today’s uptick, the price of EOS has broken its bullish structure as it has moved below its second-best (and most relevant) higher high. Although the WLFI news probably prompted the price surge, EOS has already retreated after it retested this former support level, which has now turned into resistance. If the price action fails to recapture that threshold, which means climbing above $0.90 in the next few days, the odds favor the continuation of a downtrend, probably toward the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) as part of a simple mean reversion move. However, a break below that level could result in further losses as the next support stands at the $0.53 to $0.55 range. The influence of WLFI’s investment in the project is not necessarily big as none of the two parties has announced any intentions to collaborate in a joint venture or anything of that nature. Although the prospects of EOS as an investment are a bit uncertain despite WLFI’s backing, the best crypto presales of the year like MIND of Pepe (MIND) offer early buyers significant upside potential. MIND of Pepe (MIND) Gears Up to Launch its Widely Awaited Pepe-Inspired AI Agent After a few months of successfully raising the necessary capital, MIND of Pepe (MIND) is finally wrapping up its presale. However, you still have a few days to invest before the event officially ends. MIND of Pepe is an AI agent that leverages the popularity of the Pepe the Frog meme and combines it with the power of artificial intelligence to captivate large audiences across social media platforms like X. By interacting with high-profile accounts and users in the “cryptowit” niche within X, the agent will identify nascent social trends and emerging opportunities in the meme coin space primarily. All of this information will be passed on to $MIND holders so they can take advantage of these opportunities early on to reap the highest returns. To buy $MIND and become a member of the project’s exclusive club of investors, simply head to the MIND of Pepe website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to make your investment.

When asked about Ethereum versus Solana, he said, “Everyone thinks Ethereum does nothing, they haven’t done anything correctly, but it still has the most TVL, it still has the most number of developers, and it still is the most secure proof of stake blockchain.” Hayes did acknowledge that ETH prices have not done that well since 2020, and Solana has had a recent growth spurt, but added: “If I’m gonna deploy a fresh unit of fiat capital into the system, I think that Ethereum could outperform Solana in this next sort of 18-24 months bull run.” ETH to Outperform SOL Solana’s primary use case is meme coins , and the network did very well during that frenzy earlier this year. However, now that the bubble has burst, its activity and revenue have significantly declined. Despite all the FUD and hate, Ethereum remains the industry standard for DeFi, dApps, stablecoins, and real-world asset tokenization, having a dominant market share for each category. Looking at recent performance, Solana climbed from a low of around $100 during the April 7 crash to top out at just over $180 on May 14, before sliding back below $165, notching 80%. Ethereum has almost doubled over the same time, climbing from a bear market low of $1,400 to come just shy of $2,700 on May 14, before it retreated back below $2,400. While performance has been similar, Ethereum has done marginally better than Solana over the past six weeks, so maybe Hayes has seen this potential for future price increases. What About Bitcoin? When asked about what’s next for crypto markets, Hayes, who also admitted to having 20% of his portfolio allocated to gold, said he thought BTC dominance would continue to climb. “I think Bitcoin in this next little run could go close to $200,000, and then altcoin season comes around and we’ll see some interesting things,” he said before predicting a BTC price target of about $250,000 by the end of the year. In a recent blog post , Hayes said that pressures on the US dollar could propel BTC prices to seven figures before the end of the decade. “Foreign capital repatriation and the devaluation of the gargantuan stock of US Treasurys will be the two catalysts that will power Bitcoin to $1 million sometime between now and 2028.” The asset had dumped hard, losing more than $3,500 in a few hours as it fell below $103,000 at the time of writing.

Next and Final SEC Document In Ripple Case Raises Speculation,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-destined-to-surpass-589-new-sec-document-in-ripple-case-raises-speculation/,"A recent post by prominent crypto enthusiast JackTheRippler has reignited interest among some members of the XRP community, following a judicial filing in the SEC v. Ripple Labs case. The filing, Document 984, dated May 15, 2025, by United States District Judge Analisa Torres, formally denies a motion from the parties requesting an indicative ruling in what appears to be an attempt to revisit the terms of the previously adjudicated Final Judgment. The next and final SEC document has the number “985” Coincidence? I don’t think so! 589 is real… #XRP pic.twitter.com/GnDfxyMBtq — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) May 17, 2025 According to the order, the court concluded that the motion was procedurally improper and lacked the necessary burden of proof to vacate the injunction or reduce the civil penalty. JackTheRippler, a well-known figure in the XRP community on X, drew attention to the fact that this order is Document 984, and the next filing in the case will be numbered 985. He posted: “The next and final SEC document has the number ‘985’ Coincidence? I don’t think so! 589 is real…#XRP”. The reference to “589” is a widely recognized speculative theory within parts of the XRP community, suggesting that XRP’s price could one day reach $589. Crypto Enthusiasts like Crypto Bitlord have claimed $589 as the real price target for XRP . The basis for this theory has often been criticized for lacking fundamental support, but it continues to surface during significant developments in the SEC v. Ripple litigation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Responses The comparison appears to rely on numerological associations between the upcoming court document number (985) and the long-standing symbolic figure of 589, which some community members interpret as prophetic rather than literal. The post elicited a range of reactions from the XRP community. One user, Jabby Dodger, responded , “I hate to think that people have actually listened to someone who can’t tell a ‘5’ from a ‘4’ when it comes to their finances.” In defense of JackTheRippler’s comment, user Vanessa Cherry countered : “I hate to think that someone doesn’t read the post that says the ‘NEXT’ and final number,” emphasizing that the tweet did not claim the current document but the subsequent one as relevant. Another user, Patronio, echoed the sentiment of those who see deeper meaning in the document number: “If you posted a negative reply to this you don’t get it. Oh well, too late for you.” This comment reflects a mindset common among certain XRP holders who view the $589 belief as part of a broader, often conspiratorial, narrative about future adoption or a dramatic revaluation. Court Rejects Request for Reconsideration The court filing attached to the tweet is significant in its own right, as Judge Torres rejected a request to have the court reconsider portions of the Final Judgment related to Ripple’s liability and civil penalty. The motion was styled as a request for “settlement approval.” The court determined that it failed to meet the legal standard for relief from a final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60, which demands “exceptional circumstances.” The court emphasized that the parties did not even reference Rule 60 in their motion. In citing precedent from SEC v. Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., the court made clear that such requests must be grounded in specific procedural standards and that attempts to reframe the motion without addressing the necessary legal thresholds were insufficient. Consequently, the motion was denied, and the Clerk of Court was directed to terminate it. Speculation Continues Despite Judicial Clarity XRP supporters and skeptics continue to monitor developments as the case advances toward its procedural end. Whether the next document, numbered 985, holds any significance beyond court administration remains, for now, purely speculative. Despite the clear legal reasoning behind the court’s decision, portions of the XRP community remain fixated on symbolic numerology and the narrative of a $589 valuation .

This gain comes amid Bitcoin’s recent surge, which is nearing its all-time high of $108,786. A screenshot Bukele posted on X estimated that the nation’s holdings in Bitcoin were worth more than $644.4 million, compared with the initial amount spent of $287.1 million. This translates to an unrealized profit margin of 124.4%, with $69.8 million in unrealized gains generated so far this year. 🤷🏻‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/05izbAR202 — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) May 19, 2025 El Salvador doubles down on Bitcoin strategy despite IMF pressure El Salvador’s wallet currently holds approximately 6,181 BTC, equivalent to about $639 million at the time of reporting, based on figures from the nation’s Bitcoin office. Four years ago, El Salvador became the first country to formally adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender, as Bukele proposed, to promote financial inclusion. Since then, the country has been steadily accumulating bitcoin. Though it had agreed to rein in Bitcoin activities as part of a financing deal with the IMF (even allowing private businesses to accept Bitcoin voluntarily), Bukele remained steadfast in promoting the accumulation of Bitcoin. The agreements were quickly turned into law by the legislature in January. On X, Bukele earlier said that although El Salvador’s Bitcoin move has been heavily criticized from all corners of the world, and despite early Bitcoin advocates leaving the project, the country’s Bitcoin strategy lives on. Bitcoin rallies toward record highs The surge in El Salvador’s Bitcoin portfolio parallels Bitcoin’s broader market rally as it hovers near its all-time highs. This has been boosted by renewed enthusiasm for exchange-traded funds and changing economic indicators steering investor capital back toward riskier assets. The leading crypto rose above $105,700 on Sunday evening, extending gains made over the past two weeks. Earlier today, it reached a peak of $106,500. At present, bitcoin trades at about $102,387, according to CoinGecko. While previous rallies were often powered by retail speculation, this one unfolds amid heavy flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, stable interest rate expectations, and renewed debate around inflation as tariffs on key imports come back into focus. Singapore-based QCP Capital wrote in a note last week that, looking ahead, they believe there is further room for digital assets to rally, especially as Coinbase’s inclusion into the S&P 500 becomes a reality in a short while. Bitcoin ETFs attract billions as inflation worries fuel rally US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw over $2.8 billion in net inflows during the first half of May, according to data from SoSoValue. The biggest single-day influx occurred on May 2, with $674.9 million flowing in. As of May 16, cumulative inflows had reached $41.77 billion, pushing total net assets above $122 billion. Broader macroeconomic conditions have also supported Bitcoin’s rally. Lingering inflation concerns, particularly as new trade policies affect supply chains, have added to Bitcoin’s attractiveness as a potential hedge—especially if inflationary pressures continue. A temporary 90-day tariff reduction deal between the US and China has offered some relief, but elevated duties remain on sectors including electric vehicles, semiconductors, and consumer electronics.

CoinGlass data shows a 135% spike in trading volume. Interestingly, open interest in ETH futures has declined by 5.53% during the same period, which could suggest that short-term traders are closing out positions while new momentum begins to build underneath.

Momentum has turned slightly negative, and the relative strength index has cooled from the overbought zone to 59.6. Ethereum price analysis.

His prediction is based on increasing market liquidity and expected pro-crypto policies under a Trump administration . Recent market trends back his bullish sentiment: January : BTC surged 9.54% February : Price correction pushed BTC below the $100K mark April : Strong rebound, but still below $100K May 8 : Single-day growth of 6.36%, finally breaking above $100K May (so far) : Up by 9.20% Hayes explained that the U.S. government is quietly boosting market liquidity by draining the Treasury General Account and using extraordinary measures —a move that he says supports the ongoing Bitcoin rally . Hayes on Ethereum vs. Solana: ETH Is Still King When asked about altcoins, Hayes warned investors to be cautious: “The next altcoin season will start once BTC hits $150K–$200K, but don’t expect 2021-style gains for everything,” he cautioned. His advice: Avoid dino coins (old, underperforming tokens) Look for tokens with high FDV , low float , no users , or no revenue Always ask: Can it outperform Bitcoin? Hayes also made it clear: he’s bullish on Ethereum over Solana . Ethereum remains undervalued and underestimated ETH leads in TVL , developer activity , and security He predicts Ethereum will outperform Solana over the next 18 to 24 months Performance Comparison (Last 30 Days): Ethereum : +48.9% Solana : +17.7% Past 7 Days: Ethereum: -4.5% Solana: -6.6% .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Altcoin Season Incoming?

His bullish outlook on Bitcoin and Ethereum—alongside caution on altcoins and a hedge in gold—paints a clear picture of what top investors are watching in 2025.

According to data from SoSoValue, Bitcoin ETFs brought in $603.74 million over the past week from May 12-16, which was a little over 35% less than the $934 million they recorded the week before. Most of last week’s inflows went into BlackRock’s IBIT, which attracted a massive $841.7 million. Meanwhile, funds like Grayscale’s BTC and VanEck’s HODL drew in more modest inflows of $39.8 million and $7.3 million, respectively. However, not all funds had a good week. Fidelity’s FBTC recorded outflows of $122.2 million, while Grayscale’s GBTC and ARK 21Shares’ ARKB lost around $70 million each. Even Bitwise’s BITB and Invesco’s BTCO recorded modest net redemptions. The other ETFs saw zero flows over the week. Despite the slower pace last week, May is still looking strong overall. So far, $2.64 billion has flowed into Bitcoin ETFs this month, not far off from April’s $2.97 billion. Since their launch in January 2024, these ETFs have now brought in over $41 billion in net inflows. Interestingly, Ethereum ETFs had a better week. The nine ETF funds recorded $41.59 million in net inflows, a solid rebound after the $38.15 million in outflows the week before. You might also like: Moody’s cuts US credit rating, Bitcoin doesn’t flinch Much of the market hesitation can be traced back to Powell’s recent remarks after the April PPI report. While producer prices unexpectedly fell 0.5%, pointing to easing inflation, Powell made it clear that the Fed won’t rush into cutting rates. He stressed the need for “sustained evidence” that inflation is cooling before making any moves. Powell also highlighted that the economic backdrop has changed, real interest rates are higher, and global risks like tariffs and supply shocks are making inflation less predictable. These concerns have led analysts to push back their expectations for rate cuts, with many now eyeing September or later as the likely window. Naturally, crypto felt the impact. The total crypto market cap is down 3.3% over the past 24 hours, now sitting at $3.35 trillion. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is hovering around $103,000, down 0.7%, while Ethereum ( ETH ) took a heavier hit, dropping 4.8% to under $2,400, a key support level. Earlier last week, sentiment had briefly turned bullish after the U.S. and China agreed to roll back tariffs for 90 days, a move seen as positive for global markets. But the optimism was short-lived. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that the U.S. could quickly reimpose those tariffs if talks go sideways. Commenting on last week’s pullback, Ruslan Lienkha, Chief of Markets at YouHodler, told crypto.news that it was part of a natural correction within an ongoing uptrend but warned of potential risks. “The upward momentum in equity markets has moderated following the conclusion of tariff negotiations, as short-term traders began locking in profits, triggering corrective movements. This shift in sentiment has spilled over into riskier assets, including Bitcoin. As a result, the current pullback appears to be a correction within a broader medium-term uptrend. However, ongoing global economic uncertainty and persistently high interest rates in the U.S. may act as headwinds, potentially capping the upside potential of this trend.” Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler Looking ahead, all eyes are on the May 30 release of the PCE index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. That data could be key in determining whether Powell stays the course or finally pivots.

Dogecoin (DOGE) and Tron (TRX) have long been staples for bargain hunters, offering strong communities and established networks. But in 2025, a new player, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is entering the spotlight with serious momentum and real-world use case potential. Priced at $0.025 in Presale Phase 4, Mutuum Finance has already attracted over 11,000 investors and raised $8.7 million. Demand is accelerating, with more than 90% of this phase already sold. Investors joining now stand to gain 20% as the price rises to $0.03 in Phase 5, and up to 140% by the time of launch at $0.06. As the market gears up for its next breakout phase, these three altcoins are quietly building toward what could be a massive run to $5 valuations, making them some of the best altcoins to buy now before the crowd catches on. DOGE and TRX: Veteran Tokens with Room to Run Dogecoin (DOGE) and Tron (TRX) may come from opposite corners of the crypto universe, but both have shown remarkable resilience in a manic market. DOGE, which started out as a joke, has matured to become a popular digital currency with immense brand value and steady sponsorship from A-listers. On the other hand TRX has secured its position within the decentralized content and Web3 world with the promise of speed and scalability along with a growing ecosystem of dApps. While they’ve both hovered below $1 for years, heightened interest and greater acceptance in 2025 may propel them into reach of the $5 milestone. However, with the likes of rising stars Mutuum Finance making waves, even these old warhorses could soon be under threat from the new wave of altcoins. Mutuum Finance on the Rise Investor interest in Mutuum Finance is gaining momentum as its presale gains rapid pace. With a presale price of $0.025, investors in Phase 4 are positioning themselves to earn a 20% return when Phase 5 comes online and raises the token value to $0.03. With a market entry price plan at $0.06, investors in Phase 4 are facing potential returns of up to 140%. To date, the project has raised more than $8.7 million from more than 11,000 backers and the anticipation continues to build. Buy-and-Distribute Model Fuels Sustainable Growth Breaking away from traditional tokenomics, Mutuum Finance utilizes a “Buy-and-Distribute” model. It involves purchasing MUTM tokens on the open market and redistributing them to stakers, thus encouraging user engagement and long-term ecosystem well-being. A constant stream of rewards also encourages active user engagement and retention. To create a participatory, healthy community, Mutuum Finance has introduced a live leaderboard that displays the top 50 MUTM holders. This feature promotes equitable competition and gives additional bonuses to the high-placed ones—boosting user motivation and overall engagement on the platform. Security and Transparency at the Forefront Security is always given top priority at Mutuum Finance. The platform has teamed up with CertiK, a major blockchain security company, for an intensive review of its smart contracts. Following the completion of the audit, the findings will be made available on all of Mutuum’s official social platforms for full transparency. Mutuum Finance’s presale success with over $8.7 million raised through 11,000+ investors and 90% of Phase 4 sold signals a once-in-a-generation opportunity in the crypto world. With potential returns of up to 140% on launch and tested old guard Dogecoin and Tron poised for a breakout to $5, the trend is clear. Investors who move now have the opportunity to profit before these tokens hit mainstream awareness and prices rocket through the roof. Don’t miss your chance to get in early on these sub-$0.50 altcoins that will see explosive growth in 2025. Act now before the window of opportunity closes and the herd rushes in.

Analyst Shares Annual Return Forecast for BTC,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/are-the-days-of-bitcoins-exponential-growth-behind-us-analyst-shares-annual-return-forecast-for-btc/,"Famous cryptocurrency analyst Willy Woo shared a remarkable analysis on Bitcoin's (BTC) annual compound return rate (CAGR). Woo noted that investors have unrealistic expectations about BTC and drew attention to the changes that have occurred over the years. Woo shared on social media, “People see BTC as an asset that rises forever. However, the real CAGR chart is obvious.” Woo, who reminded that Bitcoin's annual returns exceeded 100% in 2017, argued that this period is now behind us. Chart shared by Woo comparing the annualized rate of return on Bitcoin to the SP500. The analyst evaluated 2020 as a turning point. Stating that this year was a period when Bitcoin was adopted by institutional investors and even some states, Woo stated that with this institutionalization, the annual compound return dropped to 30-40% and this rate continued to decrease over time. Related News: Watch Out: There Are Lots of Economic Developments and Altcoin Events Coming Up This Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour Schedule “Bitcoin is now trading as the newest macro asset of the last 150 years,” Woo said, adding that the network will see lower rates of return as it stores more capital. In the long term, the analyst, who noted that money supply growth is around 5% and global GDP growth is around 3%, predicts that Bitcoin’s annual compound return will eventually stabilize at 8%. However, Woo stated that this process could take 15-20 years, adding that BTC's performance would remain unmatched among public investment products in the long term until this period. *This is not investment advice.

His latest proposition is linked to attempts to scale the L1 chain, which still suffers from high gas prices and growing demand for data. Vitalik Buterin proposed changes to Ethereum aiming to make the network more friendly to users running nodes. Buterin stated it’s important to run a full node and a personal RPC server, hoping to bring more users onboard with Ethereum nodes. Currently, running a node is restricted and resource-heavy. The chain has 10,051 active nodes as of May 19. The full data of the chain is at 1,312 GB and growing. In the past year, with all active DeFi and L2 verifications, the data load for Ethereum has grown by over 20%, with a trend to preserve that pace. Ethereum nodes are still concentrated in the USA and Europe, both for the consensus and execution layer. Vitalik Buterin proposed lighter requirements for running personal RPC nodes with limited archives. | Source: Ethernodes.org The Ethereum network still hinges on data centers in developed countries, with around 30% of consensus and execution nodes located in the USA and concentrated on the East Coast. Germany is the second key location for ETH nodes. New proposal offers lighter versions of RPC nodes The bottleneck for Ethereum is also the availability of RPC providers. A smaller pool of providers may resort to censorship, as currently some RPC nodes exclude entire countries, noted Buterin in his longer explanation of eventual updates. Ethereum may add a new type of node with a lower data requirement, which could verify transactions and further decentralize the network. Some users may run partial-state nodes, storing contracts and transactions only relevant to their own use cases. The end goal is to encourage smaller players to run RPC nodes, removing the risk of monopolizing Ethereum between big players. The update on L1 scaling arrives at a time when Ethereum handles 1.38M transactions per day, following renewed interest in DeFi and ETH trading. The chain has disproven claims of being dead or displaced, leading to calls for more relevance and L1 speed. The message from Buterin failed to recover the ETH price, which dropped to $2,375.66, just days after holding above $2,500 . Vitalik Buterin puts priority status on EIP-4444 One of the steps to making Ethereum easier for node operators is to prioritize EIP-4444. The end goal is to have nodes that store full data for only 36 days. This will reduce storage requirements, one of the main obstacle to running even more nodes. The EIP-4444 changes will affect the entire network, with clients no longer serving some of the data that is older than a year through P2P transactions. Clients may locally prune historical data. Full RPC nodes will coexist with archive nodes, which have provided the large and ever-expanding history of the network. The chain has envisioned up to $1 trillion in assets, including ETH, stablecoins, tokens, and NFTs, as well as tokenized securities, requiring reliable historical nodes. On the other hand, verification and short-term transaction processing may become easier without the outsized demand for storage. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The visual tool showcases probable liquidation levels, indicating where large orders may cause cascading price changes. This post explores how to interpret a Bitcoin liquidation map, allowing you to trade smarter in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. What is liquidation in crypto trading? In cryptocurrency trading , liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position. Long liquidations occur when prices fall, affecting traders who bet on an uptrend. Short liquidations happen when prices unexpectedly rise, impacting those who bet on a decline. Did you know? In crypto, a single liquidation cascade can wipe out millions in minutes, triggered not by hacking but by traders using too much leverage at the wrong time. What is a Bitcoin liquidation map? A Bitcoin liquidation map is a visual heatmap indicating price levels where large liquidations are expected to occur. These maps assist traders in identifying zones where leveraged positions may be closed forcibly if prices fluctuate sharply. Tools like CoinGlass provide real-time Bitcoin ( BTC ) liquidation maps, valuable resources for risk-aware traders. With the liquidation map, you can Use breakout trading strategies for profitable scalping opportunities. Set stop-loss levels based on key liquidation zones for better risk management. Target high-liquidity areas to secure profits efficiently. Enter large trades near liquidity clusters to minimize slippage and enhance execution. Analyze the gradient of liquidation intensity to anticipate potential price movements.. Functioning of a liquidation map and key components The X-axis of the liquidation chart represents the bid price, while the Y-axis denotes the relative strength of liquidation activity. Each column on the graphic illustrates a liquidation cluster's relative significance compared to other clusters. The chart demonstrates how the market will respond if the price reaches certain thresholds. Taller liquidation bars indicate a higher potential impact. The various hues are solely for visual clarity, allowing users to distinguish between distinct liquidation zones. Here are the main components of a liquidation map: Heat zones: Indicate where most positions could be eliminated if the price reaches specific levels. Liquidity pools: Collections of stop-loss and liquidation orders that can cause rapid price movements. Open interest levels: Demonstrate where large amounts of leveraged positions are concentrated. Price imbalances or gaps: Disclose areas without support or resistance, allowing prices to move swiftly. Did you know? Crypto liquidations often follow the herd; when too many traders place similar bets, liquidation maps light up and whales use them as price targets. How to use a liquidation map in your Bitcoin trading strategy A Bitcoin liquidation map provides insights into probable price movements and risk zones by visually representing places where leveraged positions will likely be closed. Here is how to use a liquidation map in Bitcoin trading: Identify high-risk zones: Identify places with dense liquidation clusters to avoid overleveraging. These areas come across as magnets, attracting price changes that might cause a series of liquidations. Time entry and exit: Liquidation clusters help find the optimal entry and exit points. Entering and exiting trades before a cluster becomes risky helps you lock in profits before reversals. Combine with technical indicators: Enhance your research by combining liquidation maps with tools such as support/resistance levels and relative strength index (RSI) . This sets out a comprehensive view of market conditions. Avoid herd mentality: Exercise caution in places with high leverage concentrations. Such zones may be traps constructed by larger players to induce liquidations and profit from the resulting volatility. Monitor whale activity: Large traders frequently target liquidation zones to turn price moves to their advantage. Observing these patterns can provide insights about prospective market movements. Anticipate reversals: Markets frequently experience reversals following large liquidation events. Recognizing these trends can aid in positioning for possible rebounds. Implement robust risk management: Use stop-loss orders and handle leverage carefully. Liquidation maps can help you determine where to put these orders to minimize exposure. Common mistakes to avoid when using the Bitcoin liquidation map Using a Bitcoin liquidation map can enhance trading decisions, but misinterpretation can lead to costly errors. Here are common mistakes you need to avoid: Blindly trading toward liquidity zones: If you are trading toward liquidity zones without thinking, expect reversals. Misreading map colors or scale : Making a mistake in judging map colors or scale can skew your risk assessment. Over-relying on liquidation data without context : Maps are valuable tools, not an assurance that what they reflect will happen. Ignoring macro news or sentiment analysis : External events often override technical signals. A sudden event may make all predictions fall flat. Always combine liquidation maps with broader technical analysis. Smart trading requires context, not just colorful charts. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

With the broader cryptocurrency market heating up again in May 2025, the race is on to find the next low-priced token with real potential. While Bitcoin has broken the $100,000 mark and Ethereum continues to dominate DeFi infrastructure, the spotlight is shifting to penny cryptocurrencies under $1—projects that are cheap now but backed by utility, transparency, and strong community engagement. Among these, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) offers the perfect storm of meme culture, AI functionality, and long-term upside—all at a price tag of just $0.004. Let’s break down why this might be the best crypto to buy now before the next rally. Why Invest in Crypto Now May 2025 has kicked off a new phase in the market. Bitcoin's recent breakout has reawakened retail and institutional interest, while Ethereum has surpassed $62 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama. From a macro perspective, bullish sentiment is returning due to global capital shifts, potential tax reforms, and growing blockchain adoption. Now isn’t just a good time to watch—it’s a time to act. Here’s why: The market is climbing, driven by institutional inflows. Penny cryptos offer affordable entry points for new and seasoned investors. Bullish narratives like AI, staking, and community-led growth are attracting capital. If you want to get in before the next bull run, this is the kind of market phase where fortunes are made.

The agreements follow Ripple securing a license from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) in March, allowing it to manage global payments end-to-end for banks, fintechs and crypto firms. “Securing our DFSA license enables Ripple to better serve the demand for solutions to the inefficiencies of traditional cross-border payments,” Reece Merrick, managing director for Middle East and Africa at Ripple, said in a Monday release . Zand Bank said the partnership aligns with its push toward digital finance. “We are excited to soon launch an AED-backed stablecoin,” said Chirag Sampat, head of treasury and markets. Imad Gharazeddine, CEO and co-founder of Mamo, said using Ripple’s services allows the company to offer “faster and more reliable cross-border payments” for both businesses and consumers looking to scale their UAE operations. Ripple Payments currently operates in over 90 payout markets and has processed more than $70 billion in volume globally. The platform is available in Dubai, the U.S., Brazil, Mexico, Australia and Switzerland. Ripple uses a global network of payout partners and blockchain infrastructure to move money in minutes. In some cases, it also uses its native digital asset, XRP, as a bridge currency through its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, allowing clients to instantly convert one fiat currency to another using the token.

According to the chart shared via TradingView and commentary posted on social media, XRP has formed a double bottom at approximately $2.3126 and is currently maintaining strength above a key descending trend line. The analyst emphasized that XRP continues to respect this red descending trend line, interpreting this as a signal of resilience. #XRP – Dipped to $2.3126 (Double Bottom Formation) : #XRP is still bouncing off the Red Descending Trend Line, showing resilience. Currently, we're experiencing some micro noise within the range between Fibonacci 0.888 levels at $2.30 and $2.62. #XRPFamily STAY STEADY… https://t.co/QalFZ5ohtN pic.twitter.com/ekONe5GExe — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) May 17, 2025 Fibonacci Zone Between $2.30 and $2.62 Seen as Key Trading Range In the accompanying chart, XRP’s recent price action appears to be moving within a defined zone, specifically between the Fibonacci 0.888 levels of $2.30 and $2.62. This range, identified by Egrag Crypto as a zone of “micro noise,” is where short-term fluctuations are playing out. The price is currently at $2.3845 as per the 12-hour chart on Poloniex. Egrag noted that the market dipped to a local low around $2.3126, forming what appears to be a double bottom pattern. Technical analysts generally interpret this formation as a potential reversal indicator, suggesting that buyers may be stepping in to defend this level. The double bottom occurs near the lower boundary of the observed Fibonacci zone, reinforcing its importance as a support level. Bullish Scenario Targets $3.10 and Higher if Trend Line is Broken The chart further outlines two potential scenarios for XRP’s future movement. The bullish scenario anticipates a breakout above the red descending trend line, possibly targeting the $2.6194 zone, followed by a rally towards $2.9690 and then to $3.1047. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The final target zone at $3.3967 is also marked on the chart. These targets align with Fibonacci extensions and retracement levels commonly used by technical traders to forecast potential price zones. Bearish Outlook Suggests Drop Toward $1.61 Conversely, a bearish pathway is also mapped out. This alternative scenario suggests a breakdown below the current range could push the price towards the 0.786 Fibonacci level at $1.6126. The chart illustrates a potential “fish hook” move, indicating a possible liquidity grab or deeper correction that might test the $1.2038 level, aligned with the 0.702 Fibonacci retracement. While both directional possibilities are acknowledged, Egrag Crypto’s tone in the tweet remains constructive. He urges the XRP community to “stay steady and strong,” signaling a long-term bullish outlook despite short-term uncertainty. As XRP navigates this zone, traders and analysts will closely watch whether it can break decisively above the trend line resistance or if it will revisit lower supports as outlined in Egrag’s roadmap.

This move follows a volatile rally earlier this week that had pushed the meme coin above $0.000014 before sellers stepped in aggressively.

This move comes in the wake of Moody’s downgrading U.S. credit , stripping the country of Aaa rating due to mounting deficits and escalating interest expenses. The last time the long end of the yield curve reached 5% was on April 9, during the so-called ""tariff tantrum,"" which triggered sharp sell-offs in both crypto and U.S. equity markets. At that time, bitcoin (BTC) was hovering near its local low of around $75,000. It has since rebounded strongly, currently trading around $103,000 after hitting a Sunday high of $106,000. “The last time the 30-year closed at or above 5% (at the 6 PM ET mark) was October 31, 2023. The highest closing yield in recent memory was 5.11% on October 19, 2023, the highest since July 2007, nearly 18 years ago. The current yield is just 12 basis points away from surpassing that milestone,” said Jim Bianco, head of Bianco Research. In addition, the United Kingdom surpassed China in March to become the second-largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasuries, with holdings totaling $779.3 billion—trailing only Japan, which remains the top foreign holder. Both China and Japan have continued to reduce their U.S. Treasury holdings over the past 12 months, underscoring the growing need for the U.S. to attract new buyers for its debt. As the U.S. Treasury faces growing deficits, with the potential of more bonds being issued, increasing supply and thereby pushing yields higher while prices fall.

Who Will Be First to The Party? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Well, it’s been about a week and the results are in: Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade has been compared to the earth-shattering Merge that transformed the chain. A smaller detail, but why “Pectra”? Because it represents not one but two upgrades that were combined: Prague and Electra. The actual improvements are by all accounts just as impressive as its word play, and the very positive numbers are backing the excitement. While Ethereum itself has focused on key features such as smart account wallet UX features, L2 scaling data storage blobs increased by 2x, and validator UX improvements going live, the full list of improvements are impressive. So what’s new with Pectra, and who in the ecosystem was ready to take advantage of these changes? Let’s take a look at Pectra, see what fast actors like P2P.org have done with the upgrade, and speculate on where this will take the Ethereum community. Pectra Upgrade: Smooth and Significant First, it’s important to give credit where it’s due. The upgrade has significant features, but the preparation and rollout have been very smooth so far, something that the giant Ethereum ecosystem greatly appreciates. Web3 chain upgrades do not always have the best track record, and with this many billions on the line, held by millions of users, there is a lot of pressure on the team. However, the upgrade proved that impossibly complex decentralized industries can successfully perform major updates to their systems without interrupting service. When we compare that to the 63 year old programming language (yes, if COBOL was a person it could retire) that is holding together the international finance system, this says more than most people realize. The upgrade itself focused on several key areas. A big improvement was the functionality of staking, making it much easier for institutions to integrate. The prior model required special permission from the staking service provider to exit, required proof of the permission, and could take up to 13 hours. The upgrade removes this cumbersome step, the risk involved, and cuts down the waiting time from 13 hours to 13 minutes. A major piece of this upgrade is the staking limit, or maximum validator staking balance. What was a limit of 32 ETH has been raised to a whopping 2,048 ETH. What’s the benefit of this? For one thing, institutional players can now consolidate their risk by having fewer validation nodes, as they can get benefits for up to the max 2,048 ETH. For all validators, the arbitrary rule of needing to stake in multiples of 32 was not helpful to anyone, and there wasn’t a great solution for those holding some remainder without making use of it. Now, those extra ETH can be added to the stake to maximize rewards, encouraging more staking across the network. Other key upgrades include better communication between execution and consensus layers, which improve the deposits/withdrawals of validators and makes the system run with fewer delays or other issues. The account abstraction improvements are also notable, because they allow for smart contract like interaction with externally owned accounts, which makes for a simpler (and therefore less risky) interaction. Early Birds Are Getting The Worms The powerful validator-level features have also been noticed because the P2P.org platform was ready and waiting to launch their support for Pectra almost as soon as it launched. This is a kudos to Ethereum for clearly communicating the upgrade with enough detail and time to help its supporting platforms adjust, and it’s also a kudos to the P2P team for planning well in advance, seeing how they could best leverage the upgrades, and launching a number of very promising tools. The platform supports the features across dApp and API, including validator consolidation, auto compounding, partial withdrawals, and operator switching. However, the platform has also released the industry’s first Validator Consolidation Calculator to show ETH stakers their personalized upside from consolidating validators, and provides this insight instantly. Other platforms will likely be launching upgrades of their own to take advantage of Pectra’s upgrades, while at the same time looking for brand new use cases for what is being offered. Keep your eye out for what will likely be a rush of upgrades, new features, and entirely new platforms supporting what Pectra is providing to the Ethereum community. What Does The Market Say? Given all this excitement, how far does this move the market’s needle? Quite a bit, apparently. According to Forbes , the capitalization of ETH jumped up by an eye-watering 42% only five days after the Pectra upgrade was completed. This resulted in Ethereum rising to the 39th largest asset globally with a market cap that exceeded $322 billion. The ETH futures jumped as well, showing that there was a great deal of interest, activity, and trading on Ethereum’s road ahead. With only a week behind us, groups like P2P.org are showing what will be possible with Pectra. The next few months should bring along those less proactive, but who can still bring solid ideas and implementation for the new and improved Ethereum. Other ecosystems should take note and see what happens when you dial in your upgrades to provide precision improvements, and do so in a way that is so smooth the implementation itself is newsworthy. With wins like this, the entire Web3 community can continue building both confidence and support among the TradFi crowd who are ready for something that is efficient, effective, and improving all the time.",Information,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-19 07:55:09

On May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum's layer-1 scaling “more friendly” to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin believes there are risks to this setup. “A market structure dominated by a few RPC providers is one that will face strong pressure to deplatform or censor users. Many RPC providers already exclude entire countries,” Buterin wrote. Source: Vitalik Buterin Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes In addition to censorship, Buterin argued that reasons like expensive fully-trustless cryptographic solutions and metadata privacy show that there’s value in ensuring greater ease for those running a personal node. In the proposal, Buterin's solution relies on a novel type of node called “partially stateless nodes.” These nodes are designed to help users maintain privacy-preserving access to blockchain data without the heavy resource demands of running a full node. As Ethereum scales and the gas limit increases, running a full node requires more storage and bandwidth. Buterin said partially stateless nodes address the issue by allowing users to verify the blockchain and serve local data, but only store a subset of the Ethereum state, based on the user’s needs. Vitalik Buterin’s graphic of partially stateless nodes. Source: Vitalik Buterin Related: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systems A new node type to validate blocks “statelessly” The nodes would operate by validating blocks statelessly. This means they don't require the storage of the full Merkle proofs or the entire blockchain history. They can selectively keep certain parts of the state up to date. This means that users could configure their nodes only to save data related to their accounts, the decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and their commonly used tokens like stablecoins and Ether ( ETH ). The rest of the data will be left out, and queries beyond the stored subset will fail or be routed through an RPC solution.

While Bitcoin) continues to chart new highs and anchor the market, attention is rapidly shifting to high-potential tokens like XRP, Solana, MAGACOIN FINANCE , and Trumpcoin. Each of these coins brings a unique story and technical setup, but only a few may lead the next parabolic cycle. Here’s how they stack up as the market eyes another round of explosive gains. CLICK HERE – SECURE YOUR SPOT BEFORE 25x DISAPPEARS Bitcoin (BTC): Bullish Momentum and New Highs Bitcoin remains the market bellwether, recently gaining over 40% in a month and reclaiming the $100,000 mark. Technical indicators remain bullish, with the price expected to average around $120,000 in May and possibly reach $136,000 by month’s end. Analysts suggest the top is not yet in, with some forecasts targeting $150,000 or even $220,000 later this year if bullish momentum continues. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Standing Out From Other Tokens Unlike most low-cap tokens vying for investor attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE has carved out a powerful niche. Its message resonates, its structure is sound, and its early support is strong enough to challenge more established names. Built on a platform of capped supply, cultural resonance, and clear direction, it’s quickly transitioning from outsider to contender. What mak es MAGACOIN FINANCE particularly interesting now is how early investors are treating it—as a long-term play, not just a trade. It’ s rare to see this level of commitment before listings even begin. And with social and market momentum continuing to rise, many believe this may be the only time to catch it before it breaks out fully. XRP (XRP): Parabolic Setup in Motion XRP is again in the spotlight, trading above $2.30 and showing signs of a classic parabolic breakout. The resolution of Ripple’s legal issues and the prospect of an XRP ETF have attracted institutional interest and renewed bullish sentiment. Technical analysts point to a breakout above $2.40 as a key signal, with targets ranging from $4.50 to $7 in the coming months Solana (SOL): Strong Fundamentals, Bullish Patterns Solana continues to impress, trading near $170 and consolidating just below major resistance. Technical indicators remain bullish, with the potential for a breakout above $200 to trigger a run toward $180–$190 in the coming months. Trumpcoin (TRUMP): Volatility and Political Hype Trumpcoin (TRUMP ) has seen bursts of activity tied to political sentiment, but its outlook for 2025 is mixed. Forecasts suggest a possible decline of over 40% this year, with limited upside compared to fundamentally stronger or more community-driven projects. While it may benefit from election-year , its long-term prospects remain uncertain. THE MOST-WATCHED PRESALE OF 2025 – ACT NOW Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE , stands out as the breakout presale, combining scarcity, viral appeal, and early-stage momentum for those seeking the next 20,000% winner. Trumpcoin, despite its political branding, appears less likely to deliver sustained gains. For investors chasing the next explosive cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP are firmly in the spotlight, with Bitcoin’s strength providing the foundation for another historic bull run To learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, please visit: Website: https://magacoinfinance.com Twitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance Continue Reading: XRP’s Parabolic Setup?

Conflux experienced significant losses, falling below $0.10 by mid-May 2022 and closing the year at $0.02198 after a nearly 90% annual decline. Starting the year 2023 at an all-time low of $0.02191, CFX rose above $0.30 in February following a partnership with China Telecom and peaked above $0.40 several times in March and April. It declined to $0.278 by June due to SEC lawsuits, dropped to $0.125 in August, and closed the year at $0.185. By January 2024, CFX increased to $0.2323 and surged above $0.51 in March before falling to $0.2.

Against that still-cautious backdrop, Van de Poppe argues that the recent 38–42 percent rebound in the ETH/BTC pair is the first concrete sign of capital rotating down the risk curve, echoing on-chain data that show Ethereum clawing back ground after months of under-performance. “We’ve had a 40% return against Bitcoin in just a week,” he says, “and therefore the blue chips or the large caps are the ones to watch.” Crypto Watchlist: Top 5 Altcoins Van de Poppe’s thesis rests on a classic money-flow model: funds move from Bitcoin to Ethereum, then to large-cap altcoins, mid-caps and, finally, into the smallest caps once animal spirits truly take hold. With that framework in mind, he singles out five names that he believes sit at different rungs of the risk ladder, each with a specific macro- or sector-level tail-wind. Related Reading: Crypto Bulls Just Got Their Macro Wake-Up Call: Here’s Why The first pick, Chainlink (LINK), is Van de Poppe’s “easiest play” on institutional adoption because “we require oracles to provide data in the web-3 space to connect between web 2 and web 3.” The analyst emphasises that LINK’s bitcoin-denominated chart is “still at an all-time low,” suggesting asymmetric upside if a true altseason materialises. Next on the large-cap list is Aave (AAVE). Van de Poppe calls the decentralised lending protocol “a large cap which implies less risk,” but adds that the market is under-pricing its role in bringing bank-grade yield products on-chain. Notably, the token has attracted high-profile flows this cycle—Donald Trump–linked World Liberty Financial disclosed cumulative AAVE purchases alongside LINK and ETH earlier this year. Moving down the capitalization spectrum, the analyst turns to Wormhole (W), a cross-chain messaging and liquidity layer he describes as “being used to transfer between the chains,” with revenues that cycle back into the protocol. He flags its selection as exclusive bridge infrastructure for multiple real-world-asset initiatives in which “tokenised T-bill funds” migrate across networks. Wormhole’s fundamentals received a liquidity boost when Binance listed the W token with four trading pairs on 3 April 2024, broadening access for retail and institutional desks alike. Related Reading: Analysis: Crypto Heats Up As $35 Billion Enters Market In Under A Month For investors willing to venture further out on the risk curve, Van de Poppe highlights Peaq (PEAQ), a layer-1 focused on DePIN and the machine economy. “It’s the largest ecosystem within the machine economy and … finally waking up again,” he says, citing on-chain data that already show more than 50 companies and six-million devices active on the network. He argues that growing transaction counts and cross-industry partnerships make PEAQ “interesting for an investment thesis” at current valuations. His smallest-cap mention is Alkimi (ADS), which he dubs “an advertising project” whose revenue “has gone 4x from $1.2 million to $5 million” even as the token corrected from $0.50 to $0.10 during the recent macro-driven sell-off. Alkimi positions itself as a decentralised ad exchange designed to cut supply-chain fees and provide on-chain transparency, a use-case the company claims can slash CPMs by over 200 percent for advertisers. Van de Poppe closes with portfolio construction advice rather than price targets. “The larger the market cap, the longer it’s in business, the larger your allocation can be because the lower the risk involved. The smaller and newer the project, the smaller the allocation,” he says. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.18 trillion.

The seizure was made by the AFP-led Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT), which announced the action in a statement issued on May 18. According to authorities, the case dates back to 2018 when Luxembourg law enforcement tipped off the AFP about suspicious Bitcoin transactions linked to the Queensland man. Investigators said they traced the activity back to earlier cyber offenses, including the theft of 950 Bitcoin from a French cryptocurrency exchange in 2013. Although no criminal charges were filed over the Bitcoin theft, a court ruled that the assets in question could not be tied to any legitimate income, leading to the forfeiture order issued in April. Ties to Crime and Gaming Industry Data Leaks Local media reports identified the individual as Shane Stephen Duffy, who pleaded guilty in 2016 to fraud and hacking charges. He was convicted of selling stolen personal data belonging to players of the popular online game League of Legends. While Duffy was not directly involved in the 2011 cyberattack on Riot Games that exposed data from over 5 million users, prosecutors confirmed he had obtained and resold the data independently. Further accusations included hacking the social media account of Riot Games’ president Marc Merrill to promote a service offering unauthorized access to players’ accounts. This crime history, along with the mystery surrounding the origin of Duffy’s wealth, contributed to the AFP’s decision to pursue asset forfeiture under the Proceeds of Crime Act. AFP Targets Criminal Profits to Fund Community Safety Commander Jason Kennedy of the AFP emphasized that the agency’s legal framework allows it to act decisively in confiscating assets suspected to be linked to criminal conduct—even without laying new charges. “The profits derived from criminal activities are also often used to fund further criminal acts,” Kennedy stated. “That’s why we work closely with our partners in the CACT to ensure such proceeds are reinvested in the community.” The confiscated assets will be sold, and the proceeds will go to a special purpose fund aimed at supporting law enforcement and crime prevention initiatives . Since July 2019, the CACT has restrained over $1.2 billion in criminally-linked assets, including luxury items like homes, vehicles, yachts, cryptocurrency, and fine art.

Long liquidations accompanied ETH’s price drop. Below $2,400 could be a buy-the-dip opportunity. Ether ( ETH ) price declined by over 4.5% in the last 24 hours to around $2,380 on May 19. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows ETH lost as much as 10% of its value, dropping to an intraday low of $2,353 on May 19 from a high of $2,587 on May 18.

Ethereum leads crypto market sell-off ETH’s drop mirrored similar downside moves elsewhere in the cryptocurrency market, with the total capitalization falling by approximately 1.40% to $3.25 trillion. Bitcoin ( BTC ) saw modest losses, dropping 1% over the last 24 hours to trade above $102,900. Other major altcoins, such as XRP ( XRP ) and Solana ( SOL ), also recorded significant losses of 2.3% and 4.5% %, respectively. 24-hour performance of top-cap cryptocurrencies: Source: Coin360 This performance comes as the market digested the implications of Moody’s Ratings downgrading the United States’ credit score . On May 17, the rating giant cut the US sovereign credit rating to Aa1 from Aaa, citing the country’s ballooning $36 trillion national debt , persistent fiscal deficit, rising interest expenses, and a lack of political will to rein in spending. This downgrade, the first from Moody’s since 1919, has rattled financial markets, pushing Treasury yields higher and triggering “risk-off” sentiment. “Yields are surging again following the Moody’s downgrade on Friday,” said capital markets commentator, The Kobeissi Letter, in a May 19 post on X, adding: “Trade deals, recession worries, lower inflation, and slowing GDP all can’t get lower yields.” Increasing US Treasury Bills.

Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve remains adamant about not cutting rates , with market participants pricing in only two possible rate cuts in 2025, according to the CME Group FedWatch Tool . The downgrade signals higher economic uncertainty, prompting investors to withdraw from speculative assets, including crypto. Long liquidations accelerate ETH downtrend Ether’s tumble over the past 24 hours coincided with a wave of long liquidations that forced traders to exit their leveraged positions. Over $255 million worth of ETH positions were wiped out in the last 24 hours, with long liquidations accounting for 78% of the total or $200 million. ETH total liquidation chart.

When leveraged long positions fail to maintain margin requirements, exchanges automatically sell their holdings to cover losses. Such liquidations accelerate price declines, exacerbating the downturn.

Analysis had earlier opined that ETH bulls were required to hold above $2,400 to secure the upside. ETH bulls are now focused on the next area of interest between $2,330 and the $2,274 range low reached on May 9. Losing this support would mean the ETH/USD pair could possibly retrace deeper toward the $2,250 zone, which is also the 100-day SMA. ETH/USD four-hour chart.

In a recent interview with Fortune published on May 18, Hayes predicted this breakout could occur sometime in June or early Q3, driven by rising liquidity and increased trading volume. Hayes, who now manages his family office Maelstrom, emphasized that the next altcoin cycle won’t resemble the explosive gains seen in 2021. He warned that many older tokens, what he called “dino coins,” are unlikely to recover due to high fully diluted valuations, limited float, and no real users or revenue. “You probably have a bunch of coins in your portfolio that went down 95%, and they’re not moving for a reason,” he said When asked about Ethereum ( ETH ) versus Solana ( SOL ), Hayes said he expects ETH to outperform in the upcoming bull cycle. Despite Solana’s significant rally from $7 to over $170, he pointed to Ethereum’s deeper fundamentals, highest total value locked, most developers, and stronger security from its proof-of-stake design as key advantages.

For this year, he sees Bitcoin rising to around $250,000. On macro trends, Hayes criticized U.S. Treasury tactics for masking the country’s true borrowing needs. He believes the government is effectively spending more than reported by draining cash reserves and tapping underfunded programs. This, he said, creates excess dollar liquidity, an environment that favors Bitcoin and risk assets. Hayes also revealed that gold makes up 20% of his investment portfolio, including physical holdings and mining stocks. He expects central banks to keep buying gold and believes the U.S. may eventually revalue its gold holdings to help weaken the dollar. In his view, gold could reach $10,000–$20,000 before this market cycle ends. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading near $103,000, roughly 6% below its all-time high of $108,786 set earlier this year.

But for some, it’s not just about any exchange. It’s about Coinbase, the most trusted crypto platform in the U.S. According to crypto analyst Mr. Spock 𝛑 , a listing on Coinbase could unlock Pi’s true value and bring it closer to real-world use. Coinbase Isn’t Just an Exchange—It’s a Gateway to Utility Coinbase isn’t just another platform, it’s a fully regulated U.S.-based exchange, trusted by millions and deeply rooted in the American financial system. And when a coin gets listed on Coinbase, it doesn’t just become tradable, it becomes usable. Coinbase offers real-world tools, like the Coinbase Visa card, which lets users spend their crypto like cash. Mr. Spock explains his personal experience of how he uses this card to pay for food, shop at stores like Walmart, and even withdraw cash from ATMs, all while earning Bitcoin rewards on every purchase. He imagines a world where Pi Coin pays for meals, gas, and groceries, and rewards users with crypto benefits, not in theory, but in practice. Why Coinbase Is Better Than Binance for Pi Further, Mr. Spock also makes a strong case for why Coinbase matters more than Binance, especially in the U.S. He notes that Binance.com and Binance.US are completely separate, with the U.S. version offering fewer coins and features. Binance.com is unavailable to American users due to regulatory restrictions, while Binance.US operates under a different company with limited reach. On the other hand, Coinbase has regulatory clarity and deeper market integration, something Pi would benefit from if it wants to grow in the U.S. Pi’s Real Goal To Mr. Spock and many Pi supporters, this isn’t just about price—it’s about purpose. If Pi becomes spendable through Coinbase tools like the Visa card, it could finally blend crypto with daily life. That’s when the real impact begins, not just building wealth, but changing how we use money altogether. So while many are waiting for any exchange, some believe that waiting for Coinbase is worth it.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-19 08:11:24

He called its long-term chart “a thing of beauty” and believes the future financial system will be built on Ethereum. According to him, no other blockchain is as trusted or widely used. Even though Solana has been doing well, Pal thinks ETH could perform better in the long run. He said big companies and banks prefer to build on Ethereum because it’s safe, reliable, and has a huge community of developers. It’s like Microsoft in the business world — trusted, easy to use, and everywhere. He added that banks also like Ethereum’s layer-2 solutions because they give more control while still using the strong security of Ethereum’s main network. In the end, Pal believes ETH could surprise everyone, especially if it crosses $4,300. He also thinks coins like XRP and Dogecoin might do well too, since most cryptos tend to move together. Key Price Levels to Watch: Will Ethereum Break Out? Pal explained that Ethereum’s price chart is showing a flag pattern, which usually means a big move could be coming. If ETH breaks out, it might change how people think about it. Currently, Ethereum is stuck below $2,500, facing resistance near $2,540-$2,550. Analyst Ali Martinez has also hinted that Ethereum could be starting its new bull run. The MVRV Ratio has flipped from bearish to bullish, a strong sign that momentum is now favoring the bulls. Whales have accumulated over 450,000 ETH in the past month. Exchange data also confirms the trend, with nearly 1 million Ethereum having been withdrawn since April, reducing sell pressure. If Ethereum stays above $2,200, it could rise to $3,000 and maybe even $4,000 as buying momentum grows, the analyst says. According to experts, altcoin bull markets start quietly, with doubts and big selloffs initially, but then come the big gains.",News|Crypto news|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-19 08:17:54

Hayes expects a selective altcoin season by Q3, with Ethereum outperforming Solana. He links BTC’s rise to Treasury actions, market liquidity; holds 20% gold. Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, has predicted that Bitcoin could reach $250,000 before the end of 2025 and $1 million by 2028. Speaking at Token2049 in Dubai, Hayes largely attributes these optimistic targets to an anticipated expansion of U.S. government debt, a consequent increase in market liquidity, and potential shifts in political leadership. Hayes Links Bitcoin Surge to US Debt, Treasury’s Liquidity Measures Hayes elaborated on the U.S. fiscal situation, noting the Treasury’s reliance on non-traditional methods, such as drawing down the Treasury General Account (TGA) and employing “Extraordinary Measures,” to sustain government operations without issuing new debt that would breach the current debt ceiling.

Our dYdX price prediction for 2025 expects a maximum price of $4.55. In 2030, we expect the dYdX price to touch $29.58. The dYdX exchange captured significant attention last year. The platform aimed to migrate its existing dYdX tokens from Ethereum to this new mainnet. However, in the fall of 2024, the platform disclosed that it was reducing its workforce by 35%. As dYdX’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does dYdX have the potential to hit the $10 mark soon?” or “Will dYdX ever go up?” or “Where will dYdX be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our dYdX price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency dYdX Token dYdX Price $0.6336 (-3.7%) Market Cap $521.81 Million Trading Volume $23.41 Million Circulating Supply 776.55 Million dYdX All-time High $4.53 All-time Low $0.506 24-hour high $0.6789 24-hour low $0.6131 dYdX price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.6336 Price Prediction $2.45 (+226.15%) Fear & Greed Index 70 (Greed) Sentiment Bullish Volatility 7.24% Green Days 20/30 (67%) 50-Day SMA $0.626925 200-Day SMA $0.943347 14-Day RSI 61.18 dYdX price analysis: dYdX surged toward $0.68 but faced a rejection TL;DR Breakdown: dYdX price analysis shows that dYdX faced a rejection after surging above $0.68. Resistance for dYdX is at $0.6854 Support for dYdX/USD is at $0.6092 The dYdX price analysis for 19 May confirms that dYdX faced a bearish pressure after attempting to surge above $0.68. Over the last few hours, the price of dYdX has been hovering around support channels. dYdX price analysis 1-day chart: dYdX price dropped toward $0.62 following rejection An analysis of the daily dYdX price chart shows the token faced selling pressure after the price failed to maintain momentum above $0.68. As a result, buyers are now defending a drop below the $0.62 level. The 24-hour volume surged to $10.09 million, showing increased interest in trading today. dYdX is trading at $0.6336, declining by over 3.7% in the last 24 hours. dYdX shows volatility The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and trades below the neutral level at level 48, hinting that sellers are dominating. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. dYdX/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour dYdX price chart suggests that bulls strengthen their position as they aim for a hold of the price above the EMA trend lines. However, sellers are pushing the price below EMA20 trend line. dYdX price chart The BoP indicator trades in a bearish region at 0.52, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line, and the indicator aims for a positive momentum, strengthening long-position holders’ confidence. dYdX technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.92964 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.84402 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.844129 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.807292 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.948906 SELL SMA 100 $ 1.315705 SELL SMA 200 $ 1.23951 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.8087 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.902097 SELL EMA 10 $ 1.069497 SELL EMA 21 $ 1.266273 SELL EMA 50 $ 1.426172 SELL EMA 100 $ 1.413397 SELL EMA 200 $ 1.475345 SELL What to expect from dYdX price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $0.6854, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.7683. dydX price chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.6092, beginning a bearish trend to $0.5004. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX down today? Following the overall selling demand in the market, dYdX witnessed a surge in selling pressure around $0.68. As a result, bears are aiming for a hold below $0.62. Will dYdX Recover? If buyers hold above $0.6 level strongly, we might see a strong recovery in the coming hours. What is the dYdX price prediction for 2025? In 2025, dYdX is predicted to reach a minimum level of $3.86. Traders and investors can expect a maximum level of $4.55 and an average price of $3.96 if the bulls show up. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiment, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. It is advised to seek independent professional consultation and investment advice from experts before investing in the crypto market, which has high price volatility.

However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $0.5. dYdX price prediction Minimum price Average price Maximum price dYdX price prediction May 2025 $0.5 $0.9 $1.2 dYdX price prediction 2025 The price of 1 dYdX is expected to reach a minimum level of $0.4 by the end of 2025.

At the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, the head of Point72 Asset Management says there’s a 45% chance that the US will enter a period of economic contraction, reports Bloomberg. “We aren’t in a recession yet, but we have significant slowing growth.” Cohen predicts that the US economy will grow by 1.5% in 2026, noting that the figure is “OK but not phenomenal.” Data from Trading Economics shows that the US GDP has grown 3.2% on average from 1947 until 2025. Turning to the S&P 500, Cohen notes that the stock market’s abrupt reversal after falling to a low of 4,835 points in April is “unusual,” comparing the move to the rallies witnessed after the March 2020 Covid-induced collapse. For now, the billionaire says it is within the realm of possibility for the S&P 500 to retrace by as much as 15% or just move sideways in the coming months. “Markets don’t have to go up every year. Markets can go sideways and that’s perfectly normal.” As for the Federal Reserve, Cohen thinks that Chair Jerome Powell will keep interest rates steady to cushion the economy against tariff-induced shocks. “They are going to be worried about inflation from tariffs.” Cohen is not the only one to sound the alarm about the possibility of the US entering an economic recession. Last week, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said that a US economic downturn is something he wouldn’t take off the table at this point, even after the White House signed a trade truce with China last week.

This is a day packed with real-world moves that could either disrupt or immensely boost the crypto market. From high-stakes calls from the White House to a Senate vote that reshape how stablecoins are regulated in the U.S., there’s a lot happening. Let’s break it down – what’s happening, why it matters, and what to watch next. #1 Trump, Putin, and a Ceasefire Bid that Could Quiet the Chaos President Donald Trump will speak separately with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky today in a push to secure a ceasefire. “I will be speaking, by telephone, to President Vladimir Putin of Russia on Monday, at 10:00 a.m.,” Trump said on Truth Social, aiming to stop the “bloodbath” killing over 5,000 troops a week and to discuss trade. He also confirmed he’ll follow up with Zelensky and NATO members. The geopolitical backdrop is heavy – but here’s where crypto enters the picture: research shows the Russia-Ukraine war directly affects Bitcoin trading volumes. A 1% escalation in the war reportedly causes a 0.2% drop in BTC activity. So, if this ceasefire progresses, don’t be surprised to see a volume bounce and a broader market reset. #2 XRP Futures Go Live on CME – Eyes on $2.50? After months of speculation, it’s official – CME is launching XRP futures today! The move works to expand its crypto derivatives lineup and clear the way for new institutional strategies. “We’re pleased to announce our plans to expand our suite of cryptocurrency derivatives with the introduction of XRP futures on May 19, subject to regulatory review,” CME said. If it wasn’t clear – this is a big deal! Not just because CME is the world’s largest derivatives exchange, but because futures products often act as a gateway for hedge funds and tradfi institutions that can’t (or won’t) hold spot crypto. And let’s take a look back. When CME launched regulated Bitcoin futures in late 2017, it famously coincided with the top of that bull cycle. So the XRP crowd is watching closely: could this be a breakout moment? For now, signals lean bullish. Technical indicators suggest XRP could push toward $2.50, and the token is holding firm above key moving averages. Plus, there’s growing noise around institutional interest, with BlackRock’s crypto strategies and the XRP ETF launch both in the mix. #3 Coinbase Hits the S&P 500 – A Historic First for Crypto Coinbase Global (COIN) officially enters the S&P 500 today, replacing Discover Financial Services. What a milestone! “Coinbase Global Inc. (NASD: COIN) will replace Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS) in the S&P 500 effective prior to the opening of trading on Monday, May 19,” said S&P Global in a release. Founded in 2012, Coinbase has grown into the largest U.S.-based crypto exchange and the world’s biggest Bitcoin custodian. As of today, the company holds a market cap of $67.87 billion. For crypto, this moment is symbolic and strategic. It’s one thing to talk about adoption – it’s another to see one of the biggest names in the space sit shoulder to shoulder with Apple, Amazon, and JPMorgan on one of Wall Street’s most elite lists. Wouldn’t you agree? #4 Saylor May Be Back to Buy More Bitcoin Michael Saylor is teasing YET another big Bitcoin purchase for Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). In a familiar move, he posted the firm’s portfolio tracker on X, a signal that’s historically preceded a BTC buy within 24 hours. “Never short a man who buys orange ink by the barrel,” he wrote. Strategy currently holds 568,840 BTC worth $59 billion, up $19.7 billion from cost basis. If this next buy lands, Bitcoin bulls may just get the fuel they need to push toward $110K. Fingers crossed. #5 Stablecoin Vote: GENIUS Act Returns to Senate Floor The GENIUS Act – a bipartisan bill aiming to establish a federal framework for payment stablecoins – is back for another vote after falling short earlier this month. Senator Bill Hagerty said, “Next week, the Senate will make history when we pass the GENIUS Act…” adding that the bill would “cement U.S. dollar dominance, protect customers, increase demand for U.S. treasuries…” Senator Gillibrand echoed the urgency, stressing stablecoins’ role in global finance. If this passes, it’ll mark the U.S.’s first serious regulatory win in crypto – and finally offer some clarity to stablecoin players. Bottom line? May 19 is stacked with events that could set the tone for the next phase of the crypto cycle. Momentum is building.

Analysts have noted that many of these large holders are now shifting focus to Unilabs, an AI-driven fund gaining significant attention with its innovative approach. Unlike other AI projects like NEAR or Render, Unilabs isn’t just applying AI to the crypto space – it’s aiming to revolutionize the entire $500 billion asset management industry. The fund is already managing over $30 million in assets, drawing institutional and retail investors. As ADA whales move their funds into Unilabs, it’s clear that this AI-driven asset manager is quickly becoming a top contender in the 2025 crypto market. Investors Expect Cardano’s Price to Jump as the ADA ETF Odds of Approval Increase Cardano’s price shows potential for a 75% rally toward $1.32, fueled by a bullish technical setup and growing optimism around approving a spot ADA ETF. After a 3% dip over the weekend, Cardano’s price is trading near $0.75. Despite this short-term setback, ADA is testing the upper boundary of a descending triangle on the weekly chart. A sustained upward trend could follow if it breaks through this key resistance level. The $0.91 level represents the 50% Fibonacci retracement – a crucial level. A breakout above this could spark renewed buying pressure and lead Cardano’s price toward $1.32. Though the ADX shows weakening trend strength, the directional movement index still supports a bullish outlook, indicating buyers remain in control. Adding to this bullish sentiment is the rising likelihood of an ADA ETF approval by the SEC. Polymarket data shows approval odds rising from 56% to 63%, signaling growing institutional interest. The success of 21Shares’ ADA ETP in Switzerland, with over $72 million in assets, further boosts optimism. These factors combined suggest that Cardano’s price could soon break out and resume its upward trend, with ETF speculation likely driving further momentum. Unilabs Crashes Presale Records with $580k Attracted in Less Than Two Weeks Unilabs has quickly gained momentum, surpassing $580k in its ongoing presale just days after launch. The success is driven by the UNIL token, priced at $0.0051, which powers a next-generation DeFi asset management platform. With over $30 million in AUM, Unilabs is revolutionizing investment management by eliminating human error and utilizing AI systems to enhance asset selection and portfolio construction. At the core of this strategy is the EASS, a proprietary tool that evaluates new crypto projects based on factors like real-world utility and growth potential. The AI engine processes this data to determine which projects meet the platform’s standards, ensuring a data-driven investment approach. Unilabs isn’t stopping at AI-driven asset management. It is also developing innovative DeFi tools, including the Flash Loan Accelerator. This tool targets experienced DeFi users who want to execute high-frequency strategies, enabling them to borrow capital without collateral – provided it’s repaid within the same blockchain transaction. This feature gives users more control and flexibility, marking Unilabs as a comprehensive and efficient platform for decentralized finance. Can UNIL Outperform ADA in 2025? UNIL is quickly gaining attention as one of the top AI-driven tokens in the market. Analysts are optimistic about its potential, with some suggesting it could rival Cardano’s price this quarter. What sets UNIL apart is its broad utility. It grants holders governance rights, allowing them to vote on fund strategies and participate in platform upgrades. This makes holders central to the platform’s development. The most compelling aspect of UNIL is its revenue-sharing model. Unilabs allocates 30% of its total revenue to token holders through a 12-tier system. The more UNIL an investor holds, the larger their share of the dividends, encouraging long-term engagement. If Unilabs captures just 0.3% of the global asset management market, it could generate $1.2 billion annually, with $360 million going to token holders. This combination of utility, governance, and revenue-sharing positions UNIL as a standout token in the AI-driven DeFi landscape, offering strong growth potential for 2025.

At this price, at least 10,000 XRP would make the holder $1 million richer. But according to crypto veteran Armando Pantoja, the real challenge is not achieving sudden wealth—it is preserving it. Pantoja, who has been active with cryptocurrency since 2011, believes that without a clear and disciplined financial strategy, most people will risk making irreversible mistakes once they gain significant profits. He emphasizes the importance of structured planning ahead of any major price breakout, especially one as life-altering as XRP hitting the $100 mark. Setting a Target: Define Your Financial Baseline Before Selling One of the first steps Pantoja recommends is identifying what he calls a “freedom number.” This figure represents the amount of money an individual needs annually to comfortably support their ideal lifestyle, including all essential living costs, discretionary spending, and long-term goals. He advises investors to calculate this monthly and multiply it by 12 to get the yearly total. That number should then be doubled to account for emergencies, inflation, and unforeseen disruptions. This approach is intended to help individuals avoid underestimating their future financial needs. According to Pantoja, planning based on this framework provides a practical buffer and ensures that sudden gains can lead to lasting financial independence. Long-Term Thinking: Keep Your Principal Intact After such gains, Pantoja warns against spending or reinvesting the initial capital. He explained that the goal is to generate sustainable income through dividends, staking rewards, interest, or even real estate. In his view, keeping the original investment intact while building a portfolio of assets that produce recurring income is critical to maintaining long-term wealth and building generational financial stability. He says this is the difference between becoming briefly wealthy and establishing a durable financial legacy. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Role of Preparation: A Detailed Plan Beats Improvisation Pantoja cautions investors against waiting until they become wealthy to start planning. Instead, he advises putting together a detailed, written plan in advance. This plan should include specific profit-taking points, where the money will be allocated, and how that capital will be structured to support a desired lifestyle. Importantly, he says this plan should be tested and adjusted before market conditions change. Doing so reduces the chances of making emotionally driven decisions when prices begin to rise sharply. Could XRP Reach $100? As of now, XRP is trading at approximately $2.20. To hit $100, it would require a price increase of about 4,425%. Analysts remain divided on whether such a rise is realistic in the near term. Some optimists see a $100 target as achievable within the next market cycle, potentially as early as 2025. Others adopt a more cautious view. Market commentator BarriC suggests that XRP could reach $100 between 2034 and 2040, citing regulatory clarity and institutional adoption as key variables. Meanwhile, crypto analyst All Things XRP stated that XRP can hit $100 without market cap concerns, pointing out that the market cap at that price, assuming a circulating supply of 58 billion tokens, would be around $5.8 trillion. DAG Managing Director Claver also weighed in on the matter, underscoring the significance of psychological discipline. He stated that even if XRP reaches $100, it may not transform your financial situation if you make critical investment mistakes. XRP’s path to $100 remains speculative, but the financial implications for holders are undeniable. Pantoja’s advice highlights the importance of preparation, emotional control, and forward-thinking strategy. For those holding XRP, achieving millionaire status is only the beginning; the ability to preserve and manage that wealth is what ultimately defines financial success.

In a blog post published Sunday on Ethereum’s research forum, Buterin suggested a shift in how nodes store and retrieve data, moving from full data replication to a more flexible, user-centric model. Under this approach, nodes would store only the data relevant to the user, rather than Ethereum’s entire global state, which currently exceeds 1.3 terabytes, according to Etherscan. “Currently, the overhead is impractically high,” Buterin wrote, adding that even with ongoing optimizations, the cost of operating a full node will likely remain out of reach for most users without specialized hardware or cloud support. Buterin Proposes Local-First Model The proposal centers around a local-first model. Instead of continuously tracking the full history of Ethereum, nodes would sync with only the relevant portions and request additional historical data as needed — similar to how public library systems share books across branches. Buterin’s long-standing goal has been to make fully verified Ethereum nodes operable on standard consumer devices, even smartphones. While he acknowledged last year that achieving that goal may take a decade or longer, the current proposal brings Ethereum a step closer to decentralizing access and reducing reliance on centralized service providers. “Relying too much on a few dominant providers invites censorship risks,” Buterin warned. “There’s value in ensuring greater ease of running personal nodes.” How to make Ethereum L1 scaling more friendly to users running local nodes for personal use: https://t.co/881XRJLpI0 — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) May 19, 2025 The proposal arrives as Ethereum prepares for its upcoming Pectra upgrade , described by core developers as the most ambitious yet. The overhaul will lay groundwork for greater scalability and decentralization, aligning with Buterin’s latest efforts. Last month, Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist introduced Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 9698 . The proposal aims to increase the network’s gas limit by 100 times over the next two years, potentially enabling the Ethereum mainnet to handle up to 2,000 transactions per second (TPS). Ethereum Has ‘Huge Opportunity’ to Fix AI’s Centralization Problem Ethereum could play a key role in solving some of the most pressing problems facing artificial intelligence, according to Eric Connor, a former core developer of the blockchain. Earlier this month, Connor said Ethereum’s “biggest mainstream moment” could come through its integration with AI, as the sector struggles with centralization, opaque algorithms, and growing privacy concerns. “AI is plagued by black-box models, centralized data silos, and privacy pitfalls,” Connor noted, adding that Ethereum is uniquely positioned to address these issues. Ethereum has already shown the world trustless, programmable finance through DeFi and stablecoins. But its biggest mainstream moment is waiting in the wings with AI. AI is on a fast-track to reshape almost every aspect of our lives. But it’s plagued by black-box models,… — Eric Conner (@econoar) April 15, 2025 In March, crypto venture capitalist Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures pointed to two key issues undermining Ether’s value: the rise of layer-2 (L2) scaling networks and unchecked token issuance. He argued that “greedy Eth L2s” are siphoning off value from Ethereum’s base layer while giving little back. He also criticized the Ethereum community’s acceptance of excessive token creation, claiming that “ETH was buried in an avalanche of its own tokens. Died by its own hand.” The post Vitalik Buterin Proposes Node Upgrade to Boost Ethereum Accessibility appeared first on Cryptonews .",Ethereum News|Adoption|Ethereum|Vitalik Buterin,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-19 09:18:20

While heavyweights like BNB, ETH, and SOL are expected to ride the wave of Bitcoin’s momentum, Bitcoin Pepe offers something even more explosive—early-stage growth potential paired with real infrastructure. As Bitcoin's first meme-focused layer 2, it blends BTC’s unmatched security with the viral energy of meme culture. Bitcoin Pepe’s PEP-20 token standard unlocks token creation directly on Bitcoin, a game-changer for meme coin adoption.

Why BNB is still a strong bet for 2025 Binance Coin (BNB) might not deliver the explosive returns seen in other tokens, but analysts are not counting it out. Standard Chartered has projected a potential rise to $1,275 by 2025, driven by upcoming ETF developments and the growing integration of artificial intelligence within the Binance ecosystem. Source Currently hovering around $650, BNB’s slower momentum than its peers is mainly due to its more centralized framework and measured growth pace. Still, with deep-rooted infrastructure, AI-powered upgrades, and mounting institutional interest, BNB’s breakout could be a matter of patience, not possibility. For long-term investors, the runway is still intact. Ethereum’s trillion-dollar security initiative reinforces bullish momentum Ethereum is doubling down on security at a pivotal moment.

Source Analysts now view the $2,000–$2,300 range as crucial support. If this level holds, Ethereum could be on track to break past $3,000, strengthening its grip as the top programmable blockchain while boosting confidence among long-term investors. Bitcoin Pepe tipped as top altcoin as May 31 listing nears Bitcoin Pepe is quickly positioning itself as one of the most promising altcoins of 2025.

The $170–$185 range has become a critical zone, with traders debating whether the current price action signals bullish consolidation or looming exhaustion. Crypto analyst Ali (@ali_charts) has flagged a developing cup-and-handle pattern, suggesting that a confirmed breakout above $200 could trigger a fresh wave of buying. While overbought signals remain a concern, the broader altcoin rally led by Bitcoin and Ethereum supports bullish sentiment.

The downgrade, announced late Friday, pushed the country’s long-term rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing deepening budget problems and rising debt costs. The fallout was immediate and brutal. According to data from CNBC, futures tied to the Dow Jones slid by 337 points, or 0.79%, while the S&P 500 dipped 0.97%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 dropped 1.19%. The credit warning came as borrowing costs stayed high and the US faced more debt to roll over. Moody’s said the situation made the government’s fiscal outlook riskier than before, especially as Trump’s aggressive trade policies continue to shake investor confidence. Treasuries rise as Trump tax bill adds more pressure The downgrade also rattled the bond market. 30-year US Treasury yields rose sharply to 5.01% — their highest since April 9, the day Trump’s tariff policy set off a global wave of selloffs. When yields rise, prices fall, and Monday was a perfect example of that. Traders dumped bonds, anticipating even more issuance thanks to Trump’s new tax legislation, which is designed to slash taxes without cutting spending. Nicolas Trindade, a fund manager at AXA, warned that Washington shouldn’t get too comfortable. “It’s a stark reminder that the US should not take for granted its ‘exorbitant privilege’ that enabled it to issue debt at a relatively lower cost despite a very high fiscal deficit,” he said. Tensions over the tax bill have been heating up. On Friday, five Republicans from the House Budget Committee voted against it, delaying progress. Trump, who’s been trying to rally support, posted on Friday, “Republicans MUST UNITE behind, ‘THE ONE, BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL!’ We don’t need ‘GRANDSTANDERS’ in the Republican Party. STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE!” The bill narrowly cleared the committee vote on Sunday. Economists say the plan will make the fiscal deficit worse. At the end of 2024, the deficit was already 6.4% of GDP — far beyond what’s considered sustainable. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that the bill could tack on $5.2 trillion to national debt over ten years. Asia reacts, China slows, gold tumbles, dollar drops Markets overseas didn’t shrug it off either. Asia-Pacific indexes dipped on Monday as investors digested both the US credit downgrade and weak data from China. Beijing’s retail sales climbed 5.1% in April compared to the same month last year — below Reuters’ forecast of 5.5%. Industrial output improved 6.1%, better than expected, but slower than March’s 7.7%, hinting that Trump’s tariffs haven’t hit as hard yet, but are still being felt. Major indexes all dropped. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.05% to 23,332.72. The CSI 300 in mainland China lost 0.48%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 ended 0.68% lower at 37,498.63, while the Topix slipped 0.08% to 2,738.39. In South Korea, the Kospi sank 0.89% and the small-cap Kosdaq tumbled 1.56%. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 also dropped 0.58% to 8,295.1. Gold, usually the safe space when everything else burns, wasn’t spared. Prices crashed more than 2% on Friday, the worst weekly hit since November. The metal didn’t bounce back Monday either. Traders leaned into risk after progress on US-China trade talks softened fears. But as the downgrade panic kicked in, some turned back to gold — too late to reverse the damage. Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade, said, “The Moody’s downgrade of the US credit rating, and the corresponding risk-off reaction by the market, has put some pep back into the gold price.” The dollar index (DXY) also dropped 0.5%, making dollar-denominated gold cheaper for international buyers — but demand stayed weak. Meanwhile, signs of a cooling US economy are piling up. Producer prices unexpectedly dropped in April. Retail sales slowed down. Consumer prices ticked up less than expected. That’s now fueling new guesses about when the Federal Reserve might finally lower interest rates. Waterer added, “I think we could be looking at a July or September rate cut, but how Trump’s trade negotiations fare in the interim could be a determining factor for when the Fed next lowers rates.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Recently, Ripple president, Monica Long , made a profound statement reaffirming Ripple’s transformative role in the financial ecosystem. In a post shared by Xaif on X, Long shed light on Ripple’s strategic position as the connective tissue between banks and the blockchain. BREAKING: Monica Long drops the truth: Ripple isn’t just a company — it’s the connective tissue between banks and the blockchain. This is bigger than payments. This is the future. #XRP #Ripple pic.twitter.com/SmpUkJ9MpM — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) May 18, 2025 Ripple as the Connective Tissue During her discussion, Long emphasized that it is impractical for existing banking systems to interact directly with blockchain. Banks and other financial institutions, entrenched in legacy systems, require an intermediary for effortless blockchain integration. That intermediary, according to Long, is Ripple. “It’s not realistic that the existing system, like banks, is going to plug directly into the blockchain. They do need the connective tissue. That’s what we provide,” Long remarked. She elaborated that Ripple’s infrastructure facilitates crucial processes like moving from fiat currencies to digital assets and vice versa, termed as on-ramps and off-ramps. Ripple provides institutions with secure custody, stablecoin solutions, and asset tokenization tools, addressing key digital finance needs. Infrastructure and Innovation Ripple’s commitment to financial innovation is rooted in its inception. The XRP Ledger, created by three developers, laid the foundation for Ripple’s mission to enhance financial efficiency. Since then, the company has consistently developed use cases that leverage the XRP Ledger’s capabilities. According to Long, the suite of services provided by Ripple aligns with the vision of integrating blockchain efficiency into financial institutions, leveraging the XRP Ledger as a foundational element. Ripple’s approach goes beyond payments, revolutionizing traditional finance’s interaction with blockchain. Ripple connects banks to blockchain benefits – speed, cost savings, and transparency – while ensuring regulatory compliance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Transforming Traditional Finance Ripple’s efforts are particularly crucial at a time when financial institutions are increasingly exploring blockchain applications beyond just payments. Tokenization of assets, a burgeoning area of blockchain use, requires secure and compliant infrastructure, which Ripple aims to provide. Furthermore, as stablecoins play a pivotal role in digital finance, Ripple’s ability to support stablecoin issuance and management becomes even more relevant. By offering infrastructure that banks can rely on, Ripple facilitates seamless blockchain adoption and positions itself as an indispensable player in the evolving financial ecosystem. Long’s statement underscores Ripple’s strategic focus: being the underlying layer that empowers banks to leverage blockchain without directly interfacing with it. Ripple’s vision extends beyond cross-border payments . By positioning itself as the infrastructure provider for blockchain adoption in traditional finance, Ripple ensures that banks can transition to the digital asset era without overhauling their existing systems. Monica Long’s insights highlight a pivotal aspect of Ripple’s strategy—providing the essential connective tissue that financial institutions need to thrive in the blockchain-driven future.

Referred to as one of the best performers at shaking up traditional finance, XRP paved the way for low-cost coins with tremendous potential. Now, popular names like Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Tron (TRX), as well as the rapidly emerging Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , are proving to be leading options for individuals looking to question themselves on what crypto to buy today. Mutuum Finance is currently in Presale Phase 4, which is over 90% sold, having raised over $8.7 million from over 11,000 investors. With the phase going live soon, time is running out to participate. Now worth $0.025, Phase 4 investors will gain up to 140% when the token publicly lists at $0.06. These tokens offer exciting opportunities for investing in cryptocurrency markets in 2025. Dogecoin, Cardano, and Tron: Cheap Altcoins Poised for Breakout Growth Dogecoin, Cardano, and Tron are just some of the low-cost altcoins that are currently trading for less than $1 but have all persisted in showing strength and high growth potential, making them highly rated cryptocurrencies for investment during the current times. Dogecoin remains relevant due to its virality and community-driven strength even years after its beginning as a meme currency. Cardano’s ongoing innovation with smart contracts and ecosystem development makes it a serious contender in long-term crypto investing. Tron’s focus on fast, inexpensive transactions is appealing to users and developers and continues to drive adoption. Although these altcoins have built solid foundations, new players like Mutuum Finance are arriving on the scene with fresh innovation and could be the next big headline in this competitive market. Mutuum Finance: True DeFi Lending Breakthrough Unlike traditional tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces innovative dual-lending practices by combining Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) features. While the P2C system enables users to lock stablecoins in smart contract pools of tokens where dynamically adjusted interest rates earn a passive yield, the P2P system cuts out middlemen, granting users full control over their lending contracts and enhanced anonymity. This combination of time-honored and cutting-edge solutions creates a responsive and effective lending framework, which makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) an interesting choice for investors looking for the most profitable crypto opportunities in the emerging DeFi universe. Security and openness are the pillars of the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is audited by a third party and has written open-source smart contracts with security as the priority, instilling trust in the users. The platform is also being made compatible with both EVM and non-EVM blockchain chains, broadening its scope and liquidity opportunities across multiple networks. Presale Momentum In its current price tag of $0.025, the MUTM token is capturing significant attention among early investors. A 20% price gain in Phase 5 will increase the token up to $0.03. With a foreseen listing value of $0.06, and some forecasters hypothesizing post-launch rates up to $3, there’s significant profitability for early fans. Such market momentum has positioned Mutuum Finance (MUTM) among the top, most-watched low-priced DeFi initiatives. Gamified Environment and Community Incentives To encourage more engagement, Mutuum Finance has a gamified platform with the top 50 token holders featured on a leaderboard and given bonus MUTM tokens. For an additional incentive, there is also a $100,000 giveaway going on where ten winners get $10,000 worth of tokens each. There is also a referral program being conducted on the site where users are incentivized for helping grow the community through organic, grassroots means. Mutuum Finance has raised over $8.7 million raised and 90% of MUTM’s presale Phase 4 sold, early investors stand to gain up to 140% as prices rise from $0.025 to $0.06 at launch. These low-cost tokens have strong growth potential and could be the next Ripple (XRP). Jump in now before the crowd drives prices up and this rare opportunity slips away.

Bitcoin one-day market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Drivers of Bitcoin’s price rally Although there was no immediate trigger for the Bitcoin rally that nearly tested $107,000, several factors may have driven the price higher. For instance, investors seem to be tapping into the asset as a potential safe haven in reaction to Moody’s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating, alongside easing trade tensions. At the same time, Bitcoin has also seen increased capital inflows into exchange-traded funds. Data shows that U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded net inflows of $608 million over the past week. On the other hand, Google also had an impressive week, with the stock rallying over 5% to close at $167.43 in the last trading session. GOOGL one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Bitcoin and Google structural differences The two assets, however, operate in different categories. Alphabet, a technology giant, is backed by tangible company assets, including its vast portfolio of services like Google Search, YouTube, and cloud computing. In contrast, Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that exists solely in the digital realm and trades 24/7 on global exchanges. This structural difference may have given Bitcoin an edge, as its surge past Alphabet occurred over the weekend, when traditional stock markets were closed. Bitcoin’s ability to trade around the clock allowed it to capitalize on weekend market momentum, while Alphabet’s stock remained static until markets reopened on Monday.

Many altcoins have followed suit on the way down, with substantial losses from the likes of SOL, ADA, AVAX, SHIB, and others. BTC Stopped at $106K Last Monday was also quite eventful for BTC, whose price went up to almost $106,000 for the first time since late January before it crashed to under $101,000 within hours. However, the bulls managed to maintain the asset within a six-digit price territory and began a recovery that pushed the cryptocurrency back to a tight range between $103,000 and $105,000. It spent most of the business week between those two boundaries, and the weekend began on a dull note , as most do. However, the landscape changed on Sunday evening when the bulls initiated a surprising rally that drove BTC to $106,000 at first, where it was stopped, but another, even more impressive run pushed it beyond $107,000 to mark a new multi-month peak. Another rejection followed, and BTC slumped by roughly $5,000 within hours to just over $102,000. It has recovered some ground since then and now sits above $103,000, and its market cap is back to $2.050 trillion. Its dominance over the alts has surged to almost 61% on CG after falling below 59.5% last week. BTCUSD.

Moody’s recent downgrade of the U.S. credit rating removed its Aaa status, citing large deficits and rising interest costs. The last time this part of the yield curve reached such a level was on April 9, during the ""tariff tantrum""—a period marked by aggressive market sell-offs across stocks and cryptocurrencies. Back then, Bitcoin had dropped to a local low near $75,000 , but it has since rallied to around $103,000 after peaking at $106,000 over the weekend. Market expert Jim Bianco pointed out that the last time the 30-year yield closed at or above 5% was on October 31, 2023. That was just shy of the highest recent close—5.11% on October 19, a level not seen since 2007. Adding to the pressure, foreign appetite for U.S. debt is fading. The U.K. has now overtaken China as the second-largest foreign holder of Treasuries , with $779.3 billion, behind only Japan. Both China and Japan have been steadily reducing their holdings, increasing the urgency for the U.S. to find alternative debt buyers. As more bonds are issued to cover budget shortfalls, the increase in supply is pushing yields up and prices down. Meanwhile, the broader markets are reacting nervously— Nasdaq futures dropped around 2% , reflecting a growing shift toward risk aversion.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-05-19 09:38:26

According to market tracker DEXScreener, the token trades at $0.003578, with an intraday volume of $3.7 million. The satirical nod to US President Joe Biden experienced a sudden price breakout in the early hours of Monday, followed by a price correction after speculative traders rushed in and out of the market. Several BODEN holders let go of the coin following the president’s official announcement that he would not seek re-election in the 2024 race. The news, shared via Biden’s X account on July 22, caused the Biden-themed token to nosedive by over 57% in the immediate aftermath, and later on 98.8% from its all-time high of $1.07.

Its market cap now stands at $2.5 million, 25,820% below its peak at $648 million on April 11, 2024. After topping out near its local high, BODEN retraced as early buyers took profits, sending the token tumbling back below the $0.0040 mark. As of the latest trading session, the memecoin is hovering around $0.003582, showing signs of stabilization near an intraday support level at $0.0035. Market momentum has cooled, and the token appears to be entering a phase of horizontal consolidation. Biden cancer forced him to step down in the 2024 elections Joe Biden’s prostate cancer has metastasized to his bones, according to a statement released by his office on Sunday. The diagnosis was confirmed on Friday after Biden sought medical attention earlier in the week for increasing urinary symptoms. Doctors discovered a prostate nodule, and subsequent evaluation revealed a high-grade cancer with a Gleason score of 9 out of 10, which they termed a “fast-growing and aggressive disease.” Biden’s team told reporters that the cancer is “hormone-sensitive,” which could help the 82-year-old manage the pain and spread through targeted therapies. The former president and his family are currently reviewing treatment options. As the oldest president in US history, Biden’s physical and cognitive fitness became an issue during his tenure, which naysayers picked up after his faltering debate performance against Donald Trump in June 2024. His readiness to serve another term came into question, amplified by subsequent revelations in a new book co-authored by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios journalist Alex Thompson. One anecdote describes a moment at a June 2024 fundraiser where Biden reportedly failed to recognize actor George Clooney. Trump issues words of encouragement Sitting US President Donald Trump extended well wishes via Truth Social, writing, “ We are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis. We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family. We wish Joe a fast and successful recovery .” Former Vice President Kamala Harris, who took up Biden’s democratic party ticket to vie in the 2024 elections after he stepped down, said she and her husband Doug Emhoff are praying for the Biden family. “ Joe is a fighter, and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership ,” she wrote on X. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer joined international voices in offering support, wishing Biden’s family “all the very best, and a swift and successful treatment.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",News|SOL|USD,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-19 09:41:16

In traditional finance, Moody’s credit rating agency downgraded US debt to AA1. Is Bitcoin front-running a potential US stock market dip? Bond yields spike and Bitcoin drops as US receives downgrade On Friday, the last of the top three credit rating agencies in the United States downgraded the US credit rating on its debt to Aa1, from Aaa, a rating it had held since 1917. With all three major credit rating agencies having now downgraded the US, the impact on the economy is probably about to be felt. Firstly, treasury yields have already risen as investors perceive the higher risk of holding U.S. Treasury bonds. The baseline 10-year yield has spiked to 4.52%, while the 20 yr and 30 yr yields have surged to over 5%. Volatility is going to be a major factor on Monday, while overall, the downgrade means that the US dollar just will not have the same safe haven attraction for investors as it has up to now. The Bitcoin (BTC) drop to $102,000 may have been a bit of an overreaction, or perhaps the result of profit taking, with the uncertainty of how the US stock market will react probably a major concern. It remains to be seen how the premier cryptocurrency will perform when the markets open later today. A final thought on this is that after the previous two rating agency downgrades, the longer term impact on markets was fairly limited. It might even be asked, if investors lose confidence in the US dollar, into which other fiat currency will they put their money? $BTC drops to 0.786 Fibonacci and gets bought up again Source: TradingView Looking at the $BTC chart in the 4-hour time frame, it can be noted that the price crept along the descending trendline for a while before finally breaking free and hitting that $107,000 top early on Monday. However, once it got there the reversal was fairly dramatic and took the price down to perfectly touch the deepest Fibonacci level of 0.786, at around $102,000. From there the price has been bought up again. By using the impending downgrade fallout in the US stock market, market manipulators have probably had a good day so far. $BTC bullish weekly candle close Source: TradingView The weekly time frame for $BTC continues to display a positive story. The weekly candle closed above the critical $104,000 horizontal level - a very bullish event. Of course, the price is back under this level straight away on Monday, but with the rest of the week still to come, another close above $104,000 could be a possibility. The indicators in the Stochastic RSI are coming to the top now, but with the 2-week indicators climbing as well, the weekly indicator lines could stay above the 80.00 level for quite some time. The Relative Strength Index at the bottom of the chart is starting to dip, but once again, there is the whole week left for this to change. All eyes will be on the US stock market when it opens later on Monday. This is likely going to add a lot of volatility to the mix. That said, the market prices these things in ahead of time, and it would not be a surprise for this bad news to be shaken off relatively quickly.

At press time, the world’s leading cryptocurrency is trading at approximately $103,241, up just over 3.50% over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. Meanwhile, the total crypto market capitalization rose 3.10% over the same period to $3.25 trillion. However, BTC’s dominance currently sits at a commanding 61%, indicating that altcoins have lagged. That said, BTC’s surge has reignited bullish sentiment across the market, with popular trader and market analyst Gert Van Lagen confidently declaring that Bitcoin’s march toward $300,000 is now a question of when, not if . “BTC to ~$300K+ isn’t a question of if, but when. The structure is screaming for it — identical to what we saw in SPX and Gold before their breakouts.” The pundit tweeted . According to Van Lagen, Bitcoin’s current price action mirrors a textbook “cup and handle” pattern, having broken out of both the handle structure and the neckline earlier this year. Notably, Bitcoin’s ascent also coincided with a new all-time high for gold, which surged to $3,389 per troy ounce. The rally in both assets reflects growing investor concern over macroeconomic instability, especially amid escalating tensions between the U.S. and China. This uncertain backdrop has increased demand for alternative stores of value, particularly Bitcoin and gold , as investors hedge against a weakening dollar. “Bitcoin’s breakout above $87,000 is driven by rising global liquidity, fueled by expanding money supply and renewed institutional interest,” explained Dominic John, analyst at Kronos Research. Additionally, data from Glassnode reveals a sharp uptick in accumulation by large holders. Notably, whales holding over 10,000 BTC are maintaining a strong accumulation trend, with an accumulation score near 0.7. Additionally, the number of wallets holding over 1,000 BTC has climbed to a four-month high of 2,107, levels last seen during the Trump election rally in late 2024, while smaller holders appear to be exiting the market. “Whales are accumulating huge amounts of bitcoin. They know what’s coming next,” said crypto trader Mister Crypto. On-chain analytics from Santiment also shows that addresses holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC now control 67.77% of the circulating supply, adding over 53,000 BTC in April alone.

As Ethereum ( ETH ) scales, Vitalik Buterin is looking for ways to make running a full node — which currently demands over 2 TB of disk space — more manageable. On Monday, the Ethereum co-founder shared a new post on the Ethereum Magicians forum discussing the challenges of scaling the base layer. While many discussions around L1 gas limits focus on network safety, Buterin pointed to another concern: that increasing the gas limit makes it “harder to run a full node.” While zero-knowledge technologies like ZK-EVMs could help users verify the chain without running full nodes, Buterin argued that full nodes still serve an important role: they allow users to run their own local RPC server “in a trustless, censorship-resistant and privacy-friendly way.” While cryptographic tools like private information retrieval might offer promising alternatives, Buterin argued that fully trustless solutions would likely remain expensive as they fall short on metadata privacy, and still leave users exposed to censorship risks. “ a market structure dominated by a few RPC providers is one that will face strong pressure to deplatform or censor users. Many RPC providers already exclude entire countries.” Vitalik Buterin You might also like: Ethereum enters ‘rebuild era,’ Vitalik Buterin calls for cultural shift To solve the issue, Buterin proposed a new kind of node, partially stateless nodes, which would verify the entire chain, but only store parts of the state that the user cares about. As Buterin explains, the exact portion of the state to be held “will depend on a config chosen by the user.” He also supported completing EIP-4444, a proposal to limit how much historical data each node needs to store, in order to reduce disk space requirements. Buterin suggested using erasure coding to help build a distributed system for storing older blockchain data. Earlier in May, Buterin shared a plan to make the Ethereum blockchain simpler, following months of criticism aimed at the Ethereum Foundation over concerns about transparency, slow progress on upgrades, and the growing difficulty of building on the network. The blockchain developer admitted that the system is currently too complex, which makes it hard for developers to build, maintain, or start new projects.

According to data from CoinGecko, the Ethereum-based version of MOO DENG ( MOODENG ) was up about 15.5%, trading around $0.000050 on May 19, afternoon Asian time. That puts it up nearly 180% from its lowest point this year, and gives it a market cap of roughly $11.39 billion. This recent price jump was backed by strong trading activity. Daily volume surged 130% over the previous day, hitting more than $12 million, a clear sign of renewed market interest. Looking at the 4-hour chart, MOODENG has made a solid recovery since it bottomed at $0.000018 in April. It’s now trading above both its short- and long-term moving averages, which usually signals that buyers are in control. MOODENG price, 50-day and 200-day EMA chart — May 19 | Source: TradingView On top of that, the token recently broke out of a falling wedge pattern , a classic bullish setup. Even more encouraging, a golden cross just formed, with the 20-day EMA crossing over the 50-day EMA. The last time this happened, MOODENG rallied about 140% from the breakout point.

The RSI currently sits at 56, which suggests MOODENG still has room to climb before hitting overbought territory. MOODENG MACD and RSI chart — May 19 | Source: TradingView Based on this setup, MOODENG could continue its rally all the way to $0.000093, which is around 85% higher than the current price. That level also happens to be a major resistance zone, which the token last tested in early February. Momentum on the technical front is also being matched by a rise in daily active addresses, hinting at growing network usage and retail participation. Meanwhile, whales appear to be jumping in, too. Data from Santiment reveals a noticeable increase in addresses holding between 10,000 and 100 million MOODENG tokens, which suggests large holders are accumulating.

At press time, MOODENG was exchanging hands at $0.000050 per coin.

According to Aljarrah, the digital asset is specifically engineered for debt settlement through its function as a neutral bridge asset , facilitating real-time liquidity between counterparties. In his post on X, Aljarrah stated, “XRP’s final use case is debt resolution. Not payments. Not remittances. Debt.” He emphasized that the asset’s deflationary nature positions it for a role beyond the typical functions often associated with digital assets. XRP’s final use case is debt resolution. Not payments. Not remittances. Debt. You don’t burn a deflationary asset at scale unless it’s meant to clear liabilities the world can't repay. #XRP is engineered for that burn. — Versan | Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) May 17, 2025 The idea is that XRP can clear liabilities that cannot otherwise be repaid by enabling rapid, trusted settlement between parties, without relying on the original debtor to deliver repayment in kind. Enabling Settlement Through Neutral Liquidity When asked how XRP could resolve a debt without a direct transaction against that debt, Aljarrah responded by explaining that XRP doesn’t eliminate debt, but rather settles it. This is made possible by XRP’s function as a bridge asset. Rather than requiring the original borrower to repay a creditor directly, the system uses XRP to provide immediate, liquid value transfer to the creditor, effectively clearing the obligation. Aljarrah elaborated that this form of settlement allows both parties to walk away. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP provides the real-time liquidity necessary to transfer value from one side of the obligation to the other. In this framework, the original asset or currency in which the debt was issued does not need to be repaid directly. Instead, the creditor receives an equivalent value via XRP, resolving the outstanding liability. He clarified that this does not mean XRP cancels the debt. It provides a means of resolution that bypasses the constraints of conventional repayment mechanisms. “It’s not about a direct repayment,” Aljarrah noted, “but about settling the obligation through a trusted, liquid bridge asset.” XRP’s Use as a Strategic Financial Tool Aljarrah’s view describes XRP as a strategic asset built to serve a much broader economic role. In emphasizing its capability to resolve debt through efficient, neutral settlement, he separates XRP from other digital assets whose primary use cases remain limited to remittances or retail payments. While XRP is well-recognized in cross-border payments, Aljarrah’s suggestion would elevate its importance within global financial infrastructure if realized at scale. By offering real-time settlement and clearing obligations without waiting on traditional repayment cycles, XRP could prove essential in systemic debt or financial imbalance.

Recently, Bitcoin shocked traders as it shot up to $106K, then quickly tumbled back to $103K , all in a matter of hours. This sudden spike and drop wiped out over $600 million in crypto bets, catching both buyers and sellers by surprise. Bitcoin ( $BTC ) currently trades at $103,168 with a $2.05T market cap, down 0.72% in 24h.

With inflation worries and economic uncertainty in the air, Bitcoin is still hovering near its highs , but the road ahead looks bumpy. Analyst Breaks Down What’s Next Crypto analyst Mags explains that the $106K level has become a key barrier for Bitcoin’s price , making it hard for the asset to break higher on the first try. This latest rejection came after Bitcoin reclaimed the range, a retest that often doesn’t lead to an immediate breakout. Although Bitcoin was rejected again, Mags believes this setup still supports a bullish outlook. He outlines two possible scenarios that could unfold from here, both of which favor upward movement. #Bitcoin is Dumping – But Why? Is It Over? Yesterday, Bitcoin tested the range high for the third time and got rejected again. This area is proving to be strong resistance. Previously, rejection from this same level led to a breakdown below the range. Now, this is the first… pic.twitter.com/4KhFmiQk3Q — Mags (@thescalpingpro) May 19, 2025 Scenario One: Breakout After Brief Pause The first possible outcome is that Bitcoin consolidates slightly below the resistance before breaking out strongly. Mags says this kind of breakout is rare but very powerful. It usually comes when the market catches off guard and leads to a sudden rise in price. If Bitcoin breaks this resistance after some brief sideways movement, it could signal strong momentum and kick off the next rally. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Arthur Hayes Reveals Bold Crypto Market Prediction 2025 , Scenario Two: Pullback Before Next Leg Up The second possibility is a short-term dip. Bitcoin could move back down toward the middle of the range, which sits around the $99,400 level. Mags says this could include a brief move below that price as part of a healthy correction. Such a retest would give the market time to reset before pushing higher again. This path may take longer, but it helps build stronger support for a more sustainable move up. Outlook Remains Positive Despite the recent rejection, both of these scenarios suggest that Bitcoin still has more room to grow . Mags emphasizes that the current price action is not bearish. Instead, it shows a typical pattern of resistance testing before a larger breakout. Traders are now watching closely to see whether Bitcoin will push higher soon or take a dip before making its next move. Either way, Mags remains optimistic about the trend. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The legal onslaught comes just days after Coinbase disclosed last Thursday that cybercriminals had accessed internal systems by bribing several of its customer support agents. The breach, which reportedly occurred on May 11, compromised data belonging to thousands of users, and the attackers are now demanding a $20 million ransom. According to Coinbase, the stolen data includes names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, bank account details, driver’s licenses, passports, and account-related information such as balance snapshots and transaction history. The company stated the breach impacted less than 1% of its 8 million monthly transacting users, which would equate to under 80,000 individuals. Several lawsuits ensue ahead of S&P 500 listing One of the lawsuits, filed in a New York federal court by plaintiff Paul Bender on May 16, alleges that Coinbase failed to implement and maintain adequate security protocols, which has exposed users to “serious and ongoing risks.” The complaint also accuses the exchange of mishandling the aftermath of the breach, calling its response “inadequate, fragmented, and delayed.” “ Users were not promptly or fully informed of the compromise . Coinbase did not immediately take meaningful steps to mitigate further harm, provide identity protection services, or offer actionable guidance to affected individuals, ” the complaint read. Bender’s suit claimed that the leaked data leaves users vulnerable to identity theft and financial fraud and may cause irreparable damage, given that personal information cannot be made secure once it has been exposed. Coinbase was slapped with two additional lawsuits, also filed in New York on the basis of the same complaints, while a fourth case expounds on the initial case to include unjust enrichment. That lawsuit claims Coinbase failed to invest “enough” on data security infrastructure and is profiting at the expense of user safety. Illinois users file class action over biometric data law breach In a separate legal front, Coinbase is also facing a class-action lawsuit filed on May 13 in an Illinois federal court. Plaintiffs Scott Bernstein, Gina Greeder, and James Lonergan contend that Coinbase’s identity verification process violates the state’s Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). According to the lawsuit, Coinbase requires users to verify their identity by uploading a government-issued ID and a selfie. This information is then processed using facial recognition software to extract biometric identifiers. The plaintiffs claimed that Coinbase did not properly notify users of this collection, nor did it disclose how long the data would be retained or how it would be destroyed. Coinbase responds to breach and internal sabotage In a blog post published the same day as the breach disclosure, Coinbase said it had refused to pay the $20 million ransom and instead launched a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the identification and arrest of those behind the attack. Coinbase’s Chief Security Officer, Philip Martin, confirmed that the compromised customer service agents were based in India and have since been terminated. In a recent interview, Martin insisted that the company is working with law enforcement and industry partners to press charges against those responsible, including a “small group of insiders.” “ It sucks, but when we see a problem like this, we want to own it and make it right ,” he reckoned. The company estimated the cost of addressing the breach and compensating affected customers could range from $180 million to $400 million. Meanwhile, Coinbase is under investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for “misrepresenting” user metrics in prior disclosures.

On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) announced that it had released Version 2.0 of the Rulebooks. The regulator said it had strengthened controls around margin trading and token distribution services, harmonised compliance requirements across all licensed activities and given clearer definitions for collateral wallet arrangements. VARA’s team will engage with licensed entities and expects the companies to comply with the updated rules after a 30-day transition period. “In line with global regulatory best practices, a 30-day transition period has been granted to all impacted virtual asset service providers [VASPs], with full compliance required by 19 June 2025,” VARA wrote. VARA enhances supervisory mechanisms VARA highlighted that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms across several regulated activities. This includes advisory, broker-dealer, custody, exchange, lending and borrowing, virtual asset (VA) management and investment, and VA transfer and settlement services. A VARA spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the updates will bring consistency across all activity-based rules defining core operational terms. The spokesperson gave examples of terms like “client assets,” “qualified custodians,” and “collateral requirements” as some of the terms more consistently defined in the update. The update also aligned risk management and disclosure obligations, where activities overlap, in areas like brokerage, custody and exchange. “The aim was to reduce ambiguity and help VASPs navigate cross-functional compliance more easily,” VARA told Cointelegraph.

Margin trading allows traders to control large positions with smaller amounts of capital. It amplifies both gains and losses. Tightening the leverage traders use helps limit the risks of widespread liquidations in a market downturn. The crypto regulator introduced a new section on token distribution that sets out licensing prerequisites, investor protections and marketing restrictions. The spokesperson emphasized the marketing restrictions, especially for “retail-facing offers.” “It’s about aligning with global conduct expectations and closing observed regulatory gaps,” the VARA spokesperson said.

In theory, self-custody wallets represent the ultimate form of financial freedom. In practice, they are the reason most people give up on crypto. Losing access, dealing with seed phrases, and navigating confusing interfaces is not empowering. Web3 continues to preach financial sovereignty, but most people just want to send money without feeling like they are solving a puzzle. You might also like: From TVL to TVU: Web3 needs a new narrative | Opinion The web3 ecosystem has placed ideology ahead of usability. The promise of decentralization and user control is compelling, but it means little if the tools are too frustrating for the average person. For crypto to reach the next billion users, convenience needs to be prioritized alongside sovereignty. Web3 is still building for insiders Despite the industry’s progress, onboarding into web3 remains broken. Wallets are still designed for users who already understand crypto, not for the millions who do not. Most people are expected to write down and store complex seed phrases, understand gas fees, switch between chains, and avoid costly mistakes. There is no support system, no fallback, and often no way to recover funds if something goes wrong. These are not small issues. They are the primary reason everyday users hesitate to engage with web3 at all. User data backs this up. A 2024 survey by ConsenSys revealed that over 55% of respondents found self-custody wallets intimidating or confusing. Abandonment rates are high, especially among first-time users. Fear of making irreversible mistakes with their funds keeps many from transacting after onboarding. A separate survey by RIF Technology showed that 13.25% of users identified onboarding and access as major challenges when learning to use blockchain products, while nearly a quarter (24.56%) called for easier onboarding and better mechanisms to avoid losing keys. These are not edge cases. This is the norm. Users are asking for simplicity, not sovereignty alone At the same time, people are more comfortable with digital finance than ever before. Platforms like Revolut, Nubank, Paytm, and Venmo have trained millions of users to expect simplicity, instant transactions, and customer support when things go wrong. These platforms are growing rapidly because they remove friction from the user experience. Meanwhile, most web3 apps are adding it. It is clear that people do want more control over their money. The rise in demand for self-custody after incidents like the recent Bybit hack proves this. That breach reminded users that even major, well-known platforms are vulnerable, and that trusting centralized services with full custody of funds comes with risk. Events like this push users to seek options where they feel more in control of their assets. But they want control that is safe, understandable, and forgiving. Not control that comes with a warning label and a sense of dread every time they open their wallet. This is where the industry needs a mindset shift. We need to stop treating convenience as a compromise. It is not. It is a feature. In fact, it is the feature that will determine whether crypto becomes infrastructure for the next generation of finance or remains a niche subculture. CeDeFi shows there’s a better way Until recently, most projects chose either full decentralization or full custodianship, with little room for in-between models that offered both control and safety. There is a viable path forward. CeDeFi, or centralized-decentralized finance, blends the best of both worlds. It gives users optionality. You can hold your keys or delegate custody. You can switch between custodial and non-custodial experiences depending on your risk tolerance or level of expertise. CeDeFi models allow for user protection and simplicity while still honoring the principles of decentralization. Beyond CeDeFi, other usability-driven innovations are also reshaping how people interact with crypto. Features like username-based transfers and wallet integrations with familiar platforms like Telegram are designed to reduce friction at every touchpoint. The Open Network (TON), for example, used its integration with Telegram to surpass 10.78 million activated wallets, a 1,400% increase in one year. This surge was driven by seamless in-app wallet creation and a user experience modeled after web2 simplicity. By prioritizing ease of use, some platforms are helping people who have never interacted with crypto before begin to use it regularly. And they are staying. Retention is higher when users feel confident. Adoption grows when people feel safe. The broader industry needs to follow suit. There is too much talent, capital, and potential in web3 to keep building for an elite group of technically proficient users. If we want to bring web3 to the world, we have to stop expecting the world to adapt to web3. The tools must evolve to meet people where they are. Crypto does not win by being philosophically pure. It wins by being usable. The next wave of adoption will not come from pushing users toward abstract ideals. It will come from designing products that respect users’ time, attention, and expectations. Sovereignty is important, but without convenience, it stays out of reach. The challenge now falls to the next wave of builders: to create experiences that make users feel both empowered and at ease.

In a detailed blog post on May 19 , Buterin introduced the concept of partially stateless nodes – a breakthrough approach designed to make running Ethereum nodes easier, more efficient, and censorship-resistant. Here’s what you need to know. The Hidden Danger of RPC Centralization There is a growing risk in the Ethereum ecosystem: the increasing dominance of Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers. These services allow wallets, users, and decentralized apps to interact with Ethereum without running their own full nodes, but there’s a catch. “A market structure dominated by a few RPC providers will face strong pressure to deplatform or censor users,” Buterin warned . Some providers already exclude entire countries, creating a dangerous concentration of power that threatens Ethereum’s foundational principles of openness and trustlessness. What Are Partially Stateless Nodes – And Why They Matter Buterin’s solution? Partially stateless nodes – a novel node design that validates blocks “statelessly.” Unlike traditional full nodes that require storing the entire blockchain history and all Merkle proofs, these nodes selectively keep only relevant data subsets. This means users can configure their nodes to store data tied to their own accounts, frequently used decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and popular tokens like Ether and stablecoins. Queries outside this stored subset either fail or are routed through RPC providers, dramatically reducing storage needs and bandwidth without sacrificing security. Balancing Efficiency, Privacy, and Trust As Ethereum scales and gas limits rise, running a full node becomes increasingly resource-intensive. Partially stateless nodes aim to ease this burden, enabling more users to run nodes locally and maintain privacy-preserving access to blockchain data. Beyond reducing resource demands, this design addresses metadata privacy concerns, helping users avoid exposing their full transaction activity. The approach aligns with ongoing Ethereum Improvement Proposals like EIP-4444, which focuses on decentralized history storage, and reflects Buterin’s broader push to keep Ethereum’s infrastructure robust and user-friendly.

The move marks a major expansion of CME’s crypto offering, coming soon after its Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) futures products. Breaking Down the New XRP Futures Contracts According to a notice from April 24, the new offerings will provide traders with cash-settled exposure to XRP’s price movement based on the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate without requiring actual ownership of the asset. They also come in two distinct contract sizes to accommodate different trading strategies. The standard XRP futures contract, listed under the ticker code XRP, represents 50,000 tokens with a minimum price fluctuation of $0.0005 per one, equating to $25 per contract. For traders looking for smaller exposure, the Micro XRP futures contract (MXP) covers 2,500 XRP with the same minimum tick size of $0.0005, translating to $1.25 per contract. After-hours participants were able to access the contracts from the evening of May 18 on CME Globex and CME ClearPort. Trading hours are set to follow the standard Sunday-to-Friday CME schedule, with a one-hour daily break beginning at 4 pm CT. Per the CME notice, these contracts will be listed monthly for six consecutive months, and supplemented by four quarterly listings in March, June, September, and December. The minimum threshold for block trades stands at five contracts for standard futures and ten for micro futures, with trades required to be reported within 15-minute windows. Additionally, fee structures vary significantly depending on participant type. Individual members will enjoy the lowest rates at $4 per standard contract and $0.75 for the micro one, while non-members will have to dig deeper into their pockets, respectively coughing up $7.50 and $1.15 for the standard and micro contracts. Legal Overhang The products’ launch comes only days after Judge Analisa Torres denied a joint motion by Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an indicative ruling on a $50 million settlement they had agreed on that would have ended a years-long legal spat between the two. The judge, who previously declared that programmatic sales of XRP did not constitute security offerings, stated that it would be “procedurally improper” to approve the motion since neither the regulator nor the crypto payments company filed it correctly. Meanwhile, despite the bullish implications of institutional adoption, the price of XRP has shown muted movement. At the time of writing, the token had dipped slightly by 1.3% in 24 hours and lost 2.6% across seven days. However, it maintains a 12.1% gain over the past month, suggesting some accumulation in anticipation of the futures rollout.

Lucie, Shiba Inu’s lead marketer, has recently reaffirmed the token’s relevance in a detailed post, emphasizing its resilience, decentralized nature, and the unwavering support of its global community. In a Sunday post , the pundit explained why SHIB remains a significant player in the digital asset ecosystem of 2025, tracing its transformation from a meme-inspired experiment to a multifaceted blockchain project. “What began as an experiment became a global force ,” she wrote, referencing SHIB’s launch in August 2020 by the pseudonymous creator Ryoshi with the aim of eventually shifting control from traditional power structures directly to the people. Notably, often dismissed in its early days as “just another meme coin,” SHIB defied expectations, soaring to a peak market capitalization of over $40 billion in October 2021. According to Lucie, what sets SHIB apart isn’t just its price action, but its real-world impact, like enabling community members to buy homes, clear debts, and launch businesses. One of the defining moments in SHIB’s history came in 2021, when Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin famously burned 410 trillion SHIB tokens and donated another 50 trillion to India’s Relief Fund. This act reduced supply and demonstrated SHIB’s potential for humanitarian impact. Lucie also credited SHIB’s ability to thrive amid leadership changes. When founder Ryoshi stepped away in 2022, Shytoshi Kusama took over, expanding the ecosystem significantly. Today, SHIB includes a decentralized exchange (ShibaSwap), multiple tokens (LEASH, BONE, TREAT), NFT collections, and, most notably, Shibarium, the project’s Layer 2 blockchain. “ Shibarium represents the natural evolution of the ecosystem,” Lucie said, pointing to its achievements such as over 1 billion transactions , millions of wallet addresses, and 5-second block times as of April 2025. She also emphasized that, unlike many contemporaries that emerged in the same bull cycle, SHIB has never been beholden to venture capitalists or corporate agendas. “SHIB has never been controlled by billionaires or VC firms,” Lucie added. “There were no private sales, no early access, just a community pushing together.” Meanwhile, the ecosystem’s community, known as the ShibArmy, remains the project’s heartbeat. From organizing token burns and developing new tools to expanding adoption, their grassroots efforts have sustained SHIB through every high and low. That said, as the crypto market continues to mature, SHIB stands as a testament to decentralization’s power to survive multiple market crashes, outlive numerous competitors, and continuously evolve its utility beyond its meme coin origins. “This is decentralization in its purest form,” Lucie concluded. “ This is hope coded into the blockchain.” At press time, SHIB was trading at $0.00001404, down 3.11% in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|SHIB|SHIBA INU,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-19 10:11:52

Late on Sunday, the digital assets market capitalization climbed to a high of $3.32 trillion, only to crash by more than $110 billion to $3.2 trillion at press time.

Total cryptocurrency market valuation one-week chart. Source: TradingView Why the crypto market erased $100 billion in a day At press time on May 19, there appeared to be two main reasons for the volatility and downturn. The first involved the world’s premier cryptocurrency, Bitcoin ( BTC ), as it attempted and failed to find a footing above $105,000 after its highest weekly close in history. The seven-day chart for BTC shows two strong upswings over the weekend, with one crossing above $105,000 and the other moving even higher above $106,000. Considering Bitcoin’s influence on other digital assets, it is safe to assume that the two rallies generated significant optimism for altcoins and that the correction initiated a wider sell-off. However, the fact that BTC itself corrected 2.97% in the last 24 hours to its press time price of $103,277 indicates there is more to the downturn than the market simply following the leader.

Source: Google Profit-taking limits rallies amid resurgent economic uncertainty Moody’s decision to downgrade the U.S. credit rating caused investor anxiety and arguably spoiled the growing bullishness that followed the 90-day trade truce with China. The situation was exacerbated by the growing 30-year treasury yield, especially since President Trump already demonstrated his sensitivity to the metric during the Liberation Day announcement turmoil. Overall, the latest cryptocurrency market wipe likely showcases that any potential upsides are limited in the second half of May by investors seeking to lock in profits before macroeconomic uncertainty either leads to another crash or dissipates.

Announcing the prediction for the highly anticipated altcoin season, Arthur Hayes said that the altcoin season is expected to occur this summer or early in the third quarter. When Will Altcoin Season Begin? Speaking to Fortuna, Hayes explained his predictions about Bitcoin and altcoins, as well as curiosities about his portfolio. Hayes stated that he also invested in gold apart from cryptocurrencies at this point and said that gold constitutes approximately 20% of his personal investment portfolio. He argued that for the expected altcoin season, Bitcoin must first surpass $110,000 and climb to between $150,000 and $200,000 with increasing trading volume. He said he expects this growth in BTC to likely occur this summer or early in the third quarter. According to Hayes, when Bitcoin reaches these levels, the altcoin season will also begin. However, Hayes stated that this altcoin season will not be like the 2021 super cycle, where each altcoin increased 100 times, and warned investors against some altcoins. According to Hayes, older altcoins with high fully diluted valuations (FDV), low circulating supply, low user base, and low revenue are unlikely to perform well in this cycle. Ethereum Will Surpass Solana! Hayes also said that ETH has stronger upside potential than Solana, citing Ethereum’s high total value locked (TVL), robust developer ecosystem, and position as the most secure proof-of-stake blockchain. Hayes, who acknowledged that Solana has seen a tremendous rise from $7 to $170, said that despite this rise, he expects ETH to perform better in the upcoming bull market. Bitcoin Price Prediction! Finally, Hayes, who also announced his Bitcoin price prediction, estimates that Bitcoin will reach $1 million before Trump's term ends and approximately $250,000 by the end of 2025. *This is not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. LayerK is helping build a freer, user-powered internet, one that shifts control from Big Tech to communities through open, decentralized blockchain infrastructure. The internet has long been celebrated as a force for empowerment, a place where anyone can share ideas, build tools, and connect across borders. Yet as the digital world evolved, power slowly shifted away from users and into the hands of a few dominant tech companies. Today, most online interactions pass through centralized platforms that control access, algorithms, and data. This reality has prompted a new wave of innovation: one that doesn’t just seek better tools, but a better foundation. At the heart of this movement is web3 , a vision of the internet that prioritizes autonomy, transparency, and collaboration. And among the projects leading this transformation is LayerK, a blockchain ecosystem designed to support a decentralized, post-Big Tech internet. For years, centralized tech platforms have been the gatekeepers of digital interaction. The result is a digital landscape that often feels efficient but disempowering. This centralized structure has made the internet less resilient, less open, and less inclusive. But it doesn’t have to stay that way. The web3 alternative: Rebuilding with blockchain Web3 is not just a trend, it’s a reimagination of how the internet should work. Instead of relying on a handful of powerful intermediaries, web3 systems use blockchain technology to distribute control across communities and code. In this model, data is no longer stored in single databases controlled by corporations. It is distributed across transparent, tamper-resistant ledgers. Applications aren’t bound by single ecosystems but operate in interoperable environments. And users don’t just consume, they contribute, govern, and co-create. Blockchain enables these shifts by providing a trustless infrastructure, where coordination doesn’t rely on central authorities but on protocols and participation. Still, the promise of web3 will only be fulfilled if the underlying systems are truly open, usable, and scalable. That’s where LayerK comes in. LayerK: Infrastructure for a freer internet LayerK is built on the idea that decentralization should not be limited to the technically elite. Its infrastructure is designed for accessibility, interoperability, and long-term sustainability. With full compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) , LayerK allows developers to seamlessly migrate or build decentralized applications using familiar tools. Its smart contract capabilities open doors for innovation in governance, identity, and coordination, empowering builders to create systems that put users, not corporations, at the center. But LayerK goes further. It doesn’t just operate as a standalone network. It actively integrates with other platforms and tools in the web3 space, functioning as a connective layer that expands access and utility across ecosystems. This means communities can tap into the broader web3 landscape without having to navigate the fragmentation or complexity often associated with early blockchain networks. From control to collaboration LayerK’s mission isn’t about replacing existing platforms with new ones. It’s about reimagining digital interaction in a way that restores balance. In a post-Big Tech internet, the goal isn’t to rebuild the same structures under different names, it’s to fundamentally change how those structures work. By shifting away from centralized control and toward decentralized collaboration, LayerK helps users reclaim agency over their digital lives. It invites developers to build with transparency and purpose. And it creates pathways for communities to shape the tools they rely on. This is the essence of the web3 paradigm shift, not just decentralized infrastructure, but decentralized opportunity. Looking ahead: An internet reclaimed The transition from centralized systems to a decentralized web won’t happen overnight. But the direction is clear. Around the world, people are asking new questions about ownership, governance, and trust in digital spaces. They’re seeking tools that reflect their values, and ecosystems that don’t just serve them, but include them. LayerK is part of this new generation of infrastructure: open, adaptable, and human-focused. It’s not building the internet of the past, where control was centralized and opaque. It’s building the internet of the future, where power is shared, systems are open, and the potential of blockchain can be accessed by all. In a world increasingly defined by digital experience, that’s not just innovation. It’s evolution.

44805974,https://coinpaper.com/9168/bitcoin-fees-hit-2025-high-as-corporate-buys-draw-scrutiny,1747654200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Bitcoin Fees Hit 2025 High as Corporate Buys Draw Scrutiny,https://coinpaper.com/9168/bitcoin-fees-hit-2025-high-as-corporate-buys-draw-scrutiny,"Bitcoin’s growing presence on corporate balance sheets is prompting mixed reactions across markets. As transaction fees on the Bitcoin network hit their highest levels of 2025, Singapore-based Basel Medical Group announced plans to purchase $1 billion worth of the cryptocurrency through a share-swap arrangement. The move, intended to strengthen its financial position and support future acquisitions, was met with skepticism from investors, sending the company’s stock down 15%. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s rising fees reflect renewed demand for its blockspace, even as daily transaction volume declines. Bitcoin Transaction Fees Rise as Price Pushes Toward $106K, Despite Slowing Activity Bitcoin (BTC) continues to capture market attention in May 2025, as its price briefly touched a new local high of nearly $106,000 before retreating slightly to around $104,500. While traders welcomed the surge, they also took note of a corresponding rise in transaction fees, which is a signal that demand for Bitcoin's blockspace is once again heating up. According to recent data, the seven-day moving average of transaction fees on the Bitcoin network has climbed steadily since early May, reaching a 2025 high of $2.40. That marks a roughly $1 increase over just a couple of weeks. The growing fees are often seen as an indicator of increased network congestion and heightened competition for block inclusion, especially as Bitcoin’s price surges. Curiously, the fee increase isn’t being driven by a higher transaction count. In fact, the average number of daily transactions has been falling. Data shows that Bitcoin handled around 507,000 transactions on April 22, a figure that has since dropped more than 35% to approximately 330,000 daily transactions. This inverse correlation—higher fees despite fewer transactions—suggests that the transactions being processed may be larger, more complex, or more urgent, driving users to pay higher fees to ensure prompt confirmations. It also points to renewed activity from institutions or major holders willing to pay a premium to move funds during price rallies. Bitcoin Dominance Reclaims Ground Bitcoin's market dominance, the metric that compares BTC’s market cap to that of the entire crypto ecosystem, has rebounded in recent days following a slight pullback earlier in the month. This recovery suggests that the dip in Bitcoin’s value relative to altcoins was more likely a result of temporary liquidity imbalances than a fundamental pivot toward an ”altcoin season.” Bitcoin dominance chart (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The latest bounceback in dominance signals that investors are still leaning heavily into Bitcoin during periods of volatility, affirming its status as the market’s most stable digital asset and primary store of value. One of the more bullish signals for Bitcoin comes from Glassnode’s data on illiquid supply. The amount of BTC held in wallets with little to no spending history has hit an all-time high, reducing the liquid supply available on exchanges. This tightening supply dynamic is key. With less Bitcoin available for immediate trade and rising demand spurred by both institutional interest and macroeconomic uncertainty, any continued inflows could rapidly tip the scales toward a supply shock. That scenario could drive prices even higher as buyers compete for a shrinking pool of tradable BTC. This trend reinforces a recurring theme in Bitcoin market cycles: HODLing behavior intensifies in anticipation of further gains, leaving less room for new buyers unless they’re willing to pay a premium. What’s Behind the Rally? Several factors appear to be fueling Bitcoin’s current rally. Renewed institutional interest, continued inflationary pressures in traditional economies, and growing concerns over global debt levels have made hard-capped digital assets more attractive. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and recent US Treasury discussions about expanding digital dollar research may be helping BTC find support as a decentralized alternative to state-issued currencies. And while the altcoin market has seen periodic excitement, Bitcoin remains the benchmark asset for those looking to hedge against macroeconomic instability. With transaction fees on the rise and network congestion mounting, the Bitcoin ecosystem may soon be tested again. Developers are watching closely for signals of renewed spam activity. particularly from inscriptions and Ordinals, that could artificially inflate network use. At the same time, increased fee revenues are welcomed by miners, especially following the recent halving which slashed block rewards. For now, the combination of surging illiquid supply, rising fees, and rebounding dominance presents a compelling setup for Bitcoin bulls. If liquidity continues flowing in and retail investors return in force, the case for a sustained push beyond $106,000 becomes more plausible. Yet caution is warranted. The divergence between price and transaction volume introduces potential volatility, especially if speculative activity returns to the market without fundamental support. As always in crypto, sentiment can shift quickly. Basel Medical Group Shares Fall 15% After Announcing $1B Bitcoin Treasury Purchase In other Bitcoin news, Basel Medical Group has become the latest public company to bet big on BTC, announcing plans to acquire $1 billion worth of the cryptocurrency for its corporate treasury. But the news has triggered a sharp sell-off, with shares of the Singapore-based healthcare provider plunging nearly 15% in intraday trading on May 16, according to Google Finance data. Basel Medical’s shares down 15% on May 16 (Source: Google Finance ) The market’s reaction suggests that while Bitcoin may be gaining traction as a treasury asset among corporations, shareholder skepticism remains high, particularly when the pivot comes from firms outside the tech or financial sectors. In a statement issued on May 16, Basel Medical said it is in “advanced discussions with a consortium of institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals” to acquire $1 billion in Bitcoin through a “novel share-swap arrangement.” The deal, the company claims, will significantly strengthen its balance sheet and enhance its ability to pursue mergers and acquisitions across Asia’s rapidly expanding healthcare sector. The Bitcoin allocation, Basel says, is designed to “establish a diversified asset base to weather market volatility” and provide “unmatched financial flexibility” amid ongoing expansion plans. Yet shareholders were far from reassured. Following the announcement, shares of Basel Medical Group (ticker: BMGL) fell precipitously, erasing over $150 million in market capitalization by midday. The sell-off mirrors other recent episodes where investors responded negatively to similar Bitcoin treasury announcements, casting doubt on whether corporate BTC strategies can win broad investor approval. Strategic Play or Risky Gamble? Basel Medical’s bold move is part of a broader strategy to fuel inorganic growth. Just last month, the firm acquired Bethesda Medical, a regional peer, in a move touted as “the beginning of Basel Medical Group’s expansion strategy in Singapore and the broader Southeast Asian healthcare market.” CEO Darren Chhoa defended the Bitcoin treasury pivot, calling it a cornerstone of the company’s M&A roadmap. “Our expanded balance sheet will allow us to move quickly on strategic opportunities as we build a premier healthcare platform across high-growth Asian markets,” Chhoa said. Still, market observers remain divided on the wisdom of merging Bitcoin speculation with healthcare operations. While some hail the move as visionary, others question whether volatile crypto assets belong on the books of a traditionally conservative industry like healthcare. Basel isn’t the first company to see its stock punished after announcing plans to buy Bitcoin. In March, GameStop lost almost $3 billion in market value in a single day after revealing its own plans to adopt a Bitcoin treasury model. Investors reacted with confusion, wondering whether the struggling video game retailer was losing strategic focus. “There are question marks with GameStop's model,” eToro US investment analyst Bret Kenwell told Reuters at the time. “If bitcoin is going to be the pivot, where does that leave everything else?” Despite the pushback, Bitcoin treasuries continue to grow. According to BitcoinTreasuries.net, corporations now hold approximately $80 billion worth of BTC on their balance sheets. Early adopters like Strategy and Tesla have helped blaze the trail, with Strategy in particular using convertible debt and equity offerings to accumulate over $13 billion in Bitcoin. Bitcoin treasury metrics (Source: Bitcointreasuries.net ) Financial institutions are also becoming more open to the idea. In a 2024 report, Fidelity Digital Assets noted that Bitcoin could serve as a “valuable hedge against growing fiscal deficits, currency debasement, and geopolitical risks”—a view increasingly shared by macro investors amid uncertain global conditions. A Crypto Hedge for Healthcare? For Basel Medical, the rationale appears rooted in a desire to gain financial leverage without taking on traditional debt. The share-swap model being discussed could allow the company to issue new shares in exchange for Bitcoin from private investors, thereby acquiring the asset without immediate cash outflows. In theory, this would provide Basel with an appreciating reserve asset that could be liquidated or borrowed against in future acquisitions. But such a strategy depends heavily on Bitcoin’s continued upward trajectory, an assumption not all shareholders are willing to bet on. Moreover, critics argue that using shareholder capital to accumulate crypto risks undermining investor confidence in the firm’s core business. For a company operating in healthcare, where predictability and risk management are paramount, adding a volatile digital asset to the treasury could be perceived as reckless. The Basel news comes at a time when Bitcoin itself is on the rise, recently trading just above $104,000. As macroeconomic uncertainties mount and fiat currencies face growing scrutiny, more companies may consider Bitcoin exposure as a strategic asset. But as this week’s sell-off shows, the market is still drawing a line between financial innovation and speculative overreach.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-19 11:30:00

With high-performance ecosystems and growing developer action, Cardano (ADA) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are two of the leading cryptos to invest in today for those who desire to convert a minor investment into huge gains. ADA, already a household name for blockchain technology, keeps getting better through upgrades and ecosystem growth. Alternatively, Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming an exemplary altcoin with tremendous upside. Mutuum Finance has currently reached Presale Phase 4, with over 90% already sold at the price of $0.025 currently. Investor interest is still very high, and there are over 11,000 buyers as well as a total raise of $8.7 million. People joining in at this level can earn up to 140% if the token is trading at $0.06. Cardano vs. Solana: The Cleverer 2025 Wager Pays Off Though Solana has been promoted for its blistering pace and scalability, Cardano (ADA) is the more stable, research-based player in the Layer 1 game. From peer-reviewed science and gradual, deliberate upgrades, Cardano has cultivated a robust developer community and now is reaping returns on smart contract functionality at the expense of neither decentralization nor security. Its systematic strategy can’t compete with Solana’s high-octane speed, but it will appeal to investors looking for the long haul who desire solidity and substance in their crypto investment strategy. While the market is hunting for the most appropriate crypto to play the 2025 bull run, ADA’s foundation may prove stronger, especially with new entrant altcoins like Mutuum Finance joining the competition. Mutuum Finance Presale Gets Momentum Mutuum Finance Phase 4 presale investor support remains steadily on the rise, driven by belief in its long-term-oriented sustainable DeFi model that prioritizes long-term utility over short-term meme coin hype. With a solid development foundation, Mutuum Finance is shaping up to be a serious DeFi project. So far, the presale has generated more than $8.7 million from more than 11,000 investors, an initial indicator that this could be one of the crypto projects to keep an eye on. Phase 4 tokens are currently available at a cost of $0.025 and thus are an especially enticing offer for early birds. With a planned listing price of $0.06, phase 4 investors stand to gain a prospective 140% return. Community-Driven Features and Investor Incentives Mutuum Finance has introduced an investor dashboard with real-time top 50 token holder leaderboard. Long-term holders keep their position and earn bonus MUTM tokens, incentivizing long-term holding behavior and elongating community engagement. Aside from promoting user interaction, the platform is currently running a $100,000 giveaway where ten lucky contestants will receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. The platform also has a referral scheme that incentivizes users for promoting grassroots, organic growth. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with a Two-Model Solution Mutuum Finance stands out with its groundbreaking two-model solution that integrates Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems to provide optimum flexibility and control. P2C Lending: Users provide liquidity as stablecoins locked into lending pools through smart contract-based pools. Interest rates dynamically vary based on market demand, offering stable interest rates for lenders and equalized borrowing terms. P2P Lending: The system removes middlemen, and users can directly lend and borrow. It enhances privacy, user control, and autonomy over lending contracts. Cardano (ADA) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are quickly becoming popular Solana challengers with enormous potential for pennies on the dollar. With over $8.7 million raised and 90% of Phase 4 sold, MUTM is building major momentum at $0.025. Early investors will be rewarded with as much as 140% returns at listing, with estimates reaching $2.50 in the listings. With a unique dual lending model and strong community rewards backing it, Mutuum is one of the best DeFi plays in 2025.

Once seen as a rocket fueled by internet hype and retail dreams, Bitcoin ( BTC ) may be settling into a slower, more mature phase as large investors step in, analyst Willy Woo says. In a recent post on X, Woo questioned the idea of Bitcoin’s limitless growth, saying “people think BTC is like a magical unicorn that climbs to infinity on moonbeams.” He pointed to a chart showing that the triple-digit annual gains seen in 2017 have since faded, suggesting those days may be behind us. People think BTC is like a magical unicorn that climbs to infinity on moonbeams. Here's the actual CAGR chart. We are well past the 2017 year where we'd see many 100s of percent growth.

Data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows that private and public companies, ETFs, and governments collectively hold nearly 3 million BTC as of May. After accounting for an estimated 3.5 million lost coins, this represents about 18.75% of Bitcoin’s effective circulating supply.

Despite the slowing growth, Woo remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, encouraging investors to “enjoy the ride” for the next 15 to 20 years, noting that few publicly investable assets can match Bitcoin’s performance over the long term, even as its compound annual growth rate gradually declines.

In a May 18 statement , AFP-led Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce said that more than $4.5 million worth of assets—including a waterfront mansion in Queensland, a luxury vehicle, and nearly 25 Bitcoin ( BTC )—have been forfeited to the Commonwealth, following an investigation into the suspected proceeds of a major international crypto theft dating back to 2013. The forfeiture was ordered by the District Court of Queensland back in April this year, culminating a years-long probe into stolen digital assets and cybercrime involving a Queensland man previously convicted of hacking a U.S.-based gaming company. The man, whose identity has not been publicly disclosed in this announcement, was also linked to the theft of 950 BTC from a French crypto exchange in 2013. While no criminal charges were filed in this specific case, Australian authorities used the Proceeds of Crime Act to pursue the assets under civil forfeiture laws, which do not require a criminal conviction. The investigation, known as Operation Gouldian, began in September 2018 after AUSTRAC—the Australian financial intelligence agency—received information from law enforcement in Luxembourg about suspicious BTC transactions. This triggered a deeper probe into the individual’s financial activity, which ultimately revealed a massive gap between the man’s apparent wealth and any identifiable legitimate income. By July 2023, the CACT had secured restraining orders over several assets believed to be funded through criminal means, including a 2019 black Mercedes Benz sedan, a waterfront property in Beachmere, and 24.99454224 BTC. Federal agents later executed search warrants at the Beachmere property, strengthening the case for forfeiture.

From there, they may be allocated by the Attorney-General to support crime prevention initiatives, law enforcement programs, and efforts targeting the illicit drug trade and related social harms. The Queensland forfeiture adds to a growing list of recent cases where proceeds from crypto thefts were used to fund lavish lifestyles. For example, last week, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted 12 more individuals in a $263 million crypto fraud case, revealing that the illicit gains were spent on luxury vehicles, jewelry, and designer goods.

Currently priced at $0.025 during its presale, analysts and early participants alike are beginning to point toward a realistic path to $1—and possibly sooner than originally anticipated. So what makes this new crypto coin stand out in a crowded market? It comes down to a blend of strong fundamentals, live development progress, and a revenue-based model that scales with user activity. As the presale nears completion, more investors are recognizing that MUTM’s path to $1 may be a matter of timing—not just speculation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) One of the core reasons MUTM is gaining attention is that its value isn’t being driven by marketing alone—it’s embedded in the platform’s mechanics. Mutuum Finance is building a non-custodial, decentralized protocol for lending and borrowing—a structure that appeals to long-term investors seeking the best cryptocurrency to invest in with actual function. In the system, users supply digital assets and are issued mtTokens in exchange. These mtTokens represent a share in the protocol’s liquidity pools and increase in value over time, fueled by interest paid by borrowers. That interest doesn’t disappear into the protocol treasury—it’s used to buy MUTM tokens on the open market, which are then redistributed to users. This creates consistent demand for the token, meaning as more users borrow and lend, the system naturally increases pressure on the token’s market value. Unlike many crypto coins that rely on speculative trading volume, MUTM is designed to reward actual use. The platform’s buy-and-redistribute model ties token demand directly to its core financial functions. When borrowers interact with the system, it triggers a chain of activity that leads to real token purchases—benefiting those who entered early. This design helps insulate MUTM from the volatility that plagues hype-driven projects, while also giving long-term holders a growing share of value as protocol activity scales. It’s more than simply holding a token—it’s about having a stake in an active, functioning financial protocol. A short timeline to real functionality Timing plays a major role in how fast MUTM can reach higher valuations—and here, Mutuum stands out. The team has announced that a beta version of the platform will launch alongside the token’s listing, giving users instant access to borrowing and lending services from day one. This is a critical factor. Many tokens enter the market with little more than a roadmap and promises. MUTM will enter with live features, making it far more attractive to early adopters and helping establish user volume immediately. More usage means more interest payments. More interest payments mean more token buybacks. And that leads to a faster upward trend in price. This mechanism supports long-term growth and positions MUTM as a top cryptocurrency quietly gaining momentum. Currently, Mutuum’s presale is in Phase 4, with more than 87% of the round already sold. The token is priced at $0.025, but once this phase ends, the price will move to $0.03, with the public launch price set at $0.06. The combination of rising demand and increasing visibility makes this one of the most promising crypto to buy now opportunities for those looking to position early. Interest is accelerating, and entry at this stage could prove strategic. In addition to its core lending and borrowing features, the protocol is preparing for developments that will further reinforce token value. These include Layer 2 integration to improve transaction efficiency, a stablecoin backed by on-chain collateral, and broader connections within the DeFi space. Each utility strengthens the ecosystem, deepens token use, and makes the jump to $1 a logical outcome of usage. These enhancements support the growing belief that MUTM is one of the most undervalued crypto projects in the current presale market. Many tokens flash briefly in the market, driven by trends that fade just as quickly. Mutuum Finance is moving differently—with a structure that rewards real use, a presale that’s quickly filling, and a launch backed by working features and protocol incentives. At just $0.025, the upside is hard to ignore. And with platform demand, utility, and participation all baked into the token’s mechanics, reaching $1 may not be a question of if—but how soon. For those looking for which crypto to invest in for both short-term growth and long-term fundamentals, MUTM stands out as a top contender.

According to Canadian-American venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, regulations have reduced the “competitiveness of smaller institutions” and pushed them to the brink. Through a Monday X post, Palihapitiya accused regulators of making the US a hostile environment for innovation and growth. “ The number of public companies in the US peaked around 8,000 and has since shrunk to approximately 6,000. Meanwhile, the amount of regulation and regulatory agencies have exploded ,” he wrote . He also noted the collapse in the number of banks, which once stood at 28,000, now down to just 4,500, and added that increasing oversight favors large, consolidated institutions over entrepreneurs and small businesses. “ We need a regulatory reset, ” the Social Capital founder concluded. FDIC report shows decline in US bank numbers In an April report, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) Acting Chairman Travis Hill talked about the contraction in the US banking sector. Since 2008, the number of bank charters has declined from roughly 8,500 to 4,500. Yet, Hill reiterated that mergers are not the cause for the dwindling figures. “ Statistically, the decline in banks since the start of the Great Financial Crisis is less a product of increased merger activity and much more a product of the steep decline in new bank formation ,” he explained. According to Hill’s report, the average rate of intercompany mergers since 1980 is between 1% and 4% annually, with a long-term average of 2.5%. The decline has moderated in recent years, with charter closings averaging 3.4% per year since 2018, compared to 4.2% over the longer horizon. Regulatory burden leaves entrepreneurs conflicted Several entrepreneurs share the sentiment that regulations have spiraled out of control. Arthur Macwaters, co-founder of mental health startup Legion Health, shared a chart from the Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University, showing a continual rise in the total number of pages published in the Code of Federal Regulations since the 1950s. Regulations keep climbing, and have reached an all-time high. Fundamentally, there's no incentive for politicians to delete regulations, so they just keep piling up. This not only destroys productivity, but in a fundamental and sinister way changes the way people think about… pic.twitter.com/td3MrF04hb — Arthur (@ArthurMacwaters) May 18, 2025 Starting at under 20,000 pages, the volume of federal regulations grew particularly during the 1970s under Presidents Nixon and Carter, crossing 100,000 pages by the early 1980s. It saw a brief leveling off during Ronald Reagan’s presidency in the mid-1980s, against the backdrop of his administration’s deregulation agenda, but the overall trend resumed upward shortly after. Other dips in the regulatory code’s page count occurred in the early 2000s under President George W. Bush, whose tenure had a little taste of “regulatory restraint.” The period was followed by an expansion during the post-2008 Barack Obama’s administration, when new rules tied to the Affordable Care Act and Dodd-Frank Act were implemented. By 2022, the Code surpassed 180,000 pages. Capital requirement cuts could help reduce regulators ‘weight’ Last week, reports emerged that US authorities could relax bank capital rules that have been present for more than a decade. According to a Cryptopolitan report published Thursday, regulators are poised to announce a cut to the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), a post-2008 regulation that requires banks to hold high-quality capital against risky assets such as loans and derivatives. Sources familiar with the matter claimed the changes are expected this summer. The effort follows sustained lobbying from major banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, which argue that strict capital requirements have restricted their ability to lend and compete effectively. The SLR was introduced after the 2008 global recession , designed to make sure banks could withstand financial shocks without requiring taxpayer-funded bailouts, like those seen during the crisis.

That’s exactly what happened with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) over the past two days, as $500,000 poured into its presale in just 48 hours. Investors are moving fast, and the reason behind this wave of buying goes beyond surface-level excitement. This isn’t a random pump. It’s a reaction to clear, strategic signals from the project—especially around timing, utility, and near-term price movement. So, what’s pushing this level of urgency, and why is MUTM now being considered one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) At the core of the current inflow is the structure of Mutuum Finance’s presale. MUTM remains available at a price of $0.025, though this low-cost entry point is quickly approaching its end. The project is now in Phase 4 of its presale, and over 87% of the allocation has already been sold. At the end of this phase, the token price is set to rise to $0.03, representing a 20% increase over the current price of $0.025. That single detail is what’s driving urgency. Early buyers recognize this window is closing, and the math is simple: entering at $0.025 and seeing the token launch at a confirmed price of $0.06 already sets them up with strong positioning. And if the project gains momentum after launch, the upside could stretch far beyond that. Why the Big Inflows Now? Timing matters in crypto, and smart capital tends to move before the headlines hit. The recent $500K inflow it’s about getting in before the price climbs. Mutuum’s team has confirmed that a beta version of the platform will launch alongside the token itself, rather than being delayed until months later. This ensures MUTM will launch with live borrowing and lending features, giving users immediate access to the platform’s core functions from day one. Investors understand that real utility creates token demand. And that demand starts the moment the protocol opens to the public. Mutuum Finance isn’t just another presale token—it’s an actively evolving decentralized finance protocol with real-world functionality at its core. Users will be able to deposit supported crypto assets and earn passive returns. When borrowers use the system, the interest they pay is partially used to purchase MUTM tokens from the open market, which are then redistributed to liquidity providers. This buy-and-redistribute model creates a feedback loop: more users means more borrowing, which increases buy pressure on the token, benefiting early participants. Thanks to this structure, a growing number of investors view Mutuum as the next big crypto poised for a major breakout. The presale performance speaks volumes. Nearly 10,000 holders have already joined, and the pace is accelerating. Inflows like the recent $500K are a signal that larger investors are also beginning to recognize the opportunity. With the next price jump on the horizon, interest in the token is rapidly accelerating. And unlike meme coins or trend-based tokens, MUTM’s appeal comes from mechanics that reward usage, not just exposure. Mutuum Finance has introduced a $100,000 giveaway to incentivize early contributors during its ongoing presale phase. Participants who secure MUTM tokens before the current phase closes can enter for a chance to win a share of the prize pool. With Phase 4 nearing completion and a price increase on the horizon, MUTM stands out as one of the most compelling entry opportunities available right now. For those asking which crypto to buy now with both near-term upside and long-term use, Mutuum Finance is earning its place at the top of that list.

With the right conditions forming, a projected 39x move is no longer being viewed as a stretch, but as a realistic target supported by structure, demand, and product readiness. While many traders are looking for the next big crypto, those paying attention are seeing a pattern forming. XRP climbed 4x in just a few months, and with investors now watching MUTM closely, the question is whether it’s about to follow—and perhaps even outperform. XRP’s surge sets a familiar tone Over the past few months, XRP rose from under $0.70 to above $2.60, delivering nearly 4x gains for those who positioned early. This momentum was driven by a mix of favorable legal developments, market optimism, and growing speculation over institutional adoption and future ETF listings. By mid-May 2025, XRP was valued around $2.65, showing a 20% gain over the previous month. This recent movement has drawn renewed attention from traders and analysts, with the asset continuing to hold a strong position among high-volume cryptocurrencies. But while XRP has already made its move, early investors are now scouting which crypto to invest in next. An increasing share of investors is now focusing on Mutuum Finance. Why investors are rushing into MUTM Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still accessible at $0.025, but this pricing level is quickly nearing its end. The project is in Phase 4 of its presale, with over 87% of the current round sold, nearly 10,000 holders, and more than $8.6 million raised so far. After Phase 4 concludes, the token price is set to increase by 20% to $0.03, with the launch price already established at $0.06. From today’s level, that represents a 140% jump to listing—and a projected 39x surge when the token reaches $1, a milestone many investors see as reachable based on platform design. Adding to the urgency, more than $500,000 in inflows entered the presale within the last 48 hours, a clear signal that interest is growing fast. What sets Mutuum Finance apart from other new crypto coins is its utility-first approach. Rather than relying on speculative momentum, it’s building a platform that solves real problems in the DeFi space. Mutuum is a decentralized platform designed to support crypto lending and borrowing through two distinct approaches: Peer-to-Contract, where users can supply liquidity to shared pools and earn yield passively. Peer-to-Peer, where users directly negotiate loan terms with others for more control and flexibility. Borrowers retain ownership of their assets and provide overcollateralized deposits, making the system more secure and attractive to experienced DeFi users. In addition, the team is actively developing a decentralized stablecoin, which will be fully backed by on-chain collateral from the lending protocol itself—another layer of utility that strengthens long-term sustainability. Strong interest from XRP investors What’s more interesting is that some investors who profited from XRP’s recent rally are now joining MUTM’s presale. On-chain activity shows growing wallet overlap, and several high-volume participants have already made allocations ahead of the price jump. This trend reflects growing confidence in MUTM’s real yield mechanics, token redistribution model, and overall architecture. Unlike many hype-based projects, MUTM ties token demand directly to platform usage, creating built-in buy pressure as activity scales. With Phase 4 selling out fast and the next price increase locked in, MUTM is becoming one of the best crypto coins to buy now for those looking to enter ahead of exchange listings. The structure is in place, utilities are being developed, and the project has confirmed that a beta version of the platform will launch alongside the token, not months later. This combination of early pricing, product readiness, and steady inflows is why many believe MUTM could follow XRP’s path—and even go beyond it. The window at $0.025 is closing quickly. For investors searching for the top cryptocurrency to invest in before the next wave hits, Mutuum Finance is already drawing serious attention.

President Trump’s administration is preparing to announce a reduction in the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) for US banks’ capital reserves, the Financial Times (FT) reports , citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Regulators originally implemented the current SLR rules as part of Basel III in 2014, aiming to prevent a repeat of the 2008-2009 Global Financial Crisis. But some have argued that the regulations hold back the market and the financial industry. Says Greg Baer, head of the Bank Policy Institute lobby group, “Penalizing banks for holding low-risk assets like Treasuries undermines their ability to support market liquidity during times of stress when it is most needed… Regulators should act now rather than waiting for the next event.” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also said earlier this year that he believed dialing back the SLR would “strongly” help support the US Treasury market. “We need to work on Treasury market structure, and part of that answer can be, and I think will be, reducing the calibration of the supplemental leverage ratio.” But others don’t share the same sentiment. Nicolas Véron, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, tells the FT that given the current risks for US banks and the role of the dollar and the direction of the economy, now is not the right time to relax capital standards. Under Basel III, systemically important banks (SIBs) in the United States are required to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 5% or more at the holding company level and 6% at the insured depository institution level. Meanwhile, many other developed countries adhere to the Basel III minimum SLR of 3%, though some jurisdictions have proposed or implemented slightly higher standards ranging from 3.5% to 4.25% FT’s sources did not specify what precise SLR percentage regulators are aiming for, but lobbyists say they would like to bring America’s requirements more in line with international standards.

On May 19, the Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported that the decision arose within a criminal case involving federal police officer William Wheatley, who allegedly stole 81.6 Bitcoin ( BTC ) in 2019. At the time, the assets were worth roughly $492,000. At current market prices, the tokens are valued at more than $13 million. In the case, Judge Michael O’Connell of Victoria ruled that Bitcoin qualifies as a form of money rather than property, likening the digital asset to Australian dollars rather than to shares, gold or foreign currency. The interpretation could set a legal precedent, potentially placing Bitcoin transactions outside the scope of Australia’s current CGT regime. New court ruling challenges Australian crypto tax laws In an AFR interview, tax lawyer Adrian Cartland said the verdict “totally upends” the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO) current position. Since 2014, the ATO has classified crypto assets as CGT assets. This means that users must pay tax when selling or trading them. Under the ATO’s guidance, any disposal of Bitcoin, including selling it for fiat, exchanging it for another crypto or using it to purchase goods or services, constitutes a CGT event. This framework has been the basis for taxing cryptocurrency transactions in Australia for over a decade. However, the recent ruling challenges the approach by suggesting that Bitcoin functions more like money than property. This potentially exempts it from CGT. Related: Australian feds seize mansion, Bitcoin allegedly linked to crypto exchange hack Tax refunds could reach $640 million Cartland said it was held that Bitcoin is Australian money. “That is, it is not a CGT asset. Therefore, acquisitions and disposals of Bitcoin have no tax consequences,” the tax lawyer added. If the ruling is upheld on the appeal, Cartland estimates that there could be potential tax refunds totalling 1 billion Australian dollars ($640 million). However, while Cartland thinks there could be up to a billion in refunds, the ATO said there were no official figures that confirm the amount to be potentially refunded if the case changes how Bitcoin is taxed in Australia.

That token is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , and according to growing expert consensus, this new crypto coin is one of the few early-stage assets with the mechanics, timing, and structure to support such a breakout. At its current presale price, a move to $5 would represent a 19,900% increase—an almost unheard-of jump in today’s increasingly competitive crypto space. Yet unlike hype-driven projects with shaky foundations, Mutuum Finance is earning these forecasts based on fundamentals. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Analysts projecting a $5 valuation aren’t throwing darts—they’re looking at a protocol with built-in token demand, real development milestones, and one of the strongest early-stage entries available now. According to multiple forecasts, $5 could be reached in 2026, assuming continued platform rollout, listing momentum, and broader adoption of its utilities. With a launch price set at $0.06, hitting the $5 mark would represent an 8,233% gain just from the listing level—but for those entering at $0.025 during the current presale, the upside is even greater. As attention shifts from quick flips to real utility, investors are increasingly asking what crypto to invest in for long-term growth—and MUTM keeps coming up. Unlike many tokens that enter the market with no real use case, Mutuum Finance will launch with functional utilities. The team has announced that a beta version of the platform will be launched simultaneously with the token’s official listing. This alone gives it an edge, providing users immediate access to core features—while many other tokens remain inactive for months post-launch. The smart design of the protocol encourages holding rather than flipping. When users borrow assets on the platform, a portion of the interest they pay is used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market, which are then redistributed to liquidity providers. That means those who hold and participate early benefit from real, on-chain yield—not inflation-based incentives. It’s this real demand model that gives experts confidence in MUTM’s future performance. For anyone wondering which cryptocurrency to invest in now, tokens with baked-in buy pressure and growing adoption are exactly what institutional players tend to prioritize. Utilities that justify the forecast MUTM’s value isn’t theoretical—it’s based on the DeFi services it plans to deliver: Lending and Borrowing: Users will be able to supply or borrow supported crypto assets through the platform. P2C and P2P Models: The protocol supports both Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer options, offering passive income for hands-off investors and more control for those who prefer custom lending agreements. mtTokens: These interest-bearing tokens are issued to users who deposit funds, automatically growing in redeemable value as interest accumulates over time. Stablecoin Development: The team is also working on a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin—a critical piece for expanding platform utility and building price stability. Each of these features contributes to deeper user engagement, more borrowing activity, and increased token usage—all of which support the long-term price outlook. Mutuum Finance is currently in the fourth stage of its presale, with the token still offered at a price of $0.025. More than 87% of the current allocation has already been claimed, highlighting strong participation. The project has attracted nearly 10,000 holders and generated over $8.6 million in contributions so far. Once this phase wraps up, the token price will climb to $0.03, with the launch value officially set at $0.06 for public markets. In just the past 48 hours, over $500,000 in new contributions have flowed in—another clear indicator that investors are treating this presale as a legitimate opportunity, not just a speculative bet. MUTM is far more than just the cheapest cryptocurrency on the radar—it’s one of the few early-stage tokens with a well-defined product, rising market attention, and a structure built for long-term success. While meme tokens spike and fade, this protocol is delivering function, not fluff. With the token priced at $0.025, there’s still time to enter early—though that opportunity is quickly running out. With Phase 4 nearing completion and a 20% price increase coming in the next round, the window to secure MUTM before it gains full exposure is narrowing fast. For those searching for the best crypto to buy now, Mutuum Finance offers a rare combination of early pricing, platform utility, and long-term upside—and that’s exactly why some experts believe it’s heading toward $5.

Source: CoinStats Algorand held its token sale in June 2019 at $2.40 each. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to CoinMarketCap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from its ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.64 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. So, in 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.30 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 below the $0.40 mark in January, $0.35 in February, $0.21 in March, and $0.20 in May.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-19 11:50:00

According to CoinGecko , the global cryptocurrency market cap has dropped by 3.7% to $3.37 trillion at press time. This surprising divergence comes amid a sharp rejection in Bitcoin’s price, which fell from a new multi-month high above $107,000 to around $103,000 within hours. Altcoins followed suit, with Ethereum losing over 4% in a single day, currently hovering around $2,400. Why is the price of Virtuals Protocol’s VIRTUAL rising? The price of Virtuals Protocol’s native token, VIRTUAL, has been displaying volatility but remains among the market’s strongest performers over the past month. At the time of writing, VIRTUAL traded at $1.81, having experienced a modest gain of 2% in the past 24 hours, while posting an impressive 13.7% gain over the past week and over 212% in the last 30 days. One key factor contributing to VIRTUAL’s resilience is strong investor engagement, driven by consistent platform growth and ecosystem developments. Notably, the integration of Arbus, a new AI-powered market intelligence layer, appears to have sparked interest. Arbus is now live on the Virtuals Protocol, offering tools for DeFi agents, data analysis, and dApp development. Virtuals Protocol @virtuals_io · Follow Better discovery.

However, technical analysis suggests caution. A potential triple top pattern is forming, indicating bearish momentum may be building. Virtuals Protocol price chart | Source: TradingView After repeated failed breakouts above the $2.08 resistance level, VIRTUAL could soon retest its neckline around $1.66. If support fails, the next potential downside target lies near $1.23. Despite these risks, strong historical price performance and consistent trading activity support the token’s current standing among top altcoin movers. Why is the price of KAITO rising? KAITO, the native token of the Kaito AI ecosystem, is gaining significant traction amid a broader market sell-off. Trading at $1.90 with an 8.6% daily increase, KAITO has shown sustained momentum in recent weeks. It has climbed from a monthly low of $0.6747 in mid-April to a recent peak of $2.11, before settling into its current range. While it remains 34% below the February 2025 all-time high (ATH) of $2.92 according to CoinMarketCap, KAITO’s current bullish momentum points to a possible surge above the ATH soon. One of the primary drivers of KAITO’s surge is the platform’s growing influence within the Web3 social and AI-powered content economy. Kaito’s innovative approach, which combines AI content generation with decentralised incentives, has attracted a large user base. The Kaito Yapper leaderboard, which rewards users for quality engagement and content sharing, is fueling demand. This week alone, over $5,000 in USDS is being distributed to the top 20 participants, with additional incentives for regional contributors. Additionally, the platform is now integrated with high-profile campaigns such as Novastro’s token rewards and OpenLedger’s content initiatives. These collaborative efforts are creating a strong flywheel effect for user acquisition, while the KAITO token remains central to reward distribution. Furthermore, users are publicly reporting large earnings from Kaito-related campaigns and airdrops, adding to the hype and drawing in new speculators. Kaito’s strong community engagement, coupled with its airdrop success stories, is helping maintain its upward trajectory even as most of the crypto market struggles to recover. Other altcoins to watch as Ethereum and Bitcoin bleed While the broader crypto landscape faces downward pressure, a few other altcoins are also managing to defy the trend and post strong gains. Among them is Collaterize (COLLAT), which has soared by over 73% in the past 24 hours, trading around $0.0504. Its market cap now exceeds $50 million, and its 7-day performance is up more than 130%, making it the top gainer of the day. Another strong performer is Keeta (KTA), which has risen nearly 25%, followed by Acet (ACT) and SX Network (SX), both registering double-digit gains. These assets are drawing liquidity in a market that appears to be favouring highly speculative, low-cap projects during this correction phase. Interestingly, the rise of these altcoins coincides with increased Bitcoin dominance, which has climbed back above 61%. This suggests that while larger-cap altcoins like Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are under pressure, traders are rotating into smaller-cap assets that offer quicker potential returns. The current market dynamic reveals a split strategy among investors, cautious on majors but aggressively opportunistic with emerging altcoins. This bifurcation could persist, especially if Bitcoin remains range-bound and fails to reclaim new highs.

Hold These 4 Tokens Loved by High-Net-Worth Investors,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/want-to-beat-the-market-in-2025-hold-these-4-tokens-loved-by-high-net-worth-investors,"The crypto market is heating up with opportunities for investors aiming to outperform benchmarks in 2025. Among thousands of tokens, four stand out for their unique value propositions and institutional backing: Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), XRP, and Rexas Finance (RXS). While DOGE, PEPE, and XRP show potential, Rexas Finance is emerging as the dark horse, combining blockchain innovation with real-world asset tokenization. With its presale already raising over $48.4 million and a confirmed listing price of $0.25, RXS is drawing attention from high-net-worth investors. One Ethereum wallet recently purchased $200,000 worth of RXS , signaling strong confidence in its growth. As the final presale stage nears completion, RXS is positioning itself to bridge trillion-dollar markets like real estate and commodities with blockchain efficiency. XRP Eyes Historic Rally Amid Market Momentum XRP is capturing headlines as analysts predict a surge to $27, mirroring its 2017 bull run. EGRAG CRYPTO highlights a repeating Elliott Wave pattern, suggesting the token is nearing the end of Wave 3. Holding above $2.10 could trigger a parabolic move, with long-term targets reaching $120. Institutional inflows of $214 million year-to-date further bolster this outlook. However, XRP’s reliance on broader market trends and regulatory clarity leaves its trajectory partly speculative. While promising, it lacks the tangible utility driving Rexas Finance’s adoption. PEPE Targets a Zero Elimination Amid Meme Coin Surge PEPE has rallied 12% daily, trading at $0.00000920, as Bitcoin’s climb past $90,000 fuels meme coin momentum. Analysts note a critical resistance level at $0.00000921—breaking this could push PEPE to $0.00001. Despite bullish technicals, PEPE remains vulnerable to market volatility. Its success hinges on sustained Bitcoin and Ethereum strength, unlike Rexas Finance, which thrives independently through asset tokenization. DOGE’s Technicals Signal a Run Toward $0.90 Dogecoin has rebounded above its 50-day moving average, a bullish signal last seen in January. Analyst TradingShot projects a conservative $0.90 target using Fibonacci extensions. However, whale activity and meme coin unpredictability cloud its reliability. DOGE’s lack of real-world use cases contrasts sharply with RXS, which offers fractional ownership of assets like real estate and gold—a $16 trillion market by 2030. Rexas Finance (RXS): Bridging Real-World Assets and Blockchain Rexas Finance is tokenizing physical assets, enabling global investors to own fractions of real estate, gold, or art with a single click. Imagine a retail investor in Nigeria owning 5% of a Parisian apartment, earning passive rental income through blockchain automation. This system democratizes access to markets previously reserved for the wealthy. By converting illiquid assets into tradeable tokens, RXS unlocks liquidity and transparency, positioning itself at the forefront of a financial revolution. The Rexas Token Builder allows anyone to mint asset-backed tokens without coding expertise. Coupled with the Quickmint Bot and AI Shield, the platform ensures secure, efficient tokenization. For instance, a gold mine owner in Australia can tokenize reserves, attracting global investors via the Rexas Launchpad. This toolset simplifies fundraising, bypassing traditional intermediaries and reducing costs. Fueling Growth Through Community Support Rejecting venture capital, Rexas Finance prioritized public presale access, selling 92.4% of its 500 million tokens across 12 stages. Early buyers have seen values rise 6.6x from $0.03 to $0.20, with a $0.25 listing confirmed for 2025. The ongoing $1 million giveaway—offering 20 winners $50,000 each—amplifies engagement. Listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko enhance visibility, while a CertiK audit underscores security. With plans to launch on three top-tier exchanges, RXS is poised for exponential growth post-listing. Positioning for 2025 Market Success High-net-worth investors are diversifying into DOGE, PEPE, XRP, and RXS, but Rexas Finance stands apart. Its real-world utility, $48.4 million presale traction, and institutional-grade infrastructure make it a cornerstone for 2025 portfolios. As traditional markets embrace tokenization, RXS’s $10+ target—a 50x leap—reflects its potential to dominate this fusion of finance and blockchain. For those seeking more than speculative gains, Rexas Finance offers a tangible stake in the future of global asset ownership.

Levi shared his excitement on X, as he and the broader XRP community anticipate the launch of spot XRP ETFs. However, while Levi misidentified the ETF products, a recent Coindesk report shared more information, revealing that Volatility Shares has filed for a spot XRP ETF, a 2x leveraged XRP ETF, and a -1x inverse XRP ETF. More XRP ETF Applications Join the Race The registration indicates Volatility Shares’ intent to offer multiple forms of exposure to XRP, including direct tracking, enhanced upside, and short positioning. The spot ETF would directly follow the price of XRP, the 2x leveraged product aims to deliver twice the daily performance of XRP, and the inverse ETF would provide the opposite of XRP’s daily returns. These filings are part of a broader push by Volatility Shares to introduce cryptocurrency-based ETFs to the market. The company was previously the first to launch a 2x Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. and is now extending its lineup to include XRP. Teucrium, a known ETF issuer, recently gained approval for its 2x XRP ETF in the U.S. and has since disclosed that the product achieved the most successful ETF launch in the company’s history. This shows the significant demand and trading volume potential for XRP-related products. Volatility Shares’ products are intended to be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, according to regulatory documents filed under Form 8-A12B on May 16, 2025. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Mounting Pressure for Regulatory Approval Volatility Shares is among several firms seeking approval to offer XRP ETFs in the United States. Other applicants include Grayscale, Bitwise, WisdomTree, 21Shares, CoinShares, Canary Capital, and more than 70 other ETF applications are pending . While the U.S. market is waiting for the SEC, crypto markets worldwide are progressing. Brazil’s securities regulator has approved the world’s first spot XRP ETF . This development is mounting more pressure on U.S. regulators to authorize similar products domestically. What’s Next for XRP ETFs The market conditions surrounding XRP ETFs have evolved notably in 2025. The combination of international approvals and successful domestic launches provides a favorable backdrop for further expansion. Regulatory clarity around XRP has also improved following the settlement agreement between Ripple and the SEC. While both parties have faced a recent setback, experts believe the official resolution of the lawsuit will come soon , cementing XRP’s legal clarity and opening the door for institutional investment through ETFs and other products.

The crypto market typically experiences a bump in volatility at this time on Sunday as it coincides with the opening of the CME futures market, which takes a few moments to recalibrate to the lower liquidity 24/7 crypto markets. This weekend was slightly different. Whilst on the surface the price action will go down as a bearish rejection from a key level of resistance, which bitcoin has now failed to break at three attempts. BTC actually spiked first on the CME, indicating that the price action was led by institutional U.S. traders as opposed to retail crypto traders. Over the past few months the CME has often opened lower than it closed on the Friday, creating a ""gap"" on the chart, which did not occur this week. As price whiplashed around this $5,000 range, the move wiped out liquidity on both sides , creating a rather crucial inflection point. Now, market depth all the way up to $110,000 is minimal compared to limit orders lining the book down to $100,000. This means that any upside thrust will likely take this level out and see bitcoin trade at a new record high. However, it's worth considering the other side of the coin. It is also conceivable that the Sunday evening price action was a typical stop-loss hunt, which involves traders targeting a zone where those in short positions would want to exit, thus creating an impulse in buy pressure as short traders scurry to buy back their position. This strategy often takes place alongside entry into a larger short position. For example, if a trader wants to short BTC with a risk tolerance of 4%, it would be advantageous to open that position at $107,000 with a stop loss at $111,280 as opposed at $105,000 with a stop at $109,200. Astute traders can secure that entry by assessing levels of liquidity and squeezing short positions into closing, which temporarily lifts price to an ideal entry. Either way, with liquidity now relatively low around record highs, bitcoin is one news catalyst away from that awaited upside thrust, and these potentially fresh short positions at $107,000 could provide the ammunition to that eventual break out.",Markets|Bitcoin|btc|Liquidity|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-19 11:58:43

The creation of Bitcoin ETFs has significantly boosted retail investor participation, legitimizing the asset class and driving prices higher. Governments, including the US, are now considering Bitcoin strategic reserves, adding a new layer of legitimacy and potential price support. Despite Bitcoin's volatility and correlation with equities, the declining US dollar and risk-on market sentiment support further gains for BTC. Main Thesis and Background The purpose of this article is to evaluate the broader market as a whole, with a particular focus on why I see a continued bull case for Bitcoin (BTC-USD). This is due to weighing the potential pros and cons of putting money cash into this thematic idea after looking across the investment landscape and seeing which rally really has legs. While BTC has indeed come under pressure this year, it has roared back with a vengeance. Of particular note, this cryptocurrency is up over 66% since I last covered it in Q4 2024: BTC's Performance (Seeking Alpha) Of course, it has not been a straight shot upwards (nothing ever is!). As we have seen a share of volatility in 2025, it should be no surprise that BTC has seen its ups and downs along with the market year-to-date: YTD Performance (Google Finance) With this in mind, I believe it makes sense to take a critical look at BTC to see if further gains are actually possible. It has had quite a run, but sharp sell-offs could spook some investors, and it does make sense to be cautious when an asset (any asset) is outperforming. The good news here - for those who are long or planning to be long BTC - is that I see the trend for BTC continuing in the months to come. I think the bull case remains intact and there are tailwinds swirling around that can push the price higher - despite nearing its all-time high as of the time of writing (5/12). I will discuss my outlook and the rationale behind my continued ""buy"" rating for this asset in detail below. Interest in Crypto Keeps Surging One of the key reasons I continue to like BTC here has to do with popularity. While that may sound a little juvenile, the fact is that Bitcoin and crypto more broadly continue to become more heavily adopted by the American and global investment community. This has been largely positive for this sector, and we can see this isn't a small development. The trading volumes for BTC in particular have been rising over time and really spiked after the elections here in the US in November. As we moved into 2025, these volumes have remained elevated and that is an encouraging sign: Crypto Volumes (BTC and Total Market) (Coin Metrics) The net result here is that BTC and crypto are not going anywhere. If anything, it is getting more popular with investors big and small and that is bullish for prices in my view. As allocations rise that usually means prices are heading higher - this is because more people want exposure to an asset with some level of scarcity. The view I have is that this remains an emerging asset class despite how long it has been around. The number of investors with exposure remains small compared to other sectors like stocks, bonds, or other commodities. Further, higher volumes can help reduce volatility as a few big traders cannot necessarily dominate prices the way they can if fewer people own the asset. Simply put, the rising trading volumes help support the legitimacy of the sector and I only see this helping BTC going forward. In a Shift, Governments Now Embracing BTC Perhaps one of the most bullish tailwinds I see out there in the market today with respect to crypto (and specifically BTC) is how governments are beginning to embrace the idea rather than restrict. Once skeptical of losing control over currency markets, both governments and central banks are debating how they can use BTC to their advantage. One of the primary ways has been to consider the establishment of Bitcoin ""strategic reserves"". This allows a government can control and ""own"" a level of Bitcoin in a manner similar to traditional reserves like gold and the USD. While far from a comparison to those assets right now, it is a move that could put BTC on that path in the future. Under a Trump administration, the US now seems to be on its way to making this a firm reality. In March, the White House released a statement calling for the creation of such a reserve, and I would expect other nations will follow in the short term to avoid falling behind: BTC Policy Announcement (White House) Clearly, we have seen a more ""pro-Bitcoin"" regulatory environment in the US. The initiation of a strategic reserve as well as some other appointments within the current administration that are proponents of the idea speaks to the general sense that the US is helping to lead the charge to legitimize this currency as a medium of exchange. If we see the US have some early success or wins in this regard, I would expect other developed nations to follow suit. Of course, I am not a US dollar skeptic nor do I think cryptocurrencies are going to ""replace"" fiat currency. While I see a bull case for Bitcoin continuing, I don't have a complete lack of trust in the currency system like some do who happen to invest in this space! And I would point out that the US dollar remains the far and away favorite for international trade and finance: Percentage Of Currency Use (By Purpose) (Bank for International Settlements) What I am driving at here is I do not want to give the impression that I believe BTC is going to replace traditional currencies around the world. The US dollar remains paramount when it comes to international finance and other currencies - such as the Euro, Yen, British Pound, and Chinese renminbi - are not going anywhere either. I see BTC being a compliment to traditional currencies, not a replacement, and I don't want to lump myself in with the US dollar skeptics out there who dominate many BTC blogs and news articles. That said, I see a world where the US dollar can still remain top dog while BTC can also thrive. That has been happening to date, and I see it continuing in the short term. So I don't see anything insincere about suggesting both have a bright future ahead. The ETF Catalyst Really Delivered My next point is an expansion on a tailwind I talked about in prior reviews. It was the creation and deployment of ETFs on the open market targeting retail investors - giving a plethora of ways to gain exposure to this asset class beyond buying BTC directly. This was central to my prior ""buy"" calls on BTC because I saw this as a two-fold catalyst. One, it would increase the legitimacy of the cryptocurrency sector to see the major names in investment management offering funds to own exposure. Two, it gave easy and relatively cheap ways for retail investors to buy into this idea, fueling a retail rally that would indeed ultimately materialize. Simply, I saw this as a big win for the sector when it was starting to become a reality, and it has indeed been a win. To understand the significance, we can look at volumes again. As these ETFs hit the market, they saw a surge in demand. This has boosted prices across the sector (for BTC and other cryptos) and has also forced those fund managers to increase their holdings of BTC in order to meet redemptions should they occur. The net result has been a massive piling into BTC by said fund managers who offer these ETFs, and the result has been staggering: BTC Holdings in Publicly Traded, Private Companies, ETFs, & Countries (World Bank) The takeaway for me is that retail buying is being facilitated - in part - by the expansion of ETF products available in the market. This has given non-institutional buyers a way to easily compare and shop for the ""right"" fund for them, and offers options beyond going on crypto exchanges to purchase BTC. While I, personally, favor that latter approach, I recognize it isn't the best path for everyone given how emerging and confusing this sector can be. In a nutshell, over the past few years, I saw adoption by fund managers of this idea and approval of ETFs as big catalysts for higher prices for BTC. This hypothesis has been vindicated, and I don't believe the thesis has run its course. I see this as support for me buying BTC in the past has worked out well, and I see it as continued support for remaining a bull today. The Dollar's Decline is Helping Push Commodities Higher Another factor behind BTC's rise has been the decline of the value of the US dollar. This has helped crude oil rebound, pushed gold prices to record levels, and, of course, supported higher prices for BTC: USD Index (Bloomberg News) The logic here is pretty straightforward. As long as there is some weakness in the US dollar, I would expect assets priced in the US dollar - such as BTC - to see some support. This is not a ""sure thing"" by any means, but it does help illustrate how one can tap crypto markets to profit off a falling US dollar. Unless we see the Fed hike interest rates aggressively, which I would not expect this year, then I don't see the US dollar stifling the returns of BTC going forward. Bitcoin is a 'Risk-On' Play, Similar to Tech While I continue to have a favorable view of BTC, we need to remain aware of the risks. One doesn't have to look any further back than April to understand that this is an asset that can be very volatile. The similarity between stocks and BTC is growing increasingly correlated in this regard. While that can be ""good"" when investors are in risk-on mode, the reverse is also true. This is not an asset I would recommend for those who are risk-averse because the drops can be severe when they occur. Expanding on this, I would note that unlike the ETF adoption thesis, one of my other reasons for buying BTC initially has faded out a bit. This was to act as an equity hedge - hoping that BTC would deliver positive returns even when equity markets are dropping. While there was not much of a correlation when BTC first arrived on the scene, that has changed dramatically. Many of the same market and macro-forces that impact large-cap US stocks are not impacting BTC in a similar fashion. The net result is that BTC's use as a diversifier is starting to come into question: Bitcoin vs. Tech Stocks (US) (Morningstar News) The conclusion I draw is that Bitcoin is doing less to round out a portfolio, and there is less and less chance of this being a true ""hedge"" when equity markets get rattled. To me, this has become just another asset to buy if one is wanting a risky play that could pay off. That doesn't make it bad, but it does suggest it may not be for everyone. Bottom Line BTC continues its march higher, and I see more gains ahead. While the last time it breached the 100k level it swiftly pulled back, I think the market's resumption of rewarding risky plays will send this cryptocurrency to a new record. With ETFs continuing to bring in retail dollars, global governments warming up to the prospect of owning BTC directly, and the US dollar seeing a push lower, all of this adds up to me liking BTC here. I am therefore keeping the buy rating for this asset in place and suggest that my followers give the idea some consideration at this time.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-19 12:00:00

This has triggered a wave of liquidations for crypto traders who have been betting on the price to go higher. The decline has also raised concerns as to whether the bullish rally that began at the start of the month is finally over. Dogecoin Price Faces Major Resistance Crypto analyst MindfullyLost has explained what is plaguing the Dogecoin price recently. According to the crypto analyst, the Dogecoin price has seen good support on the 4HR, which has continued to be above $0.21, even through the downtrend. Related Reading: Golden Ratio Multiplier Called Bitcoin Top In 2021 – Here’s What It’s Saying Now Also, when it comes to the hourly chart, there is also support forming for Dogecoin at this level. This comes after a retest of the $0.22 level before the bulls were able to bounce. This shows weakness in this support and could fail with a more dominant move. Presently, there is resistance mounting at $0.23 for the Dogecoin price and the bears are already bearing down on this level. As the crypto analyst shows, a break above this level would be confirmation of the uptrend for the Dogecoin price, making it a buy zone. The next major resistance after this then lies at $0.25 and this is the moment of truth for Dogecoin. Bulls would have to completely test and clear this resistance level. Otherwise, the chances of the price falling back down toward support at $0.21 remain high. What’s Next For DOGE? The Dogecoin price is currently consolidating and according to the crypto analyst, this consolidation could continue for a while. This would translate to sideways price movement for the foreseeable future, as well as a continuation of the battle for dominance between the bears and bulls. Related Reading: Cardano Market Structure Says Crash Is Coming, But $0.9 Is Still In The Cards Bulls would have to start pushing the price higher to actually try to test the first resistance level. Until then, Dogecoin could plunge further into the oversold territory, which would not be entirely bad for the price, making the rebound even stronger. As for how high the Dogecoin price could go if it breaks major resistance levels, some crypto analysts have called for a bounce to at least its previous all-time high at $0.71. While others have speculated that $1 is a natural destination for Dogecoin, and double-digit predictions, such as reaching as high as $10, have also made it to the forefront.

However, open interest has now dropped 5% to $29.47 billion, marking a slowdown from recent weeks as Bitcoin’s price struggled to break key resistance levels. The pullback in inflows follows a month-long run of heightened institutional interest, with investors now appearing more cautious. During the five-day period, Bitcoin remained rangebound, trading between $102,711 and $104,971. This consolidation phase likely contributed to the softer demand for ETF exposure. The lower inflow figure also reflects broader macroeconomic uncertainties, with traders reacting to global rate policies and mixed inflation data across key markets. BTC trades sideways near $103K Bitcoin’s lack of decisive price action has curbed some of the aggressive buying seen in prior weeks. On 19 May, BTC briefly touched $107,108 before correcting and is now trading at approximately $102,969. Source: CoinMarketCap This suggests that despite occasional breakouts, strong overhead resistance is dampening short-term momentum. While ETFs remain a key avenue for institutional crypto exposure, last week’s inflow of $260.27 million highlights tempered enthusiasm compared to previous weekly figures that crossed $900 million. The technical indecision may be prompting investors to wait for a more defined trend before deploying fresh capital. Market observers have also noted a shift in investor focus toward other altcoins and layer-2 projects, which have shown stronger relative strength in recent sessions. Derivatives activity Despite slower ETF inflows, data from the derivatives market points to ongoing bullish sentiment. Futures open interest dropped 5% to $29.47 billion. Options market data also reflects positive bias. On 16 May, demand for call options outweighed puts, indicating that traders are positioning for an upward move. This suggests confidence in a possible short-term rebound above recent resistance, with some investors anticipating a push toward the $110,000 mark. Still, analysts warn that leveraged positions may increase volatility, especially if BTC fails to hold above $100,000 in the coming days. Resistance levels remain key to next move Bitcoin’s near-term direction hinges on its ability to break through resistance around $105,000. A convincing move above this level, supported by volume, could reignite ETF inflows and validate bullish positioning in the derivatives market. Until then, institutional interest may continue to moderate. Even with the recent dip in net ETF flows, the broader 2025 trend reflects growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin. Spot products have made it easier for asset managers to gain exposure without dealing directly with custody or regulatory complexities. As BTC hovers near $102,969, the market awaits a clearer breakout or breakdown. The next move could determine whether this consolidation is merely a pause in a longer uptrend or an early sign of a broader cooldown.

That said, BNB price has also faced a strong pushback from investors as seen in its recent performance metrics. On the flip side, Unilabs is gaining traction for offering early access to high-potential trades in the market before Binance. BNB Price Technical Overview and Short-Term Outlook Binance Coin (BNB) is currently trading at $634.99, with a 1.83% dip over the past 24 hours. Despite the minor correction, BNB price is still resistant and maintains a market cap above $89 billion, which secures its position as one of the top crypto giants. However, the surge in trading volume by 22.39% suggests major investor selling activity, indicating short-term caution. From a technical standpoint, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 56.31 places the BNB price in a neutral zone, signaling that it’s currently not overbought or oversold. This equilibrium implies that there's room for upward momentum if market sentiment shifts. Meanwhile, Binance coin’s MACD level at 14.24 is still bullish, although the current trend hints at potential consolidation. The overall setup suggests that the BNB price is gearing up for its next move, with market participants watching closely for directional cues. In the upcoming sessions, the Binance coin could retest the $660 – $680 resistance range if bullish momentum builds, especially if Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market remain strong. Unilabs’ (UNIL) Diverse Fund Strategy Dominates Binance Coin Unilabs (UNIL) is rapidly emerging as a complete game-changer in the DeFi investment sector, ranking as the world’s first AI-backed DeFi asset manager with over $30.6 million in assets under management (AUM). Contrary to conventional crypto platforms that depend solely on user-driven decisions, Unilabs incorporates AI to evaluate blockchain projects in real-time. This data-driven strategy enables investors to access high-growth opportunities earlier than the broader market. With proprietary tools like the ‘Early Access Scoring System (EASS)’ and the AI Market Pulse, Unilabs is building a complete investment ecosystem where every UNIL holder (from novice to pro) can tap into high-yield crypto innovations with institutional-grade precision. One of the main factors that set Unilabs apart is its automated profit-sharing model built on blockchain technology, allowing users to track exactly how and where their capital is performing. Through the platform’s ‘Launchpad Review’ and AI-Driven Insights, the platform filters noise from quality and thoroughly checks each investment before it’s shared with the community. Binance Coin Long-Term Projections and Development On the alarming other side of things, the BNB price is facing minor setback, with its critical support near $620. A breakdown below this level could push the Binance coin back toward $590. If macro and platform-specific conditions align, mid-term projections place the BNB price between $700 and $750, including further Binance ecosystem growth. In the longer term, the Binance coin is still one of the most utility-driven assets in the crypto market, offering a range of Binance services, including fee discounts, staking, and token launches. With the exchange continuing to expand globally and integrate new features, BNB's value proposition is solid among investors and in the broader market sentiment. Gain Early Access And 10x Transparent Profits With Unilabs (UNIL) In contrast to Binance coin, which mainly serves as a trading venue, Unilabs (UNIL) is a full-scale DeFi wealth-generation ecosystem, offering four specialized AI-powered funds: AI, BTC, RWA, and mining. Each fund caters to different investment appetites and risk profiles, from cutting-edge tech ventures to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and reliable mining revenues. With the AI Fund, for example, investors gain exposure to emerging machine learning dApps before they hit mainstream awareness, positioning portfolios for potential upside. Given its current AUM growth, strong presale performance, and a rapidly expanding product suite, it's plausible that Unilabs could exceed $100 million AUM by 2026, especially as institutional interest in DeFi continues to touch new highs. This investment protocol also introduces innovation at the speculative end of the market through its ‘Memecoin Identification Tool,’ offering calculated exposure to viral, high-risk tokens using AI-analyzed metrics like liquidity and virality. For the retail community, this opens doors to profit from market segments that are often unpredictable and inaccessible through traditional platforms. Conclusion: While the Binance coin is moving toward a developing bearish sentiment in the network, Unilabs (UNIL) is soaring ahead with its rooted AI efficiency to lead the next wave of blockchain passive income.

We know this news may be disappointing for those who were excited about Lumina Fates, and we deeply appreciate the time, passion, and anticipation you invested in its journey.” Tatsu Works You might also like: DappRadar: NFTs mark worst trading year since 2020 Tatsumeeko: Lumina Fates was designed to run on Ethereum and Solana blockchains, integrating NFTs to offer unique digital assets and a new business model for the game.

Here’s what’s driving the hype and the caution. XRP Trend Shifts: Key Weekly EMA & SMA Strategy Analyst EGRAG Crypto’s latest analysis on XRP highlights a trading strategy based on the relationship between the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 33-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the weekly chart. According to EGRAG, these moving averages are key for spotting major trend shifts in the market. If the 21 EMA crosses below the 33 SMA, it signals a bearish trend, and we could be heading into a bear market. Historically, these crosses have led to significant price drops, with XRP falling 87% in May 2018 and 72% in November 2021. The next major drop could be around 79.5% from the bearish cross point. This is a key sell signal as it suggests that the top is in and a steep correction could follow, Egrag explains. Is XRP Entering A Long-Term Uptrend? On the flip side, a 21 EMA crossing above the 33 SMA is seen as a strong bullish signal, often preceding major price rallies. The analyst notes that the past bullish crosses have triggered massive pumps. This could be a sign that the market is entering a long-term uptrend, leading to much higher price levels, like the $5.7, $9.5, $27, and $37 targets mentioned. Double Digits Possible, Say Analysts XRP hitting double digits may sound a bit far-fetched, but history says it’s possible. In 2018, XRP controlled over 31% of the entire crypto market and hit $3.84. Now, in 2025, it’s trading around $3.34 but holds just 5% market share. If XRP reclaims even half of its old market dominance, it could see massive gains. This is especially possible if Bitcoin cools off and altcoins rally later. Will XRP Rally After Futures Launch? CME is launching XRP futures today. Some traders worry that this could lead to a short-term top, as similar futures launches for Bitcoin in 2018 had led to sharp sell-offs later. It had also coincided with the peak of the bull cycle at that time. XRP is currently trading at $2.32, down 2.9% ahead of the launch.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-19 12:09:16

On May 19, VARA in Dubai announced that it has released Version 2.0 of its activity-based Rulebooks, setting a deadline of June 19 for all VASPs to comply with the updated regulations. The revised Rulebooks introduce strengthened requirements across advisory, broker-dealer, custody, exchange, lending and borrowing, asset management, and transfer and settlement services. Key updates in Version 2.0 include enhanced controls on margin trading and token distribution, clearer definitions related to collateral wallet arrangements, and standardized compliance obligations across all licensed activities. A 30-day transition period has been granted to allow affected VASP s time to implement the necessary changes. VARA stated that its Supervision Teams will provide direct support to licensed entities to assist with activity-specific compliance during the transition period. “Our commitment remains to ensuring that innovation and compliance go hand in hand. These rulebook updates reinforce the foundations of a responsible, scalable ecosystem,” said Ruben Bombardi, General Counsel and Head of Regulatory Enablement at VARA.

Alongside the penalties, the firms were ordered to halt their operations and stop promoting virtual asset services.

Accordingly, Coinbase is facing a class action lawsuit in the US state of Illinois over an alleged biometric data breach. Following the conclusion of its lawsuit with the SEC, Coinbase has faced new litigation, with a group of Coinbase users in the state of Illinois filing a class-action lawsuit against the exchange, alleging that the exchange’s identity checks violate the state’s Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). Users allege in the lawsuit that Coinbase required users to verify their identity with a government-issued ID and processed the collection, storage, or sharing of biometric data without written notice or proper consent, thereby violating BIPA. The plaintiffs allege that Coinbase failed to inform users in writing about the collection, storage or sharing of their biometric data and the purpose and retention schedule of their data. The plaintiffs also alleged that Coinbase violated the law by sharing biometric data with third-party verification providers such as Jumio, Onfido, Au10tix, and Solaris without users’ consent. “Coinbase does not publicly provide a retention schedule or guidelines for the permanent destruction of Plaintiffs’ biometric identifiers as specified by BIPA.” Coinbase was also hit with a lawsuit filed by a group of Coinbase users in May 2023 alleging similar BIPA violations, but the case was dismissed by a judge. *This is not investment advice.

Table of Contents Binance Wallet’s dominance What is Binance Alpha? Why did it get criticized? Binance Wallet’s dominance Primitive Ventures founder Dovey Wan emphasized the fact that Binance Wallet became a dominant power in the swap market after the shutdown of OKX Wallet due to its use by North Korean hackers. In her X post, Wan called Binance Wallet a MetaMask killer and brought up an 80% market share evaluation. Nobody on CT is talking about this, but Binance Wallet quietly became the global level MetaMask killer, ate the whole lunch of OKX wallet after its prolonged shutdown. Its market share just rips after launching of the alpha program, turned the wallet into a meme farming engine +… pic.twitter.com/XuBjKlguHy — Dovey ""Rug the fiat"" Wan (hiring) (@DoveyWan) May 14, 2025 Wan said that given Binance Wallet’s functionality, which makes it a “meme farming engine” and has millions of daily users, it is rather a funnel than just a wallet. She noted that CEX wallets serve as an on-ramp for many newcomers, and the centralized Binance Wallet achieved great results while working “against a decentralized ethos.” She elaborated further that the need to undergo a KYC procedure to use Binance Wallet streamlines liquidity towards Binance while unlocking all the Binance-curated services for users. What is Binance Alpha? Binance Alpha is a platform within Binance Wallet. The platform helps to look for fresh cryptocurrency projects that offer airdrops and squeeze their profits out. Through Binance Alpha, users may profit from the tokens not listed on Binance Exchange. Binance Alpha was introduced in December 2024, amidst the nascent memecoin craze. Read more: Binance Wallet unveils Binance Alpha to highlight emerging projects Binance Alpha highlights the early-stage projects that already have notable traction in the Web3 space. The platform allows users to buy tokens instantly at favorable rates during 24-hour windows. After purchasing, the tokens are available on the Alpha account. Binance Alpha Points that Binance users earn for completing some tasks or reaching specific achievements can be exchanged for participation in an airdrop of choice or a token generation event. To ensure that users won’t miss interesting projects, each one is announced beforehand via Binance’s social media accounts, and the countdown clock is attached. According to the Binance announcement , the tokens are picked by the exchange’s experienced team of experts who consider strong community interest and consistent growth. Why did it get criticized? The very fact that Binance Alpha offers its users the opportunity to benefit from already trending projects is problematic for those who helped to make these projects trending–the community behind these early-stage tokens. Critics point out that it allows people who had nothing to do with the project to get more rewards than those who dedicated their time to finding out the project’s weak spots in the testnet period. According to a Web3 enthusiast using a satyaa moniker on X, the problem with Binance Alpha is that this platform violates the decentralization principles, monopolizes the airdrop market, and most importantly, allows “token tourists” to get the most out of airdrops. On May 14, 2025, satyaa shared the first post that read: “Grind testnet for months. Give feedback. Squash bugs. Wait for that sweet airdrop… Binance Alpha: walks in last minute and gets the fat slice of the pie. damn..” The post found relative support from the crypto X, with many people responding to the post with the hashtag #StopBinanceAlpha. On May 15, satyaa shared another post. This time, he tagged Binance-related accounts on X and called his rant “an open letter from a community member and believer of decentralization.” 🟡 Dear @BinanceWallet @binance @_RichardTeng Are You Building Crypto Monopoly or Just Killing Early Communities? This is an open letter from a community member, and believer of decentralization. And I’m not the only one feeling this. Many of us are mad and we need to talk.… https://t.co/BAqCAewqC7 — satyaa (@satyaXBT) May 15, 2025 In the post that gained 7,000 retweets, satyaa likened the actions of Binance to a monopoly and referred to them as “extraction.” Here’s how he described the situation: “Oh, you completed testnet quests before it was cool? Posted threads, memes, brought in new users, ran Discord community nights? Congrats. You get diluted by people who just joined for one Alpha snapshot. This is not crypto. This is a game of pay-to-play, burn-to-earn, and pay-for-allocation. Even worse? The Alpha Points requirement keeps increasing. The fees keep climbing.” He said it is not Web3 and blamed Binance for caring mostly about how to impress venture capitalists. He said that the “real alpha” are the loyal users who help the project when no one else cares: “alpha points don’t build loyalty.” One of the X users responding to this post tried to defend Binance Alpha, saying that it helped them to earn more money than they were trying to earn as a usual community member. However, this standpoint found little support in the comment section, more loyal to the grassroots stance of satyaa. Another user pointed out that the lack of rewards for the community is rather the project’s fault, not Binance’s. The counterpoint to it was the lack of awareness from the side of Binance, which just decided to profit from new projects, whatever it takes. I understand you as a mediator thank you, but this controversy was created by binance itself who, without thinking long and only thought of reaping their own huge profits without thinking about what web3 really is — Retrofit | (Ø,G) Seismic (@Jono38003) May 15, 2025 Some ironically criticize Binance Alpha for encouraging its users to pay for airdrops (with Binance Alpha Points), which are normally free. However, it is far from being the main concern. Lol. So we now basically buy the airdrop with alpha points.. — Greatness (@iamgr8nesss) May 12, 2025 As of press time, Binance hasn’t responded to this debate.

Today, Bitcoin even touched a high near $107,000 —fueling excitement among crypto investors. A key factor in this bullish trend is El Salvador’s bold Bitcoin investment strategy , which has generated impressive returns. Recently, El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele revealed via an X post that the country’s Bitcoin holdings have yielded over $357 million in unrealized profit . Let’s dive deeper into this developing story. El Salvador’s Bitcoin Investment Strategy: Key Facts El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021 , signaling its strong pro-crypto stance. According to El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office, the country currently holds 6,181 BTC , valued around $639 million at current prices. El Salvador’s BTC Holdings: $357 Million Unrealized Profit President Bukele’s recent X post confirmed the unrealized gains from their Bitcoin holdings: “Our BTC holdings have generated over $357 million in unrealized profit.” View Bukele’s post on X With the BTC price around $102K per token, the total value of El Salvador’s holdings stands at roughly $644 million . The country’s initial investment was approximately $287.1 million , meaning their Bitcoin assets have grown by an incredible 124.4% . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Prediction This Week: Will BTC Break Past $106K or Pull Back? , Challenges Facing El Salvador’s BTC Strategy Despite the gains, El Salvador faces hurdles: The country is negotiating a financial package with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) , which requires limiting Bitcoin activities . A law was passed making Bitcoin usage voluntary for the private sector , not mandatory. Many global critics and some Bitcoin supporters have distanced themselves from El Salvador’s approach. However, President Bukele remains firm in his commitment: “If it didn’t stop when the world ostracised us and most ‘bitcoiners’ abandoned us, it won’t stop now, and it won’t stop in the future.” What This Means for Bitcoin’s Future El Salvador’s successful BTC investment highlights growing acceptance and confidence in Bitcoin as an asset and legal tender. Its experience could influence other countries considering similar moves, especially amid Bitcoin’s current bullish momentum. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Announced on May 19, this marks the company’s second-largest Bitcoin buy to date, as the cryptocurrency continues to hover just below its all-time high. With this acquisition, Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at 7,800 BTC, valued at roughly $807 million at current market prices. The purchase follows closely behind its largest single buy of 1,241 BTC on May 12 for $129 million, a transaction that pushed its reserves past those of El Salvador. Metaplanet is now the largest corporate BTC holder in Asia and ranks tenth globally, according to data from BiTBO. The company has demonstrated a strong return on its BTC investment strategy. It posted a Bitcoin yield of 95.6% in the first quarter and has already achieved a 47.8% yield in the second quarter. This yield reflects the percentage growth in BTC holdings per fully diluted share, highlighting Metaplanet’s aggressive and consistent accumulation strategy. Closing in on Galaxy Digital’s Position If Metaplanet adds another 301 BTC to its balance sheet, it will surpass Galaxy Digital Holdings, which currently sits in ninth place among public companies with 8,100 BTC. At the top of the leaderboard remains Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, with a commanding 568,840 BTC—worth around $59 billion—under management. Metaplanet has notably ramped up its Bitcoin purchases in recent months. So far in May alone, the firm has added 2,800 BTC. In April, it made four separate buys totaling 794 BTC, and in March, six purchases brought in a combined 1,655 BTC. Michael Saylor Teases New Bitcoin Buy Meanwhile, Strategy founder Michael Saylor hinted at another upcoming purchase by sharing a screenshot of the firm’s BTC portfolio tracker on social media platform X, accompanied by the cryptic phrase, “Never short a man who buys orange ink by the barrel.” Strategy continues to lead all corporate buyers with 77% of the growth in corporate-held Bitcoin this year, according to investment firm River. River’s May 12 report also revealed that corporations have outpaced all other sectors—including ETFs, governments, and retail investors—as the largest net buyers of Bitcoin in 2025. With institutional momentum building and prices nearing historic highs, Metaplanet’s aggressive strategy may signal broader corporate conviction in BTC’s long-term value.

The price surged and reached the crucial resistance levels, not seen since February but failed to surpass the range, resulting in a notable pullback. Previously, the rejection from the range had dragged the levels towards the lows below $1400. So the question arises whether the ETH price will revive a strong upswing to $3000. Regardless of the long-term price action, the ETH price is poised for a strong upswing in the short term as the 50/200-day MAs have undergone a golden cross. However, in the long term, the price is expected to face some upward pressure as the token has dropped below a crucial resistance zone. Previously, a strong buying volume followed this rejection, which pushed the price to $4000. The ETH price has witnessed its strongest 1-month rise in recent times after the rebound it underwent on April 7, 2025. Meanwhile, the price faced extreme upward pressure last week, which stopped the rally and got rejected exactly at the 50-day weekly MA. This rebound is technically the new bullish leg of the multi-year rising wedge. The 1-week MA 50 turned into a resistance when it last broke on the week of January 27, 2025. Once it breaks and closes above the range, one can expect a strong bullish upswing that happened during late 2024. Therefore, all eyes will now be on the current weekly close, which is now expected to rise above the 200-day weekly MA and surpass the 50-day MA. As the weekly MACD has already turned bullish, the ETH price is believed to revive a strong rise back to the psychological barrier at $4000. However, breaking this barrier is extremely crucial to keep up the bullish trend towards a new ATH.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-19 12:28:22

In a statement on Friday, the agency warned that the country’s fiscal outlook was deteriorating. The US Debt Clock shows the national debt has risen to over $36.8 trillion, up from $21 trillion in 2020. That figure is expected to rise further following a new agreement in the House on the so-called Big, Beautiful Bill.

Historically, markets have reacted negatively to credit rating downgrades of major economies. Stocks and cryptocurrencies declined on August 1, 2023, when Fitch downgraded the U.S. from AAA to AA+. A similar move occurred on August 5–6, 2011, when S&P Global made the same downgrade. Some analysts, however, downplayed the impact of Moody’s decision. In a post on X, Jim Bianco called the downgrade a “nothingburger.” Why the Moody’s downgrade of the US SHOULD BE a nothingburger —- In August 2011, S&P went first and downgraded the US from AAA to AA+. All hell broke loose. The reason hell broke loose was a lot of derivative contract, loan agreements, investment directives and the like… https://t.co/YLq29uKcyZ — Jim Bianco (@biancoresearch) May 16, 2025 In theory, the deteriorating US public finances is a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin, an asset that is slowly becoming a safe-haven asset. In a lengthy white-paper , BlackRock argued that Bitcoin was becoming a good asset to hedge against the soaring US debt and the rising risk of a default. BlackRock noted that Bitcoin was a “scarce, non-sovereign, decentralized asset with a limited supply.” Since that paper’s release, Bitcoin’s fundamentals have improved. Supply on exchanges and in over-the-counter markets has dropped to multi-year lows, while demand via exchange-traded funds has surged. Cumulative inflows into spot Bitcoin funds have surpassed $41 billion. More companies are also adding Bitcoin to their treasuries. Therefore, Bitcoin and crypto prices will likely bounce back from this panic.

Analysts Favor MUTM Over Other Low-Caps Before Listings Begin,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/analysts-favor-mutm-over-other-low-caps-before-listings-begin/,"The post Best Cheap Crypto to Buy Now? Analysts Favor MUTM Over Other Low-Caps Before Listings Begin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With so many low-cap tokens in the market claiming to be the next big cryptocurrency, it’s becoming harder for investors to separate long-term value from short-term noise. But there’s one project that’s consistently gaining quiet attention among analysts, and it’s not doing it through hype or meme-fueled trends. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a still-affordable token priced at $0.025, is steadily carving out a reputation as a serious DeFi contender—and many believe it’s the best cheap cryptocurrency to invest in before exchange listings kick off. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) MUTM’s presale progress alone is telling. Over $8.6 million has already been raised, and the fourth presale phase is more than 88% complete. Once this phase wraps, the price will jump by 20%—a move that will take the token one step closer to its $0.06 listing price. That’s already a built-in 140% climb from today’s level. So far, over 490 million tokens have been sold to more than 9,950 holders, showing that growing interest isn’t just speculation—it’s backed by action. What’s pushing this momentum is not just affordability. It’s the design behind the project. Mutuum Finance isn’t following the usual playbook. It’s building a decentralized lending and borrowing system that gives users full flexibility over how they use their digital assets. Rather than forcing investors to sell their crypto to access funds, Mutuum allows them to lock in their assets as collateral and borrow against them—keeping their portfolios intact while gaining liquidity. Deposits are made into smart contracts, and in return, users receive mtTokens—a digital representation of their holdings that steadily grows in value as interest accumulates. These mtTokens are not just receipts; they are ERC-20 compliant, meaning they can be moved, traded, or even used elsewhere, all while continuing to earn yield. It’s this kind of utility that has analysts flagging MUTM as one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch before it hits major trading platforms. A key highlight of Mutuum’s framework is its reward mechanism, which channels a share of the protocol’s earnings into buying back MUTM tokens directly from the open market. The project redistributes these purchased tokens to participants, particularly mtToken holders. This approach not only promotes long-term engagement but also creates consistent buy pressure without overloading the supply side. For investors exploring what cryptocurrency to invest in right now, especially those looking for yield without excessive dilution, MUTM is proving to be a rare opportunity. Beta Launch to Accompany Listing What’s also worth noting is the team’s plan to roll out a beta version of the platform shortly after launch. Unlike many projects that list first and build later, Mutuum aims to give early users hands-on access to its borrowing and lending features almost immediately. That’s a strong utility move—one that is expected to drive fresh demand as soon as the token becomes available for trading. In a market that’s constantly shifting, what often separates real contenders from short-lived experiments is functionality and timing. MUTM has both. It’s affordable, it’s already moving toward real deployment, and it’s backed by mechanisms that reward holders from actual protocol activity—not just promises. For anyone considering which cryptocurrency to invest in for the long haul, MUTM is steadily earning a top spot on the list. It combines core DeFi utility with real momentum and a financial model designed for sustainable growth. To increase visibility as it approaches the next presale phase, the team behind Mutuum Finance is also running a $100,000 giveaway. Full participation details can be found on their official website, but it’s already adding another layer of energy to the presale—and reinforcing that early adoption has its perks.

This was driven by traditional asset holdings like Treasury bills and gold, which cushioned the impact of crypto market volatility. As the US debates stablecoin regulation through bills like the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act, Tether’s growing influence proves the increasing institutional acceptance of stablecoins. Meanwhile, Tether also recently backed a massive Bitcoin acquisition on behalf of Twenty One Capital by purchasing $458.7 million worth of BTC as the firm prepares for a public listing via a SPAC merger. With backing from SoftBank and Bitfinex, Twenty One now ranks as the third-largest corporate Bitcoin holder and plans to become the top institutional vehicle for Bitcoin exposure. Overall, it is quite clear that Tether is expanding its footprint across traditional and crypto markets. Tether Ranks Among World’s Largest Treasury Holders Tether, the leading stablecoin issuer with over $151 billion in assets, surpassed Germany in United States Treasury bill holdings. According to data from the US Department of the Treasury and Tether’s Q1 2025 attestation report, the firm now holds more than $120 billion in US Treasurys, placing it ahead of Germany’s $111.4 billion and ranking it as the 19th largest holder among all countries and entities. Countries holding US Treasury bills (Source: Treasury.gov ) The attestation report also revealed that Tether generated more than $1 billion in operating profit during the first quarter of 2025. This performance was driven primarily by its holdings in US Treasury bills, which are widely regarded as one of the safest and most liquid investment instruments globally. The firm shared that while the broader crypto market experienced downside volatility in Q1, its traditional asset reserves—including Treasury bills and gold—helped mitigate potential losses. In particular, the gains from gold investments nearly offset the impact of crypto-related fluctuations, which certainly helped confirm the strength of Tether’s asset mix . Tether’s expanding influence comes at a time when stablecoin regulation in the United States is in flux. Growing regulatory clarity could help boost demand for USDT, prompting the company to expand its reserves even more. Two key legislative proposals are at the center of the regulatory conversation. The STABLE Act, which aims to increase transparency and accountability for stablecoin issuers, has advanced through committee and is now awaiting a floor vote in the House. Meanwhile, the GENIUS Act, which focuses on stablecoin collateralization standards and anti-money laundering compliance, has stalled due to political resistance. Despite this, a strong show of support from top crypto founders in Washington, D.C., suggests that regulatory momentum may soon pick back up. US Stablecoin Law Still on Track The push for comprehensive stablecoin regulation in the United States is still going forward despite a recent setback in the Senate. Cody Carbone, CEO of the Digital Chamber, a prominent Washington-based blockchain advocacy group, is still very optimistic about the eventual passage of the GENIUS Act, formally titled the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation in US Stablecoins of 2025. Cody Carbone In an interview at Consensus 2025, Carbone explained that although the bill failed to pass a procedural vote earlier this month, it is only a temporary delay and not a derailment of momentum. According to him, the bill is likely to pass in the coming weeks, especially as Congress already moved faster on this issue than many expected. Carbone also talked about the bipartisan appeal of stablecoin regulation, and argued that protecting the US dollar's global dominance should be a shared goal across party lines. The GENIUS Act is seen as a crucial legislative framework that could shape the future of stablecoin issuance and compliance in the United States. Failing to pass meaningful reform before the 2026 midterm elections could potentially roll back the progress that was made in creating a favorable regulatory environment for digital assets. Despite the procedural hiccup on May 8, negotiations are ongoing, and advocates are hopeful that the revised version of the bill will find the necessary support in the Senate soon. Part of the GENIUS Act (Source: US Senate ) The initial failure of the bill was blamed on partisan disputes and growing controversy surrounding former President Donald Trump’s involvement in the crypto space. Several Democratic senators withdrew their support due to ethical concerns over Trump’s links to meme coins, NFTs, and decentralized finance. Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal had similar concerns, and suggested Trump’s digital asset complicated the regulatory debate. In response, Republican Senator Tim Scott accused Democrats of allowing political motivations to obstruct necessary financial innovation. The most recent version of the GENIUS Act reportedly removes references to the Trump family in an attempt to push the legislation through. Industry insiders believe the revised bill could pass by the end of May. Tether Backs Major Bitcoin Play Meanwhile, Tether recently made a large Bitcoin purchase on behalf of Twenty One Capital, a Bitcoin-focused investment firm it backs. Tether bought nearly half a billion dollars' worth of BTC in anticipation of the company’s upcoming public debut. According to a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing on May 13, Tether purchased 4,812.2 Bitcoin for $458.7 million at an average price of $95,319 per coin. The purchase was transferred into an escrow wallet on May 9, boosting Twenty One’s total Bitcoin holdings to 36,312 BTC. This positioned Twenty One as the third-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally, behind only Strategy and MARA Holdings. Strategy holds approximately 568,840 BTC, while MARA controls around 48,237 BTC, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net . Once the firm completes its Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) merger with Cantor Equity Partners, it plans to trade under the ticker XXI. The merger is still undergoing regulatory approvals, though CEO Jack Mallers confirmed the process is underway. Tether, along with crypto exchange Bitfinex, holds a majority stake in Twenty One. The merger is being sponsored by Cantor Fitzgerald, a major Wall Street player providing financial advisory services and securing $585 million to help fund the firm’s growing Bitcoin portfolio. Japanese investment conglomerate SoftBank also threw its weight behind the venture by contributing $900 million. Together, Tether, SoftBank, and Bitfinex want to help Twenty One reach a total of 42,000 BTC before to its public listing, with Tether expected to contribute 23,950 BTC, SoftBank 10,500 BTC, and Bitfinex roughly 7,000 BTC in exchange for equity . In an April presentation, Twenty One laid out its ambition to surpass Strategy as the leading Bitcoin investment vehicle. It markets itself as a “pure play” for institutional and retail investors looking for capital-efficient Bitcoin exposure.

Presales are extremely profitable since they allow purchasers to purchase crypto at significantly reduced prices before tokens are listed on major exchanges. Early investors frequently benefit from bonus allocations, staking awards, and a first-mover advantage, which may result in bigger gains when the larger market begins its next ascent. As cryptocurrencies heat up, now is the moment to review your presale crypto list for high-quality ICOs, with the potential for 10x profits waiting to be taken. Nexchain's AI-Driven Ecosystem: A New Era in Utility Nexchain redefines what a cryptocurrency presale may provide by using AI at every level of its Layer-1 network. At its center is a hybrid consensus architecture that combines proof-of-stake and machine-learning algorithms, allowing the platform to execute up to 400,000 transactions per second at an average price of $0.001. This speed allows high-frequency DeFi swaps and microtransactions to be both viable and affordable. Beyond performance, Nexchain provides direct benefits to its community. Ten percent of the network's gas-fee revenue is provided daily to NEX holders who store their tokens in non-custodial wallets. There is no need for separate staking contracts; simply hold NEX to get passive revenue. This open income allocation promotes long-term loyalty and aligns user incentives with network expansion. NEX also serves as a universal payment token in the Web3 environment. Whether you're buying AI-generated content, making in-game microtransactions, or accessing business data, NEX drives transactions in all Nexchain-based dApps. Token holders may also stake NEX to vote on governance decisions, development roadmaps, exchange listings, and ecosystem awards. Nexchain, currently priced at $0.05 in Stage 13 of its token presale, has a goal listing price of $0.30 and provides a strong ROI potential. Nexchain's combination of speed, cheap fees, passive revenue, and AI usefulness makes it one of the finest cryptocurrency presales to purchase in 2025. Dawgz AI: Meme-Powered Trading for Real Utility For investors looking for the next altcoin industry leader, Dawgz AI stands out on the presale cryptocurrency landscape. Built on Ethereum, this project blends the viral appeal of a meme coin with useful AI-powered trading bots. Dawgz AI, which has been audited by SolidProof and is completely KYC-verified, delivers up to 96% APY through its staking programs, an unusual payout for an early-stage ICO. To date, the project has successfully raised approximately $3.57 million, nearly reaching its soft cap of $3.61 million, with tokens currently trading at $0.004 each. Dawgz AI's Proof of Intelligence method incentivizes community interaction, linking Telegram and Twitter participation to on-chain incentives. This simultaneous focus on social virality and functional value has piqued the curiosity of both retail and institutional investors, positioning it as one of the most exciting presale crypto prospects as market sentiment moves in favor of alternative coins. Final Words: Nexchain Leads Crypto ICOs in 2025 As cryptocurrencies recover traction, crypto presales provide an opportunity to secure tokens at floor pricing. While Dawgz AI and other projects provide new features, Nexchain's extensive AI integration, clear revenue-sharing mechanism, and low-cost, high-speed infrastructure propel it to the forefront of presale cryptocurrency offers. With $2.3 million funded, tokens priced at $0.05, and a clear route to a $0.30 listing, Nexchain offers a unique combination of real-world utility and multiple-bagger upside. Nexchain is the best option for people wishing to invest in presale cryptocurrency with a 10x potential by 2025. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

However, after several bullish runs and corrections, many are thinking if SHIB nonetheless has the potential to attain this ambitious price—or if new initiatives like Ozak AI , presently priced at just $0.003, provide a more realistic chance at 100x gains. As investors search for the next breakout star in the altcoin market, comparing legacy meme coins like SHIB to emerging tokens with real-world AI utility like Ozak AI becomes critical. SHIB to $0.01: A Long-Awaited Dream SHIB’s rise was nothing short of spectacular. Driven by community hype, celebrity endorsements, and exchange listings, the token delivered meteoric returns. But reaching $0.01 from its current price remains a tough challenge. Let’s do the math: For SHIB to hit $0.01, it would need a market cap in the hundreds of billions of dollars, assuming no massive token burns. While SHIB does have a dedicated following and ongoing developments like Shibarium, such a market cap would put it on par with or above Ethereum—an unlikely scenario without a major shift in tokenomics or utility. Although SHIB still holds potential for upside during a bull run, its sheer supply makes a $0.01 target more speculative than probable in the near term. Ozak AI: A Low-Cap Gem with Real Utility Unlike SHIB, Ozak AI is not just hype-driven—it’s built on a solid foundation that combines blockchain with artificial intelligence. The project offers a suite of decentralized AI tools aimed at automating tasks, optimizing smart contracts, and supporting AI-driven dApps. Here’s what sets Ozak AI apart: Presale Price: At just $0.003, it’s still in early accumulation phases. AI-Blockchain Synergy: It’s tapping into the explosive demand for AI-integrated crypto applications. Scarcity and Growth: With a lower token supply and real-world use cases, price appreciation is more feasible. If Ozak AI reaches just $1, that’s a 100x return from current levels. Unlike SHIB, which relies heavily on community support and speculative sentiment, Ozak AI offers utility-based demand and a clear path to growth through adoption and usage. Where’s the Smart Money Going? Crypto investors are becoming more discerning. They're not just chasing meme coins—they’re looking for high-upside projects with fundamentals. While SHIB might still deliver 2x or 3x gains in a bullish environment, tokens like Ozak AI could offer 100x potential for those willing to take early positions. As artificial intelligence becomes a cornerstone of innovation in both Web2 and Web3, projects that bridge this technology with blockchain stand to benefit the most. Ozak AI could be one of those breakout leaders. While the dream of SHIB hitting $0.01 isn’t entirely dead, it’s weighed down by supply and market cap limitations. On the other hand, Ozak AI’s entry point of $0.003 and practical AI use cases make it a more attractive option for investors seeking massive returns in 2025. For those chasing 100x returns, the answer may not be in the old favorites—but in new, utility-driven innovations like Ozak AI. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based project that offers a technology platform that specializes in predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Ozak AI helps crypto investors and companies in choice-making by offering real-time, accurate, and actionable insights thru machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies.

Singapore-based crypto trading platform Crypto.com has partnered with Canary Capital Group to launch the Canary CRO Trust, marking the first investment product in the U.S. that provides exposure to the Cronos ( CRO ) token. This new trust allows qualified U.S. investors to hold CRO in a regulated and secure manner. The partnership with Canary Capital comes on the heels of Crypto.com’s previous collaboration with Trump Media & Technology Group to introduce a series of digital asset-focused ETFs under the “Truth” brand. The ETFs, which aim to combine digital assets, including Bitcoin ( BTC ) and CRO, with traditional “Made in America” securities, are expected to debut later this year, pending regulatory approval.

Dubious Lido Team-Linked Wallet Transfers $21 Million Worth of LDO to Exchanges Amid Price Drop According to blockchain analytics platform EmberCN, the wallet moved 3.5 million LDO (worth around $3.1 million) to Binance, OKX, Bybit, and Gate.io today alone. This brings the total amount transferred over the past six days to 21.31 million LDO, worth around $21.24 million at the time the transactions were made. During this time, the price of LDO dropped by 24%, from $1.16 to $0.88, leading to speculation that the sell-off could be adding to the downward pressure on the token. The address in question has not been officially confirmed to belong to Lido Finance or its team, but the scale and timing of the transfers have caught the attention of on-chain analysts and the broader crypto community. Lido is one of the largest liquid staking protocols on Ethereum, and LDO is its governance token. Large movements of tokens held by the team, especially to exchanges, are often interpreted by the markets as potential sell-offs. Especially when accompanied by price drops. At the time of writing, Lido has not made any public statement regarding wallet activity or whether the address is officially affiliated with the project.

Tron founder Justin Sun joined the venture as an advisor in December 2024 after investing $30 million in the firm. Sun has long been a controversial figure and has previously faced several investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Since Sun became a WLFI advisor, the SEC dropped its investigations of Sun’s sale of BitTorrent and Rainberry tokens. This prompted Democrat legislators to demand an investigation into Trump’s crypto ventures.

44809154,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=753882,1747661401,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/44809154.jpeg,Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent?,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-major-breakout-or-breakdown-imminent/,"The Dogecoin price could be at a critical juncture for a breakout but momentum needs to persist. On the four-hour chart shared by analyst Josh Olszewicz, price has been sliding inside a clearly defined falling-wedge formation since printing a local high at $0.25941 on 13 May. The upper and lower boundaries of that wedge continue to drift lower, trapping successive swing highs and lows; the lower rail is presently guiding support at while the upper rail caps the market near $0.219. Within that compression, Olszewicz overlays an Ichimoku system set to short-cycle parameters (20/60/120/30). The most recent completed candle — stamped 17 May 08:00 UTC — settled at $0.21532 after trading between $0.21187 and $0.21676. That close left price lodged squarely inside the cloud, a location that typically denotes equilibrium. Internally, the Tenkan-sen rests at $0.21427, the Kijun-sen at $0.22524, Senkou Span A at $0.22102 and Senkou Span B at $0.21184, creating an unusually tight band of short-term reference levels. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tops Tend To Follow Surges In Retail Futures Activity, Analysis Shows The zone between the wedge floor and Span B around $0.212–0.214 forms a high-confluence support zone that has already produced two intraday rebounds. Conversely, the Kijun-sen and descending wedge resistance intersect near $0.225, erecting an equally visible ceiling overhead. As long as price remains trapped between those two lines, momentum traders are likely to see a low-volatility coil; the first decisive breach — particularly a four-hour close through the upper rail — would satisfy every textbook criterion for a bullish falling-wedge resolution and mechanically projects a return toward the 13 May high. Dogecoin Looks Still Strong Cantonese Cat’s weekly perspective speaks to a larger cycle. In his chart, Dogecoin has just finished its first weekly close above the Bull Market Support Band — essentially the 20-week simple moving average enveloped by a two-sigma envelope — since early February. That band currently spans $0.21617 at the lower edge to $0.22378 at the upper edge; last week’s candle settled at $0.22387, a whisker above the cap, converting what had been resistance throughout the spring into provisional support. The break occurs while the Bollinger upper band is still descending from the February crest near $0.35, an indication that volatility on the weekly time-frame has only just begun to contract after a multi-month bear unwind. The midline of the Bollinger structure, identical to the 20-week SMA and the top of the Bull Market Support Band, is therefore the single most important pivot for the week ahead. Related Reading: Dogecoin Pullback May Be Short-Lived—Here’s The Next Price Target A second consecutive weekly settlement above $0.22378 would confirm the first as more than a one-off spike and could embolden trend-followers to price in a medium-term push toward the mid-$0.30s where the upper band presently curves. Taken together, the two time-frames sketch a clear roadmap. Short-term traders will be looking for a resolution of the descending wedge; a bullish breakout through $0.219 would immediately shift focus to prior supply at $0.24-0.26, whereas a failure to hold $0.205 risks an acceleration toward the April pivot at $0.185. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.217.

Strategy reported a Bitcoin yield of 16.3% year-to-date. Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor made his usual hint at the purchase in a May 18 X post . Source: Michael Saylor According to a May 19 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company was also the recipient of a class-action lawsuit. The suit accuses Strategy officials of having failed to represent the nature of Bitcoin investments accurately. As of May 18, Strategy holds 576,230 BTC acquired for around $40.2 billion at an average price of $69,726 per coin.

Hedera Hashgraph ( HBAR ) dropped to $0.1870, down by almost 20% from its highest level this month and 54% from its highest in November last year. The ongoing HBAR price retreat happened as the crypto market lost momentum. Bitcoin ( BTC ) retreated to $102,000, a day after it hit $107,000 for the first time since January. Third-party data shows that Hedera’s network fundamentals remain strong, with the total value locked in its decentralized finance ecosystem rising by 15% over the last 30 days to $186 million. The top-performing platforms are Stader and Bonzo Finance.

As shown in the chart below, the supply jumped to $181.2 million on Monday, up from a year-to-date low of $40 million. It stood at $131 million just last Friday. Hedera stablecoin market cap | Source: DeFi Llama A soaring stablecoin supply on a blockchain is generally seen as a positive indicator, suggesting rising on-chain activity. It can also drive higher network revenues as transaction volumes increase. For example, Tron ( TRX ) has become the most profitable chain due to its dominant share of Tether transactions. Decentralized exchange volume on Hedera also climbed, with a more than 80% increase in the past week to $70.4 million. This brought the network’s cumulative DEX volume to $4.58 billion. Another bullish signal is that the funding rate in the futures market has remained positive since April 16. A positive funding rate indicates that traders expect future prices to rise, a generally bullish sentiment. Hedera funding rate | Source: CoinGlass HBAR price technical analysis Hedera price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that HBAR has pulled back in recent sessions. On the positive side, the token remains above the 200-day Exponential Moving Average and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. Hedera has also formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a popular bullish reversal sign in technical analysis. Therefore, the Hedera price may bounce back in the next few days as the US credit rating downgrade jitters end . If this happens, the initial target to watch will be at $0.2240, the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level. A move below the support at $0.15 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

Its Realized Capitalization has reached a fresh high of $906.04 billion for the fourth consecutive week. This metric reflects the total value of all unspent Bitcoin transaction outputs (UTXOs) based on their purchase price, and has now surpassed its previous record as BTC continues consolidating around the crucial support of $103,000. Experts say that this trend could set the stage for a historic bull run. Bullish Breakout Ahead? Since the current range-bound phase began on May 8, Bitcoin has absorbed an additional $14.4 billion in new capital, which is a 1.61% increase in Realized Capitalization. According to CryptoQuant’s latest report , this is an indicator of steady investor inflow. It further suggests that once Bitcoin decisively clears the $104,731 resistance level, the next target at $107,757 could come into play, which, in turn, could potentially open the door to a new all-time high. Interestingly, driving much of this capital accumulation are large holders, with the 100-1,000 BTC UTXO value bands increasing their combined holdings by 122,540 BTC over the past 10 days. This figure represented a 2.2% increase. Institutional interest remains uneven, but BlackRock has emerged as the only major ETF to add to its Bitcoin holdings during this period, which has increased its balance by 10,302 BTC (1.66%) to 631,902 BTC, while other funds have either trimmed exposure or held steady. As such, CryptoQuant observed that the upward trend in Realized Capitalization signals market confidence. If the trend continues, it could support further price expansion and potentially catalyze a historic bull run. Bitcoin’s June Explosion Looms Matrixport’s recent market update also echoed a similar trend, as Bitcoin’s surge has found significant backing from multiple positive catalysts. The platform stated that the fading of crucial downside risks, such as US tech sector pressure due to Q1 earnings and concerns over AI-related capex, has reopened the door for asset growth. Strong earnings and renewed commitments from major tech firms have helped restore investor confidence and lifted equities and crypto alike. Political shifts have also played a role, as US President Donald Trump promoted inbound investments and potential policy tailwinds like extended tax cuts and deregulation. Matrixport said that it turned bullish in mid-April, supported by its trend model signaling a reversal into an uptrend. The firm expects a favorable window for risk assets until July, as this period coincides with the Q2 earnings season, the conclusion of the 90-day tariff truce, and peak liquidity conditions. Another key catalyst is the upcoming $5 billion in FTX creditor payouts set for late May, which could flow into crypto markets and boost momentum in June. Combined with steady ETF inflows and stablecoin growth, these factors may sustain Bitcoin’s rally.

At this point, over 87% of the round has already been completed, reflecting increasing demand. With more than $8.6 million raised and nearly 10,000 holders, the numbers are starting to resemble those of projects that make major post-listing moves. After this phase concludes, the token price will increase to $0.03, with the launch value officially set at $0.06. For early participants, that’s already a potential 140% return by listing—before the token even reaches open exchanges. For experienced investors, this kind of early exposure to an asset with upcoming product deployment is exactly why MUTM is becoming one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch right now. It’s not just about where the token is priced. What’s setting Mutuum Finance apart is the team’s development-first approach. Rather than focusing on speculative trends or viral marketing, the project is being built to deliver core DeFi functions from the start. MUTM goes beyond being an idea—it’s supported by a protocol designed to launch non-custodial lending and borrowing functionality. When users supply assets, they receive mtTokens in return—tokens that grow in value over time as borrowing activity on the platform increases. This structure creates a direct link between platform usage and token demand, something long-term investors look for when evaluating which new crypto coin is likely to perform well after launch. Also in development is a fully overcollateralized stablecoin, backed directly by on-chain activity within Mutuum’s lending protocol. This stablecoin isn’t just a theoretical idea—it’s part of the platform’s next phase of utility, and it adds stability, internal liquidity, and new incentive layers that can push long-term token value even further. Early accumulation ahead of exchange listings Despite being in pre-listing mode, large wallets have already started to accumulate MUTM. These aren’t retail pumps—these are early-stage positions being taken before wider visibility sets in. That’s typically when seasoned crypto investors move: before the rush. The project is also undergoing a smart contract audit by CertiK, which adds an extra layer of trust and validation to its roadmap. This signals that the team isn’t just aiming for hype-driven momentum but is preparing to scale the platform with a secure, transparent foundation. At just $0.025, investors still have access to a token that many analysts believe will see substantial appreciation once the platform goes live. With the launch price confirmed at $0.06, early holders already have a clear value advantage. But more importantly, as features like borrowing, stablecoin integration, and automated token redistribution activate, long-term demand could drive the price much higher. The fact that this is all still happening before exchange listings is what makes Mutuum Finance one of the best cryptos to buy now. MUTM isn’t waiting for listing day to start gaining traction. It’s already drawing high-level interest from those who understand how real DeFi protocols are built—and how early positioning can lead to massive upside. With utility already under development, a smart token model, and a limited presale window, this is one of the next big cryptos being quietly added to portfolios. The market isn’t watching yet—but the right investors already are. And that says everything.

The relatively larger acquisition happened during a bullish week, with an average price above $103,000. Strategy (MSTR) continued its weekly BTC purchases, this time adding 7,390 BTC to its reserves. The company acquired the additional coins as BTC had a turbulent week with a hike to $106,000. Strategy has acquired 7,390 BTC for ~$764.9 million at ~$103,498 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 16.3% YTD 2025. As of 5/18/2025, we hodl 576,230 $BTC acquired for ~$40.18 billion at ~$69,726 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF https://t.co/woIBO11Hz9 — Strategy (@Strategy) May 19, 2025 The latest purchase was in the middle of the range for the weekly buying operations, down from the previous week’s acquisition of 13,390 BTC . After the latest purchase, MSTR common stock traded at $399.80, down from its recent six-month peak. Strategy shares are down from their recent six-month high, though remaining one of the winners for the past month. | Source: Google Finance The latest announcement also included a recent development for Strategy, reporting on an alleged lawsuit filed with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The class-action lawsuit against Michael Saylor and associates claims misleading statements on the potential returns for BTC-based investments. The lawsuit covers the April 30, 2024 to April 4, 2025 period, and alleges misleading statements and failure to disclose information on the anticipated profitability of the BTC investment and treasury operations. Despite the purchase announcement, BTC still erased some of its gains over the weekend. The leading coin traded at $102,447, below the average price of Strategy’s purchase for the past week. Despite this, the firm is still in the green with a $69,726 average price per BTC. Strategy achieved its latest purchase after the sale of over $705M in common stock. This week’s purchase is relatively high compared to previous periods, showing BTC bullish momentum translated into demand for MSTR . The rest of the purchase was financed with $59.7M in STRK convertible instruments. After the latest addition to the treasury, Strategy has $18.98B in common stock authorized to issue, and another $20.85B to issue in the form of STRK. With the latest purchase, Strategy has already allocated over $40B to BTC acquisitions at market price, with nearly as much remaining in authorized but not issued common stock or convertible STRK shares. Strategy inspires other companies to keep buying The latest Strategy acquisition coincides with a new announcement from Metaplanet. The Japanese company added another 1,004 BTC to its balance, at an average price of $103,873 per BTC, a higher entry point compared to Strategy. Just like MSTR, Metaplanet stock rallied to $4.39 , close to its higher range for the next few months. Metaplanet also entered the top 10 of the most liquid stocks on the Japanese market, generating new demand by following Strategy’s model. With the latest purchase, Metaplanet holds 7,800 BTC, getting close to its goal for 2025 to acquire 10,000 BTC. In the past week, announcements from corporations aiming to acquire BTC accelerated. Not all potential buyers made good on their promises. A total of 108 public companies hold BTC in their balance, with seven new treasuries added in the past two weeks. Large-scale treasuries now contain 3.33M BTC, one of the biggest reserves with potential long-term holding. Strategy and Metaplanet bought even though ETFs had net outflows in Q1 and a slowly growing balance in Q2. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty. Miner profitability improved in May, as the price of bitcoin BTC rose, and gross margins expanded, the bank said. The hashprice, a measure of daily mining profitability, rose 13% from April, which the bank said was ""encouraging."" ""We estimate miners earned ~$50,100 in daily block reward revenue per EH/s over the first two weeks of the month, up 13% from last month and 3% y/y,"" analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote. U.S.-listed miners maintained their share of the network hashrate, and currently account for about 30.5% of the network, a 1.1% increase from April, the bank said. The total market cap of the 13 U.S.-listed bitcoin mining stocks that the bank tracks rose 24%, or $4.6 billion, this month.

Tether has now positioned itself by relying on more traditional assets to back its USDT stablecoin. In 2024, the USDT issuer was the seventh-largest buyer of U.S. Treasuries, beating Canada, Mexico, Taiwan and Norway. Tether was the seventh-largest buyer of U.S. Treasuries. Source: Paolo Ardoino (X/Twitter) The aim of these investments is to sustain the stability of the USDT and help maintain sufficient liquidity when markets are volatile. Tether also reported over $1 billion in profits from conventional investments in Q1, mainly because of the success of its U.S. Treasury assets. With its gold-backed portfolio, the company managed to address the issues that arose from changes in digital assets. “Q1 2025 showcases Tether’s continued leadership in stability, strength, and vision. With record U.S. Treasury exposure, growing reserves, strong profits, and increased adoption ofUSD₮ worldwide.” Paolo Ardoino Tether CEO. USDT supply hits $150 billion The market cap of USDT recently rose above $150 billion for the first time in history. It has grown rapidly this year, adding over $11 billion to its market capitalization. During the last year, more than 250 million users completed over $33.6 trillion in stablecoin transactions in only 5.8 billion transactions. Visa reports that 192.2 million addresses purchased stablecoins, and 242.7 million addresses received them, suggesting more people are using them. Both Citi and Standard Chartered say that the growth is unlikely to stop. According to Citi, stablecoins could see their value reach $1.6 trillion by 2030. According to Standard Chartered, an increase in institutional interest and better financial regulations may lead to a valuation of $2 trillion in 2028. XAUt expands to Thailand Tether is expanding into Thailand by offering its tokenized gold product. Tether Gold (XAUt), a digital form of gold, was listed on Maxbit, a licensed exchange in Thailand, on May 13. Thailand’s announcement in March 2025 granting permission to trade USD-backed stablecoins, including USDT and USDC, led to this move. Within the Thai digital asset market, USDT can now be used without restrictions. XAUt currently has a market capitalization of $802 million and is growing popular with investors looking for alternative currency and digital assets. There are currently two U.S. legislation proposals being studied, and they might play a role in regulating assets like USDT. In February, the House Financial Services Committee voted in favor of the STABLE Act, moving the decision on a full House vote to the next phase. Its purpose is to ensure that each stablecoin issuer is open in their actions and maintains stability. The opposition to the GENIUS Act stopped its advance in May.

Strategy has acquired 7,390 BTC for ~$764.9 million at ~$103,498 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 16.3% YTD 2025. As of 5/18/2025, we hodl 576,230 $BTC acquired for ~$40.18 billion at ~$69,726 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF https://t.co/QwYKgLkfPX — Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 19, 2025 Although most investors became aware of the legal action while reading the firm’s latest Bitcoin purchase disclosure, the company running the lawsuit, Pomerantz, disclosed and detailed it on Sunday, May 18. Some MSTR shareholders are displeased with the firm’s accounting practices and feel they have suffered losses as a result of improper risk statements: Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the anticipated profitability of the Company’s bitcoin-focused investment strategy and treasury operations was overstated; (ii) the various risks associated with bitcoin’s volatility and the magnitude of losses Strategy could recognize on the value of its digital assets following its adoption of ASU 2023-08 were understated; and (iii) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. The lawsuit also heavily relies on the newly adopted ‘Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-08, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets (“ASU 2023-08”).’ In summary, suing investors allege that Michael Saylor’s company offered severely misleading data on the performance of its Bitcoin ( BTC ) strategy. According to Pomerantz’s press release, the inciting incident was the April 7, 2025, $5.91 billion loss disclosure that triggered a rapid 8.67% MSTR stock price drop. While it is not known at press time how much money the plaintiffs are demanding, Strategy expressed its intent to fight vigorously. Why MSTR investors are yet to price in the lawsuit Elsewhere, it is doubtful if MSTR investors have priced in the class action lawsuit. To begin with, following an initial 2% drop in the Monday pre-market, the equity entered a rapid rally immediately after the morning bell. What makes the upswing even stranger is that there has been no shortage of adverse economic news in the second half of May. A major cause for investor anxiety came from Moody’s, which downgraded the U.S. credit rating, thus turbocharging the already-rising 30-year treasury yield.

But only if you know how to make the most of the tools Pi already gives you. A dedicated Pi user recently revealed how they boosted their mining rate by over 26 times from the current base of 0.0030 π/hr to an impressive 0.083 π/hr. And guess what, you can do the same by applying a few smart strategies. Why Is the Mining Rate So Low Now? Pi mining is no longer about just tapping a button daily. It now rewards active participation, strong community building, and long-term commitment. Pi Network introduced a base rate of 0.0030 π/hr in May 2025, significantly lower than in past years. This drop is part of a planned reduction to control the total supply of Pi coins, which is capped at 65 billion for the Pi community mining rewards for the loyal Pioneers. That means passive users are now earning very little—unless they boost their rates through activity. Real User Strategy: From 0.0030 π/hr to 0.083 π/hr First, let’s understand how Pi calculates mining rates. Every user starts with a base rate, currently 0.0030 π/hr. But several features act as multipliers, adding significant boosts depending on your actions. Here’s how the user achieved this high mining rate: First Security Circle (100%), by adding 5 trusted Pioneers, you double your base rate. Secondly, Lockup Bonus (631.44%), by locking their Pi for 3 years, which gave them a massive 631.44% boost, shows strong network commitment and was rewarded generously. Lastly, Referral & Utility Bonuses (3.26x total), they had 7 active referrals and actively used Pi apps, both of which pushed the rate higher. All these together created this powerful formula: 0.0030 × (1 + 831.44%) × 3.26 = 0.083 π/hr Interestingly, the user wasn’t even running a Pi Node, which could’ve added another 10% or more, potentially pushing them past 0.1 π/hr. Why This Matters for Pioneers If you’re only mining at base rate, you’re missing out. Pi Network’s design favors those who actively engage, building trust circles, helping others join, locking up tokens, and using apps. Even though the mining rate keeps decreasing, you can still maximize your rewards by using these tools wisely. Pi isn’t about passive rewards anymore—it’s about building value together.",News,EN,0,0,MINING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-19 13:58:36

The new solution, dubbed Payroll Treasury Yield, uses blockchain lending protocols to help firms earn returns on payroll funds that would otherwise sit idle, the company told Cointelegraph in an exclusive statement. Franklin said its new offering integrates Summer.fi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform, to allow companies to deposit stablecoin-denominated payroll reserves into smart contract-based lending pools. These funds are lent to vetted borrowers, and companies earn yields while retaining access to their capital. Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk. “The problem that Franklin solves for is two-fold,” Megan Knab, founder and CEO of Franklin, told Cointelegraph. For companies that have already integrated crypto onto their balance sheets, Franklin helps them use those assets to manage their operations, she said. “But for the broader market, we are enabling business models of the future, where money moves instantly, more intelligently, and to more globally,” Knab added. Source: Franklin Related: PayPal to offer 3.7% yield on stablecoin balances: Report Alternative to T-Bills Franklin said its new offering is an alternative to traditional treasury tools like sweep accounts or T-bills, which often involve operational complexity and limited returns. Furthermore, it differentiates from earned wage access (EWA) platforms, which enable employees to access their earned wages before their scheduled payday by avoiding additional debt and associated costs. “Traditional payments in the next decade will run entirely on public blockchain rails as a wholesale replacement to ACH and SWIFT,” Knab said. She added that if onchain payroll products go mainstream, banks could fade into the background. While technology may replace many banking functions with self-custody tools and smart contracts, regulatory frameworks will still require accountable legal entities. The result may be “zombie-like institutions” — banks in name only, existing to meet compliance rules but playing a minimal role in actual payment processing, Knab said. However, decentralized lending comes with risks like smart contract vulnerabilities and market fluctuations. Franklin said it aims to mitigate these by using Summer.fi’s audited contracts and overcollateralized lending.

44810071,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=730638,1747663200,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png,Solana Price Prediction: Is Yeti Ouro The Next SOL?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-yeti-ouro-the-next-sol/,"Institutional influxes have propelled Solana (SOL) back to the mid-$170s, and upstart Yeti Ouro (YETIO) completes its fourth period of presales at $0.041. Over the last three days, SOL established new records for decentralized-exchange flows, and the rise of Yeti Ouro, breaking $4.1 million. Is it possible for a meme-meets-GameFi token to match the early speed that turned SOL into a blue chip? We compare their fundamentals, distribution curves, and short-term price trajectories below. Solana’s Mid-May pulse Solana price is at approximately $177 following an intraday spike to $184. The surge was preceded by an approximately $24 million treasury purchase by DeFi Development and over $35.6 billion of weekly on-chain DEX turnover. Daily SOL/USDT shows strong buying conviction on the daily chart, perpetually above its 20-day SMA (now ~$158.41) and lately touching the topmost Bollinger Band (~$186.14). The uptrend was backed by supporting volume, while the latest minor down leg is supported by lesser volume, which could be a bearish consolidation. But the MACD (currently 1.89), while above its signal line, shows a declining histogram. This suggests diminishing bullish momentum, which makes us aware to be cautious of a slowing down or divergence if the price does not break through the recent ~$186 highs decisively. Short futures interest has exceeded 51% , but analysts still delineate a $155-$185 consolidation range, flagging $230 as the next level to break through if spot-ETF discussion translates into official filings. Funding is neutral, which suggests that leverage is under control and enables SOL to function for traders as a liquid “alt-beta” trade minus micro-cap risk. Yeti Ouro’s Ingenious Strategy YETIO runs on a locked 1 billion-token cap. 500 million is reserved for a five-stage presale, which raises the quotation every time a stage limit or deadline is reached. It opened for Stage 1 at $0.012 and currently stands at $0.041 for Stage 4, giving the earliest investors a 242% paper return. The remaining distributes 15% to rewards for playing and earning, 15% for user rewards, 5% for liquidity, base team and strategic burns. Remaining unsold tokens burn, reducing float and supporting demand. Stage 5 price is also confirmed to take on a steeper price increase. The project is currently offering a 20% bonus on all token purchases, with an extra 5% bonus for purchases exceeding $500. Yeti Go: Utility that Burns Tokenomics by itself doesn’t create sustainability. On top of SOLIDProof-audited smart contracts, YETIO’s team pegs utility to Yeti Go, a cross-platform racing game built using Unreal Engine 5. Racing deposits a part of the fees into treasury buybacks and burns, and weekly leaderboard batches rewards on-chain to reduce gas. In-game purchases and seasonal competitions provide further sinks, transferring tokens to real players over passive airdrop farmers—a user-first spin on the builder rewards which bootstrapped early Solana. The game immerses you in a bold, fast-paced world where every detail is designed to thrill. Developed with the same studio behind iconic titles like Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space, it delivers cinematic visuals and adrenaline-fueled gameplay. What sets it apart is the sound—brought to life by audio experts who’ve collaborated with Grammy-nominated artists such as Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid—infusing every race with energy and emotion. Distribution contrasts Solana’s 2018 seed round sold approximately 16% of the supply for $0.22, keeping early upside concentrated within venture funds. YETIO reverses that script: over 80% of the circulating float at launch is held by presale buyers or game participants. The rhythm of the stages completed gives consistent marketing hooks, pushing price up ahead of first-exchange print. Standalone models estimate that if Stage 5 sells out and the exchanges list approximately three times the presale cap, early buyers may equal the 5-10 × month-one returns SOL achieved after its 2020 launch. Risk-reward balance SOL’s upside is tied to macro catalysts and regulatory catalysts, but its institutional bids and growing fee base support blue-chip status. YETIO is execution risk pure and simple: the studio has to get YetiGo out the door on schedule, have week-over-week burns and secure a tier-one listing. Success might lead to outsized returns due to deflation and low float, or failure might have presale capital abandoning ship quickly. Bottom line SOL provides proven scalability coupled with contained upside, and YETIO provides high-beta exposure founded on rising presale markups, autoburns, and GameFi interaction. Those investors prepared to take execution risk may enjoy seeing YETIO as a lively echo of Solana’s early days—if the roadmap makes the move from slide deck to screen.

Ethereum ( ETH ) fell to $2,400 on Monday, down from this month’s high of $2,732. The decline wiped out $35 billion in market capitalization, which dropped from $325 billion on May 14 to $289 billion. ETH retreated after a large holder capitulated. According to Lookonchain , the whale withdrew 7,000 ETH worth $16.8 million at a loss. Previously, the same address had withdrawn 13,479 ETH worth $48.82 million between Dec. 5 and Jan. 13. The whale still holds 6,479 ETH and has realized a loss of $16.28 million. Still, Ethereum fundamentals point to a potential price rebound. First, Nansen data shows that more investors are transferring ETH out of centralized exchanges and into self-custody wallets. Tokens on exchanges dropped by 3.46% on Monday to 23.47 million. Total supply on exchanges has also fallen to 19.45%.

Another positive sign is that assets on the Ethereum network continue to grow despite broader market headwinds. As shown below, BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, or BUIDL , has been in a strong uptrend. Its assets have surged to $2.9 billion, up from $640 million on Jan. 1. BUIDL assets are nearing $3 billion | Source: TokenTerminal Ethereum price technical analysis ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that ETH bottomed at $1,380 in April before rallying to $2,732 last week. It has since pulled back as investors took profits. Despite the drop, ETH remains above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages, which are on the verge of forming a mini golden cross. The current pullback occurred after the price hit the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, a sign that ETH may now be entering the second phase of an Elliott Wave pattern. If this outlook holds, Ethereum could bounce and potentially retest the 78.2% retracement level at $3,527 over the longer term. A drop below the $2,000 support zone would invalidate this bullish scenario.

The issue prompted the executive team at Bybit to act, both symptomatic of the vulnerability of centralized platforms as well as the power of crypto community pressure. A One-Time Technical Issue Begets Swift Action On 18th May, the Bybit China Team made a declaration that some users experienced withdrawal issues caused by KYC operations upon logging in via Apple ID. The firm immediately launched an internal investigation and involved various departments — like Chief Operating Officer Helen Liu, customer support, risk control, and technology teams — to resolve the issue. Based on Bybit, the impacted account’s KYC data was not touched and money was never in danger. The company labeled it as “a solo instance impacting one individual user, not a systemic one.” Influencer Steps In to Champion Retail Investor The issue came to light after Chinese-speaking crypto influencer EnHeng reported the issue on X (previously Twitter). He noticed a post on a group chat about a user not being able to access due to an Apple ID bug on Bybit. After confirming the issue, he contacted the exchange. Bybit’s employees allegedly acted quickly, unblocking the user account. EnHeng then stated, “This incident really made me feel the value of having influence,” pointing to the necessity to use one’s voice to stand for retail investors in a marketplace sometimes skewed in the direction of institutional participants. Account Locks Prevalent Throughout the Industry Incidental loss of access is not uncommon in the crypto ecosystem , especially on security incidents or compliance audits. Phemex halted withdrawals earlier this year after it discovered nearly $30 million of suspicious withdrawals, and Mudrex halted withdrawals due to compliance updates. In extreme situations, actions are performed on law enforcement’s behalf. For example, last year, OKX and other exchanges froze accounts of Tornado Cash and sanctioned entities. These stories underscore the crypto mantra: “Not your keys, not your coins.” Those who rely on centralized exchanges are nonetheless vulnerable to loss of access, making self-custody the talk of the town. Bybit’s rapid, executive-initiated response illustrates the ability of centralised exchanges to act quickly — particularly when those within a community amplify urgent issues. The experience does, however, illustrate the importance of robust access controls, user representation, and broader transparency for platforms holding user funds.",Blockchain|Bybit|KYC,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-05-19 14:04:00

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/ethereum-founder-vitalik-buterin-presents-a-new-roadmap-focused-on-increasing-gas-limits-on-ethereum-here-are-the-details/,"In a new proposal published today, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin outlined a roadmap that aims to address the challenges of scaling Ethereum Layer 1 (L1), focusing on increasing gas limits without compromising the ability to run full nodes. Vitalik Buterin Proposes 'Partially Stateless Nodes' to Help Ethereum Scaling Buterin’s post addresses a long-running debate in the Ethereum ecosystem: whether and how to increase the L1 gas limit, a move that could significantly increase network throughput but poses potential risks to decentralization and node availability. “The most common criticism of increasing the L1 gas limit, beyond concerns about network security, is that it makes it harder to run a full node,” Buterin wrote. Running a full Ethereum node, which today requires approximately 1 terabyte of state data and 500 gigabytes of additional historical data storage, is the cornerstone of the network’s trustless and censorship-resistant architecture. However, its high hardware requirements are making this system increasingly inaccessible to many users. To alleviate this, Buterin has proposed several short- and medium-term upgrades, including EIP-4444, which would limit the requirement for nodes to store historical data to just 36 days. This would significantly reduce disk space requirements and shift the burden of long-term historical storage to a distributed network of data providers. In the medium term, Buterin advocated for stateless validation, a method that allows nodes to verify transactions and blocks without storing the entire blockchain state. According to Buterin, this could reduce node storage needs by around 50%. He also suggested changes to gas pricing to encourage more efficient use of the blockchain, making data storage more expensive while lowering the cost of execution. The most notable innovation on Buterin’s roadmap is the idea of “partially stateless nodes.” These would act as a hybrid between full nodes and fully stateless clients. Rather than storing the entire state of the blockchain, these nodes would only hold a select subset of data. This way, they could continue to validate blocks and interact with the chain while consuming much less storage. “Partially stateless nodes have the potential to increase the L1 gas limit by 10 to 100 times,” Buterin said. These nodes will continue to contribute to decentralization and security while providing a much lighter participation in the network by using stateless validation tools such as zkEVMs or Merkle proofs to verify data integrity. *This is not investment advice.

44810217,https://thecoinrise.com/top-5-exchange-tokens-in-2025-regulations-rewards-utility/,1747663678,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/44810217.jpeg,"Top 5 Exchange Tokens in 2025: Regulations, Rewards, & Utility",https://thecoinrise.com/top-5-exchange-tokens-in-2025-regulations-rewards-utility/,"In 2025, exchange tokens are increasingly central in the broader crypto ecosystem. These tokens aren’t just speculative assets; they form the backbone of major trading platforms, offering holders tangible rewards, trading perks, governance rights, and, in some cases, exposure to tokenized real-world assets. As regulations tighten and user expectations grow, tokens that combine strong utility with robust compliance frameworks are pulling ahead. Below, we examine five standout exchange tokens, BGB, GT, MBG, KCS, and HT, and their evolving roles in a regulated, utility-focused crypto environment. 1. Bitget Token (BGB) Bitget Token (BGB) is the utility token of the Bitget platform and a critical part of its expanding crypto service ecosystem. Regulatory Framework: BGB is classified as a utility token rather than a security, which means it avoids some of the heavier regulatory scrutiny. Rewards and Benefits: BGB holders can enjoy trading fee discounts of up to 20% while also earning passive income through staking. The token grants early participation in new project launches and offers profit-sharing through Bitget’s Copy Trade feature. Utility: Beyond trading perks, BGB can cover gas fees in the Bitget Wallet and grants access to exclusive platform features and events, enhancing the overall user experience. 2. GateToken (GT) GateToken (GT) powers the Gate.io exchange and its underlying blockchain network, GateChain. Regulations: GT operates as a utility token and is not bound by securities regulations. Rewards Structure: Holders benefit from trading discounts and can earn rewards through staking on GateChain. GT also enables participation in governance decisions and grants exclusive access to new token sales and events. Use Cases: GT acts as the primary gas token on GateChain and is used for ecosystem incentives. Gate.io employs a deflationary model, periodically burning GT to reduce supply and support token value over time. 3. MultiBank Group Token (MBG) The MBG token stands out for its hybrid focus on regulatory compliance and institutional-grade digital asset infrastructure. Issued by the MultiBank Group , MBG is central to a growing ecosystem that bridges traditional finance and blockchain. Regulatory Oversight: Unlike many exchange tokens, MBG is built within a fully regulated environment. MultiBank Group emphasizes strict adherence to global regulations, creating a secure and compliant framework for users and institutional partners alike. Incentives and Rewards: MBG holders can stake their tokens on MultiBank.io to earn rewards, access tiered trading fee discounts, and unlock VIP privileges. The token also facilitates participation in new token launches via the platform’s Launchpad. Utility and Infrastructure: MBG is used for platform access, transaction fees, and staking. It serves as a foundational layer for tokenized assets, including real estate and commodities. Future developments include a stablecoin, MUSD, which will be backed by fiat and pegged to assets like gold and oil, extending the MBG ecosystem into real-world finance. 4. KuCoin Token (KCS) KCS is the native token of the KuCoin platform and offers a rich array of benefits designed to reward platform engagement and loyalty. Regulatory and Governance Features: KCS operates within KuCoin’s own governance structure. The token benefits from a buyback and burn program, supporting long-term value appreciation through controlled deflation. User Rewards: Holding KCS unlocks up to 20% in trading fee discounts. KuCoin Earn offers daily bonuses from trading fee revenue. Functional Utility: Staking KCS through KuCoin’s programs offers users steady passive income. Governance participation and VIP-tier benefits further incentivize long-term holding. 5. HT (HTX, formerly Huobi Token) HT is the longstanding utility token for the Huobi (now HTX) ecosystem, which emphasizes cost savings and governance benefits. Compliance Landscape: HT is categorized as a utility token and isn’t regulated as a security. It provides functional access within the HTX platform rather than acting as an investment. Rewards and Redemptions: HT allows users to reduce trading fees and buy into VIP plans that unlock additional discounts. HT holders also receive rewards and exclusive access to platform events and token listings. Utility and Deflationary Mechanism: HT is used for platform voting, fee payments, and purchasing VIP packages. A buyback and burn strategy reduces the token’s supply, helping to preserve value over time. Final Words As we move deeper into 2025, tokens like MBG are pushing the boundaries by integrating regulatory compliance and tokenized real-world assets, while BGB, GT, KCS, and HT continue to refine rewards and governance models. For investors and users alike, these tokens represent a gateway to crypto trading and a means to participate in the future of decentralized finance with increasing security, compliance, and innovation.

Despite recent deals with China and the United Kingdom, President Donald Trump’s overall tariff policy has also had an impact and investors eye more clarity and more deals. Commenting on Moody’s downgrade, RBC Capital Markets head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvasina told CNBC in an interview : “There’s not a ton of importance here… It’s more symbolic, but at the same time, if it’s going to push 10 year treasury yields up, my market is going to care.” Monday’s downbeat open comes after a largely positive week for U.S. stocks. The Nasdaq Composite closed more than 7% up last week, while the S&P 500 edged more than 5% for a five-day winning streak that had investors upbeat. Even the Dow, which struggled a bit over the week, rose to end the week more than 3% up. With the 10-year yield also surging to above 4.5%, stocks heaved under sell-off pressure. Cryptocurrencies also dipped, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) plunging to lows of $102k after retesting highs of $107k on Sunday. Despite the volatility, analysts are bullish on BTC and crypto, with broader sentiment being that the crypto market still has room for upside continuation.

No sooner had the BTC price erased all the gains incurred during the last trading day than the markets tumbled heavily. Currently, the Bitcoin price has dropped below the pivotal support at $102,800, which has dragged down the levels of the majority of the altcoins. The Ethereum price has slumped below $2400, while the Solana price is trading close to $160. Meanwhile, the XRP price is heading close to the barrier at $2.3, while the Cardano price is approaching the crucial barrier at $0.7. On the other hand, the memecoins have also faced a massive bearish action, with BOOK OK MEME recording over a 10% loss, followed by dogwifhat, Fartcoin, and Mog Coin with over an 8% drop. No tokens have been attracting gains, which suggests the bears could have capitulated the market. Why is the Crypto Market Down? Multiple reasons other than the BTC profit-taking have been contributing to the crypto market plunge, like the drop in the ETF inflows, a security breach at Coinbase and a regulatory crackdown on illicit activities of Haowang Guarantee, one of the largest online black markets. On the other hand, the market volatility has triggered substantial liquidations, as more than $650 million worth of positions were liquidated. One of the major reasons for the downfall of not only the crypto markets but also the stock markets is Moody’s decision to downgrade the US credit rating. Moreover, the agency warned that the country’s fiscal outlook was deteriorating as the national debt had risen to over $36.8 trillion from $21 trillion in 2020, which is believed to rise further. What’s Next? Will Bitcoin Price Go Up? The lowered prices of Bitcoin have again attracted the institutions, as MicroStrategy has again accumulated 7,390 BTC. On the other hand, the XRP and Micro XRP Futures are live on the CME Group, which has a major credibility upgrade with institutional futures. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s BTC ETF, IBIT, has pulled in nearly 2X the inflows of the GOLD ETF in 2025. Hence, the momentum appears to be cooling, but the structure stays bullish as retail is piling in while whales quietly accumulate off-exchange, and sentiment’s heating up without tipping into mania. The BTC MACD flashes near-term caution with a bearish crossover, and open interest has pulled back, signalling reduced leverage and some profit-taking. Hence, one can expect a chop or a reset unless buyers step up fast. Besides, the stablecoin inflows on exchanges are rising, and if the BTC price could rise back above $107K on real volume, the upside trend could accelerate. But for now, risk of consolidation or a shallow dip remains in play.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MOG,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-19 15:33:04

As of press time, SHIB was valued at $0.000014, down 5% in the last 24 hours, with weekly losses of over 12%. SHIB one-week price chart. Source: Finbold The coin’s 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) stands at $0.00001332, slightly below the current price, suggesting a mild upward trend in the recent past. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA at $0.00001657 indicates SHIB is trading below its longer-term average, hinting at a broader downtrend. On the other hand, SHIB’s 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) is at 54.24, placing the meme coin in neutral territory, neither overbought nor oversold, implying balanced momentum. AI predicts SHIB price Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT and xAI’s Grok for the price prediction, which offered various scenarios for SHIB on June 1. ChatGPT stated that SHIB will likely trade in a relatively stable range over the coming weeks. The model outlined a base-case scenario where SHIB fluctuates between $0.00001350 and $0.00001500. This assumes that Bitcoin consolidates near current levels and that no major news events significantly impact market sentiment. The OpenAI tool cited neutral readings on technical indicators such as RSI and MACD to support this sideways movement. However, ChatGPT also sees a bullish path for SHIB if it breaks resistance around $0.0000152 and broader market momentum returns, potentially pushing the token to the $0.00001650 and $0.00001800 range. On the downside, the model warned that a Bitcoin correction or fading interest in meme coins could send SHIB back to the $0.00001200 and $0.00001300 range, especially if community engagement weakens or bearish technical signals emerge. SHIB price prediction. Source: ChatGPT Grok’s SHIB price outlook Away from ChatGPT, Grok offered a three-tier forecast and placed more emphasis on external catalysts. In its bullish scenario, SHIB could reach $0.000020 and $0.000025, driven by strong Shibarium adoption, aggressive token burns, and a broader crypto market rally. However, Grok assigned just a 20–25% chance to a bullish breakout, instead favoring a more likely scenario where SHIB trades between $0.000013 and $0.000016, closely aligning with ChatGPT’s neutral outlook. This projection reflects steady community support, a stable Bitcoin market, and gradual progress in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, particularly through Shibarium. In a bearish case, Grok sees SHIB dropping to the $0.000010 and $0.000012 range, citing risks such as rising interest rates, regulatory pressure, underwhelming Shibarium performance, or a technical breakdown triggering stop-loss orders and panic selling. Both AIs emphasized that SHIB’s near-term direction depends as much on market sentiment as on technicals, with news, influencer buzz, and crypto trends often outweighing fundamentals.

Analysts Predict Where Smart Money Is Headed,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/ethereum-to-10k-or-ozak-ai-to-1-analysts-predict-where-smart-money-is-headed/,"The post Ethereum to $10K or Ozak AI to $1? Analysts Predict Where Smart Money Is Headed appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Two vastly different projects have captured the attention of investors—Ethereum (ETH) and a rising AI token called Ozak AI. While Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, eyes a climb to $10,000, early-stage project Ozak AI aims for $1 from a humble $0.003 presale price . Both are backed by compelling narratives—Ethereum by institutional DeFi dominance and Ozak AI by the booming combination of AI and blockchain. But where is the smart money flowing—and which could deliver the superior ROI? Ethereum to $10,000: A Likely But Slower Climb Ethereum has firmly established itself as the backbone of decentralized finance and NFTs. With ETH 2.0 bringing improved scalability, energy efficiency, and staking rewards, ETH is poised for a major breakout. Several analysts believe Ethereum can hit $10K in the next bull market due to: Network upgrades improve speed and reduce gas fees. Layer-2 growth boosting Ethereum’s usage without bloating the main chain. ETF speculation, similar to Bitcoin, drawing in institutional investors. If ETH moves from its current range of around $2,500 to $10,000, that’s roughly a 3.3x return. For whales and institutional players, that’s a great return on a large investment. But for retail investors seeking higher upside, this may not be the most aggressive growth play. Youtube embed: Next 500X AI Altcoin Ozak AI to $1: 300x Potential in the AI-Driven Crypto Sector Ozak AI, an AI crypto project that’s turning heads for its fusion of artificial intelligence and blockchain. With a Ozak AI presale price of just $0.003, Ozak AI is not just another meme coin—it’s building a decentralized ecosystem for AI-powered tools, automation, and smart applications. What makes Ozak AI stand out? Low market cap with room to grow exponentially. Strong narrative fit with 2025’s AI boom. Real utility in automating tasks, enhancing dApps, and AI-governed smart contracts. If Ozak AI hits $1, that would represent a staggering 300x return from its presale entry point. That’s the kind of upside that makes early-stage projects incredibly attractive to high-risk, high-reward investors. Where Is Smart Money Heading? Smart money doesn’t always mean institutional money—it refers to capital that moves based on logic, data, and timing. While Ethereum is a safer long-term bet, smart money often seeks asymmetric opportunities—where the upside massively outweighs the downside. Crypto whales and savvy investors are increasingly diversifying into promising low-cap altcoins like Ozak AI. Why? Because while ETH to $10K might double or triple your investment, early entry into a project like Ozak AI can multiply wealth significantly—even from a small starting capital. Ethereum’s path to $10,000 seems realistic and relatively low risk, making it a solid hold. But for investors looking for explosive gains and to ride the AI wave in Web3, Ozak AI’s $1 target may be a far more lucrative opportunity. In 2025, the biggest winners might not be the safest plays—they’ll likely be the most visionary. If Ozak AI delivers on its roadmap, it could become one of the top performers of the cycle—and smart money seems to be catching on. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based project that offers a technology platform that specializes in predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Ozak AI helps crypto investors and companies in choice-making by offering real-time, accurate, and actionable insights thru machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies.

(NASDAQ: MSTR) has deepened its already commanding position in the Bitcoin market, acquiring an additional 7,390 BTC for $764.9 million during the week of May 12–18. The company disclosed that the average purchase price was $103,498 per bitcoin, a major jump from its historical average cost basis. This latest acquisition comes just a week after Strategy purchased 13,390 BTC for $1.34 billion. The firm remains committed to its Bitcoin-centric treasury strategy.

The company’s Bitcoin holdings have delivered a year-to-date yield of 16.3%, driven by the digital asset’s surge past $104,000. Strategy has acquired 7,390 BTC for ~$764.9 million at ~$103,498 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 16.3% YTD 2025.

Saylor’s Bitcoin Bet Could Make Strategy the Top Public Stock A recent Financial Times documentary, Michael Saylor’s $40 Billion Bitcoin Bet, explores the bold vision behind Strategy’s approach. In the film, Jeff Walton, an analyst at Strategy, claims the company could eventually become the top publicly traded firm in the world, propelled by its singular focus on Bitcoin. “Strategy holds more of the best asset and most pristine collateral on the planet than any other company, by multiples,” Walton said. He argues that the firm’s massive exposure to Bitcoin—viewed by many as digital gold—gives it an unmatched strategic edge in a volatile macroeconomic environment. Bitcoin has rallied steadily in 2025, attracting renewed interest from institutional investors amid ongoing inflation concerns and geopolitical instability. Strategy’s aggressive buying spree suggests high confidence in the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin. As Bitcoin continues to break new ground, Strategy’s bet may turn into one of the most successful financial plays in corporate history—or one of the riskiest. Either way, Michael Saylor and his team have made it clear: they’re not just in it to win—they’re in it to redefine the game. Bitcoin Price Action Bitcoin has surged past the $106,800 mark, gaining an impressive $12,000 in May alone and notching up six consecutive weeks of growth. This upward momentum has revived the market, raising questions about whether the cryptocurrency is now on track to hit a new all-time high. Despite a brief pullback, BTC is consolidating within a tight range, with strong support at $102,000 and resistance at $106,000—indicating a market gearing up for its next big move. Arthur Azizov, founder and investor at B2 Ventures, believes this breakout reflects not just bullish enthusiasm but a maturing market underpinned by increasing institutional interest. “The return of the Coinbase premium is a key sign of renewed U.S. demand,” he notes, adding that if buyers can push through the current range, Bitcoin could break $108,000 and even test $110,000. That level would likely act as a strong psychological resistance, which could be overcome if momentum continues building at this pace. Technical indicators are aligning with the bullish narrative. Moving averages (EMA and SMA across 10, 20, 30, and 50-day periods) and the MACD (12, 26) support a continued upward trajectory. Azizov emphasizes that macro fundamentals are also favorable: last year’s halving has restricted supply, while ETF inflows are outpacing mining output. With fewer Bitcoin sitting on exchanges, supply pressure remains low. “The flat now is definitely not the top,” Azizov says. “It’s a pause before a surge—unless something unexpected knocks the market off course.” The post Strategy Bets $764.9M on 7,390 BTC, Doubling Down on Corporate Crypto Crown appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|News|Bitcoin|Michael Saylor|Strategy,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-19 15:34:37

Over time, however, those fundamental incentives have fallen short of what today’s investors require. In 2025, the question for token adoption will be “What concrete utility does this token provide?” rather than “Will this asset pump?” Let’s explore it. Real-world use is the new standard Rather than chasing hype cycles, investors now assess tokens using explicit tokenomics, real-world applications, and strong governance frameworks. Tokens that burn or buy back supply to create scarcity, split platform revenue like dividend-paying equities, or provide holders with genuine voting rights to influence exchange decisions are gaining traction. Tokens, on the other hand, offer little more than fee savings and are swiftly losing popularity. As a result, exchange tokens are transitioning from bonus programs to complex financial products that incorporate components of traditional stocks and profit-sharing structures. What investors seek in 2025 As digital asset markets grow, experienced investors are focusing on four essential characteristics when assessing exchange tokens. First, obvious regulatory compliance is unavoidable. Tokens that operate under recognized licenses and adhere to know-your-customer and anti-money laundering regulations considerably reduce legal concerns. Second, sustainable tokenomics, such as programmed burns or buybacks linked to verifiable on-chain measures, help connect long-term holder incentives with platform performance. Third, genuine governance tools that allow token holders to vote on platform roadmaps, fee structures, and token burn schedules promote community involvement and responsibility. Fourth, cross-protocol utility—whether through bridges to DeFi apps, integration with layer-2 rollups, or collaboration with other blockchain networks—increases demand and liquidity. Exchange tokens that match all of these requirements have the highest chance of prospering despite market fluctuations and regulatory changes. Top exchange tokens gaining traction in 2025 Some long-standing exchange tokens demonstrate how this industry is evolving, each in its own manner. Bitget (BGB) Bitget’s BGB, for example, has established a market niche by focusing on social trading and copy-trading networks throughout Asia. So far, Bitget has burned over 20 million BGB tokens, lowering the supply by over 5%. This, along with its incorporation into both spot and futures markets, has progressively increased BGB’s market share. Gate.io (GT) Gate.io’s GT token has developed a reputation as a sneaky performer. GT increases its practical value by delivering graduated fee discounts to loyal customers and linking to GateChain’s cross-chain bridges, allowing holders to easily shift assets between centralized services and DeFi platforms. KuCoin (KCS) KuCoin’s (KCS) uses a more direct revenue-sharing model. Every day, KuCoin returns fifty percent of its trading-fee profits to KCS holders, a process that has disbursed well over one hundred twenty million dollars in the last year. Quarterly burning linked to platform earnings increases scarcity and community confidence. HTX (HT) HTX’s HT token has been more volatile, but it remains important because of aggressive burn announcements and an increased push into growing regions such as Latin America and Southeast Asia. HT holders now benefit from localized staking pools, occasional NFT drops, and on-chain lottery events designed to rekindle interest and engagement. Each of these tokens represents progress, from basic loyalty rewards to more complicated, financial-like arrangements. However, despite these advancements, only a handful of projects successfully connect traditional financial infrastructure with the decentralized potential of blockchain. That is where MBG hopes to lead. MBG: Combining traditional finance and crypto MBG combines traditional finance and cryptocurrency. Among exchange tokens, MBG stands out for its unique combination of traditional financial infrastructure and blockchain innovation. MBG is backed by MultiBank Group , an organization that processed over $4.5 trillion in trade volume in 2024, giving it a base that few other coins have. MultiBank Group has 17 regulatory licenses from significant jurisdictions, including Dubai’s VARA, Australia’s ASIC, Germany’s BaFin, and Poland’s FIU. This comprehensive compliance network provides the coin with unparalleled legal security for both retail and institutional investors. MBG’s inexpensive design enhances its attractiveness. The platform reserves up to half of its token supply for activity-based buybacks and burns, ensuring that the supply decreases as the platform grows. Holders additionally get monthly distributions of platform income, resulting in an annualized return of 4 to 6 percent. Beyond financial advantages, MBG provides token holders with early access to certain Initial Exchange Offerings and seamlessly interacts with MultiBank’s social-trading environment, allowing users to imitate expert trading methods at preferential rates. By combining fee savings, income, governance, and social trading, MBG delivers a full value offering based on both TradFi rigor and DeFi flexibility. Final word: Creating tokens that last The future of exchange tokens will not be determined by flashy marketing campaigns or short-term reward schemes. Instead, it will rely on confidence built via true benefit, enforceable compliance, and long-term tokenomics. Tokens that embrace these ideas will not only survive the next market collapse but will emerge as key assets in the expanding crypto ecosystem. In 2025, MBG sets a new norm by demonstrating how institutional rigor and blockchain innovation can coexist to produce long-term value. For investors looking for more than just buzz, concentrating on long-term tokens is the best course of action.","Deep Dive - Crypto, Web3 & Market Insights|BGB|MBG",EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BGB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-19 15:44:43
44813416,https://timestabloid.com/?p=67689,1747669549,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,The Inevitable Evolution: How OpenFundNet (OFNT) is Already Hardwired to Become the Gold Standard of Web3 Project Incubation,https://timestabloid.com/the-inevitable-evolution-how-openfundnet-ofnt-is-already-hardwired/,"Beyond Simple Launches: The Critical Need for True Web3 Project Incubation – OFNT Answers the Call In the early days of Web3, launchpads filled a crucial gap—helping projects raise capital quickly. But as the ecosystem evolved, the cracks in this model became clear. Too many projects secured funds without long-term support, community trust, or accountability. What followed were rug pulls, failed products, and investor fatigue. The Web3 world doesn’t just need launchpads. It needs incubators —platforms that guide, challenge, and elevate worthy ideas from seed to maturity. OpenFundNet (OFNT ) is rising as the definitive answer to this call. It doesn’t just host fundraising; it actively shapes the journey of high-potential projects with built-in tools, transparent validation, and economic support systems. It’s a shift from fast funding to sustainable building . Darwin’s Law in Decentralization: Why Previous Funding Models Paved the Way for OFNT’s Superiority Crypto’s earlier funding systems faced the same evolutionary pressure as living organisms. Weak models—ones with high fees, centralized control, and zero post-launch support—couldn’t survive. Projects floundered in environments that rewarded hype over delivery. This survival struggle paved the way for a better system. OpenFundNet didn’t just evolve by chance; it was designed with intention , built on the lessons of past models. It recognizes that success in Web3 depends on transparent governance, robust feedback loops, and investor protections. OFNT fills the evolutionary gap, standing as a next-gen platform built not only to launch but to incubate and refine . “Hardwired for Excellence”: The Intrinsic OFNT Architecture Defining the New Gold Standard At its core, OFNT is more than a crowdfunding portal. It’s a self-regulating ecosystem where every part is engineered to elevate quality and accountability. Its architecture includes a validator scoring system to ensure only credible, vetted projects move forward. Its tokenomics model isn’t just incentive-based—it fosters true community alignment. And its decentralized governance mechanism ensures the platform can evolve with the needs of both builders and backers. These components aren’t add-ons. They are hardwired into OFNT, making it structurally superior for long-term incubation. It’s this integrated design that puts OFNT on a level beyond anything legacy launchpads have offered . The Incubation Engine (Part 1): OFNT’s Validator System – Forging Resilient, High-Caliber Projects The validator network is OFNT’s brain trust—a decentralized set of evaluators that assess projects at every stage. But their role is far deeper than a one-time check. Validators assign quality scores , influence milestone-based funding disbursements, and monitor project progress. This continuous oversight means projects must deliver—not just promise. It turns the funding process into an ongoing meritocracy , encouraging iteration, transparency, and refinement. This vetting mechanism is one of the clearest signs that OFNT isn’t just about raising money. It’s about creating strong, enduring Web3 ventures from the very beginning. The Incubation Engine (Part 2): OFNT’s Economic Alchemy – Zero Fees & Rich Rewards for Sustainable Growth Incubation isn’t just about guidance—it’s also about resources. OFNT’s zero-fee policy allows every dollar raised to be directed into actual development. This removes a major friction point that hinders early-stage growth on traditional platforms. But the brilliance lies in the incentive model. Backers receive project-specific tokens and daily OFNT emissions , ensuring continuous value for their support. Validators, too, are rewarded, creating a healthy, feedback-rich ecosystem where everyone has a stake in project success. By aligning economic rewards with positive project outcomes, OFNT creates a financial structure where growth and sustainability go hand-in-hand .

In a speech published on the SEC’s website, Atkins said the Commission’s previous posture—initially ignoring crypto and then relying heavily on enforcement—had failed to provide clarity and discouraged engagement from legitimate players. “It seemed like a catch-22,” Atkins said. “The message was, ‘You go figure it out.’ That environment did not create trust.” To rebuild that trust, Atkins directed the Division of Corporation Finance to engage more transparently with market participants. He emphasized that while formal crypto rulemaking is underway, interim staff guidance will continue helping firms navigate regulatory uncertainties.

Once viewed as an enforcement channel, FinHub will now focus on fostering innovation and adapting rules to evolving technology. In a notable policy shift, Atkins said he supports allowing registered firms to custody and trade both securities and non-securities within a single entity. He called it an “initial step” toward a “super-app” ecosystem, where investors can access both traditional and digital financial products in one place. The speech signals a strategic pivot for the SEC, as it looks to bring clarity and consistency to crypto regulation without stifling innovation. Still, Atkins noted the agency must remain within its statutory boundaries while using its discretion to modernize oversight. “I believe we can foster innovation while remaining true to our mission,” he said.

The price of Oasis ( ROSE ) declined over 9% in the past 24 hours, trading at lows of $0.0314 as the broader crypto market turned negative. The losses have pushed the ROSE price down more than 22% over the past week. While the altcoin remains in the green on the monthly timeframe, up 68% since hitting lows of $0.019 on April 7, 2025, the current price is over 94% below its all-time high above $0.59. Over the past year, ROSE has fallen more than 63%. A lack of bullish momentum may allow bears to extend the downtrend that began after ROSE reached a high of $0.14 in early December 2024.

For ROSE, the 24-hour trading volume is up 21% to over $17 million. However, derivatives data from Coinglass shows a 12% dip in open interest, suggesting a notably bearish outlook.

Platforms like Uniswap, Aave, and Compound sparked a revolution in lending, trading, and yield farming. Fast forward to 2025, and DeFi 2.0 is taking shape — smarter, faster, and more deeply integrated into both the crypto ecosystem and traditional finance. But to support this evolution, DeFi needs more than new apps.It needs new infrastructure built to scale, interoperate, and connect real-world assets. That’s why the focus has shifted from just dApps to the Layer 1s that can actually run them efficiently. What DeFi 2.0 Demands from Layer 1s DeFi today is more complex than ever. To support institutional liquidity, global retail access, and machine-driven finance (like AI agents), blockchains must now deliver: High throughput for real-time trading Sub-second finality for flash loan and arbitrage execution Ultra-low gas fees for micro-yield strategies Interoperability with stablecoins, RWAs, and multiple ecosystems Composability — the ability for DeFi protocols to build on each other Ethereum can no longer do this alone. Layer 2s are fragmented. So what comes next? A New Foundation for DeFi 2.0: Kaanch Network Kaanch Network, currently in Stage 5 of its presale, is one of the only Layer 1s designed specifically with DeFi’s next phase in mind. Key infrastructure features: ✅ 1.4 Million TPS – Built to handle trading, lending, staking, and tokenization at once✅ 0.8-Second Finality – Perfect for on-chain AMMs and real-time price movement✅ 3600 Validators – Security and decentralization for large-volume DeFi✅ Interoperability – Connects with Ethereum, Solana, BNB, and RWA networks✅ RWA Integration – On-chain real estate, bonds, and more✅ .knch Domains – Simplified DeFi wallet naming + identity tracking✅ DAO Governance – Community-controlled upgrades for protocol evolution✅ Live Staking with up to 119% APY Buy early at:👉 https://presale.kaanch.com The Timing Couldn’t Be Better With the GENIUS Act (stablecoin regulation) gaining traction, and DeFi protocols integrating real-world data and assets, blockchains that support scalable, compliant finance are getting more attention. Kaanch is still in presale, priced at $0.16, with the next stage set to double at $0.32 — making it one of the few early-entry infrastructure plays aligned with DeFi’s next breakout. FAQs What is the best blockchain for DeFi in 2025?Kaanch Network is one of the few Layer 1s purpose-built to power the next evolution of DeFi with speed, interoperability, and real-world integration. Which crypto can grow 100x from here?Kaanch has the right mix of early-stage valuation, real tech, and DeFi-ready architecture putting it in the 100x conversation for this cycle. What’s the best crypto to buy now for yield?Kaanch offers live staking with up to 119% APY, even before listing — making it a strong pick for yield-focused investors. Is DeFi still a good investment narrative?Yes especially with institutional demand growing and stablecoin legislation bringing regulatory clarity. DeFi is maturing, and infrastructure like Kaanch is key to that growth. Where can I buy Kaanch tokens?Presale is open at https://presale.kaanch.com . You can buy with ETH, SOL, BNB, USDT, or card.

This analysis suggests that XRP is poised for significant upward momentum, potentially reaching new all-time highs. Hi Friends, We discussed that XRP has completed the A Wave. Now we are on B Wave. So Wave 2 is in its midway! All Time High is closer than anyone else can think of #XRPCommunity #Ripple #XRPArmy https://t.co/WtuVjBJV2M — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) May 18, 2025 Elliott Wave Analysis and Current Market Position According to Dark Defender, XRP has finalized the first leg of its corrective phase, known as Wave A, and is now navigating through Wave B. This phase is typically characterized by a temporary price increase before the final corrective Wave C. In his May 16 update, Dark Defender identified key support levels at $2.3502 and $2.2222, with resistance levels at $2.58 and $3.3333. He anticipates that after completing the B and C waves, XRP could surge towards the $3.333 mark in the short term. Long-Term Projections and Technical Indicators Beyond the immediate corrective waves, Dark Defender’s analysis extends to more ambitious price targets based on the Elliott Wave Theory. He projects that XRP could reach $5.85 in the third wave, with subsequent waves potentially pushing the price to $18.22 and even $77.7 in the mid to long term. These projections are supported by technical indicators such as Fibonacci extensions and the formation of symmetrical triangle patterns, which often precede significant price movements. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Sentiment and Potential Catalysts The broader market sentiment towards XRP remains cautiously optimistic. While the cryptocurrency has experienced periods of consolidation, the technical patterns identified by analysts like Dark Defender suggest that a breakout could be imminent . Factors such as increased adoption of Ripple’s payment solutions and favorable regulatory developments could serve as catalysts for the anticipated price surges. Dark Defender’s comprehensive analysis of XRP’s price movements through the lens of Elliott Wave Theory provides a structured framework for anticipating future trends. As XRP progresses through its corrective phases, the potential for substantial gains remains, contingent on the confirmation of technical patterns and supportive market conditions.

Amidst this fluctuation, certain lesser-known coins are catching investors' eyes. This article explores why Gala and JasmyCoin are generating buzz and could be poised for significant growth. Is this the right time to consider these emerging contenders? Discover the potential and the reasons behind their rising appeal. GALA: A Surging Month and 6-Month Dip with Defined Price Levels Last month, GALA recorded a robust gain of about 38.67% while the six-month performance slipped nearly 32.48%. The numbers reveal a volatile backdrop where short-term strength contrasts with longer-term weakness. Price movements over these periods highlighted rapid shifts in market mood with clear rallies followed by significant declines, reflecting mixed investor sentiment. Currently, the coin trades between $0.0125 and $0.0202, with near-term resistance at $0.0235 and support at $0.0079. Secondary levels are set at $0.0312 and $0.000211. The slightly elevated RSI near 57 suggests neutrality, yet a one-week drop of 9% indicates some bearish pressure. Traders might consider entering near support and aiming exits close to resistance, balancing short-term caution with potential for a rebound. JasmyCoin: Recent Surge Over a 6-Month Dip JasmyCoin experienced a notable 27.66% monthly gain contrasting a 16.99% decline over the past six months. A short-term pullback of 7.80% in the last week reflects recent volatility. Price action has shown rapid shifts, highlighting aggressive upward movement in the short term while enduring a longer period of softness. The coin’s overall momentum remains mixed, illustrating a dynamic performance pattern. The current price is trading between approximately $0.0099 and $0.0216. Immediate resistance lies around $0.02666, with a second barrier near $0.03840. Support is solid at roughly $0.00318. No clear trend is present, as bulls and bears remain in contention. Traders might consider trading breakouts or reversals near these levels, staying alert to shifts in momentum. Conclusion BTC's fluctuating price offers an interesting chance for those considering alternative coins. Both GALA and JASMY present potential opportunities in this space. GALA stands out with its focus on the gaming market, attracting gamers and developers alike. JASMY emphasizes data management and offers a unique proposition for securely handling information. These coins might be appealing choices for buyers looking for promising projects outside of Bitcoin. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The flagship cryptocurrency held above $103,000 for most of the weekend before moving late on Sunday/early Monday, rising to an intraday high of $106,847 before registering a steep decline and falling below $104,000. BTC is marginally down over the past 24 hours, trading at $103,296. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) extended its losses over the weekend and has dropped nearly 4% over the past 24 hours, slipping below $2,400 to $2,394. Ripple (XRP) is down almost 1%, while Solana (SOL) is down 1.28%, trading around $165. Dogecoin (DOGE) has bucked the bearish trend, up nearly 2%. However, Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Toncoin (TON) , Polkadot (DOT) , and Litecoin (LTC) traded firmly in bearish territory. Australian Authorities Seize Bitcoin, Mansion Linked To Exchange Hack Authorities in Australia have seized Bitcoin, a waterfront mansion, and a Mercedes Benz car allegedly linked to a crypto exchange hack. The AFP-led Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT) issued a statement on May 18 saying it had seized nearly 25 BTC along with the mansion and the car. The total worth of the seizure was 4.5 million Australian Dollars ($2.88 million). The AFP began its investigation into the assets in September after law enforcement agencies in Luxembourg shared details about suspicious Bitcoin transactions. Luxembourg authorities said the transactions were linked to a Queensland individual previously convicted of hacking a US gaming company. The AFP stated their investigation also tied the individual to the theft of 950 BTC from a French crypto exchange in 2013. However, no criminal charges were brought over the theft of Bitcoin. According to local agencies, the owner of the assets is Shane Stephen Duffy, who pleaded guilty to fraud and computer hacking in 2016 and selling data of League of Legends players. However, prosecutors did not convict Duffy of the attack, stating he received a copy of the data online and sold it for profit. Duffy was also accused of hacking the X account of Riot Games President Marc Merrill to publicize his data-selling business. AFP Commander Jason Kennedy stated, “The profits derived from criminal activities are also often used to fund further criminal acts, which is why the AFP works closely with our partners in the CACT to target the proceeds of crime and ensure they are reinvested in the community.” Crypto Firms In The UK Must Report Customer Transactions Crypto companies operating in the UK must collect and report data from every trade and transfer beginning January 2026 as part of an effort to improve tax reporting. According to a UK Revenue and Customs Department statement, crypto firms must collect the user’s full name, home address, and tax identification number for every transaction, including the cryptocurrency used and the amount moved. The statement added that failure to comply with the directive will incur penalties of up to 300 British pounds per user. The department stated it would inform companies on how to comply with the incoming guidelines. The new rules are part of the UK’s integration of the Organization for Economic Development’s Crypto Asset Reporting Framework, designed to improve transparency and efficiency in crypto tax reporting. The changes reflect the government’s aim to establish a robust regulatory environment supporting growth while ensuring consumer protection. The UK’s move to integrate crypto rules into its existing financial framework is in stark contrast with the EU’s approach. The EU introduced the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation framework last year. VCs View Stablecoins Positively The latest Pitchbook report on crypto VC trends has revealed their overwhelmingly positive views on stablecoins. The report stated, “Dollar-denominated settlement remains crypto’s killer application, insulated—at least partially—from broader risk-off moves. Our expectations remain that VC investments in the near term could see a step-up increase, especially in payment, remittance, and treasury-management startups that directly monetize stablecoin velocity.” However, the report stated that VCs will commit more to the crypto industry only if it works to address growing security concerns. These concerns were amplified by the recent Bybit hack. The report also predicted that institutional investors would begin demanding real-time proof of real-time proof-of-reserve tooling and middleware that “abstracts” away key-management complexity. The report also highlighted a decline in retail speculation, leading to a substantial loss in meme coin volumes, especially on Solana. The drop in retail interest has led to a significant drop in investment in prominent meme coins. The report added that Circle’s upcoming IPO could create significant crypto liquidity and potentially validate the stablecoin model. “Taken together, Q1 2025 was a quarter of consolidation rather than capitulation. Market beta turned negative, but venture-relevant signals—stablecoin growth, infrastructure de-risking, and a credible IPO pipeline—remain intact.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin’s (BTC) weekend calm was broken on Sunday when the flagship cryptocurrency unexpectedly jumped over 3%, catching the markets off guard. However, what followed next was even stranger, as the price dropped back, falling to a low of $102,145 before moving to its current levels above $103,000. The sudden increase saw over $460 million in long positions wiped out. The price jump took BTC just shy of its all-time high before it fell back to current levels. Economists have stated that BTC’s current price levels are due to growing institutional interest and sustained inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. Analysts believe the current price levels are sustained by strong inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, which registered $2.8 billion in net inflows in May, taking the total value past $122 billion. Singapore-based QCP Capital stated in a note to investors, “Looking ahead, we believe there is further room for digital assets to rally, especially as Coinbase’s inclusion into the S&P 500 on May 19 draws closer. History tells us that index inclusion tends to act as a short-term catalyst, as passive managers adjust their allocations to track the benchmark more closely.” A positive economic outlook has also helped BTC maintain its current price levels. The Federal Reserve has kept its benchmark interest rates unchanged at 4.25% to 4.50%, maintaining a cautious stance. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said that the Fed is prepared to respond to evolving data but has offered no imminent shift in policy due to inflation concerns. BTC’s price action has been subdued after its May 8 rally, when it surged past $100,000 and settled at $103,093. The rally lost momentum on Friday, registering a marginal decline, slipping below $103,000 and settling at $102,851. The price recovered on Saturday, rising 1.72% and settling at $103,617. However, it was back in the red on Sunday, dropping nearly 1% and ending the weekend on a bearish note at $103,802. BTC encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC dropped 1.04% and settled at $102,728. Source: TradingView The price rebounded on Tuesday, rising 1.36% to reclaim $104,000 and settle at $104,123, but was back in the red on Wednesday, falling 0.53% to $103,568. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday but rebounded to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. However, sellers were back in control on Friday as BTC registered a marginal decline to $103,545. Price action remained muted on Saturday as BTC registered another marginal decline and settled at $103,235. Price action turned bullish on Sunday as BTC rallied over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,479. However, the flagship cryptocurrency has lost momentum during the ongoing session and is down nearly 3%, having slipped below $105,000 and trading around $103,275. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) continued its downward trajectory, starting the new week in the red after experiencing volatility on Sunday. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency lost momentum after failing to move past the 200-day SMA on Tuesday (May 13) and has continued to trade downwards as buyers struggled to reclaim momentum. ETH must reclaim and close above $2,450 to prevent a decline to $2,000. Additionally, if the price fails to clear the $2,500 mark, it could indicate a fresh decline, with sellers already gaining the upper hand. However, if buyers regain momentum and break above $2,500, ETH could push towards $3,000. ETH registered a stunning rally on Thursday, rising nearly 22%, surging past $2,000 and settling at $2,206. The price raced to an intraday high of $2,489 on Friday but failed to stay at that level, ultimately settling at $2,345. Bullish sentiment intensified on Saturday as ETH rose over 10%, crossing $2,500 and settling at $2,585. Despite the positive sentiment, ETH lost momentum on Sunday, dropping to a low of $2,437 before settling at $2,514, ultimately registering a decline of $2,514. ETH encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers gained the upper hand as the price registered a marginal decline, slipping below $2,500 and settling at $2,496. Source: TradingView Despite the volatile start to the week, ETH rebounded on Tuesday, rising over 7%, surging past $2,600 and settling at $2,691. ETH could not push higher as selling pressure overwhelmed buyers. As a result, ETH dropped nearly 3% on Wednesday and settled at $2,610. Sellers retained control on Thursday as the price fell 2.38%, slipping below $2,600 and settling at $2,548. ETH rose to an intraday high of $2,648 on Friday as buyers attempted to regain control. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and fell to $2,537 after a marginal decline. The price continued to drop on Saturday, dropping 2.44%, slipping below the key $2,500 level and settling at $2,475. ETH encountered volatility on Sunday, plunging to an intraday low of $2,326 and rising to an intraday high of $2,586 before ultimately registering a marginal increase and settling at $2,498. The current session sees ETH down nearly 4% as sellers look to drive ETH toward $2,200. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) has dipped back into the red during the ongoing session after ending the weekend with an increase of nearly 5%. Analysts believe SOL is showing early signs of a breakdown after dipping below $165 during the ongoing session. SOL was rejected from the $180-$185 levels on May 14, declining nearly 10% until Saturday. However, it rebounded after finding support around $160 and the 200-day EMA. If SOL continues its decline and slips below $150, the price could see a retest of the support around $145 and the 50-day SMA. SOL registered a significant increase on Thursday (May 8), rising nearly 12% to cross $160 and settling at $164. Buyers retained control on Friday as the price registered an increase of over 5%, crossing $170 and settling at $172. SOL continued to push higher on Saturday, increasing nearly 3% and settling at $177. Despite the positive sentiment, SOL registered a notable decline on Sunday, falling almost 3% and settling at $173. SOL experienced volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a marginal increase and settled at $174.

SOL lost momentum on Wednesday as sellers overwhelmed buyers. As a result, the price plunged nearly 4%, slipping below $180 and settling at $176. SOL continued to drop on Thursday, falling 4.28%, slipping below $170 and settling at $169. Price action remained bearish on Friday and Saturday, dropping 0.98% and 0.89% to settle at $165. Despite overwhelming selling pressure, SOL rebounded on Sunday, rising 4.45% to reclaim $170 and settle at $173. However, the price plummeted during the ongoing session and dropped over 7% to its current level of $161. A drop below $160 could see SOL plunge below $150. A bearish MACD suggests sellers have the upper hand. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) also registered a notable jump on Thursday (May 8) after President Trump announced the US-UK trade deal. As a result, the price rallied over 9%, surging past the 20 and 50-day SMAs and settling at $2.32. The price reached an intraday high of $2.42 on Friday but dropped to settle at $2.34.

Aptos (APT) Price Analysis Aptos (APT) lost momentum after crossing $6 on Tuesday as markets turned bearish. The price registered a significant rally last Thursday, rising over 14%, surging past the 20 and 50-day SMAs and settling at $5.48. APT rose to an intraday high of $5.85 on Friday but could not stay at that level and ultimately settled at $5.58.

The coin experienced a 9.7% drop from $0.237 to $0.214 before buyers stepped in at key support levels. This buying pressure has created what analysts describe as a ""panic zone retest"" around the $0.215 mark, which has so far held firm against selling pressure. Market structure indicates DOGE is currently navigating a falling wedge pattern, typically considered a bullish reversal formation when broken to the upside. The Ichimoku cloud on short-term charts shows price lodged in equilibrium territory, with multiple technical indicators converging to create tight reference levels between $0.212 and $0.225. For traders, the immediate focus remains on whether DOGE can break above the descending trendline resistance near $0.219-$0.220. A decisive move above this level could target the $0.235-$0.244 range, while failure to hold current support might see prices retreat toward $0.20 or even $0.185 in the near term. Technical Analysis Highlights DOGE formed a descending channel with clear resistance at the $0.235 level, where selling pressure consistently emerged. A notable support zone developed around $0.215-$0.217, confirmed by increased volume during the 13:00 hour. V-shaped reversal pattern formed with the bottom at $0.215 around 13:14, followed by steady accumulation. Volume significantly increased to over 10 million units around 13:30, triggering a sharp upward movement. New support zone established at $0.218, with multiple high-volume candles confirming strong buying interest. Overall price action suggests bearish momentum with intermittent consolidation phases.

Some quietly build traction through product delivery, real adoption, and community trust before the wider market even notices. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one such project. Despite raising over $8.6 million in its presale and securing more than 10,000 holders, it still trades for just $0.025. That combination of low price and visible traction is raising eyebrows—and for good reason. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum isn’t another empty-name token banking on trends. It’s developing a non-custodial protocol where users can lend and borrow assets in two distinct ways—Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P)—giving them more flexibility, control, and earning potential. In the P2C model, lenders deposit crypto into a shared pool. For example, someone supplying $10,000 in ETH would receive mtETH, a token that grows in value over time based on borrower activity. Those mtTokens can be held or even used elsewhere in DeFi, all while passively generating interest. On the borrowing side, users can access funds by locking up overcollateralized assets. For instance, a trader holding ETH could borrow stablecoins without selling their ETH—preserving exposure while unlocking liquidity. Repayments can be made anytime, and the position stays open as long as the collateral ratio is healthy. In the P2P system, users negotiate loan terms directly. This feature is especially useful for more volatile or niche tokens—such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) or Pepe (PEPE)—which may not be included in the main liquidity pools. It gives Mutuum the flexibility to support a wider range of assets, something most DeFi platforms aren’t built to handle efficiently. A Presale That’s Attracting Real Capital The current presale is in Phase 4, and over 88% of this round is already sold. The price remains fixed at $0.025, but that will increase by 20% in the next phase. The final listing is confirmed at $0.06, meaning early buyers are locking in access at less than half the exchange price. What makes this presale even more impressive is how grounded the project remains in real development. While others focus on speculative hype, MUTM is gaining traction through measured progress and consistent funding—traits that are often missing in early-stage tokens. Unlike many projects that inflate token supply with unsustainable rewards, Mutuum Finance takes a different approach. A portion of the platform’s fees is used to buy back MUTM tokens on the open market, which are then redistributed to users who actively participate. This creates real demand, avoids excessive dilution, and incentivizes long-term participation—an appealing setup for those who want more than just short-term gains. Mutuum’s development roadmap includes the rollout of a beta version of its platform, planned to go live shortly after the token listing. This early access will include core features like lending, borrowing, and mtToken functionality. Alongside that, the team is working to implement a Layer 2 integration, reducing fees and increasing speed for all transactions. This makes the system more scalable and accessible, especially for users looking to avoid costly gas fees. There’s also the upcoming launch of an overcollateralized stablecoin, which will be fully backed by assets deposited in the Mutuum protocol. This will further extend the ecosystem’s capabilities while reinforcing long-term utility for both borrowers and lenders. Investors are often left wondering what crypto to buy now or how to identify the next big cryptocurrency before it’s discovered by the mainstream. MUTM stands out because it checks boxes most early-stage tokens don’t: real features, active development, steady funding, and a clear path to rollout. The presale pricing still leaves room for strong upside, but that window is closing quickly. With a jump in price coming in the next phase and more features rolling out soon, interest is building—quietly but consistently. Mutuum Finance may not be making headlines—yet—but the fundamentals say it should be. With strong tokenomics, an evolving DeFi framework, and a growing presale, MUTM is shaping up to be more than just another early-stage project. And for those who spot value early, it may just turn out to be the best crypto to buy now—before the rest of the market catches on.

Murray goes after Moody, brands it a ‘lagging indicator’ after US credit downgrade",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-appointees-go-after-moody-indicator/,"Trump’s administration has once again downplayed concerns over the US economy. In response to Moody’s ratings, the US credit rating was lowered from AAA to Aa1. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the rankings were a “lagging indicator.” In an interview, Bessent said, “I think that Moody’s is a lagging indicator I think that’s what everyone thinks of credit agencies.” According to him, Biden’s administration is to blame. He said that the downgrade was because of the Biden administration’s spending policies, which they had defended as investments in things like fighting climate change and making sure more people could get health insurance. The US owes $36.22 trillion in debt. It started steadily rising in the 1980s and kept going up during both President Trump’s first term and the government of former President Joe Biden. Government spending fell, and imports increased as firms raced to get goods into the country ahead of tariffs. In fact, according to the Commerce Department, the economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3%. This was a sharp downturn after growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter. Recession talks resurface Bessent said that the rest of the World doesn’t care. He pointed to Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar. He said that they are bringing money into the US. However, Dems care. They have found another reason to attack Trump’s administration. Brendan Francis Boyle, a member of the US House Committee on the Budget, said, “This downgrade is a direct warning: our fiscal outlook is deteriorating, and House Republicans are determined to make it worse.” He said the US is in a mess because of Trump’s reckless tariffs. In addition, Sen. Chris Murphy criticized Bessent’s comments about the credit downgrade. He said, “I heard the treasury secretary say, ‘Who cares about the downgrading of our credit rating from Moody’s?’ That is a big deal.” According to him, the downgrade means that the US is likely headed for a recession. This translates to higher interest rates for anybody out there who is trying to start a business or buy a home. He added, “These guys are running the economy recklessly because all they care about is the health of the Mar-a-Lago billionaire class.” Moody’s said that by 2035, the government debt will have grown from 98% of GDP last year to about 134% of GDP. However, they said that the US retains exceptional credit strengths such as size, resilience and dynamism and the continued role of the US dollar as the global reserve currency. On the other hand, republicans are using this to show the importance of getting rid of the US deficits. Rep.Ralph Norman of South Carolina insisted on cutting down the budget because of Moody’s ratings. He said, “Moody’s just stripped America of its last AAA credit rating. This is exhibit A for why we need budget hawks in Congress.” After Moody’s DOWNGRADES the United States’ credit rating from Aaa to Aa1 – the first U.S. credit downgrade in the agency’s history – the Trump Distraction Machine works the overnight shift. pic.twitter.com/00HdipW46g — Greta (@GretaGrace20) May 19, 2025 Meanwhile, Trump has not shown concern. He is, rather, speaking on investigating candidates’ endorsements in connection to Bruce Springsteen, who reportedly branded the Trump administration corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous. Moody’s rankings will not have a lasting impact on the markets The markets have responded to Moody’s downgrade differently. Dow E-minis were down 0.61%. S&P 500 E-minis were down 1.05%, and Nasdaq 100 was down 1.42%. At the same time, yields on U.S. government bonds went up slightly. The 10-year note’s yield rose 10.9 basis points to 4.54%, and the 30-year note’s yield reached 5.02%. Technology stocks are worth a lot, but they lost value before the market opened because rising rates make future gains less valuable now. With a drop of 3.4%, Tesla had the biggest drop of all the megacap and growth stocks. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The XRP price reacted mildly to the futures launch as it dropped to $2.33, down by 12.25% from its highest point this month. This decline was in line with the ongoing crypto market crash and the fact that the launch was already priced in.

At this point, Russia is tightening its control over the crypto sector, even as it begins to use Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in international payments. According to Bloomberg, the Central Bank of Russia’s digital asset regulations, which are expected to come into effect next week, May 26, are expected to seriously affect Tether (USDT) trading within the country and impose restrictions on USDT access. The new digital asset regulations reportedly include: “a ban on digital assets issued by unfriendly countries, only allowing digital assets from friendly countries, and a ban on tokens that can be blocked or taken by issuers or payment agents.” At this point, it is thought that Russian companies can continue to use stablecoins such as USDT for cross-border payments, but the use of USDT in local payments is too risky and restrictions may be imposed. Experts even state that the use of USDT may be banned in Russia due to new regulations. “Tether may be banned for use within Russia, as it does not meet the requirements of Russia's new digital asset regulations. However, stablecoins are not prohibited for use in international payments,” said Mikhail Uspensky, a member of the Russian Virtual Asset Regulatory Committee. *This is not investment advice.

Explosive 2-Week Rally Has Traders Watching Closely,https://cryptonews.com/news/explosive-2-week-pepe-price-rally-has-traders-eying-next/,"PEPE has seen a surge in trader activity over the past two weeks, with record participation levels suggesting it’s becoming the go-to meme coin for speculative momentum plays. Despite being 14% below its $0.0000154 high just a week ago, it still boasts a 67% gain over the past two weeks, positioning it as one of the best cryptos to buy over the period. While US inflation data printed better than expected in April, Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s hesitance towards rate cuts has left the market in a state of cautious optimism. Open Interest Hits Record High: Is This the Meme Coin Play? According to Coinglass data , open interest in PEPE has surged to record highs over the past two weeks, exceeding post-inauguration rally levels at $583 million.

With recent FUD easing, the door has opened to bullishness, attracting fresh retail liquidity. However, after last week’s mass liquidations, traders seem more cautious about near-term gains. The 24-hour long/short ratio has now fallen below 1 at 0.9516 alongside the $85 million in open interest added during Monday trading—more traders are shorting the Pepe Price. PEPE Price Analysis: Is a 10x Realistic? The PEPE price appears to be amid a correction, retracing alongside the RSI after a stint along the oversold threshold at 70, an indication of exhausted buying pressure. PEPE / USDT 1-day chart, potential correction. Source: TradingView / Binance. More critically, the MACD line is on the verge of a death cross, preparing to fall below the signal line. On the daily time frame, this setup often signals short-term declines. A retest of the $1 resistance zone as support could mark the correction’s bottom. This aligns with the 0.5 Fib retracement level, which often marks correction bottoms—a potential 19% decline from current levels. Looking further, PEPE appears to be echoing the descending channel breakout pattern that led to its 265% surge to a new all-time high. While a 10x may not be realistic this year, PEPE could aim for a 230% surge to $0.00042 if history repeats. This top aligns with the long-term resistance zone that has capped highs since mid-2024.

Roxom TV is a relatively new media platform that focuses on Bitcoin ( BTC ) news, culture, and education. It was founded by crypto entrepreneurs ​​Borja and Helena Martel Seward in November 2024 and established its presence on YouTube shortly after. Still no ETA. Still no human review of our account. It’s been two days. @YouTube removed our channel with zero strikes and no explanation. We stream Bitcoin educational content 24/7. That’s the “dangerous content.” Catch us on @rumblevideo . @chrispavlovski https://t.co/AFxrhOUJ6c — Roxom TV (@RoxomTV) May 16, 2025 Roxom TV Speaks Out About YouTube Ban Alex McShane, director of Bitcoin strategy at Roxom TV, told Cryptonews that no clear explanation was given as to why the channel was removed by YouTube. “Our transcripts from recent shows we’ve published don’t align with the reasons listed in the emails sent to us by YouTube,” McShane said. According to the email from YouTube, Roxom TV violated YouTube’s “harmful and dangerous content” policy. Source: Roxom TV After appealing the decision, Roxom TV received another email from YouTube that stated the channel continues to violate policy and will not be put back on the platform. With little communication from YouTube, McShane explained that he can only guess the ban was automatically issued by a bot that mistakenly viewed the channel as promoting cryptocurrency projects . “I think this was an automatic ban triggered by bot moderation, not understanding satire or mistaking our coverage of crypto scams and hacks as promoting them somehow, but it’s really hard to say,” he said. McShane added that Roxom TV streamed live content on YouTube most of the time, which could have made the algorithm more sensitive, particularly to Roxom’s live political coverage featuring Bitcoin. While Roxom TV’s YouTube channel remains banned, McShane is confident it will be placed back on the platform. “But we need a manual human appeal review; so far we’ve only had bots reviewing our appeal, which was auto denied,” he remarked. YouTube Cracks Down on Gambling Content: Does Crypto Qualify? While Roxom TV is the most recent Bitcoin-focused channel to be removed from YouTube, the platform underwent a “crypto-purge” in December 2019. Sources note that at least 35 crypto-focused channels were impacted during the purge, including popular shows like Bad Crypto Podcast and Altcoin Daily . Additional channels from major media outlets Bankless and Cointelegraph were also removed around this time, but have since been put back on YouTube. The Bankless @YouTube account 'has been terminated' No warning. No notification. No justification 150,000 subs 10,000+ hours of content Hey @YouTube , our community would like a word! RETWEET to let YouTube hear you: It’s not okay to ban crypto content pic.twitter.com/MJQ4MGwtYD — Bankless (@BanklessHQ) May 8, 2022 A CNBC TV18 article states that channels were removed for violating community guidelines, but that the removal of the content was actually due to machine learning algorithms. While this likely was the case in December 2019, YouTube has recently taken steps to crack down on gambling-related content . On March 4, YouTube sent out a public statement warning against promoting gambling sites or related content. YouTube also made it clear that it may take down videos that “promise guaranteed returns.” McShane was made aware of this statement and noted that YouTube’s message to Roxom TV made no mention of violating these terms specifically. YouTube Algorithm Triggers However, YouTube’s algorithm may be unable to detect the differences between crypto and gambling content . This may also be due to certain words or instances that can trigger these algorithms. Nikki Martinez, head of short form video content at Hype, told Cryptonews that she has seen creators’ content get flagged or shadowbanned for using certain trigger words or phrases. Martinez currently works with a global network of creators at Hype to produce content for crypto clients at scale. “One time, I was even shadowbanned on social media platform TikTok for talking about why one of my accounts was banned,” Martinez stated. Martinez added that TikTok’s moderation system can flag videos that sound like “guaranteed income,” “easy money,” “instant payout,” or even token names. She noted that the platform will automatically label these videos as scams or misleading financial advice. “The moderation is largely automated and tends to overcorrect, removing or limiting content based on certain keywords or context,” she pointed out. “Even links can be flagged as suspicious, especially when posted by new accounts.” Martinez also explained that most video platforms, like YouTube, don’t want creators driving users off the platform, especially when it comes to financial products. Fortunately, both TikTok and YouTube offer users an option to appeal. “I’ve seen creators successfully appeal takedowns and go on to reach 1M+ views after their content was reinstated,” Martinez said. “But these bans are becoming more common as TikTok, YouTube, and Meta face increasing pressure to regulate financial content globally, especially in industries like crypto that are still unregulated in many regions.” Tips For Crypto Creators Using Centralized Social Media Platforms Given recent crackdowns on crypto-related content , McShane noted it’s important for Web3 creators to support decentralized protocols like Nostr or Calaxy where content cannot be censored. Yet given the reach of YouTube and TikTok, many content creators may want to continue using these platforms. In this case, Martinez suggests that creators sharing crypto content be mindful of financial language. “Success on TikTok often comes down to how you say something. Subtle narratives like ‘side hustles,’ ‘digital income,’ or phrasing like ‘withdraw once approved’ (instead of ‘instant payout’) tend to perform better and avoid violations,” she remarked. Martinez further pointed out that some centralized social media platforms are more crypto-friendly than others. “X (Twitter) is by far the most open and effective for crypto content. But if you’re posting about unregulated industries on Instagram, TikTok or YouTube, it’s essential to build a presence elsewhere too – email lists, gated communities, or Telegram/Discord. You never want to be dependent on one platform,” she said.“ Martinez believes that content creators who will win long term are the ones who can tell crypto stories in a way that feels accessible, culturally relevant, and algorithm safe. Wendy O—a popular crypto-content creator with about 2050 subscribers on YouTube—told Cryptonews that her channel has never been banned by YouTube. Her advice to other creators is “to read the centralized platform’s policy, disclose and be cautious on verbiage.” The post YouTube Axes Roxom TV, Sparking Fresh Fears of Bitcoin Content Crackdown appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|News|Bitcoin|Decentralization|Social media,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-19 16:05:40

However, its struggles at higher levels continued as it lost momentum after reaching this level and declined substantially during the ongoing session. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours, trading around the $103,000 mark. Strategy Acquires 7,390 BTC, Reveals Class-Action Lawsuit Michael Saylor’s Strategy completed the acquisition of 7,390 Bitcoin last week for nearly $765 million. According to the announcement, the company purchased the Bitcoin for $764.9 million at an average price of just under $103,500 per coin. Strategy also reported a Bitcoin yield of 16.3% year-to-date. Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor had hinted at the purchase in a cryptic post on May 18. The company’s May 19 filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also revealed it was the subject of a class-action lawsuit. The lawsuit accuses Strategy officials of misrepresenting the nature of their Bitcoin investments. 0xngmi, a pseudo-anonymous developer at DefiLlama, stated, “The lawsuit seems to be people complaining that Microstrategy understated how much money it could lose if BTC went down, but if you're buying a company that is self-labeled as leverage on Bitcoin, what do you expect? It's pretty clear what will happen if BTC goes down.” The lawsuit accuses Strategy officials of violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. “The [suit claims] that the named defendants made false and/or misleading statements with respect to and/or failed to disclose information with respect to the anticipated profitability of our Bitcoin-focused investment strategy and treasury operations, and the various risks associated with bitcoin’s volatility.” Strategy holds 576,230 BTC as of May 18, acquired for around $40.2 billion at an average price of $69,726 per coin. The firm’s total Bitcoin holdings are valued at nearly $60 billion at current prices. Bitcoin Risks $100,000 Breakdown Bitcoin has registered one of its largest daily declines during the ongoing session, with the price down over 3%. The price fell to a low of $102,145 before rebounding to reclaim $103,000. The marketwide decline was prompted by Moody’s downgrade of the US credit rating thanks to a growing budget deficit and the absence of a credible fiscal consolidation plan. Analysts believe the flagship cryptocurrency’s decline may confirm a bearish divergence and raise the prospect of a breakdown below $100,000. BTC jumped to a local high of $107,111 during the ongoing session but rapidly declined, with its RSI printing a lower high and hinting at a classic bearish divergence. Analysts from Swissblocks noted that Bitcoin grabbed liquidity around the $104,000-$106,000 levels but failed to sustain momentum. As a result, it faced another rejection at higher levels, putting its immediate support levels at $100,000 and $97,000 under pressure. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has exhibited cautious optimism over the past two sessions, rising over 3% on Sunday and crossing $107,000 during the ongoing session. However, it failed to maintain its position above this level and plunged below $104,000. Analysts believe BTC must consolidate above $103,000 before it can breach the wall of resistance above $105,000-$106,000. Additionally, its performance also depends on US stock indices. A pullback in US markets could delay BTC’s recovery. Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus Crypto Platform, stated, “If Bitcoin decisively breaks $107,000, aided by strong ETF inflows, it would lead to new highs for Bitcoin, with strong rallies expected among altcoins. Until then, traders are advised to minimize their losses and be ready to deploy cash in case of a breakout.” According to analysts, two factors were behind BTC’s jump on Sunday. The first is a proposal by President Trump to levy a 5% tax on remittances sent by individuals to their home countries. The proposal impacts 40 million people who wire a part of their income to their families living abroad. Analysts have warned that such a move could drive people to unofficial channels, including crypto. Another reason is an upcoming bill that proposes stablecoin regulation, set to be taken up by Congress this week. Republican Senator Bill Hagerty stated, “Next week, the Senate will make history when we debate and pass the Genius Act that establishes the first-ever pro-growth regulatory framework for payment stablecoins.” The sudden increase saw over $460 million in long positions wiped out. Economists have stated that BTC’s current price levels are due to growing institutional interest and sustained inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. Analysts believe the current price levels are sustained by strong inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, which registered $2.8 billion in net inflows in May, taking the total value past $122 billion. Singapore-based QCP Capital stated in a note to investors, “Looking ahead, we believe there is further room for digital assets to rally, especially as Coinbase’s inclusion into the S&P 500 on May 19 draws closer. History tells us that index inclusion tends to act as a short-term catalyst, as passive managers adjust their allocations to track the benchmark more closely.” BTC registered a substantial increase on Thursday (May 8), rising over 6% to cross $100,000 and settle at $103,093. The rally lost momentum on Friday as the price registered a marginal decline and settled at $102,851. Buyers returned to the market on Saturday as BTC rose nearly 2% and settled at $104,617. Despite a positive Saturday, the flagship cryptocurrency was back in the red on Sunday, dropping nearly 1% and settling at $103,802. BTC encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC dropped 1.04% and settled at $102,728. Source: TradingView BTC rebounded on Tuesday, rising 1.36% to $104,123, but fell back on Wednesday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $103,568. The price fell to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday but rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. Price action turned bearish on Friday and Saturday as BTC registered marginal declines and settled at $103,235. Bullish sentiment returned on Sunday as the price rallied over 3% to cross $103,000 and settle at $106,479. The current session sees BTC down nearly 3%, recovering from a low of $102,145 to trade around $104,300. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Despite the recent 13.81% dip, bullish momentum remains intact as price approaches a key support confluence. Moo Deng ( MOODENG ) has seen a sharp but expected correction after a strong weekend rally that pushed price into resistance. This pullback is not a sign of weakness but rather a natural breather in what continues to be a bullish trend. As price retraces, attention now turns to a key technical zone that could offer the perfect setup for the next leg higher. Key technical points Current Correction: Moo Deng has pulled back 13.81% from the local high after hitting resistance at the 0.618 Fibonacci. Support Zone: Price is approaching a confluence of key levels: the 0.618 Fibonacci, 200 MA, and high time frame range support. Bullish Setup: A bounce from this area would likely form a higher low in the current uptrend and could trigger a move back to $0.31 and potentially $0.35. MooDeng USDT (1H) Chart, Source: TradingView After rallying aggressively from weekend lows, Moo Deng faced technical resistance at a key Fibonacci level, which halted the bullish momentum and triggered a corrective phase. This move, however, fits the structure of a bullish trend, where pullbacks are expected and even healthy to sustain long-term gains. A drop of nearly 14% might seem concerning on the surface, but the underlying structure remains constructive. The current retracement is bringing Moo Deng into a support-rich zone. The 0.618 Fibonacci level is overlapping with the 200-day moving average, a historically strong area where buyers often step in. Additionally, this zone sits within a broader trading range between key support and resistance on the higher time frames, increasing the chances of a strong reaction. You might also like: Crypto bull run intact despite weekend volatility in Bitcoin If Moo Deng holds this level and forms a higher low, it will confirm continued strength in the existing bullish market structure. Such a move would establish a deviation beneath resistance and offer technical confirmation that the correction is ending, with price gearing up for another push higher. What to expect in the coming price action If support holds and a higher low forms, Moo Deng is likely to resume its uptrend and retest previous resistance levels at $0.31 and $0.35. The bullish structure remains valid, and continuation to the upside could unfold quickly once momentum returns.

In April, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rebounded to reclaim the $90,000 mark showing its resilience during a wobbly economic period triggered by tariff concerns.

In May so far, it has already climbed above the $100K mark. According to Standard Chartered , Bitcoin could reach new all-time highs of around $120K in Q2, don the back of a broad asset reallocation away from U.S. assets as well as several technical indicators.

One popular trader sold their “spot bag” and is now looking for re-entry options. The Necessary Condition Solana’s SOL has been in a downtrend in the past week and is far from its all-time high registered in January this year. As of this writing, it trades at around $161, representing a 45% decline from the historic peak. However, some analysts believe a renewed rally might be knocking on the door. The popular X user Ali Martinez claimed that a breakout above the resistance level of $176-$188 could ignite a fresh bull run. Earlier this month, he disclosed that the number of wallets holding at least 0.1 SOL has soared above 11 million in the span of just two weeks. This development indicates growing participation in the ecosystem, while the minor threshold hints that most newcomers are likely retail investors. Martinez isn’t the only renowned analyst to give his two cents on the topic. The X user Cas Abbe reminded about SOL’s crash in April, outlining that the price has climbed by over 50% since then, “while its fundamentals are getting better.” They think the ATH registered at the start of 2025 was not the cycle top for Solana, envisioning a new peak sometime this year. Mags chipped in, too, suggesting that SOL’s monthly chart “is forming a massive ascending triangle pattern.” That said, the analyst expects that a breakout beyond $267 could trigger “a massive leg up” to uncharted territory. The Next Buying Opportunity? Another X user who weighed in recently is XO. Earlier this month, they shared their trading history, which included a big sell-off approximately a week ago when the price was above $180. As it turned out, this was the trader’s entire “spot bag.” They now explore new buying opportunities that might occur in the next weeks or months. XO described the $140-$150 zone as an “immediate level of interest,” adding that $120 “isn’t out of the question.” Subsequently, the trader assumed that Solana’s future price dynamics may heavily depend on what bitcoin does next.

We checked if these gambling sites had a solid variety to keep things interesting. That means a good mix of slot machines, classic table games like blackjack and roulette, video poker games for those who like a bit of strategy, and a decent selection of live dealer games to bring that real casino vibe home. Since we are ranking gambling sites, we also considered sports betting markets. Payment Methods Since we're talking about the best crypto casinos, the range of accepted cryptocurrencies was a big one. The more options like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and others, the better for flexibility. We also noted if they made crypto transactions smooth and easy. We looked for gambling websites that process payouts quickly, especially for crypto. Instant or near-instant crypto transactions are a major win in our book. Bonuses and Promotions Bonuses are freebies, and who doesn’t want them? So, we looked into the welcome bonuses and other ongoing promos these top online casinos in Canada have for crypto players. Fair wagering requirements and clear terms and conditions were also crucial. A massive bonus doesn't mean much if it's impossible to actually cash out. We wanted to see crypto casino bonuses that offer real value to players. User Interface A clunky website or app can ruin the whole experience. We looked for Bitcoin gambling Canada sites that are easy to navigate, look decent on both desktop and mobile (mobile gambling is huge, after all), and have games that load quickly. Customer Support When things go sideways, good customer support is essential. We checked for the availability of live chat, email support, and a helpful FAQ section. Quick and friendly responses from support teams were a big plus. Safety of Crypto Gambling Sites in Canada The safety of crypto gambling sites in Canada isn't a straightforward yes or no. Like any online gambling platform, the level of security can vary significantly. That’s why you must take the time to look into any online casino you’d like to sign up with. While reviews like ours help, it’s also best to check what other casino players have to say. Feel free to check sites like Trustpilot or Reddit for this. But if you really only want to deal with safe and legit online Bitcoin casinos, you can never go wrong with our top picks like Wild.io, 7Bit, Cloudbet, MyStake, and Goldenbet. How to Tell if a Bitcoin Gambling Site is Legit Now, figuring out if a Bitcoin gambling site is on the level requires a bit of digging. Here’s what to look for to separate the good from the bad: • Valid License: A legitimate online casino will hold a license from a recognized regulatory authority. Look for licenses from bodies like the Malta Gaming Authority or Curacao eGaming. Licensing information is usually found in the footer of the casino site.• Strong Security Measures: Look for SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption, which makes it impossible or at least harder for unauthorized parties to intercept information. They should also have clear policies on data protection and privacy.• Provably Fair Games: For crypto casinos, the availability of provably fair games can only be good. These systems use transparent algorithms that allow you to verify the randomness and fairness of each game outcome. Why Crypto is the Safest Way to Gamble So, why should you be using crypto to gamble online anyway? What makes it safe? Here’s what you should know: • Better Privacy: Crypto transactions generally offer more anonymity than traditional bank transfers or credit card use. While not entirely untraceable, they don't directly link your gambling activity to your personal banking details.• Reduced Risk of Fraud: Crypto transactions are secured by blockchain technology, making them incredibly difficult to tamper with or counterfeit. Once a transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, it's immutable, reducing the risk of fraudulent activities often associated with traditional payment methods.• Decentralization: Cryptocurrencies operate independently of central banks and financial institutions. This decentralization means your funds aren't subject to the same level of control or potential interference as traditional currencies held in bank accounts. What Are the Advantages of Using Bitcoin at Canadian Gambling Sites? Aside from safety, privacy, and additional security, there are more perks to using crypto at Canadian online casinos. Crypto can give you access to exclusive games or higher bonus offers. Which Types of Cryptocurrency Can I Use at Canadian Gambling Sites? Many Canadian gambling sites that accept crypto aren't limited to just Bitcoin. You'll often find support for other popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and sometimes newer or less common ones like Solana, Ripple, and Tether. The availability of various crypto options provides flexibility for players who hold different digital assets. So, always check the ""Crypto Payments"" or banking section of the casino site for a complete list of accepted currencies. How to Deposit and Withdraw With Crypto at Gambling Sites in Canada Depositing and withdrawing crypto at online casinos generally follows a straightforward process. To deposit, you'll typically need to go to the cashier or deposit section of your account, select your preferred crypto, and copy the unique deposit address (and sometimes a destination tag, like for XRP). You then use your crypto wallet to send the funds to this address. For withdrawals, go to the ""Withdrawal"" section, choose your crypto, and enter your wallet address and the amount you wish to withdraw. Remember to double-check the deposit and withdrawal addresses to avoid losing funds. Get Started: How to Join Crypto Gambling Sites in Canada How do you start playing your favourite casino games at crypto gambling Canada sites? We've got you covered.

To level up your experience, consider these less common strategies: Scrutinize Software Providers Many players focus on the casino's name or the game titles, but the software provider behind the game matters. Researching the online casino software providers featured on a gambling site can give you insights into the expected gameplay experience. For example, some providers are known for high-volatility slots with big but infrequent wins, while others offer more consistent, smaller payouts. Knowing this can help you choose games that align with your risk tolerance and playing style. Leverage Loss Limits Strategically Most Canadian online casinos offer the option to set deposit and loss limits. While setting a deposit limit is common advice, actively using loss limits per session or week can be a powerful tool. Instead of just preventing catastrophic losses, use them to enforce pre-determined stop-loss points based on your session goals. If you hit that limit, step away, regardless of whether you feel a ""comeback"" is near. Explore Niche Crypto Options for Bonuses While Bitcoin bonuses are prevalent, some crypto casinos offer more favourable bonus terms or higher percentages for fewer mainstream cryptos. New crypto casinos trying to promote a specific altcoin might offer a significantly better bonus for deposits made in that currency. Understand Transaction Fee Structures Crypto transactions can come with varying fees depending on the network and the cryptocurrency used. Before making a deposit or withdrawal, familiarize yourself with the fee structure of your chosen gambling site for each crypto option. Engage with Casino Communities Online forums and communities dedicated to gambling online and crypto casinos can be valuable resources. Players often share firsthand experiences, insights into specific gambling sites in Canada, and even information about less obvious promotions or potential issues.

If buyers can’t defend this support, Cardano ($ADA) risks falling further. The native token of the proof-of-stake blockchain has struggled to breach the $1.20 level for nearly three years, having last reached an all-time high of $3.10 in the summer of 2021. $ADA Struggling at $1: Why Cardano Hasn’t Reclaimed Its Former Glory Since its launch in September 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano has maintained a strong position among the top 10 cryptocurrencies. It currently boasts a market capitalization exceeding $25 billion. However, $ADA’s inability to reclaim the $1.00 threshold, an area of psychological and technical importance for bulls, has raised concerns among traders about a potential slide into bearish territory. Despite this, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez remains optimistic. He suggests that $ADA holding above the $0.72 level could trigger a rebound toward $0.92 in the near term. If the current structure on #Cardano $ADA is an ascending channel, holding above $0.72 could pave the way for an upswing toward $0.92. pic.twitter.com/vgNNfuudPd — Ali (@ali_charts) May 18, 2025 Another analysis by Bull Spot Bear points to $ADA’s lagging performance relative to the M2 Global Liquidity Index (global money supply), implying that the token could surge by more than 50% to around $1.80 if it aligns with macro liquidity trends. On-Chain Indicators Flash Green as Whales Accumulate Millions in $ADA On-chain data from Santiment further supports this bullish narrative. Recent whale activity shows that over 80 million $ADA were accumulated in a short span, following a previous 400 million ADA acquisition just two weeks prior. This accumulation by large holders suggests growing institutional or whale-level confidence. Trading volume has also seen an uptick. Despite $ADA’s 3.79% price drop in the past 24 hours, trading volume surged by over 54%, with more than $1.14 billion worth of $ADA changing hands, an encouraging sign of continued market engagement. Cardano Price Chart/ Source: CoinMarketCa p Futures market sentiment appears similarly bullish. Derivatives data from Coinglass shows positive funding rates for $ADA/$USDT, $ADA/$USDC, and $ADA/$USD trading pairs across major platforms such as Bybit, OKX, and Binance. A positive funding rate indicates that long traders are paying shorts, suggesting expectations of price increases. What’s Next for $ADA? Key Resistance and Support Levels to Watch $ADA is currently trading within a clearly defined ascending channel on the daily timeframe. After a strong rally that saw $ADA approach the $0.90 region, the token has entered a corrective phase, now pulling back to the lower boundary of the channel around $0.72. Cardano Price Analysis/ Source: TradingView This level coincides with dynamic trendline support, suggesting a potential rebound zone. The 16.22% upside projection from current levels targets the $0.85–$0.87 area, which sits just beneath a major resistance band spanning from $0.88 to $0.90. A successful breakout above that range would open the door to retest the higher resistance zone between $1.095 and $1.1499, which was last visited in March and remains a psychologically major level for bulls. The price structure also shows prior consolidation in the $0.58 to $0.66 range (highlighted in blue), which now acts as a solid demand zone should the channel support fail. If bulls can defend the lower channel and reclaim short-term momentum, $ADA could begin a fresh leg up, targeting $0.85 first and potentially $1.10. However, a confirmed breakdown below $0.70 would invalidate this bullish setup and may drag the price back into the previous consolidation zone.

While this situation is temporary and new ATHs and the altcoin season are expected to begin in the following months, Coinshares published its weekly cryptocurrency report and said that there was an inflow of $ 785 million last week. “Inflows into cryptocurrency investment products reached $785 million last week, bringing the total to $7.5 billion since the beginning of the year, completely offsetting the outflows in February-March.” Big Breakout from Ethereum! When looking at individual crypto funds, it was seen that the majority of inflows were in Bitcoin. While BTC experienced an inflow of $557 million, positive sentiment returned to Ethereum (ETH) and an inflow of $204.9 million was experienced. When we look at other altcoins, SUI experienced an inflow of $9.3 million, XRP experienced an inflow of $4.9 million, while Solana (SOL) experienced an outflow of $0.9 million. “Bitcoin attracted $557 million in inflows, down from the previous week, likely due to continued hawkish signals from the US Fed. Ethereum was the standout performer with inflows of $205 million last week and $575 million YTD. Conversely, Solana was the only altcoin to record outflows of $0.89 million.” When looking at regional fund inflows and outflows, the USA ranked first with an inflow of 681 million dollars. After the USA, Germany had an inflow of $86.3 million and Hong Kong had an inflow of $24.2 million. Against these inflows, Sweden had an outflow of $16.3 million and Canada had an outflow of $13.5 million. *This is not investment advice.

The broader crypto market slipped over 3% in the past 24 hours, pulling total capitalisation down to $3.38 trillion. Still, sentiment stayed upbeat, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index held firm at 74, keeping the market deep in Greed territory. Gains across altcoins were barely noticeable, hovering between 0.5% and 1.0%. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin’s drop appears tied to renewed risk-off sentiment across global markets. After hovering near $106,000 over the weekend, the leading cryptocurrency slid to an intraday low of $102,870 on Monday, tracking weakness in U.S. equity futures and broader investor caution. The selloff wasn’t isolated to crypto. Futures tied to the Nasdaq 100, Russell 2000, and S&P 500 each fell more than 1% during Monday’s early session, while Dow Jones futures slipped by 0.70%. At the core of Monday’s market downturn was Moody’s decision to revise its outlook on the US credit rating from stable to negative, citing a worsening fiscal trajectory. Moody’s is one of the world’s three major credit rating agencies, alongside S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings. It provides credit ratings, research, and risk analysis for governments, corporations, and financial instruments. Moody’s is the last of the three major credit rating agencies to maintain a top rating for the US, and a negative outlook signals a higher risk of a future downgrade. The agency pointed to rising debt levels and political gridlock as key threats to the country’s long-term creditworthiness. Historically, credit rating downgrades have rattled markets. A similar slump followed Fitch’s downgrade of US debt on August 1, 2023, while an even earlier downgrade by S&P Global in 2011 also triggered heavy selloffs across risk assets. Investors were quick to react to the warning, with concerns deepening over America’s ballooning debt. According to the US Debt Clock, the national debt now exceeds $36.8 trillion, up from $21 trillion just five years ago. Those fears were further stoked by the House’s recent agreement on the so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill,” a sweeping legislative package that includes tax cuts estimated to cost up to $5 trillion over the next decade, partially offset by $1.5 to $2 trillion in projected spending cuts. Adding to the market’s unease, the Federal Reserve has signaled a cautious approach to monetary policy. Despite calls, Fed officials have indicated that interest rates will remain unchanged in the near term, citing ongoing economic uncertainty and the need for more definitive signals about the economy’s trajectory before considering any rate cuts. What’s next for Bitcoin? On the technical front, Bitcoin was already flashing signs of weakness ahead of Monday’s drop. While Bitcoin climbed to a new local high above $107,000 on May 19, analysts noted a bearish divergence as the relative strength index (RSI) printed a lower high. Bluntz @Bluntz_Capital · Follow there’s a daily $btc bear div brewing here if it closes red by tomorrow.its unfortunate that its appeared before fresh ath’s but its the first one since last year.be careful with longs imo 9:09 am · 19 May 2025 287 Reply Copy link Read 27 replies That classic bearish divergence between price and momentum often hints at a trend reversal, and this time, it delivered. BTC quickly tumbled 4.5% intraday, and trader Bluntz wasn’t surprised, warning followers to “be careful with [placing] longs.” Adding to the caution, analysts at Swissblock pointed out that Bitcoin had simply “grabbed liquidity” above the $104,000–$106,000 resistance zone without actually securing a proper breakout. That move was followed by a sharp rejection, pulling the price right back into a previously contested range. Bitcoin now finds itself hovering just above immediate support between $101,500 and $102,500, a zone that’s currently being tested. If this support zone gives way, Swissblock sees the $97,000 to $98,500 range as the next potential landing spot, backed by historical onchain volume data and past trading activity. According to some market pundits, the likelihood of a retest has increased after BTC failed to close above the $107,000 neckline, the same level that triggered bearish reversals in December 2024 and January 2025. For now, cautious traders pointed to the $101,500 support, which, if broken, could lead to a deeper correction. When writing, Bitcoin bulls were trying to establish the $104,000 level as a support zone, which, according to popular commentator Rekt Capital, is exactly what needs to happen for a successful post-breakout retest. In a May 19 post, Rekt Capital noted that holding around $104,400 as support is crucial for Bitcoin to confirm the breakout structure it has been building for months. The analyst highlighted a repeating pattern on the weekly chart, where BTC historically retests former resistance zones as support before continuing higher. The $104,000 area now represents the latest key zone in that structure. BTC/USD weekly chart. Source: Rekt Capital. If this level holds, it could pave the way for further upside in the medium term. But if it breaks, the momentum could shift decisively in favour of the bears. Nevertheless, some traders remained bullish despite the current downturn. One upside scenario was presented by Merlijn The Trader, who referred to the BTC/USD 8-hour chart and identified a bullish pennant pattern in formation. According to him, as long as the structure holds, Bitcoin could be poised for a breakout toward $116,000. Merlijn The Trader @MerlijnTrader · Follow They shook the tree.Now the rocket’s back on track. As long as structure holds, $BTC target: $116KYou either got shaken out… or you’re holding the golden ticket. 7:30 pm · 19 May 2025 415 Reply Copy link Read 23 replies Meanwhile, fellow analyst Moralis rejected the idea of a full retrace to $97,000, suggesting that Bitcoin may not offer such a clean retest after all. BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source: Moralis. According to Moralis, BTC is still respecting this trendline despite the recent pullback, and the market structure remains intact for now. While many traders are eyeing the $97K zone as a potential support target, Moralis implied that the opportunity may have already passed, with Bitcoin now rebounding above $103,000 at the time of his post. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $104,829, down 0.6% over the past 24 hours, as bulls continued to defend key support levels amid lingering market uncertainty. Altcoins struggle The broader risk-off sentiment didn’t spare altcoins, which mirrored Bitcoin’s decline. Over the past 24 hours, the altcoin market cap dipped 3.5% to roughly $1.35 trillion, with the Altcoin Season Index reading slipping from 31 on May 14 to 26 at last check Monday, May 19. Ethereum (ETH), which stands as the largest altcoin by market share, has dropped 4,% falling below the $2,500 level while other large-cap altcoins leading the market like XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) experienced losses ranging from 3-7%. Some of the high-cap coins that barely managed to remain positive over the past day when writing were Tether Gold (XAUI), PAX Gold (PAXG), and KuCoin Token (KCS), only holding gains lower than 1% each.

Pi Coin ( PI ) token plunged to a low of $0.7165, down by 57% from its highest level this month. It is also hovering near its lowest level since May 9. It has erased over $4.21 billion in value in the last few days as the market cap fell from $9.35 billion to the current $5.14 billion. Pi Network price has crashed as concerns about the coin rose. First, there are concerns that insiders have been selling tokens in their wallets. In an X post, Dr. Altcoin, a popular pundit on X, estimated that the team had dumped about 700 million coins in the past few months. Need evidence !?

Some analysts noted that the team sent an X post hinting at a major announcement during the Consensus event. That post triggered a short squeeze, which pushed the token up by over 200%. Some analysts noted that Pi Foundation used the rally to sell more coins. A key concern among investors and exchanges is that Pi Network is a highly centralized crypto project that is not audited. The Pi Foundation holds over 90 billion tokens, exposing the community to risk if something like a hack or a token dump happened. Worse, the Core Team has not revealed any details about the foundation’s membership. The centralization issue likely explains why tier-1 exchanges like Coinbase and Binance have not listed it three months after its launch. Further, there are concerns that Pi Network has become a ghost chain or a blockchain with no developers. While the Pi Network Venture s launch is a step in the right direction, analysts note that it could take over a year before funded projects launch in the mainnet. Pi Network price analysis Pi price chart | Source: crypto.news The eight-hour chart shows that the price of Pi Coin has been in a strong downtrend in the past few days. It has moved from a high of $1.6708 on May 12 to $0.7260. Pi has moved below the key support at $0.7902, the highest swing on April 5 and 12. It has dropped below the 50-day moving average and is forming a bearish pennant pattern, a popular continuation sign. Therefore, the coin will likely keep falling as sellers target the support at $0.5745, the lowest swing on April 29.

According to analysts, Ethereum (ETH) is on track to reclaim the $4,000 mark, and Solana (SOL) is poised for a new all-time high amid renewed institutional interest. Meanwhile, FloppyPepe (FPPE) , one of the fastest-rising meme coins, is gaining serious traction, with projections of a potential 500% rally that could make early investors huge returns. Surging Demand For FloppyPepe (FPPE) To Trigger 500% Price Rally FloppyPepe (FPPE) has sparked widespread market interest, attracting attention from both retail and institutional investors due to its strong potential for a 500% rally in the coming weeks. In just a few weeks, the project has nearly sold out its Stage 1 token supply and raised close to $3 million in funding. The FOMO for FloppyPepe (FPPE) is so strong that even influential figures in the crypto space, such as YouTuber NASS CRYPTO , have endorsed the project, calling it an “AI gem” and spotlighting its potential to bring massive gains up to 500%. Its growing communities on Telegram and X also reflect the building hype, which is expected to climb even higher as the token expands to platforms like Binance Smart Chain and Solana (SOL). With this momentum and unique AI utility, it’s only a matter of time before FloppyPepe (FPPE) rallies 500%. Ethereum (ETH) Primed to Reclaim $4,000 After months of bearish pressure, Ethereum (ETH) is staging a strong comeback. On May 13, Ethereum (ETH) saw over a 7% surge, briefly crossing $2,700, marking a 92% gain from its April low of $1,383. On the price chart, Ethereum (ETH) has now broken out of a falling channel and climbed above the 200-day EMA, signaling a potential trend reversal. The token is forming a symmetrical triangle pattern on the weekly timeframe, with the $2,699 level acting as a key neckline. Analysts on X (formerly Twitter) say a decisive close above this point could trigger a breakout, with Ethereum (ETH) targeting the 100% Fibonacci level near the $4,000 mark. Solana (SOL) Gears For Breakout To New ATH Solana (SOL) has once again captured market attention, after recently reaching $184. Although the token has since pulled back and is struggling to stay above the $170 support zone, Solana (SOL) bulls are anticipating a breakout. Notably, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified a cup-and-handle formation on Solana’s (SOL) chart—a classic bullish pattern. A decisive breakout above $200 would confirm this setup, signaling strong momentum and growing investor confidence. If Solana (SOL) can maintain support above this threshold, analysts expect rapid gains to new all-time highs, provided market volume and sentiment remain strong. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Unique Utilities To Trigger Long-Term Price Rally Among Ethereum-based tokens, FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out with one of the most unique blends of features and utilities. At its core is a suite of advanced AI tools like Meme-O-Matic (text-to-image generator) and FloppyAI (AI agent for scanning real-time market sentiment and trends), keeping investors ahead in the market. These AI agents position FloppyPepe (FPPE) at the forefront of the rapidly expanding $66 billion AI agent market. If it captures even 1% of this sector, the resulting demand could send its value to the moon. Beyond its tech appeal, the SolidProof-audited employs a distinct tokenomics model known as “Floppynomics”. Every transaction burns 1% of the supply, redistributes 1% to holders, and donates 1% to wildlife conservation, strengthening the token’s long-term value proposition. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is Leading This Year’s Bull Run As Ethereum (ETH) targets a move back to $4,000, Solana (SOL) nears a key breakout above $200, and FloppyPepe (FPPE) builds strong momentum, the crypto market is full of potential. Of the three, FloppyPepe (FPPE) emerges as the most promising contender. Still in the earliest stage of its presale, this token offers the lowest entry point of $0.0000002 , with the potential to deliver up to 500% gains.

Moody’s downgraded the US credit rating to Aa1, citing a $36 trillion debt and rising deficits, causing market turbulence and a spike in US Treasury yields. Despite short-term pressure from macroeconomic shifts, Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains bullish due to cautious shorting and a weakening US dollar. Bitcoin (BTC) price faced a sharp 4% correction during the Asian trading session on May 19, tumbling from an “important level” as noted by Glassnode. The data analytics platform indicated that Bitcoin’s surge stalled just below $106,600, a critical level where 31,000 BTC are held. This supply cluster, formed on Dec. 16, 2024, reflects firm holder conviction, as investors have neither sold nor averaged down despite price fluctuations. Bitcoin price cost basis chart. Source: Glassnode The BTC price drop occurred after macroeconomic headwinds intensified, with a historic downgrade of the US credit rating by Moody’s and a rise in US Treasury yields, raising speculation around risk assets such as Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory. Moody’s US credit downgrade spooks markets After the US markets closed on May 16, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the US credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, marking the first downgrade in modern history. Moody's cited concerns over the US's ballooning $36 trillion debt pile, with federal deficits projected to reach 9% of GDP by 2035, up from 6.4% in 2024. Interest payments on US debt are expected to consume 30% of federal revenue by 2035, a significant rise from 18%. Following similar actions by S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023, this downgrade underscores the unsustainable fiscal path of the US, rattling investor confidence and contributing to market turbulence. US 30Y treasury yields reached its highest level since Oct 2023. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The downgrade also coincided with a surge in US Treasury yields, further impacting markets. The 10-year Treasury yield opened at 5.53% post-downgrade on May 19, while the 30-year yield followed a similar upward trend, currently at 4.98%, reflecting investor concerns over higher borrowing costs for the US government. The Kobeissi newsletter highlighted that historically, past downgrades led to mixed yield reactions—yields fell 35% after the 2011 S&P downgrade but rose 23% after Fitch's 2023 downgrade. This time, the yield spike mirrors the 2023 pattern, signaling fears of inflation and fiscal strain, which likely contributed to Bitcoin's price correction as investors sought safer assets.

Bitcoin's price dump on May 19 reflects its sensitivity to macroeconomic shifts. Bitcoin could face continued pressure in the short term as investors pivot to safer assets amid rising uncertainty and borrowing costs. However, Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. on X highlighted a shift in market sentiment, noting that traders betting on price declines have been “significantly more cautious” in building short positions during this bull cycle compared to 2021. This suggests a generally bullish long-term outlook, as bears grow risk-averse. Bitcoin Advanced Short/Long signals. Source: X.com Historically, Bitcoin has served as a safe haven during economic turmoil, such as the COVID-19 crisis, and could benefit long-term from eroding trust in fiat systems, especially with the US fiscal outlook deteriorating. The US Dollar Index (DXY) is signaling a potential decline below $100, reflecting a weakening dollar that has triggered a classic ""risk-off"" response. This shift has reignited interest in gold, which saw a modest 0.4% increase, though broader market reactions remain subdued. Typically, a weaker dollar bolsters risk assets like Bitcoin, as investors seek alternative stores of value. Adler Jr said, “Overall, despite the prevailing “risk-off” sentiment (typically a headwind for high-volatility assets), Bitcoin may find itself in a relatively stronger position in the current environment due to its “digital gold” narrative and the supportive effect of a weaker dollar.” Related: $107K fakeout or new all-time highs? 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

According to the tech website Blue Dot Network , Procolored transferred the infected driver from a USB flash drive and uploaded it to its servers for users to download. It is unclear whether this was a deliberate attack by the company or if it involved a third party. However, experts believe the driver was developed by a third party who likely added the malware. They noted that most hardware manufacturers in China outsource their software development to third parties. Thus, the third-party developer likely sent the driver to Procolored using a USB flash drive after adding the backdoor. Meanwhile, Yu Xian , the founder of blockchain security firm SlowMist, has further investigated the issue and discovered how the backdoor functions. He explained that the code in the printer driver could hijack wallet addresses on the users’ clipboards and change them to those of the attacker. He said: “This printer’s official driver comes with backdoor code… which can hijack the wallet address in the user’s clipboard and replace it with the attacker’s own: 1BQZKqdp2CV3QV5nUEsqSglygegLmqRygJ.” While this might look like an address poisoning attack, Xian admitted it is a classic case, noting that the stolen Bitcoin had been laundered long ago. Overview of the hacker address (Source: Yu Xian) Interestingly, he found that all the stolen BTC was not due to the printer alone, as the malware had been active for eight years and infected several applications. The first theft happened back in April 2016, while the most recent was in March 2024. Bitcoin attack vectors continue to grow with crypto market expansion Meanwhile, the incident highlights the variation of threats that crypto users are facing. With the crypto market expanding in size and value and attracting more mainstream attention, bad actors have also turned their eyes toward it. The result is a growing number of attack vectors that the average crypto user may need to face. These attacks, ranging from phishing to malware to exploiting vulnerabilities, have allowed bad actors to make over $1.7 billion this year alone. While most of these attack vectors are not new, scammers also leverage some crypto users’ ignorance to steal their funds. For instance, users of hardware wallet Ledger have been getting physical letters and fake wallets that look like the original ledger, asking them to migrate their crypto assets to the new device. According to experts , this scam is not new. It dates back to 2021, when hackers gained access to the information of several Ledger users, including their names, emails, and even physical mailing addresses. However, some users are still falling victim to it. Physical threats pushing crypto whales to increase their security Interestingly, the risk of exploiting and being the target of phishing scams is not the only challenge crypto users face. There have also been increasing physical and violent attacks on known crypto holders and their relatives. Recently, the daughter of Paymium CEO Pierre Noizat was almost abducted in Paris. Paymium is a France-based crypto exchange. This was not a one-off incident, as the father of another crypto entrepreneur was previously abducted in the city but rescued by the police. Even the co-founder of Ledger, David Ballant, was also abducted in January with his wife in Paris and had his finger severed before his eventual release. While France appears to be the hotspot, there have also been several incidents in other countries. A public directory of known crypto attacks by Jameson Loop showed that there have been three attacks this month, with the most recent happening on May 14 when three Chinese citizens tried to rob a mining facility in Paraguay. With the risks of physical attacks for crypto users now rising, it is unsurprising that large crypto holders are turning to private security firms. According to reports by Bloomberg , Wall Street Journal , and Wired , crypto whales have increased their demand for bodyguards. That demand will likely increase with recent data leaks from exchanges putting personal information, including crypto users’ physical locations, in bad actors’ hands.

Pi Network and IOTA appear poised for significant resurgence. Various factors contribute to this renewed interest and activity. This article delves into the dynamics behind their upward trends, revealing which coins might be on the verge of a remarkable comeback. Pi Network Price Surge and Current Pressure PI experienced a steady rise of approximately 15.71% over the last month, while showing an impressive overall growth of 638.1% in the past six months. Price performance has varied, marked by strong uptrends mixed with sharp drops of 34.50% in certain weeks, indicating significant market activity and shifting investor sentiment. Currently, the coin trades within a range of $0.41 to $0.81. Key levels consist of resistance around $1 and support at approximately $0.21, with additional resistance at $1.40. Bears appear to have some influence, as momentum and moving averages are slightly negative, and the RSI is near 48. Market behavior is likely to remain sideways, suggesting that traders should consider entering near support and exiting closer to resistance. IOTA Price Update: Recent Gains and Key Levels for Trading IOTA last month saw a 38.85% increase while the past six months recorded a 24.65% gain. A one-week drop of 10.76% marked a short-term setback in a period that otherwise reflected a strong recovery trend. The coin experienced volatile swings, indicating a dynamic market performance over these time frames, with figures pointing to resilience amid fluctuations. The current trading range sits between $0.1441 and $0.2555, with a key resistance at $0.3045 and support at $0.0817. Indicators such as the RSI near 51.39 and mixed momentum readings signal an evenly poised battle between bulls and bears. Traders may look to enter near support and target a breakout above the resistance to define a clear upward trend. Conclusion Pi Network and IOTA see potential for significant growth. Pi Network's focus on user-friendly mining draws interest. IOTA's advancements in technology catch the eye of investors and developers. Both projects show promise for long-term development. The renewed attention and active community support are positive indicators. As interest grows, these coins might experience further momentum.

In his latest post, he suggests that the asset may deviate from the recent Aug–Dec 2024 fractal, but could still follow the structure seen during the 2017 bull run. The latest chart highlights the evolving divergence between the current price and the purple overlay representing the August to December 2024 fractal. Despite this deviation, XRPJunkie remains open to the possibility that the 2017 fractal may still play out. He explained that the 2017 fractal would mean approximately 40 more days of sideways trading before a massive breakout in late June or early July. Other experts have shared bullish targets for the digital asset in June , and XRPJunkie’s projection includes a Take Profit (TP) zone extending above $10, should the pattern repeat. Looks like #XRP may have deviated from the purple fractal, let's see if the 2017 fractal will play out. If 2017 fractal plays out, then likely we range sideways for another 40 days or so before a massive breakout into late June early July. Just playing around with fractals.

This update builds upon a prior analysis he posted on April 28, where he overlaid XRP’s May to December 2017 price action onto the current chart. At that time, he emphasized how “the current price movement is almost identical with 2017” and referenced a 208-day accumulation phase that preceded XRP’s historical breakout in late 2017. In that analysis, XRPJunkie identified key Fibonacci retracement levels between approximately $2.68 and $3.09, highlighting a potential consolidation period before the next major upward move. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Fractals as a Tool in Long-Term Analysis In both charts, visual emphasis was placed on historical repetition, specifically the similarities between XRP’s current structure and its 2017 trajectory. While the first includes the 2024 and 2017 fractals for comparison, the older pattern may still be the most relevant. The new projection infers that if XRP follows the 2017 structure, a period of sideways movement is likely to continue through June, setting the stage for a sharp upward move potentially into double-digit territory. XRPJunkie has made clear that these interpretations are speculative and not financial advice. Not everyone shares XRPJunkie’s belief that XRP will repeat the 2017 fractal, but his charts show a strong correlation between the price movements, and fractals as a technical tool continue to attract attention from market participants because of the cyclical nature of cryptocurrencies. Whether XRP adheres to the 2017 roadmap remains uncertain. However, based on the charts provided and the timing, the coming 40 days may prove pivotal in confirming or invalidating the prediction.

This projection, while ambitious, is grounded in the evolving dynamics of Ripple’s strategic positioning and the broader adoption of its payment infrastructure. If Ripple ever IPOs and reaches Big Tech levels, $XRP at $700 isn’t hype. It’s math. Garlinghouse says they’re not rushing it, but the talk is getting louder. ' XRP isn’t just tied to price action. It’s tied to infrastructure that scales. You don’t need hype when you’ve got… pic.twitter.com/1U9H0XHGjz — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) May 18, 2025 Ripple’s IPO Prospects: A Catalyst for XRP? The prospect of Ripple initiating an Initial Public Offering (IPO) has been a topic of considerable speculation. While Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has indicated that an IPO is not an immediate priority, he has not dismissed the possibility entirely. In a Bloomberg interview, Garlinghouse expressed optimism about XRP’s inclusion in the U.S. digital assets stockpile, hinting at future developments that could enhance XRP’s market position. Should Ripple proceed with an IPO, the implications for XRP could be significant. A public offering would not only infuse Ripple with additional capital but also potentially increase institutional interest in XRP, given its integral role in Ripple’s payment solutions. Such a development could act as a catalyst, propelling XRP’s value upward. Integration with Big Tech: Expanding XRP’s Utility Beyond the IPO, Ripple’s potential collaborations with major technology firms could further bolster XRP’s valuation. Integrating Ripple’s payment infrastructure into Big Tech platforms would amplify XRP’s utility, facilitating faster and more cost-effective cross-border transactions . This increased adoption could drive demand for XRP, exerting upward pressure on its price. The synergy between Ripple’s technology and Big Tech’s expansive user bases could revolutionize digital payments, positioning XRP as a central medium of exchange in a rapidly digitizing economy. XRP’s Infrastructure: A Foundation for Growth X Finance Bull emphasizes that XRP’s potential is not merely speculative but is underpinned by robust infrastructure. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) offers high-speed, low-cost transactions, making it an attractive option for financial institutions and remittance services. As adoption of the XRPL grows, so too does the demand for XRP, which serves as the native currency facilitating these transactions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Analysts have projected that if XRP captures a significant share of global payment flows, its value could escalate dramatically. For instance, one analysis suggests that if XRP handles 20% of payments through the XRPL, processing $50 trillion annually by the end of 2025, the price could reach $771. Market Sentiment and Future Outlook While the $700 price target for XRP is ambitious, it reflects the optimism surrounding Ripple’s strategic initiatives and the expanding role of cryptocurrencies in global finance. The convergence of a potential Ripple IPO , integration with Big Tech, and the solid foundation of the XRPL creates a compelling narrative for XRP’s future. Investors and market observers will be closely monitoring Ripple’s next moves, particularly any indications of public offering plans or partnerships with major technology firms. Such developments could validate the projections made by X Finance Bull and others, signaling a new era of growth for XRP.

PEPE/USD chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.00001275, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00001066. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe down today? Pepe’s price faced intense selling pressure around immediate resistance channels at $0.0000142. This resulted in a loss of buying demand, plunging the meme coin toward $0.0000127. However, buyers are now triggering an upward correction. Will Pepe Recover? If buyers hold the price above the $0.00001 level strongly, we might see further upward rally in the Pepe price chart. What is Pepe price prediction for 2025? The Pepe price prediction for 2025 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000035. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040.

We expect the PEPE price to record minimum and maximum prices of $0.0000059 and $0.0000098, respectively. The average price might be around $0.0000072. Month Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) May 2025 0.0000059 0.0000072 0.0000098 Pepe price prediction 2025 The Pepe roadmap is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high.

The session, titled “Mitigating Impacts of Fraud and Scams Targeting Customers,” featured Christine Kieffer, Senior Director of Investor Education at FINRA; Brooks Brown, Senior Director at FINRA’s High-Risk Registered Representative Unit; Tara Ambrose, Senior Financial Fraud Ombudsperson at the Minnesota Department of Commerce; and Bismarck Prado, Director of Fraud & Senior Investor Protection at Commonwealth Financial Network. FINRA Panel Details Rise of AI-Driven Crypto Scams Kieffer opened by noting the growing complexity of fraud threats and the increasing overlap between investment fraud and crypto scams. She cited FTC data showing $5.7 billion in 2024 investment fraud complaints. “They can take complaints through the BBD Scam Tracker and across all age groups, investment and cryptocurrency scams is[are] in the top three,” she said. Ambrose described how many frauds begin with tech support scams. Fake antivirus pop-ups prompt victims to call a number, leading to an elaborate ruse involving phony bank fraud agents. “They all seem to end at the government agencies, but they start sometimes at the popup,” she stated. Prado detailed impersonation scams that manipulate victims through staged calls, allegedly from companies like Walmart or the FTC. According to Prado, the fraudsters ask victims to stay on the phone, drive to Bitcoin ATMs, and deposit funds. The victims are also told not to tell anyone, while the scammers create urgency by claiming the victim’s identity is tied to criminal activity. Brooks Brown emphasized how new tools are changing scam tactics. “You’re not seeing those punctuation errors,” he said, pointing to AI-generated phishing materials and deepfake videos. “Scheme techniques are just that much more effective because of the proliferation of the toolkits and AI applied on top of it.” Member firms should be aware of an alleged large-scale data breach possibly affecting Oracle Cloud services at firms and third-party providers. FINRA recommends that firms review this information to assess any potential impact to their operations, as well as with third-party… pic.twitter.com/rvPR65ixQP — FINRA (@FINRA) April 3, 2025 Preventing Fraud Requires Cross-Industry Response Panelists emphasized that these scams are not limited to seniors. Ambrose noted that midlife professionals, entrepreneurs, and tech-savvy investors are often among the hardest hit. “The biggest losses I’ve seen in my current role at my past firm involved cryptocurrency investments,” she said. “They already were sophisticated investors, and somehow they got convinced to move money out of a legitimate crypto wallet into a specialized trading platform that was fake. And so they were doing the trades. They thought they were earning money.” To combat such threats, the panel recommended proactive strategies. Brown urged firms to utilize FINRA Rule 2165, which allows temporary holds on suspicious account activity. He also pointed to the FINRA Securities Helpline for Seniors, which has helped recover over $9 million since its launch without opening formal investigations. As fraud tactics become more technologically advanced, traditional safeguards are losing ground. Real-time interventions are now essential as scammers exploit tools like AI-generated personas and decentralized platforms to bypass institutional checks. The panel stressed that financial crime prevention can no longer sit solely with compliance teams. It now requires coordination across fraud detection, client services, tech platforms, and even telecom providers. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) What role do telecom providers play in scam prevention? Many frauds rely on real-time communication, such as phone calls and text messages. Telecom providers can help identify spoofed numbers, block known scam calls, and support law enforcement investigations. How can mid-sized firms without advanced fraud teams respond effectively? Smaller firms are encouraged to use “smart friction” tactics, such as additional verifications before crypto withdrawals, and provide clear client alerts. They can also partner with third-party monitoring services that flag unusual behavior.

Stating that he is very positive about the Etheruem price, Raoul Pal said that the potential for ETH to rise in the long run continues. Stating that the future financial system will be built on Ethereum, Pal stated that no other blockchain is as reliable or widely used as ETH. At this point, Pal said that large companies and banks prefer to build on Ethereum. Comparing Solana (SOL) to Etheruem, Pal thinks that while Solana is doing well, ETH could perform better in the long run. The famous CEO stated that ETH could surprise everyone, especially if Etheruem surpasses $ 4,300, and said that the Ethereum price chart points to a flag pattern, which usually means that a big move is coming. There is a Bull Flag in XRP! Raoul Pal stated that apart from Ethereum, altcoins such as XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE) could also show tremendous performance because most cryptocurrencies tend to move together. Opening a separate parenthesis for XRP, the famous CEO stated that a bull flag pattern has emerged on the XRP weekly chart and that the ongoing consolidation that keeps XRP at $ 2 is an integral part of the bull. Finally, Pal stated that the bull flag in XRP started in November 2024 after President Donald Trump's victory in the US elections, and said that even without XRP investment, XRP is prepared for an impressive rise. *This is not investment advice.

In fact, the network is already nearing a $12 billion milestone in total trading volume just three months after it hit mainnet. Unichain’s Rapid Adoption According to recent figures, Uniswap v4, launched in January, has seen a significant share of its activity shift to Unichain in the past month. In fact, Unichain processed 76% of Uniswap v4’s total volume on May 9th, leaving Ethereum with just 15.5% and even smaller shares for Arbitrum with 4.7% and Base with 2.7%. The latest figure points to the network’s increasing importance in Uniswap’s broader scaling and user adoption roadmap. Uniswap officially launched Unichain in February this year. Built on the Optimism Superchain, it is designed to offer faster and cheaper DeFi activities. It also aims to deliver one-second block times and up to 95% lower gas fees than Ethereum and supports swapping, bridging, liquidity provision, token launches, lending, and cross-chain trading using the ERC-7683 standard. The Layer 2 network saw a surge in activity beginning mid-April, coinciding with the launch of a $45 million liquidity incentive program. Data compiled by DeFiLlama showed that its TVL peaked at $800 million by the second week of May before falling to the current level of $627 million. Meanwhile, L2Beat reported that Unichain now ranks as the fourth-largest Layer 2 network by total value locked. Furthermore, Unichain has recorded a dramatic surge in user activity over the past 30 days, according to new findings from Nansen. The network saw a 3,071% increase in active addresses as it reached 5.9 million – a more than 30-fold rise and the largest percentage gain among all EVM chains tracked. As a result, it even managed to outpace major players like Base and BNB Chain in this metric. Uniswap Fights Back with Unichain Uniswap has faced stiff competition from alternatives like Raydium on Solana, as high Ethereum gas costs diverted users during the recent meme coin boom. Now, with Ethereum Layer 2s gaining traction and the launch of Unichain, the leading DEX is working to attract users back by offering significantly lower transaction fees and improved trading speeds. Besides its strategic focus on the new offering, Uniswap recently hit $3 trillion in aggregate all-time volume, thereby becoming the first decentralized exchange to hit the figure.

Yesterday, Ethereum climbed more than 2.5% in 24 hours to trade around $2,536. The recovery has reignited hopes that ETH could hit the $3,000 mark this month, backed by several bullish technical indicators. Ethereum Price Prediction: Is $3,000 the Next Stop for ETH? Ethereum has bounced from a low of $2,440 to touch $2,551 — a move that triggered widespread liquidations across the crypto market. According to data from CoinGlass , over $158 million in leveraged positions were wiped out in the past 24 hours alone, including $95 million in longs and $22.25 million in shorts. Longer-term, Ether could test new highs near $5,000, bolstered by AI integration, spot ETF inflows, and Ethereum’s new Pectra upgrade, supposedly the most significant since the “Merge” transitioned the network from the energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake. From a technical standpoint, there are two key formations on ETH’s chart over the last three months that suggest a breakout to $4,000 may happen soon. The first is a descending wedge from August to April. Here we can see Ethereum’s resistance and support lines are both falling in tandem to create a wedge shape that is often the precursor to explosive price movemtns. On May 8, the coin began a breakout that halted by May 13 and then fell slightly, creating a bullish flag that Ethereum could launch up from. However, some short-term losses are expected. Ethereum’s relative strength index is 65 and falling, suggesting a sell-off is likely to stabilize, or even incrementally depreciate, the price by the weekend. After that, the moon is the limit. As Ethereum Awaits New Price Highs, Investors Flock to the Network’s First Layer 2 Protocol Token Before it Hits Exchanges Ethereum is the world’s favourite altcoin. It sits ahead of Solana as the leading Bitcoin challenger. However, one new presale token could be the catalyst that helps Solana flip Ethereum one day. Enter Solaxy (SOL) , Solana’s inaugural Layer 2 scaling solution. Similar to Ethereum’s Layer 2 protocols, Solaxy validates transactions on a second layer at higher speeds before adding them to the distributed ledger on the first layer. By boosting transaction speed, lowering gas fees, and easing network congestion, Solaxy paves the way for a speedier and cheaper network. Beam me up $SOLX . 37M Raised! pic.twitter.com/odzUL9fHBN — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 17, 2025 The platform also features full Ethereum compatibility, enabling cross-chain liquidity and expanding its functionality within the wider DeFi landscape. Currently, SOLX tokens are available in a presale phase at a locked-in price of $0.001726, with gradual increases anticipated as the sale advances. Potential approval of Solana-based spot ETFs by the U.S. SEC could significantly boost interest and demand for Solaxy ($SOL) , which could lead to explosive Solana and Solaxy price rallies. With more than $37.8 million already secured in funding, it’s evident that large investors are heavily investing in SOLX. Staking rewards of 106% APY offer a further incentive to get in sooner rather than later.

According to the Ethereum co-founder, running a full node is valuable because it provides users with a ”secure, censorship-resistant and confidential way” to access the blockchain. To scale the L1 gas limit without sacrificing full node operation, Buterin suggested short-term priorities that include implementing EIP-4444. This protocol limits nodes to storing historical data only for the last 36 days, which reduces disk space requirements for network participants. Right now, running a full Ethereum node requires storing the entire state of the blockchain (about 1 TB for state, about 500 GB for history). EIP-4444 will offload historical data storage, making nodes lighter. Buterin's other short-term proposals include creating a distributed solution for storing historical data and adjusting gas prices to make storage more expensive and execution cheaper. Buterin's roadmap defines stateless nodes as a medium-term change that could allow nodes to interact with the blockchain without maintaining the Merkle branches used to check data integrity. According to Buterin, this could reduce storage needs by about 50%, making it much easier for nodes to operate. The Ethereum co-founder noted that such nodes are capable of increasing the L1 gas limit by 10 to 100 times, as they will be programmed to store a selected subset of data rather than the full set, while retaining the ability to execute queries related to the data in the selected part. The technological solutions presented could have a significant impact on Ethereum's scaling prospects.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-19 17:44:02

The new feature covers 78 key stocks from the technology, automotive, energy, and e-commerce industries. Bybit said , “Users can now tap into traditional markets like stocks, gold, oil, indices, and forex, without fiat onboarding or leaving the crypto ecosystem.” The crypto exchange added that the launch allows it to “unify crypto, stocks, and traditional assets under one roof” and enables “seamless trading” across asset classes from a single account. Major stocks include Apple ($AAPL), Tesla ($TSLA), Meta ($META), Nvidia ($NVDA), Amazon ($AMZN), and Microsoft. Bybit users will be discounted Stock trading on Bybit will be facilitated through Contracts for Difference (CFDs) instead of Spot trading or the purchase of physical shares. This will allow users to gain exposure to price movements without owning the underlying asset. A fee of 0.04 USDT per share applies. It has a minimum charge of 5 USDT per order. From June 2 to June 15, all Bybit users will get a 50% discount on fees for trading stocks through Gold & Forex. Investors still remember the massive crypto heist worth around $1.5 billion that happened in February . CEO Ben Zhou said at the time that the crypto was stolen from a so-called “cold wallet,” or a digital wallet for ether tokens that are typically stored offline and said to be more secure. Bybit is also experiencing some challenges in China. The Bybit team said that it heard from users that they could not take money from the Bybit platform because of a problem with KYC verification when using an Apple ID. Bybit has more than 70 million users in 160 countries and regions. The exchange, which lets you buy and sell coins like Bitcoin and Ether, recently said that its 24-hour trading volume hit $40.11 billion. The Stablecoin market reaches a new high With $150 billion in circulation, Tether now has 61% of the stablecoin market. Coin USDC comes next with $60.4 billion in assets, and Ethena USDe comes in third with almost $5 billion. With authorized amounts of $2.3 billion and $1.8 billion, networks like Solana and Avalanche are still behind as the stablecoin market grows. The USD1, which was just released by President Trump’s World Liberty Financial, has gained more than $2.1 billion in value. For the most part, these funds are linked to MGX’s $2 billion investment in Binance. Other well-known stablecoins are Ripple USD and PayPal’s PYUSD. They have accumulated assets of $900 million and $313 million, respectively. This week, stablecoins have kept up their fast growth, and their market value reached a new high of $243.8 billion. Meanwhile, Tether has created $1 billion worth of USDT on the Tron blockchain. This means that it now has more authorized supply than Ethereum. This is the start of a new phase in the fight between the two networks to be the most popular stablecoin. The openness data from Tether shows that Tron’s authorized USDT now exceeds $74.7 billion, passing Ethereum’s $74.5 billion. When it comes to the amount of money that is actually in circulation, Tron has $73.6 billion, while Ethereum has $71.8 billion.

Gemini’s recent addition of RLUSD led to a significant surge in trading volume, with a 63.7% increase to over $52 million in a single day. This uptick underscores the market’s growing interest in RLUSD as a stable and reliable digital asset. Ripple’s commitment to transparency and regulatory compliance has been a driving force behind RLUSD’s adoption.

Zand Bank, the UAE’s first all-digital bank, and Mamo, a fintech company that offers a digital payment platform for businesses, will be the principal users of the blockchain payments system, according to a May 19 Ripple announcement . Zand Bank and Mamo will use “Ripple Payments” to facilitate cross-border blockchain payments. Ripple Payments is a platform that combines stablecoins, cryptocurrency, and fiat to enable payments and quick settlement times, a feature of Web3 that cross-border traditional finance payment systems often lack. Ripple was licensed to offer crypto payments by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) in March. Reece Merrick, Ripple’s managing director for the Middle East and Africa, said acquiring this license “enables Ripple to better serve the demand for solutions to the inefficiencies of traditional cross-border payments, such as high fees, long settlement times, and lack of transparency, in one of the world’s largest cross-border payments hubs.” Related: Ripple, Chipper Cash partner for faster and cheaper African remittances UAE ranked 56 out of 151 countries for crypto adoption Chainalysis, a blockchain data platform, ranked the United Arab Emirates 56th out of 151 countries for crypto adoption, according to a 2024 report. The country scored high in decentralized finance, stablecoin use, and altcoins. The UAE has made some changes that may further increase its ranking. Various emirates, including Abu Dhabi and Dubai, have attempted to establish themselves as crypto hubs. In December 2024, Tether’s USDt ( USDT ) became an accepted virtual asset in Abu Dhabi . In 2025, Circle’s USDC ( USDC ) and EURC became the first stablecoins recognized under the emirate’s crypto token regime. The country is also continuing plans to establish a digital dirham , which would be a central bank digital currency. On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) announced more oversight for crypto asset activities , specifically margin trading and token distribution. There will be a 30-day transition period, and affected companies will be expected to comply with the new rules by June 19.

A breakout could lead to a sharp 77% upside move. BONK ( BONK ) continues to show signs of strength, even after a recent rejection at a key resistance level. The cryptocurrency is currently holding a major area of technical support, setting the stage for another potential leg higher. With buyers stepping in at the right moment, the bullish market structure remains intact—offering traders an optimistic outlook heading into the week. Key technical points Support Zone: 200MA + Daily Support + 0.618 Fibonacci Resistance: Point of Control (POC) Market Structure: Higher highs and higher lows confirmed BONKUSDT (5H) Chart, Source: TradingView BONK’s current price action reflects a textbook bullish trend, marked by a series of consistent higher highs and higher lows. After hitting resistance at the point of control, a zone with heavy historical volume—price rotated back down into a strong area of confluence support. This zone includes the 200-day moving average, daily support, and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, all aligning to provide a solid base. Price is now stabilizing in a low-timeframe range, a common structure that often forms before a bullish continuation. This behavior suggests that buyers are defending this level, and demand is beginning to outweigh supply once again. You might also like: Dow Jones posts modest gains as U.S. debt downgrade shakes Wall Street Volume analysis also reinforces this bullish bias. Each price rally has shown strong volume inflows, indicating that interest and momentum are still favoring the bulls. As long as BONK continues to form higher lows, the next target sits above the POC resistance. A successful breakout above this zone could quickly open the door to a 77% move to the upside. Another important factor supporting the bullish outlook is the current behavior of market participants at support levels. Despite recent volatility, the buying pressure seen at each dip indicates strong investor confidence and willingness to accumulate at lower levels. This type of consistent demand is often a hallmark of trending markets, where temporary pullbacks are met with aggressive buying. If this pattern continues, BONK is likely to maintain its upward momentum, building the foundation for another breakout as market conditions stabilize. What to expect in the coming price action If BONK continues to hold the current support level and breaks above the point of control resistance, a new rally toward higher resistance zones is likely. Bulls remain firmly in control.

Now, with the US dollar depreciating against Bitcoin, borrowing against Bitcoin instead of selling it has become a more viable strategy. “Prior to Bitcoin, my most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with dollars,” di Bartolomeo told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said. The arrival of Bitcoin-backed loans means investors can now effectively implement the same strategy by using a harder currency as collateral. Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at Consensus. Source: Cointelegraph This was part of the motivation behind launching Ledn , a Cayman Islands-based company that gives Bitcoin holders the ability to access dollar liquidity without having to sell their BTC. By borrowing against Bitcoin, “you’re basically doing the same thing, but you are in effect holding the hard money, which is Bitcoin, and taking a borrow [position] on dollars, which is a weaker currency,” said di Bartolomeo, adding: “This creates a bit of a virtuous cycle that we see happen time and again with real estate, with borrowing against your stock, borrowing against your gold, and so Bitcoin is no different.” Related: Bitcoin miners should pay costs in depreciating currency — Ledn exec Crypto lending market on the rise Ledn operates in a much broader crypto lending industry that has grown over the past five years due to the rapid appreciation of Bitcoin, the arrival of institutional investors and the growing utility of stablecoins. By the fourth quarter of 2024, the crypto lending market was valued at $30.2 billion, a more than threefold increase compared to two years earlier, according to Galaxy Research. However, the size of the overall industry remains below the 2021 peak. The researchers attributed the recent rise to decentralized finance applications, which allow users to borrow against assets onchain. This trend was further corroborated by a recent Cointelegraph report , which documented the growing monetary value secured by DeFi lending protocols. The crypto lending market has rebounded sharply from its 2022 lows but remains well below the peak from 2021. Source: Galaxy Research Ledn was ranked among the top three centralized finance (CeFi) lenders, with a loan book valued at $9.9 billion at the end of 2024. Together, the top three CeFi lenders — Ledn, Tether and Galaxy — account for 89% of the total market, the Galaxy report showed.

Currently hovering around the $2,400 mark, ETH is struggling to maintain bullish momentum, and many analysts warn that a deeper correction could follow if bulls fail to defend this crucial support zone. The recent drop reflects broader market uncertainty, with rising volatility shaking investor confidence just as ETH appeared ready to join a wider altcoin breakout. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Activity Spikes – 80 Million ADA Added In 48 Hours Despite this weakness, there’s growing optimism in some corners of the market. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a technical analysis showing that a Golden Cross has been confirmed on Ethereum’s 12-hour chart — a signal traditionally viewed as a precursor to major bullish moves. This crossover, which occurs when the 50-period moving average crosses above the 200-period moving average, often marks the beginning of an extended uptrend. If bulls manage to hold current levels and reclaim higher resistance near $2,600, the Golden Cross could become a turning point. Until then, the coming days will be critical in determining whether Ethereum can bounce or sink into a longer consolidation phase. Volatility Hits Ethereum Amid Golden Cross Signal Ethereum saw sharp volatility over the weekend, surging past $2,550 before rapidly reversing and falling back into the $2,400 zone within hours. This sudden move has sparked renewed uncertainty, as analysts grow cautious about the fading bullish momentum and rising selling pressure. While ETH remains one of the stronger performers in the broader altcoin market, it is still down 36% from its December high of around $4,100. This leaves bulls with a clear challenge: hold current levels and regain control by pushing prices above $2,800 to ignite a sustained rally. The $2,400 level is now acting as a critical support zone. A break below it could trigger a deeper retracement, likely dragging Ethereum into a consolidation range or even toward lower support levels. Still, technical signals offer a glimmer of hope. According to Pillows, Ethereum recently confirmed a Golden Cross on the 12-hour chart — a bullish pattern that occurs when the 50-period moving average crosses above the 200-period moving average. Historically, such signals have preceded strong upside moves, and Pillow believes this one could pave the way for Ethereum to reach $3,000 in the near term. However, for that to happen, buyers must step in decisively. Volume has tapered off, and sentiment appears fragile after last week’s breakdown. If bulls can defend the $2,400 region and reclaim higher resistance quickly, the Golden Cross might mark the beginning of Ethereum’s next leg up. Until then, the market remains in a wait-and-see mode, watching whether the bullish signal can outweigh the growing pressure from sellers.

As seen in the 4-hour chart, ETH is now consolidating right above the $2,390–$2,400 zone, a level that is proving critical for bulls to hold. This area coincides with a prior consolidation zone and could act as a short-term support base. The 200-period EMA on the 4H chart is currently at $2,130, and the 200 SMA is near $1,991 — both are significantly below the current price and offer long-term trend support. However, the volume profile shows a spike in sell-side activity during the pullback, suggesting that short-term traders are locking in profits. If price breaks below $2,390, a deeper retrace toward the $2,200–$2,300 range becomes likely. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates Below ATH – Buying Pressure Weakens As Equities Outperform On the upside, ETH must reclaim $2,550 to reestablish momentum. Failure to do so could confirm a local top. The price action is clearly indecisive, and this range-bound structure could persist unless bulls reassert strength with a decisive move above $2,600. Until then, the $2,400 level remains a battleground between buyers and sellers amid elevated volatility.

Sei Giga is Sei ( SEI ) blockchain network’s new path towards becoming the first multi-proposer Ethereum Virtual Machine L1. According to an announcement shared with crypto.news, the upgrade proposes a design of parallel blocks, powered by the Autobahn consensus protocol. It means Sei Giga brings a solution to network bottlenecks related to data availability, execution, and storage, among others.

Strategy and Metaplanet continue to accumulate Bitcoin, adding steady buy-side pressure to BTC price. Select altcoins have pulled back, but they have not yet turned negative. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) attempt to challenge the all-time high faced a strong rejection near $107,100 on May 19, signaling that the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight. However, the long tail on the candlestick shows solid buying at lower levels. The short-term uncertainty has not deterred the long-term buyers from accumulating more Bitcoin. Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, announced the purchase of 7,390 Bitcoin for an average price of about $103,500, taking its total holding to 576,230 Bitcoin. Similarly, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet said on May 19 that it acquired 1,004 Bitcoin , boosting its total to 7,800 Bitcoin. Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360 Although Bitcoin’s trend remains bullish, repeated failure to break above the overhead resistance may tempt short-term traders to book profits. That increases the risk of a break below the psychological level of $100,000. What are the crucial support and resistance levels to watch out for in Bitcoin and altcoins? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. S&P 500 Index price prediction The S&P 500 Index (SPX) extended its up move last week, indicating continued buying by the bulls. SPX daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping 20-day exponential moving average (5,712) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought zone signal an advantage to buyers, but the up move is expected to face significant resistance in the 6,000 to 6,147 zone. If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the index could find support at 5,800 and then at the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to drive the index to the all-time high. Sellers will have to tug the price below the 20-day EMA to break the bullish momentum. US Dollar Index price prediction The relief rally in the US Dollar Index (DXY) hit a wall at the 50-day simple moving average (101.67) on May 12, indicating that the bears are selling on rallies. DXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The index is likely to find support at the 100.27 level. If the price rebounds off 100.27, the bulls will again try to kick the index above the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the index could pick up momentum and surge toward 103.54. Such a move signals that the corrective phase may be over. Sellers will retain the advantage if the price closes below the 100.27 support. That opens the doors for a retest of the 99 level. Bitcoin price prediction Bitcoin broke above the overhead resistance at $105,820 on May 18, but the bulls could not sustain the momentum. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Sellers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $107,000 and $109,588. The 20-day EMA ($100,787) is the crucial support to watch out for on the downside. A rebound off the 20-day EMA suggests the positive sentiment remains intact. The bulls will again try to clear the overhead zone. If they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair could skyrocket toward $130,000. This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the psychologically crucial $100,000 support. The pair could then plummet to the 50-day SMA ($91,916). Ether price prediction Ether’s ( ETH ) bounce off the 20-day EMA ($2,288) on May 18 fizzled out near $2,600, signaling that the bears have kept up the pressure. ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Sellers tried to pull the price below the 20-day EMA, but the long tail on the candlestick shows solid buying at lower levels. The bulls will try to kick the price above the $2,738 resistance, opening the gates for a rally to $3,000. There is minor resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed. Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA tilts the advantage in favor of the bears. The ETH/USDT pair could then slump to $2,111. XRP price prediction XRP ( XRP ) remains stuck inside the $2.65 to $2 range, indicating buying near the support and selling close to the resistance. XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The XRP/USDT pair bounced off the 20-day EMA ($2.34) on May 17, but the bulls are facing selling at higher levels. If the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, the pair could stay inside the range for some more time. The price action inside the range is expected to be random and volatile. The next trending move is likely to begin on a break above $2.65 or below $2. If buyers pierce the $2.65 resistance, the pair could travel to $3. BNB price prediction BNB ( BNB ) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($635) on May 18, but the higher levels attracted selling by the bears. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The gradually upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate a slight edge to the bulls. If the price rises and maintains above $644, the bulls will again try to drive the BNB/USDT pair above $680. If they succeed, the pair may start its northward march toward the overhead resistance of $745. Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA clears the path for a decline to the 50-day SMA ($606) and later to $580. Solana price prediction Solana ( SOL ) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($163) on May 17, but the bulls could not push the price above the $180 resistance. SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Sellers are trying to pull and retain the price below the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the SOL/USDT pair could tumble to $153 and, after that, to the 50-day SMA ($143). That points to a possible range-bound action between $180 and $120 in the near term. The bulls will have to propel the price above the $185 level to regain control. The pair could then pick up momentum and rally to $210 and subsequently to $220.

DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Sellers will try to make a comeback by pulling the price below $0.21. If they do that, the DOGE/USDT pair could slide to the 50-day SMA ($0.18). That signals a possible range formation between $0.26 and $0.14. Buyers will have to thrust the price above the $0.26 resistance to signal the resumption of the recovery. There is minor resistance at $0.30, but it is likely to be crossed. The pair may then ascend to $0.35. Cardano price prediction Cardano ( ADA ) has broken below the neckline of the inverted head-and-shoulders pattern, indicating that the bulls are losing their grip. ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The next support is at the 50-day SMA ($0.68). If the price turns up from the 50-day SMA, the bulls will try to push the ADA/USDT pair above the neckline. If they can pull it off, the pair could retest the $0.86 level. A break and close above the $0.86 resistance clears the path for a rally to $1.01. Conversely, a break and close below the 50-day SMA suggests the markets have rejected the breakout above the neckline. That increases the risk of a drop to $0.58. Sui price prediction Sui’s ( SUI ) bounce off the 20-day EMA ($3.67) turned down from the $3.90 to $4.25 zone, indicating that the bears are active at higher levels. SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pullback could deepen if the price breaks and sustains below the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the SUI/USDT pair could skid to $3.12 and then to the 50-day SMA ($2.97). On the contrary, if the price snaps back from the 20-day EMA and rises above $3.90, it suggests a positive sentiment. That enhances the prospects of a break above the $4.25 level. The pair could then surge to $5. Sellers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $5 and the all-time high of $5.37. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The guidance warned the public that using Huawei’s Ascend chips without authorization could result in substantial criminal and administrative penalties. Chinese officials now say that the guidance undermines trade conversations in Geneva, Switzerland, earlier this month, Reuters reports . Says the Chinese ministry, “The U.S. has been abusing export control measures, imposing stricter restrictions on Chinese chip products under unfounded accusations… China firmly opposes this… Trying to trip others won’t make oneself run faster.” China also reportedly vowed resolute measures if the US continues to “substantially” harm its interests, according to Reuters. China sold off billions of dollars worth of US Treasuries between February and March, according to new government data. An update from the Treasury Department shows China’s US Treasury holdings dropped $18.9 billion in one month, while most other countries increased their holdings. The data also shows that the UK has overtaken China and is now the second-biggest foreign holder of USTs in the world. Macro investor Luke Gromen warns that the countries buying more USTs won’t be able to simultaneously buy more American-manufactured goods, further hurting America’s trade deficit that President Trump has promised to address. Says Gromen, “Foreign UST holdings rose $133 billion Mar vs. Feb. UK, Caymans, and Canada were $86 billion of that $133 billion; China sold $19 billion. UK surpassed China as the 2nd biggest US foreign creditor for 1st time ever in March. Cayman Islands (pop. ~73,000) is now the fourth biggest US foreign creditor at $455 billion… How are they going to buy both USTs and more goods from America going forward?” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

44817649,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=730857,1747678278,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png,Salesforce offers Slack at 90% off to federal government,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/salesforce-offers-slack-at-90-off-to-feds/,"Salesforce Inc. has announced it will offer its Slack collaboration software to U.S. federal agencies at an unprecedented 90% discount. The significant price reduction is the latest Trump administration effort to reduce government technology costs. The discounted offering includes Slack Enterprise Grid, designed for large organizations requiring enterprise-grade security, scalability, and centralized administrative control. Additionally, Salesforce provides nearly 70% off on Slack AI for Enterprise per user. OneGov initiative drives major tech savings with the centralized Slack deal The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) announced the agreement on Monday. It’s the newest push under the federal government’s OneGov Project as part of a strategy to centralize technology buying and save taxpayers’ money. The GSA said that the new pricing replaces smaller, fragmented discounts that agencies typically negotiate independently. Josh Gruenbaum, the commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service, said they were on a journey toward smarter buying. He explained that instead of managing hundreds of small contracts, the government was now focusing on larger, high-impact deals that would benefit everyone. The OneGov concept enables the GSA to deal directly with software vendors on behalf of the entire federal government. It has already saved millions — and the potential savings could be billions as more companies participate. The agreement with Salesforce, whose products include Slack and other business tools, will likely speed the government’s transition to digital collaboration. In 2022, Slack launched a government-specific, secure version designed to meet federal data protection and privacy standards. Software giants back federal cost-cutting push Salesforce is just one of several tech companies giving the U.S. government discounts. In recent weeks, Google lowered the price of its Workspace productivity suite by 71%. Adobe and other software companies have extended similar offers. These firms are reacting to pressure from the GSA and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — the recently formed federal bureaucratic body headed by Elon Musk. DOGE aims to cut federal spending and streamline the government’s tech use. The agency also reported that many departments were overpaying for software licenses they did not use. In March, DOGE said that agencies were pressuring Adobe and ServiceNow to submit bills for licenses above the number required. A spokesperson from DOGE said last week that their audits had uncovered waste at every level. They added that the agency was working with the GSA to address the issue. The action has drawn bipartisan political support. The Senate also revived a dormant bill last week that would overhaul software purchasing at the federal level — making it more competitive and more visible. To drive even more costs down, the GSA is cutting the number of intermediaries the government uses when it buys software. Municipalities are urged not to hire outside contractors to tailor software for their use but to rely on commercial versions made in advance. Gruenbaum explained that this was why there were significant savings on large purchases. He noted that integrators often added a mark-up, and the government aimed to avoid those extra costs whenever possible. However, critics maintain that the relationship between tech companies and government agencies must be tightly monitored. Government pushes for bigger tech changes The federal government’s tech landscape is shifting rapidly as more tech companies pile in. And Salesforce’s bid for Slack may only be the beginning of a much bigger change in how Washington deals with software and digital collaboration. Dave Rey, Salesforce’s head of public sector business, said the initiative wasn’t just about providing cheaper software. He emphasized that it was ultimately about helping the government serve the American people more effectively. As agencies plan for the next fiscal year, many are reevaluating their software stacks completely — dropping longtime suppliers as necessary. Gruenbaum clarified that no company was too big and no product too small for the government to reevaluate. The message was clear and bold: to continue doing business with the U.S. government, vendors would need to offer better value, more useful features, and greater flexibility.

In a new interview on CNBC Television, Lee says that even though Moody’s downgraded the US’s credit rating from AAA to AA1 on Friday due to soaring national debt, he remains bullish on equities for the time being. “I don’t know if there’s much signal in the downgrade Friday, because I think the first triple A downgrade was a signal from 2011. I don’t think Moody’s had any information that we didn’t have on Friday afternoon. So I think markets should realize the bond market is largely priced in the fact that the US is really not triple A anymore. So I’d be viewing this as a buying opportunity.” Lee says that while the country has an unsustainable debt challenge, Treasury bond auctions are not failing, indicating that investor confidence remains in the United States. “ I think everyone should be aware that the US has an unsustainable path for debt. But I think the real signal will be when an auction fails. That happened a few years ago, and then we realized that was the time to really pay attention to the fact that we have debt sustainability issues. But I think a downgrade itself, I don’t think it’s much of a signal.” Lee also says that many investors caught off guard by the stock market recovery since April’s severe correction will likely now reenter the market after being left on the sidelines, sending stocks higher. “I’m assuming [Monday’s] pullback is going to be really shallow – might even close positive, because most investors rage-sold at the bottom in April, and so as the markets climbed, a lot of people sort of doubted it, thought it was a rally that would fail, and so I think there’s $7 trillion in cash on the sidelines, enormous skepticism from our institutional clients, and a lot of folks sort of bet outside the US. So I think it’s going be a lot of chasing into year-end… I think most people might be flat on their books, but if the market is above its 200-day, showing this sort of impulsive buying, and you’re flat, that means you’re underinvested.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Strict KYC pushes darknet vendors toward DeFi platforms. Monero gains traction as darknet operators ditch traceable Bitcoin. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis has reported a 15% decline in global cryptocurrency sales across darknet markets in 2024, according to a data-driven blog post on May 16. Altogether, these markets brought in just over $2 billion in Bitcoin, while fraud shops dealing in stolen or counterfeit goods saw around $225 million in inflows. However, this overall slowdown wasn’t universal. Russia’s darknet market defied the trend, recording a 68% surge in crypto sales, which indicates a sharp regional divergence in illicit crypto activity. Why is “Kraken” (Darknet Market) Dominating Russia’s Underground Economy? The global darknet markets continue to evolve, and Russia is at the center of a surprising shift. In 2024, most countries saw crypto sales on darknet markets fall , but not Russia. Chainalysis revealed that the top Russia-based darknet markets remained dominant, but one stood out. The “Kraken” darknet market (unrelated to the legitimate Kraken crypto exchange) surpassed Mega to become the highest-earning darknet market of the year. While Mega’s revenue fell by over 50% year over year, the Kraken darknet market saw a dramatic 68% rise. Kraken darknet market leads by 68% | Source: Chainalysis By the end of 2024, the Kraken darknet market had generated $737 million in on-chain crypto sales. Meanwhile, Blacksprut, which initially gained traction alongside Mega, saw its revenue drop by 13.6%. Crypto sales are only part of the story. Russia’s darknet markets are steadily evolving as vendors grow savvier and more coordinated, increasingly outsourcing key functions—hosting, payments, and logistics—to turnkey providers like iKlad.biz and Klad.cc. When Hydra Market collapsed in 2022, its network didn’t disappear. Former affiliates simply regrouped, tapping into the same shadowy ecosystem now driving Kraken’s expansion. Authorities are also pushing hard against this underground resurgence. For example, in December 2024, a Russian court sentenced Stanislav Moiseyev, Hydra’s founder, to life in prison. Fifteen of his associates received sentences ranging from 8 to 23 years. In the U.S., federal authorities arrested Taiwanese national Rui-Siang Lin in May 2024. Lin allegedly ran Incognito Market, a darknet market that disappeared after an exit scam in March. Investigators linked Lin to crypto transfers made to an exchange account in his name. His charges include a wide range of cyber and financial crimes . But criminals are adapting. Bitcoin, once the currency of choice, now poses a risk due to its traceability. Many darknet market operators are switching to Monero, a privacy coin that hides transaction details. Monero’s activity, however, lies beyond the scope of the Chainalysis report. DeFi Creates New Illicit Loophole for Darknet Market Vendors The report also observed a changing trend. Over the past few years, darknet market vendors used centralized exchanges (CEXs) to convert crypto to cash, but this changed in 2024. Vendors increasingly moved funds to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms instead. Darknet vendors moved from CEXs to DeFi in 2024 | Source: Chainalysis Vendors sent more of their earnings to DeFi platforms and personal wallets than ever before. While CEXs still play a major role in the crypto sales cycle, DeFi is now a rising alternative. The appeal is simple. DeFi offers extra privacy and lighter oversight, letting users bypass KYC checks and other red tape, which makes it a convenient way for criminals to cash out quietly. Retail vendors are storing more crypto on-chain, while wholesale vendors are leaning heavily on DeFi. This results in a more fragmented and harder-to-trace web of darknet market transactions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What new strategies are emerging in the darknet market ecosystem? Following the closure of major darknet markets, new models like Telegram-only marketplaces and platform mergers have appeared. For example, Haowang Guarantee was a massive Telegram-based black market that processed illicit transactions worth $27 billion before Telegram shut it down in May 2025. What role does AI play in detecting illicit transactions in crypto and DeFi? AI can help detect money laundering in crypto better than traditional methods. Some newly trained AI models can spot tricky transaction patterns that humans might miss. For instance, Lucinity is an AI-powered graph analysis product that can map wallet connections to find money laundering schemes.

The HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) says the new rule covers all UK-based reporting crypto-asset service providers (RCASPs), which include exchanges, brokers, dealers, and any firm that transacts with digital assets on behalf of users or provides a platform for the transactions. The government will implement the policy as part of the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF), a global initiative that promotes the exchange of information between countries to address tax evasion risks related to digital assets. “From 1 January 2026, if you provide cryptoasset services in the UK, you’ll have new responsibilities for collecting data and reporting it to HMRC . This is because the UK is introducing the Organisation for Economic Development (OECD) Cryptoasset Reporting Framework (CARF), and extending it to include domestic reporting.” Crypto firms will have to collect data such as names, dates of birth, addresses and country of residence for individual users and business names and addresses for entity users, which include companies, partnerships, trusts and charities. For transactions involving users based in the UK or other countries participating in the CARF, crypto firms need to record the type of crypto asset and transaction involved as well as the value and number of units. The HMRC urges crypto firms to verify the accuracy of the information they collect since there will be penalties of up to £300, or around $399, per user for inaccurate, incomplete or unverified reports.

Investors allege the company made “materially false and misleading statements” about its profitability. Plaintiff Anas Hamza and other investors filed the lawsuit Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia through the law firm Pomerantz LLP. The lawsuit specifically covers the period from April 2024 to April 2025 and alleges that Strategy overstated the profitability of its “Bitcoin-focused investment strategy” and the risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility. “As a result of the defendants’ unlawful acts and negligence and the sudden decrease in the market value of the company’s securities, the plaintiff and other community members have suffered significant damage,” the complaint stated. Related News: Is History Repeating Itself in Bitcoin? Analysis Company Predicts BTC's Movement in the Coming Days Based on Previous Data! Not only Saylor, but also the company's CEO Phong Le and CFO Andrew Kang are among the defendants in the lawsuit. The complaint also notes that Strategy adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) new regulation, ASU 2023-08, at the beginning of 2025. This regulation requires public companies to report cryptocurrencies at fair value in their financial statements and reflect these value changes in the income statement. Strategy previously used an accounting model that only recognized losses on decreases in value and did not consider increases in value unless sales occurred. Investors claim that the company has been presenting unrealistic and optimistic performance evaluations to the public even after switching to the new accounting standard. The company is alleged to have disregarded the huge losses that could have occurred after fair valuation while sharing positive figures such as “BTC Return,” “BTC Earnings,” and “BTC Dollar Earnings.” Strategy did not issue a press release on the matter, but did address the lawsuit in an SEC filing on Monday: “The complaint seeks unspecified damages, interest, attorneys' fees and other legal expenses on behalf of the community. We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. It is not possible for us to predict the outcome of this lawsuit or estimate potential damages at this time.” *This is not investment advice.

Speaking on Truth Social, Trump wrote, “Just completed my two hour call with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. I believe it went very well.” The conversation focused on restarting direct talks between Russia and Ukraine. Trump claimed both sides are now ready to begin negotiations “immediately” to reach a ceasefire and put an end to the war that’s been going on for over three years. He added that only the two countries involved know the true details required for a proper negotiation. The US president also mentioned that the “tone and spirit” of the call were “excellent” and stressed that if they hadn’t been, he would’ve said so now. He pointed out that Russia is looking to begin large-scale trade with the United States once the war ends, calling it a “tremendous opportunity” for Moscow to create jobs and build wealth. “Its potential is UNLIMITED,” he said. Trump said Ukraine would benefit economically as well, especially during the reconstruction of its cities and infrastructure. Trump informs global leaders about new negotiations After speaking with Putin, Trump immediately got on the phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ursula von der Leyen of the European Commission, Emmanuel Macron of France, Giorgia Meloni of Italy, Friedrich Merz of Germany, and Alexander Stubb of Finland. He told them the talks between Ukraine and Russia would begin right away. He also said the Pope, on behalf of the Vatican, had expressed interest in hosting the negotiations. Trump ended his Truth Social post by declaring, “Let the process begin!” This update follows a long delay in diplomatic efforts to end the war . According to CNBC, attempts to restart peace talks have largely failed in recent months, despite Trump’s push to get both countries to the table. Trump has also warned that if progress doesn’t happen soon, the US could pull out of the effort, raising fears that critical American military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine could dry up. That warning has made other countries nervous about the stability of the ongoing support Ukraine depends on. During Biden’s time in office, the US relationship with the Kremlin froze over. Since returning to the White House, Trump has reopened that communication, but now he’s also threatening sanctions on Moscow if it doesn’t take the process seriously. He’s backing a 30-day ceasefire proposal supported by Ukraine and many European nations. US says both sides are preparing ceasefire proposals Russia is demanding more than Ukraine is willing to give, especially on land claims. Zelenskyy has refused to accept any deal that includes giving up territory. So while Trump is claiming momentum, both countries still have big gaps to close. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted on social media that “The US has presented a strong peace plan and we welcome the Prisoner of War exchange agreement reached in Istanbul. Let’s not miss this huge opportunity. The time for ending this war is now.” Marco said he spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who told him that Russia is working on a document listing their conditions for a ceasefire. He added that Ukraine is also preparing its own version and said, “Hopefully that will be forthcoming soon.” But Marco also said that the US isn’t interested in endless talking. “We don’t want to be involved in this process of just endless talks. There has to be some progress, some movement forward,” he said. On Sunday, Zelenskyy met with Rubio and Vice President J.D. Vance, and later criticized Russia’s Istanbul team as “a low level delegation of non-decision-makers.” He said Ukraine is prepared to take part in “real diplomacy” and is pushing for “a full and unconditional ceasefire as soon as possible.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",Economy|Russia|United States,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-19 18:48:53

Circle Internet Financial, the issuer of USDC ( USDC ), is moving forward with its planned initial public offering. But behind the scenes, the stablecoin firm has engaged in informal sale talks with Coinbase and Ripple ( XRP ). Circle is reportedly seeking a $5 billion valuation — either through public markets or acquisition, according to Fortune.

While IPO plans remain intact, no terms or roadshow have been announced. Coinbase may be the likeliest buyer. The two companies co-founded Centre Consortium in 2018 to issue USDC and still share revenue from reserve interest. Coinbase has favorable terms, including a 100% share of revenue from USDC held on its platform. It also holds influence over Circle’s partnership decisions and intellectual property rights. Ripple has also shown interest, reportedly making an offer between $4 billion and $5 billion, though that bid was rejected. Ripple could leverage its large XRP reserves—worth more than $100 billion when including tokens in escrow—to fund a deal. But Coinbase, with $8 billion in cash and the ability to raise capital through public markets, remains a stronger financial contender. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said on May 14 that Circle’s IPO doesn’t affect their commercial ties but hinted at openness to future deals, according to Fortune. Coinbase has ramped up M&A activity this year with acquisitions like Deribit and Spindle. Circle’s IPO hopes may be buoyed by eToro’s recent strong debut, but the possibility of a strategic sale remains in play.

In a YouTube AMA from Argentina this weekend, Hoskinson addressed what he described as a “coordinated campaign of defamation,” while offering new details and context about the complex redemption process that followed Cardano’s early token distribution. Speaking from Buenos Aires, where IOHK is launching its new regional office for the Lace Wallet project, Hoskinson explained that the original ADA token sale took place between 2015 and 2017 in Japan via a voucher system handled by a third-party distributor, Attain. He emphasized that IOHK’s role was limited to building compliance software and that Attain managed direct sales under Japanese law at the time. The pundit further revealed that the current controversy stems from unredeemed ADA vouchers associated with that sale. These vouchers were never converted into spendable tokens and remained in special addresses on the Cardano blockchain. After Japanese regulators changed the law, Attain was forced to shut down, severing the redemption channel for some purchasers. “This is not an issue of theft,” said Hoskinson. “ These were pending transactions never completed by the buyers. We initiated a post-sweep redemption mechanism to allow late participants a chance to redeem under a new compliance process .” He added that the system was approved in consultation with Emurgo and the Cardano Foundation (CF). Hoskinson also criticized the Cardano Foundation for refusing to publicly acknowledge its awareness of the redemption process. “We asked them for a simple tweet to confirm they were aware. That could’ve helped deescalate the misinformation. Instead, they claim it’s a ‘self-inflicted wound’ and asked me to personally call CF president Fred,” he stated. He then warned that the spread of false claims, with some suggesting over 300 million ADA was stolen, is causing reputational harm to Cardano. “People don’t read into the details. They see headlines like ‘ADA theft’ and assume systemic failure. That damages the entire ecosystem,” he said. To substantiate its position, he confirmed that IOHK will publish audit reports and internal documentation, including Slack messages, emails, and legal memos. “We’ve acted in good faith. 99.8% of ADA was redeemed by buyers. The rest are voided, pending legal resolution in Japan ,” he added. Hoskinson closed by urging the community to wait for the full audit before drawing conclusions. Notably, this is not the first time Cardano has faced public criticism or internal ecosystem rifts. In the past, disagreements between IOHK and the Cardano Foundation have surfaced, notably over governance and project direction. Hoskinson has repeatedly advocated for greater unity and accountability among Cardano’s core institutions. Hoskinson reaffirmed IOHK’s commitment to resolving the matter and defending the project’s integrity despite the controversy. The said audit report is expected to shed more light on the redemption process and may determine how the lingering 0.2% of ADA transactions will be handled under Japanese law.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano|Charles Hoskinson,EN,0,0,ADA|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-19 18:51:49

Bitcoin BTC notched a strong rebound after slipping to as low as $102,000 early in the U.S. session, following its record weekly close at $106,600 overnight. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap climbed back to $105,000 in afternoon trading, up 0.4% over 24 hours. Ether ETH rose 1.2%, reclaiming the $2,500 level. DeFi lending platform Aave AAVE outperformed most large-cap altcoins, while the majority of the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index members still remained in the red despite advancing from their daily lows. Solana SOL, Avalanche AVAX and Polkadot DOT were down 2%-3%. The bounce extended to U.S. stocks, too, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq erasing their morning decline. The early pullback in crypto and stocks came after Moody’s late Friday downgraded the U.S. credit rating from its AAA status. The move rattled bond markets, pushing 30-year Treasury yields above 5% and the 10-year note to over 4.5%. Still, some analysts downplayed the downgrade's long-term impact on asset prices. ""What does [the downgrade] mean for markets? Longer-term – really nothing,"" said Ram Ahluwalia, CEO of wealth management firm Lumida Wealth. He added that in the short term there might be some selling pressure centered on U.S. Treasuries due to large institutional investors rebalancing, as some of them are mandated to hold assets only in AAA-rated securities. ""Moody’s is the last of the three major rating agencies to downgrade U.S. debt. This was the opposite of a surprise – it was a long time coming,"" Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, said in an X post. ""That’s why stock investors don’t seem to care."" Bitcoin targets $138K this year While BTC hovers just below its January record prices, digital asset ETF issuer 21Shares sees more upside for this year. ""Bitcoin is on the verge of a breakout,"" research strategist Matt Mena wrote in a Monday report . He argued that BTC's current rally is driven not by retail mania, but by a confluence of structural forces, including institutional inflows, a historic supply crunch and improving macro conditions that suggests a more durable and mature path to fresh all-time highs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have consistently absorbed more BTC than is mined daily, tightening supply while major institutions, corporations such as Strategy and newcomer Twenty One Capital accumulate and even states explore creating strategic reserves. These factors combined could lift BTC to $138,500 this year, Mena forecasted, translating to a roughly 35% rally for the largest crypto.",Markets|Market Wrap|Bitcoin|21Shares|Ram ahluwalia|News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-19 18:52:17

The cryptocurrency is currently trading around $104,921. Notably, after dipping below $80,000 amid heightened U.S.-China tariff tensions, Bitcoin rebounded strongly, gaining approximately 25% in April alone before a further surge this month. Renewed institutional interest has bolstered this upward momentum, including significant inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity. That said, in this bullish environment, market analyst “apsk32” has projected that Bitcoin could reach $220,000 by the end of 2025 if its historical correlation with gold remains intact. In a recent tweet , the pundit argued that Bitcoin’s price movements continue to reflect long-term patterns tied to gold, not fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, which he claims distorts BTC’s real value due to inflation. “The peg to fiat hides the truth,” he stated, citing a valuation model that prices Bitcoin in ounces of gold rather than dollars. The model uses a power-law function, a mathematical formula that accounts for Bitcoin’s cyclical nature. According to the analyst, Bitcoin currently represents over 643 million ounces of gold in market capitalization. This relationship, he suggested, puts the digital asset on track to match or exceed $220,000 in the coming months, assuming gold’s rally continues and Bitcoin maintains its historical pattern of lagging gold’s movements by a few months. Notably, Gold recently reached a record price of $3,500 per ounce, forming what the analyst describes as a “very bright” backdrop for Bitcoin. Although a theoretical top of $444,000 is possible based on this model, the analyst noted he believes $220,000 is a more realistic ceiling for 2025. But the journey to that target is not without obstacles. Market data shows a significant liquidity barrier between $105,000 and $110,000, where large sell orders could suppress upward momentum. Key support is seen at around $98,000 to $100,000, a level some analysts call “critical” for sustaining the uptrend. Elsewhere, Michael van de Poppe, a popular crypto trader and founder of MN Trading, echoed this sentiment, stating that Bitcoin needs to hold above $98,000 to continue its bullish momentum. “ It’s the last major consolidation before the breakout, ” he said. Meanwhile, other prominent voices have weighed in with similar bullish predictions. Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad , doubled down on his support for Bitcoin, calling it a hedge against a collapsing central banking system. “ I predict Bitcoin climbs to $250K this year. Buy more. Do not sell ,” he urged his followers on Saturday However, not all indicators point to a smooth ride. According to crypto analytics platform Glassnode, Bitcoin’s short-term correlation to gold has recently dropped to -0.54, its lowest since February, implying that in the short run, BTC and gold are currently moving in opposite directions. Still, long-term correlations remain intact, with 90-day and 365-day values at 0.39 and 0.60, respectively.",Bitcoin|Markets|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-19 18:56:45

While Tron continues to support content creators and developers globally, another emerging project is set to change the blockchain landscape. Ruvi AI combines artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain to solve real world problems and offer exciting investment opportunities. About Ruvi AI Ruvi AI is a forward thinking platform that brings together the power of AI and blockchain. Designed to solve inefficiencies in industries like healthcare, logistics and finance, the platform provides smart tools for better decision making, data management and transparency. What sets Ruvi AI apart from many other blockchain projects is its tangible progress. The team has launched a Beta platform where users can try out the platform’s features and see it in action solving real world problems. By combining the predictive power of AI with the decentralized security of blockchain, Ruvi AI offers a cutting edge solution that industries can trust. Presale Success Shows Ruvi AI’s Potential Ruvi AI is already making waves in the crypto space. During Phase 1 of the presale tokens were offered at $0.01 . This phase sold out in 2 weeks. Now in Phase 2 the token price has risen by 50% to $0.015 . Even with this price increase analysts predict Ruvi AI could reach a $1 token shortly after listing on major exchanges and deliver huge returns for early investors. For those who bought in Phase 1, their tokens have already increased in value by 50%. A great start for those in the Ruvi AI ecosystem. A Reward System That Rewards Commitment Ruvi AI rewards commitment through its VIP rewards system where token bonuses are given to pre-sale participants based on the number of tokens they accumulate. Here’s how it works: VIP Tier 2 To accumulate 50,000 tokens during the presale phase an investment of $750 is required at $0.015 per token . Joining VIP Tier 2 means you will get a 40% bonus and get 20,000 tokens which brings your total tokens to 70,000 tokens .If Ruvi AI lists at $0.07 this set of tokens will be worth $4,900 and give a 553% return . If the token reaches $1 your tokens will be worth $70,000 and give a 9,233% ROI . VIP Tier 3 To accumulate 100,000 tokens an investment of $1,500 is required during the presale phase. As a VIP Tier 3 you will get a 60% bonus and get 60,000 tokens which brings your total tokens to 160,000 tokens . At a listing price of $0.07 these tokens will be worth $11,200 and give a 1,020% ROI . If and when the token reaches $1 this investment will be worth $160,000 and give a 10,567% ROI . VIP Tier 5 For more ambitious participants, to accumulate 500,000 tokens an investment of $7,500 is required at the current presale price. As a VIP Tier 5 you will get a 100% bonus and get 1,000,000 tokens . At a token price of $0.07 this portfolio will be worth $70,000 and give an 833% return . If the token hits $1 you will have a portfolio worth $1,000,000 and a 12,233% ROI . These examples show the value of accumulating tokens early as the rewards for long term investors are exponentially greater. Leaderboard Rewards for Top Investors Ruvi AI also rewards its top contributors through its leaderboard rewards system . The rewards are as follows: Top 10 contributors will get 500,000 tokens which is $35,000 at $0.07 or $500,000 at $1 . Top 50 contributors will get 250,000 tokens which is $17,500 at $0.07 or $250,000 at $1 .* Top 100 contributors get 100,000 tokens which is $7,000 at $0.07 or $100,000 at $1 .

As XRP touched above key technical patterns and DOGE signals a parabolic pattern, things are gaining speed. But there’s one particular altcoin, Remittix (RTX) , causing a huge splash with an innovative real-world use case. Is this the best crypto presale of 2025? Let’s take a look. Remittix (RTX): The Most Potential Crypto Presale of 2025? Remittix (RTX) is quickly becoming one of the hottest projects in the crypto space, offering a revolutionary solution for cross-border payments. With its real-time crypto-to-fiat on-ramp, Remittix allows customers to send cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and XRP into real bank accounts within minutes — a game-changer for real crypto adoption. For $0.0757, Remittix has raised over $15.05 million and sold over 535 million tokens thus far, with massive investor confidence. What is new is that Remittix already has real-world value, in contrast to most theoretical blockchain projects. Leveraging the $190 trillion global payments economy, RTX is being compared to Ripple (XRP) and Stellar (XLM) in nascent stages — but with faster, tangible utility. As the pace quickens, a lot of people believe that RTX has the potential to reach the top 10 cryptos. With increasing adoption, this might well be the best crypto presale in 2025, positioning early investors for possibly life-altering gains. XRP Price Prediction: Bullish Momentum and Blockchain Utility The latest XRP price prediction indicates a bull breakout in action. Following the CMC report from VIP ROSE, XRP has established a break-out from its downtrend falling wedge pattern and zoomed 11.11% in a matter of a week to trade around $2.63. Major support levels come at $2.40 and $2.20, but upside targets are now set at $3.15, $3.73, and $4.29. Source: VIP ROSE Aside from charts, fundamentals are also catching fire. In a real-world implementation, Ripple recently partnered with Mercy Corps Ventures and Colombian agri-tech firm WËIA to empower 300 farmers with financial inclusion through blockchain traceability. Dogecoin ETF Buzz and Price Outlook for 2025 The Dogecoin ETF discussion is heating up as the world of meme coins holds its breath for institutional adoption. Even though there isn’t a Dogecoin ETF yet, the rumor is playing out on the markets. DOGE is respecting a critical weekly level, with potential moves up towards $0.36, and even $0.66 or $0.74, if the momentum continues. Source: NDkrypto DOGE hit its recent peak at $0.48, with traders left wondering about the peak of its current cycle. With approximately 224 days still remaining in 2025, a parabolic sprint to $1 is still within play, especially in the event that an ETF announcement makes its way out or DOGE adoption accelerates with retailers and payment firms. Conclusion With this fast-growing market, XRP is showing utility by means of real-world use cases and bullish momentum. DOGE is still hanging in there on the back of momentum, meme power, and ETF hype. Both tokens are still decent contenders. But Remittix (RTX) offers a different choice — a first-of-its-kind opportunity to invest in a utility token in its early stages with ongoing adoption and massive potential. While XRP and DOGE dominate the headlines, RTX may come to dominate the portfolios by year-end 2025.

In prepared remarks for a May 19 speech, Atkins said it was a “new day” for the crypto industry under the current leadership of the SEC. He suggested that the financial regulator would be more open to “adapt to and accommodate new developments” while still abiding by its statutes. “The crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years,” said Atkins, adding: “While I have directed Commission staff across our policy Divisions to begin drafting rule proposals related to crypto, the staff continue to ‘clear the brush’ through staff-level statements.” Even before Atkins stepped into the role of SEC chair, the commission’s actions under Donald Trump suggested that it would radically depart from the direction of former chair Gary Gensler. In 2025, the SEC has dropped several investigations and enforcement actions against crypto companies and issued guidance on memecoins and security tokens. Related: CFTC commissioner to leave agency on May 31 “As I begin my tenure as Chairman, I can tell you that we are getting back to our roots of promoting, rather than stifling, innovation,” said Atkins. “The markets innovate, and the SEC should not be in the business of telling them to stand still.” Looking to Congress for market structure Atkins’ remarks came as US lawmakers considered draft legislation to establish a regulatory structure for crypto markets. The proposed bill, moving through the House of Representatives, could clarify the roles the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have in overseeing and regulating digital assets. Until the legislation passes Congress and is signed into law, the SEC’s rules and guidelines over crypto could face pushback from affected parties. The SEC chair has given opening remarks and overseen the commission’s roundtable events, discussing regulatory issues surrounding digital assets and blockchain. The next event, scheduled for June 9, will cover decentralized finance.

The allegations, first raised by Masato Alexander, an NFT creator, claim Charles used a “genesis key” during the 2021 Allegra hard fork to manipulate ADA token flows. But according to a statement from Charles on Monday, the Cardano Foundation is preparing an official audit report to address the issue directly. Masato had pointed to a specific transaction dated October 24, 2021, known as Move Instantaneous Rewards (MIR), showing 318 million ADA moved from reserves into staking or treasury pools. The transaction was flagged on Cardanoscan, fueling suspicion that the funds were quietly redirected. Critics believe the action wasn’t authorized or transparent, raising questions about how Cardano handles unclaimed or dormant ADA. Audit underway as Charles Hoskinson pushes back Responding to the backlash on May 6, Charles said the claims were false and misleading. He explained that ADA redemptions remained open for another three years after the MIR transaction. He added that the “vast majority of that 350 million ADA was redeemed by the original buyers,” and the whole redemption process stretched across seven years. Charles wrote on X, “IOG never gave itself 350 million unclaimed ADA. This is a lie. The vast majority was claimed, and the remaining that was forfeited after seven years of waiting was donated to Intersect.” Intersect is the decentralized governance body tied to Cardano’s development. While some users welcomed the explanation, others demanded independent verification. On May 18, Charles said he’s “deeply hurt” by the mistrust and plans to step back from running his X account, possibly handing it off to a media team. He also said he’ll change how he runs AMAs and X spaces moving forward. Charles confirmed that an audit report tied to the Allegra hard fork is being prepared and will be released soon. In an X post from April after the Paris Blockchain Week 2025, Charles said : “Cardano has a huge stockpile of Ada in its treasury, annual inflows, and is in a hypercompetitive industry. We’ve always known that 2025 would be an interim budget year to get us to a regular annual process. We shouldn’t expect perfection nor squeeze the people who have been building our ecosystem for years. I want Cardano to win. No one outside of the Cardanoverse cares about this stuff. They care about whether we win with Bitcoin Defi. They care if we ship Leios and beat the performance of Solana. They care about our adoption.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

This strategy appears to have paid off, as the country now holds a massive trove of unrealized gains worth over $357 million, driven by Bitcoin’s recent rally as the cryptocurrency inches closer to breaking its previously established all-time high. El Salvador’s BTC Treasure Trove President Nayib Bukele shared a screenshot on X that revealed that El Salvador’s BTC portfolio, which is now worth more than $644 million, was built on an initial investment of $287.1 million. As such, this has translated into over 124% profit margin. Despite ongoing scrutiny from global financial institutions, El Salvador has remained firm in its BTC accumulation strategy. Bukele, who led the move to legalize Bitcoin in 2021 as a means of boosting financial inclusion, has consistently dismissed external pressure to roll back the program. According to the data compiled by Bitcoin Treasuries, the Central American country’s holdings of 6,181 BTC position it as the sixth-largest sovereign BTC holder across the world, with the US topping the list, followed by China, the UK, Ukraine, and Bhutan, respectively. Bitcoin Bet Marches On Despite IMF Constraints Last December, El Salvador agreed to scale back its Bitcoin-focused policies as part of a financing arrangement with the International Monetary Fund. The package , which includes a $1.4 billion loan and is expected to total over $3.5 billion, came with conditions that aimed to reduce crypto activity in the country. The IMF had previously warned of possible risks tied to El Salvador’s BTC holdings. Complying with the deal, lawmakers approved reforms in January of this year, such as making Bitcoin acceptance optional for businesses rather than mandatory. However, Bukele made it clear that the cryptocurrency remains a central part of his vision. In a post on X, the country’s President insisted that the buying strategy will continue despite international agreements while asserting that El Salvador stood firm even when it was globally criticized and largely abandoned by the broader crypto community.

As a result, the price fell to $0.68 by May 18, representing a nearly 58% drop from the May 12 peak. As of this writing on May 19, PI is trading around $0.71, reflecting a modest 4.4% recovery from the recent low. In addition, the ongoing lack of exchange listings and persistent KYC limitations continue to restrict trading activity, leaving the price more exposed to perception-driven volatility. Let’s now look more closely at Pi Network’s current ecosystem, recent technical and structural issues, and what kind of price action can reasonably be expected in the days ahead. What really happened with Pi Network? Over the past month, Pi Network made a series of announcements that were expected to mark a turning point for the project. Instead, they introduced more questions than answers. The core team had previously hinted at a major ecosystem milestone scheduled for May 14, creating anticipation that the long-awaited decentralized applications would finally become a reality. Some developments did occur. In early May, Pi Network completed the shutdown of its last remaining central node as part of the Horizon upgrade. This was framed as a step toward decentralization, aligning with earlier claims about preparing the infrastructure for full network autonomy. The team also signaled plans to open-source its codebase, something community members have been requesting for years as a move toward transparency. On the accessibility side, Pi partnered with Banxa to integrate fiat onramps into the app, allowing users to buy PI using traditional payment methods like credit cards and Apple Pay or Google Pay. Notably, this service became available even before users completed the in-app know-your-customer process. While this improved entry points into the ecosystem, it did not equate to actual utility for the token itself. The key announcement on May 14 was the launch of Pi Network Ventures, a $100 million investment fund aimed at supporting ecosystem development. Alongside this, the team introduced the concept of an “ownerless” Pi Foundation, meant to provide long-term governance for the network. While both initiatives are structurally important, neither included a timeline for the launch of widely usable applications. For users who had been mining Pi for years with the expectation of real-world usage, this marked another delay. This is especially relevant in the context of earlier guidance. Back in February, the team suggested that over 100 decentralized applications would accompany the Open Network launch. As of now, aside from experimental events like a Pi domain name auction or a small-scale shopping festival, the actual presence of working applications remains limited. There is no clear indication of when that broader app ecosystem will go live. Further disappointment followed Pi’s appearance at the Consensus 2025 conference. During a keynote, founder Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis discussed long-term visions involving artificial intelligence, digital identity, and decentralized finance. However, he did not provide a roadmap or dates, leaving many attendees and community observers uncertain about the next steps. Allegations, confusion, and a trust gap The past week has not only seen Pi Network’s price fall sharply, but also a visible breakdown in trust within its user base. As the price corrected, community sentiment across platforms like Discord and X turned openly critical. A growing number of long-time Pi users, known as “Pioneers,” began voicing concerns that the project was being deliberately delayed, with little effort to provide real utility or access. These frustrations were compounded by fresh allegations. On May 17, an X user known as Dr. Picoin, a Pi-focused community analyst, posted blockchain screenshots claiming that a Pi core team-linked wallet moved 12 million PI tokens close to the time when the token reached its recent high. In the last 24 hours alone, PCT sold approximately 12 million Pi! @PiCoreTeam @nkokkalis @Chengdiao pic.twitter.com/TdzF8ucdtX — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) May 17, 2025 He suggested this could reflect a form of insider token sale during a period when community focus was directed toward the project’s announcements. The implication was that core contributors may have offloaded holdings at elevated prices before the broader community had a chance to react. Though the claims remain unverified, the timing triggered concern. The wallet address in question, tagged GABT7EMP, had been previously identified by some in the community as a standard distribution or migration wallet used to transition balances from testnet to mainnet. Some Pi supporters pushed back, arguing that the allegations were based on a misreading of blockchain data. Dr. Picoin followed up with a longer statement outlining a series of grievances from the community’s perspective. He highlighted delays in core features, such as referral-based rewards not being honored, inconsistencies in KYC rollout since 2021, and repeated postponements of the Open Network launch, which finally launched in February 2025. The Pi Core Team’s Latest Move Leaves Pioneers Behind The recent launch of Pi Network Ventures has sparked frustration across the community—and for good reason. After six years of dedication, mining, promoting, and waiting, Pioneers expected a thriving ecosystem. Instead, we… pic.twitter.com/046ayH4Ntz — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) May 15, 2025 According to him, the recent $100 million Pi Ventures fund is now being framed as a way to build the 100 DApps that were already promised years ago, raising the question of how earlier hackathons and ad revenues were utilized. Others in the community raised issues around censorship. In one case, a user claimed to have been banned from a Pi community channel after asking why wallet mapping and exchange access were restricted in mainland China. As of now, the Pi Core Team has not issued a formal response to the allegations or provided clarity on the disputed wallet activity. Nothing is confirmed or independently verified, and all interpretations remain unproven claims at this stage. Pi Network price prediction Following its recent correction, Pi is trading at approximately $0.71. The question for many holders now is whether this price can recover, and if so, how far and how fast. In the short term, CoinCodex estimates a possible price increase to $0.947 over the next five days, marking a 33.4% rise from current levels. Further ahead, the 1-month prediction points to a target of $2.38, a 235% increase from the current price. The 3-month projection is slightly higher at $2.51, which represents a 253.5% potential gain from $0.71. CoinCodex’s longer-term outlook for 2025 and 2026 shows similar projections . The platform places Pi’s possible trading range between $0.728 and $3.43 for both years. If PI were to reach $3.43, this would represent a 382% gain from today’s value. However, it’s important to note that these ranges remain speculative and heavily dependent on progress in network utility, exchange listings, and user adoption. DigitalCoinPrice offers a more conservative forecast. For 2025, it projects Pi’s average price at $1.44, with a potential peak of $1.56, approximately a 119.7% rise from current levels. In 2026, its estimated maximum is $1.84, a 159% increase from today. The platform expects continued growth through 2030, with Pi potentially reaching up to $3.90 by the end of the decade. Despite these optimistic projections, none of the models accounts for regulatory challenges, exchange restrictions, or unverified claims that could impact investor confidence. Pi Network still lacks a fully operational trading ecosystem. Until that changes, market access and real-world value remain limited, which makes any forecast highly uncertain. As with any emerging crypto, caution is essential. Pi Network still has to prove its long-term viability, andPi Network price predictions alone should not be the basis for investment decisions.

While still below its $3.39 peak earlier this year, which nearly approached the all-time high of $3.84 in early 2018, this level represents one of XRP’s strongest performances since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed its lawsuit against Ripple Labs in December 2020. In light of Ripple’s recent legal victories, growing institutional adoption, and expanding global footprint, speculation has intensified regarding when XRP could eventually break the $100 barrier and potentially surge even higher. The latest catalyst for this discussion came from crypto analyst “BarriC,” who outlined why he believes XRP will reach a 3-figure price tag or more. “When banks start using $XRP, we will know because of the insane price per $XRP,” he tweeted on Sunday . “We will see prices like $100, $500, $1,000 per XRP. The fact that we can still accumulate XRP at approx $2 means that banks aren’t utilizing XRP… YET.” According to the analyst, the current price levels reflect a market still waiting for real institutional utility. But once banks and global financial institutions start leveraging XRP for high-volume cross-border settlements, the price could soar beyond three-digit figures. Ripple has spent years building the necessary infrastructure to support this vision. RippleNet and its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product already process billions of dollars annually, with XRP used to eliminate pre-funded accounts in cross-border transactions. Ripple has also forged strategic partnerships with financial giants like Santander, SBI Holdings, Tranglo, and Novatti. In Southeast Asia and Latin America, Ripple’s solutions are already being used to facilitate real-time remittances. Moreover, in 2023, Ripple acquired Metaco , a Switzerland-based digital asset custody provider, for $250 million. This acquisition gave Ripple a strong foothold in institutional-grade crypto infrastructure, a move widely seen as part of a broader strategy to attract banks and asset managers to the XRP ecosystem. In parallel, Ripple has been engaging with central banks to explore how XRP could be used within central bank digital currency (CBDC) frameworks. The company has ongoing pilot programs with at least four countries and is building a reputation as a trusted partner in tokenized finance. On the legal front, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, confirmed on May 3 that the SEC had formally abandoned its appeal in the case over XRP’s classification. Speaking via Ripple’s “Crypto in One Minute” series, Alderoty called the decision a “positive shift” in U.S. crypto policy. He argued that the outcome provides long-awaited clarity for the market, suggesting that Ripple is free to pursue deeper institutional integration, which could help bolster XRP . At press time, XRP was trading at $2.36, reflecting a 1.24% drop in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|SPONSORED|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-19 19:19:27

TRON > Ethereum for USDT TRON now leads stablecoin activity: – $75.8B USDT supply – $23.4B daily volume – 2.4M daily txs vs ETH’s 284k Stablecoin crown secured. pic.twitter.com/kEnMzGN8a1 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) May 19, 2025 TRON has quietly become a workhorse for stablecoin payments, especially for Tether (USDT), demonstrating its expanding influence in day-to-day crypto transactions. So far in 2025, users have moved USDT across TRON more than 283 million times, cementing the chain as a go-to settlement layer for stablecoins. That surge stems from three basics: ultra-low fees, near-instant confirmation, and easy access worldwide—advantages that matter even more in emerging markets where every cent counts. These factors have pushed TRON beyond the label of “blockchain platform”; it now serves as a key infrastructure for global payment systems. USDT Dominance Marks Strategic Shift CryptoQuant’s analysis shows that there has been a dramatic shift in USDT activity from Ethereum to TRON. As of the latest data, the total supply of USDT on TRON has surpassed that of Ethereum, reaching $75.8 billion, compared to Ethereum’s share, which has plateaued. In 2025 alone, TRON saw a 27% increase in USDT supply—equivalent to around $16 billion—solidifying its status as the primary network for Tether-based transactions. This marks a turning point in the stablecoin market. For the first time, TRON accounts for more than half of the total USDT supply, while Ethereum’s share has dropped to around 49%, with other blockchains accounting for a negligible 1.5%. Ethereum, once the dominant player in the stablecoin ecosystem, appears to be ceding ground to TRON as developers and users increasingly prioritize speed and affordability. TRON has also overtaken Ethereum in daily USDT transfer volume. In 2025, TRON reached a new peak of $23.4 billion in daily transfers, more than double Ethereum’s average of $10.5 billion—a figure that has declined 37% from its peak in late 2024. This divergence indicates a broader shift: Ethereum is now being used more for DeFi and institutional applications, while TRON is emerging as the network of choice for high-volume, retail-focused payments. Beyond USDT: Expanding Use in Payments and Commerce USDT still anchors most activity on TRON, but a wider mix of tokens shows how the network’s role in DeFi and payments is broadening. Wrapped TRX (WTRX) has notched roughly 2.5 million transfers—evidence of busy DEX trading and a lively DeFi scene. PayNet Coin sits at about 1.3 million moves, while USDD tallies around 427,000, demonstrating TRON’s growing footprint in retail payments and cross-border remittances. CryptoQuant’s figures make the trend clear: payment-driven tokens dominate TRON’s volume, far outpacing governance or general-purpose assets. Taken together, the numbers show TRON’s deliberate focus on being a low-fee, high-throughput rail for everyday transactions rather than a hub for resource-heavy smart contracts. With TRON processing around 2.4 million USDT transactions daily—compared to just 284,000 on Ethereum—the gap between the two networks continues to widen. The data affirms TRON’s emergence as the leading blockchain for stablecoin payments, powered by its consistent performance, accessibility, and strategic focus on the payments economy.

However, he added that it will not keep it in custody. Dimon is allowing the clients to buy the cryptocurrency despite his reservations against the asset. Why JPMorgan CEO is against Bitcoin Dimon is critical of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, pointing out that his personal opinion on them remains unchanged. The investment bank’s CEO compared buying bitcoin to smoking, saying, “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke.” “Our clients are adults. They disagree. If they want to have access to buy or sell bitcoin – we can’t custody it – but we can give them legitimate, as clean as possible access.” Dimon added. Jamie Dimon had called cryptocurrencies “ worthless ” during the 2021 bull run. In a 2023 Senate hearing, he said that he was always against cryptocurrencies. In that hearing, he said cryptocurrencies were used by criminals, drug traffickers, and were used in money laundering and tax avoidance. Speaking at the 2024 Economic Forum in Davos, he said, “Bitcoin does nothing. I call it the pet rock.” Changing Stances JPMorgan’s opening to bitcoin is the latest among banks and governments’ embrace of the digital asset. Until now, the bank had only allowed owning crypto futures. Morgan Stanley, in August 2024, had allowed its employees to pitch bitcoin exchange-traded funds to interested clients. Ted Pick, Morgan Stanley’s CEO said in January 2025 that the bank will be working with the US regulators to increase its involvement in cryptocurrency markets. Under the previous US administration led by former US President Joe Biden, banks were not allowed to own physical bitcoin. The exposure was limited to bitcoin derivatives. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also sued multiple crypto entities like Coinbase and Kraken. However, the current President Donald Trump’s administration is more accommodating towards digital assets. Under the new laws, banks can now custody crypto, though they still have restrictions on working with crypto firms directly. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Currency Comptroller’s Office have removed their anti-crypto guidance. The SEC also agreed to drop its lawsuit against Kraken. The US SEC chair, Paul Atkins , said in May that the regulator is looking to establish rules for crypto token distribution. Atkins said he is also considering changing rules that registered brokers with alternative trading system can facilitate trading in bitcoin or ether. Various US states introduced crypto reserve bills, with Texas being the first among them . Bitcoin outpaces equity markets Bitcoin in 2025 has given a 12% return, outperforming the S&P 500 index which was only up 1.47%. Bitcoin has seen inflows worth $7.21 billion in the year so far, amassing up to $147.9 billion assets under management.

A group of investors has filed a class action lawsuit against the company. The plaintiffs accuse Strategy of making false and misleading statements about its profits and the risks associated with its large Bitcoin holdings . The lawsuit covers events that took place between April 2024 and April 2025. Investors Claim Strategy Hid the Real Risk The lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia targets Strategy and its top executives. It names explicitly co-founder Michael Saylor, CEO Phong Le, and CFO Andrew Kang. Investor Anas Hamza, represented by the law firm Pomerantz LLP, is leading the lawsuit. The class action alleged that Strategy presented an overly optimistic view of its financial health while concealing key risks. According to the complaint, the software intelligence firm gave investors the impression that its Bitcoin -focused strategy would be highly profitable. However, the company allegedly downplayed the risk of the coin’s sharp price swings. When Bitcoin’s value dropped, investors say they suffered major losses. Strategy’s Shift in Accounting Raised New Questions In early 2025, Strategy started using a new accounting rule called ASU 2023-08 in compliance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board. This rule demands that companies show both gains and losses in the value of their crypto, based on market prices each quarter. Before adopting this rule, the Nasdaq-listed firm Strategy only reported losses when Bitcoin dropped, but did not show gains unless it sold the Bitcoin. After implementing this change, Strategy began showing big profits and strong Bitcoin results. Now, investors are arguing that the reports were misleading. They believe the company did not clearly explain the risks or possible losses associated with the new rule. Strategy Responds to Lawsuits, Stock Price Jump Strategy replied to the lawsuit in a public filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company said it plans to fight the claims, but it cannot predict the case’s outcome yet. Strategy currently holds 576,230 Bitcoins, worth over $59 billion. The company bought those coins at an average price of $69,726 each, spending about $40.2 billion. According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin is trading at about $104,000, showing strong growth. Experts believe the digital asset will go even higher, saying it is still in the acceleration phase. Even with the lawsuit in the news, Strategy’s stock (MSTR) went up by 1.8% as of Monday. Investors and the crypto community are waiting to see what happens next.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a longtime crypto skeptic who has previously labelled Bitcoin ( BTC ) as worthless, now says the bank’s customers can buy the benchmark digital asset. Dimon announced the move during a speech at the banking giant’s annual investor day on May 19, 2025. However, while JPMorgan bids to join other leading banks and financial institutions, including Morgan Stanley, in bringing BTC to their clients, Dimon remains skeptical. He also noted that while JPMorgan will allow its customers to buy Bitcoin, the bank will not custody it. On his personal view about Bitcoin, Dimon has said: “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin.” After calling Bitcoin worthless in 2021, Dimon reiterated the take during a Senate hearing in 2023 and again in 2024 at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Earlier this year, Dimon likened Bitcoin to a “fraud.” You might also like: JPMorgan’s Dimon says he will now ‘defend your right to buy Bitcoin’ In his remarks about crypto and the ecosystem to lawmakers, the JPMorgan chief said he has always been “opposed to crypto, Bitcoin.” He noted that the only true use case of cryptocurrencies remains by criminals, money laundering, and tax evasion. He has previously said he would shut Bitcoin down if it was all down to him. “If I was the government, I’d close it down,” he noted in remarks in December 2023. While Dimon has maintained a negative view of BTC and crypto, the broader banking ecosysem has increasingly warmed up to it. Banks such as Morgan Stanley have shown greater ambition in tapping into the crypto market for their clients . This has come as the launch of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds continues to shine a spotlight on institutional demand. Also taking a more upward trajectory is the tokenized assets market, with players such as BlackRock key cogs. Notable shifts in regulatory approach by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, banking regulators and others are also pushing crypto into widespread adoption across the globe. This positive outlook has gathered pace under President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance.

However, he said the bank will not provide custody services for the asset. The bank’s approach underscores a broader trend among traditional financial institutions to accommodate client demand for digital assets while maintaining a cautious stance on direct involvement. JPMorgan balances client interest with its risk management strategies by enabling Bitcoin purchases without providing custody services. JPMorgan is among the American banks that have been accused of debanking in the last three years. However, the policies that were unfair to the crypto industry were revoked. These include “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” and the decision to drop the controversial accounting rule SAB 121. Although the bank is still not treating crypto like other traditional assets by offering custody, the finance sector looks more open to blockchain technology. Jamie Dimon says he still doesn’t like BTC After the announcement, Dimon clarified that he is not a fan of Bitcoin. However, by allowing Bitcoin into the bank, it tells how much has changed since 2017. Back then, he called Bitcoin a “fraud,” said it was like the tulip bubble, and said it would burst. He went as far as saying that he would fire any JPMorgan worker caught dealing with it. In 2024, he said that he would no longer discuss Bitcoin publicly. He also said that Bitcoin “has no intrinsic value” and is heavily used by criminals involved in sex trafficking, money laundering, and ransomware activities. However, although he said all this, JPMorgan has stayed involved in the crypto market by letting its wealth management clients buy Bitcoin. The bank is also a registered participant in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF. Recently, JPMorgan Chase completed its first structured trade on a public blockchain. The company had only worked in private, permissioned networks for institutional clients for years. The testnet deal was done with the help of Ondo Finance (a leader in tokenizing real-world assets) and Chainlink (the top cross-chain oracle network). Both companies provided infrastructure, and Kinexys, JPMorgan’s blockchain division, ran it. Meanwhile, investors are reacting on all social media, saying Dimon contradicts himself by saying he doesn’t like BTC but will allow his clients to buy. Bitcoin rally is on During the Asian trade session on May 19, the price of Bitcoin dropped sharply by 4%. It fell from an “important level,” as Glassnode put it. The platform for analyzing data showed that Bitcoin’s rise stopped just below $106,600, a key mark where 31,000 BTC are held. Bitcoin price cost basis chart. Source: Glassnode Also, after Moody’s downgraded the US credit rating and US Treasury yields went up, investors became more interested in risky assets like Bitcoin. However, the macroeconomic pressures got stronger and influenced the drop. Meanwhile, Strategy (MSTR) bought 7,390 BTC for about $764.9 million at $103,498 per Bitcoin on average. With this new purchase, the company now has a total of 576,230 BTC in Bitcoin, worth about $60 billion at the current market price of $105,000 per Bitcoin.

Hoskinson announced that he will publish a comprehensive audit report regarding the transfer made during the 2021 Allegra hard fork that was at the center of the controversy. NFT artist Masato Alexander claimed that Hoskinson unilaterally used “genesis” keys to manipulate the Cardano ledger in 2021 and took control of 318 million ADA. Alexander compared the incident to Ethereum’s DAO hack in 2016, saying, “The Ethereum community did a hard fork for a $60 million hack; here, there is a $619 million intervention.” Responding to the allegations, Hoskinson said, “Input Output Global never allocated 350 million ADAs. This is a complete lie.” He stated that the majority of the ADAs in question were claimed by the original recipients over a seven-year period, while the rest was donated to an organization called Intersect. Related News: Why Did the Rally in Ethereum Stop? Expert Analyst Predicts the Future of Bitcoin and ETH in the Coming Days Hoskinson made the following statement in his statement: “No matter how many times people lie, the truth remains the same. The vast majority of those 350 million ADAs were reclaimed by their original owners within seven years. The rest were donated to Intersect after the legal deadline.” Hoskinson stated that the events deeply affected him and that he was disappointed that some people in the Cardano community did not trust him: “In a crisis, you quickly learn who your real friends are and who your just ‘good-weather friends’ are. The fact that some people treated me this way without providing any proof showed me that the bond between us was not as strong as I thought. This really upset me.” Hoskinson also announced that he plans to hand over his social media accounts to a media team and change the format of his regular AMA (Ask Me Anything) posts and X (formerly Twitter) interactions following the release of the audit report. Charles Hoskinson concluded his remarks by stating that he will still be present at events and will not give up on one-on-one contact with the community. *This is not investment advice.

This sustained rise in dominance sends a clear message that Bitcoin (BTC) still holds a considerable amount of investor attention, leaving the rest of the market, particularly altcoins, struggling to keep pace . Bitcoin Dominance Powers Ahead, Eyes Major Resistance On May 17, crypto market expert ‘Daan Crypto Trades,’ took to X (formerly Twitter) to share insights on Bitcoin Dominance , highlighting how its continued rise could impact alternative cryptocurrencies . The analyst shared a chart showing that BTC.D has been steadily climbing for almost three years, since mid-2022, after bottoming out near the 39% level. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says “Altseason Is Dawning” As Bitcoin Dominance Reaches HTF Resistance, What To Expect Since then, Bitcoin has slowly reclaimed its market share, outperforming altcoins in almost all categories, including price performance and market capitalization. Based on the chart, this momentum has led BTC.D to climb past key resistance levels at 48%, 52%, and, more recently, above 60%. Despite a brief retracement this past week, Daan Crypto Trades highlights that the overall structure of the BTC.D chart remains bullish, with the flagship cryptocurrency continuing to attract substantial capital inflows. What stands out the most as Bitcoin Dominance rises is its steady approach toward a critical resistance level at 71.3%—a zone historically marked as the top of BTC.D during previous cycles. The analyst’s chart shows three failed attempts to break this level in 2019, 2020, and 2021. Each rejection was followed by significant altcoin rallies, indicating that this zone could once again be a significant battleground between Bitcoin and the broader altcoin market . If BTC.D revisits this historical resistance level , Daan Crypto Trades suggests that it could serve as a key signal for traders to closely monitor the behavior of altcoins, as any rejection might ignite a strong rotation of capital back into altcoins. For now, Bitcoin remains in control, driven by institutional inflows , increased demand, and a generally positive market sentiment . Altcoins, on the other hand, continue to trail behind, struggling due to reduced liquidity and weaker investor interest. Nevertheless, historical price trends indicate that once Bitcoin Dominance reaches the top and begins to plummet, altcoins could be poised for a strong comeback, signaling the possible start of the altcoin season. Analyst Says BTC.D Is Reaching A Top After experiencing months of steady gains, a crypto analyst identified as ‘CT_TAC’ on X has declared that Bitcoin Dominance may be approaching its peak. He revealed that BTC.D is also flashing potential weakness after breaking down from a rising wedge chart pattern and struggling to reclaim lost ground. This breakdown marked a critical shift in momentum, with BTC.D briefly dipping before attempting a recovery . Notably, a sustained move lower in Bitcoin Dominance would indicate that capital has finally begun to rotate out of the flagship cryptocurrency and into altcoins—a necessary condition for an altcoin season . With BTC.D still struggling to reclaim former highs, the analyst has noted that next week’s performance will be critical in determining whether it continues to rise or drops to new lows.",Bitcoin News|Altcoin|Altcoin Season|bitcoin|Bitcoin dominance|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|BTC.D|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CT_TAC|Daan Crypto Trades|Rising Wedge Pattern,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-19 19:30:19

He pointed out that on May 12, XRP fell from $2.47 to $2.33—a 5.60% drop in 24 hours. Such moves stoke fear. But Farina says sticking around might pay off in the long run. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? Strong Reminder To Hold Farina urged investors not to let a 20–30% pullback scare them out. He warned that selling during a small slide often kicks people out just before the next surge. When XRP fell to around $0.50–$$0.70 in past years, many sold. Those same coins later climbed by hundreds of percent. Holding through the downturn would have turned a small stake into a much larger gain. Big Gains Lost By Early Sellers Based on reports, people who bailed at $0.60 missed out on big rallies. That drop to the $0.50–$0.70 range represented a massive buying opportunity. But paranoia took over. Investors sold to shield themselves from more losses. They thought the dip would last. It didn’t. XRP’s price shot up, leaving many behind.

He dismissed the need for complex tactics like day‑trading or staking. He even said you don’t need a huge pile of cash to get started. Instead, courage during volatility is what counts. That message is meant to be easy to follow. Institutional Interest And Conviction He also spoke about doing a “conviction move” by studying XRP’s tech, financials, and geopolitical role. According to Farina, XRP serves as a bridge currency for fiat transfers. He claims this has drawn the eye of big players like the IMF and the Bank for International Settlements. He believes this backing shows that demand could stay strong. Warning On Risks And Reality Farina admitted he once sold in panic and missed out. Now, he says he’d hold his XRP even if the price fell to zero. That’s a bold stance. Yet, real markets can be unpredictable. No amount of courage can replace the need for risk checks and exit plans.

Garlinghouse Responds,https://timestabloid.com/pro-bitcoin-senator-cancels-meeting-with-ripple-ceo-garlinghouse-responds/,"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has called out U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis for canceling a meeting and refusing to reschedule. Lummis, known for her pro-Bitcoin stance and role as Chair of the Senate’s Digital Assets Subcommittee, has been a vocal figure in crypto legislation. However, Garlinghouse expressed disappointment over her decision, emphasizing the need for inclusive leadership across the broader digital asset industry. Heading to DC to champion sensible pro-crypto legislation around stablecoins and market structure, and I’m very encouraged to see our elected officials look at crypto as it should be – a multichain industry. That said, @SenLummis , as Chair of the Digital Assets Subcommittee,… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) May 19, 2025 Ripple’s Push for Sensible Crypto Regulation Garlinghouse announced traveling to Washington, D.C., to advocate for “sensible pro-crypto legislation” focused on stablecoins and market structure. While optimistic about other elected leaders who see the crypto industry as a multi-chain space, his comments suggest that Lummis’ refusal to meet with him contradicted the responsibilities of a national leader. Some maximalists see Lummis’ actions as support for Bitcoin, with one commenter calling Bitcoin the only asset that matters, with others suggesting that Lummis shares their maximalist views. However, Garlinghouse’s statement shows that he maintains his inclusive stance and wants to advance the market. “As a leader in Congress and Senator from one of the most crypto-friendly states,” he wrote, “I hope you will reconsider and be a leader for ALL of crypto.” Garlinghouse has consistently pushed for inclusivity in the crypto space, and while Bitcoin maximalists were calling for a Bitcoin-only national crypto reserve, Garlinghouse suggested a multi-asset reserve to include top U.S. cryptocurrencies. Ripple’s Stablecoin Initiative and Broader Crypto Goals Ripple has been active in shaping the U.S. regulatory framework for digital assets, and Garlinghouse has consistently positioned the company as a key stakeholder in that process. The meeting with Senator Lummis was expected to support that mission, particularly as Ripple expands its influence through its new stablecoin initiative, RLUSD. Launched in December 2024 , RLUSD represents Ripple’s strategic entry into the stablecoin market. Ripple has stressed the importance of regulation and transparency, and the long-running XRP lawsuit and the negative effects it had on the asset show the importance of sensible regulation. Ripple has big plans for RLUSD as Garlinghouse previously revealed plans to make it one of the top five stablecoins by the end of 2025, and sensible crypto legislation is crucial in achieving that goal. Despite Lummis’ actions, Garlinghouse is optimistic and called on the Senator to join him on an X space or any live event to discuss ways to advance the entire crypto space and not just Bitcoin, and help achieve Donald Trump’s goal of making the U.S. the crypto capital of the world.

While JPMorgan will not custody the top crypto, the move signals a shift in how the bank deals with the asset. JPMorgan Clients Will Soon Be Able To Buy Bitcoin Speaking at JPMorgan’s annual Investor Day on Monday, Jamie Dimon revealed that the bank he runs will now allow clients to purchase BTC. “We are going to allow you to buy it,” Dimon told shareholders, though he added JPMorgan will not provide custody services for the asset. Dimon previously stated that JPMorgan was “probably one of the biggest users of blockchain,” but on Monday, he dismissed the hype around blockchain, asserting it’s less important than people make it out to be. “We have been talking about blockchain for 12 to 15 years,” he opined. “We spend too much on it. It doesn’t matter as much as you all think.” It’s worth mentioning that JPMorgan’s Kinexys Digital Payments platform recently settled a tokenized U.S. Treasury transaction on a public blockchain, in collaboration with Ondo Finance and Chainlink. Dimon Still Isn’t A Fan Of Bitcoin Over the years, Dimon has maintained that Bitcoin “has no intrinsic value”. In 2017, he even threatened to fire any employee found trading the apex crypto, describing the act as “stupid.” He doubled down on Monday that he is still not a fan of Bitcoin because of its use for illicit activities like sex trafficking and money laundering. Earlier this year, Dimon and other banking bosses spoke about their struggles with crypto amid criticism that the U.S. government has restricted what they can do in the burgeoning sector. However, the pro-crypto Trump administration has triggered a change of heart for many in legacy finance. Goldman Sachs, for instance, recently mentioned crypto in its annual report for the first time and hinted that the Wall Street giant could participate in crypto if US regulations shift.

Intersect confirms it received only $7M, far short of the $619M in question. The controversy rekindles old doubts about Cardano’s early token distribution and governance mechanisms. The Cardano Foundation is preparing to release an audit of its treasury holdings after new allegations surfaced accusing founder Charles Hoskinson of misappropriating over $600 million worth of ADA tokens. The controversy centers on a 2021 transaction during the Allegra hard fork, in which 318 million ADA, valued at around $619 million at the time, was moved from presale addresses into the Cardano reserves. The move has also sparked accusations of unilateral control and manipulation of the blockchain ledger. Cardano Faces Tough Questions Over ADA Transfers Non-fungible-token artist Masato Alexander brought the claims to light, alleging that Hoskinson used a “genesis key” to rewrite the ledger. Alexander described the hard fork as a “two-step maneuver” that effectively erased the original UTxOs holding the ADA and reallocated them to the reserves controlled by Hoskinson’s team. In 2021, Charles Hoskinson unilaterally used his genesis keys to REWRITE the Cardano ledger and take control of ₳318m ($619m) By comparison, when the DAO hack happened in 2016, the Ethereum community forked over $60m. One of the largest ledger reorgs in blockchain history: — masato_alexander (@masatoalexander) May 7, 2025 Alexander also pointed to a second transaction involving Cardano’s “Move Instantaneous Rewards” (MIR) feature, which was used to withdraw the funds from reserves. He argued that most of the original token holders never reclaimed their funds and questioned how such a large sum could be moved without the consent of the original buyers. Hoskinson addressed the claims on May 6, stating that the “vast majority” of the funds were either redeemed by original ICO buyers or donated to Intersect, the member-based organization involved in Cardano’s governance. According to Intersect’s interim executive director, the group received around $7 million in funding, far less than the alleged $318 million . It’s unclear how much, if any, of the withdrawn funds went elsewhere. Critics have also raised concerns about the lack of transparency surrounding the funds, which were reportedly staked and earned an additional 25 million ADA in rewards. Hoskinson expressed frustration over the accusations and what he described as a lack of trust from the community. “It’s not possible for anyone to not take this personally,” he wrote on X . The one advantage in a crisis or an event that tests people is that you rapidly get to see who your friends truly are and who's fairweather. I'd like to thank all the support and kind words both privately and publicly. The downside is that I believe there will be a cold… — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) May 18, 2025 “To not be given the benefit of the doubt here without strong evidence to the contrary means I don’t have the connection I thought with some people,” Hoskinson stated. He added that the experience has left him “deeply hurt” and he plans to change how he interacts publicly. “After the audit report comes out, I’m going to likely turn my X account over to a media team and change the format of my AMAs and X spaces.” The upcoming audit is expected to provide clarity on the movement and use of the funds, but it may not be enough to resolve the community’s concerns. For many, the controversy has reopened old wounds about Cardano’s early token distribution and raised broader questions about accountability in blockchain governance. Cardano Market Dips as Hoskinson Defends Vision Amid Treasury Concerns ADA slipped 4.6% to $0.7352 following allegations of treasury mismanagement, with trading volume rising by over 27% to $1.05 billion in 24 hours, according to CoinGecko . Source: CoinGecko In a recent interview, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson responded to criticism by reaffirming the network’s long-term goals and acknowledging its current limitations. “We know what’s wrong, and we know how to fix it,” he said, addressing growing concerns from both the investor community and broader crypto space. Cardano has been repeatedly criticized for trailing behind in key areas like DeFi growth and stablecoin adoption. Its DeFi total value locked remains below $320 million, far behind Solana’s $7 billion. Additionally, the network has yet to attract major stablecoins like USDT or USDC or build momentum around meme coin communities that have energized rival chains. Still, Hoskinson pointed to Cardano’s $1.5 billion treasury as a major advantage and positioned the network as the ideal foundation for Bitcoin DeFi. “It’s the biggest opportunity of our lives,” he said. “And Cardano’s architecture is the best to unlock it.” The post Cardano Audit Probes $600M ADA Gap – Was Treasury Looted? appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|Crypto Regulation News|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|WALLET|FORKS,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-19 19:50:22

According to a new press release , Pomerantz LLP is announcing a class action lawsuit against the Bitcoin ( BTC ) treasury firm. Pomerantz says the lawsuit is on behalf of anyone who acquired Strategy securities between April 30, 2024, and April 4, 2025, and alleges that Strategy made “materially false and misleading statements” about its profitability by omitting critical information from its disclosures. Says the press release: “The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding Strategy’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the anticipated profitability of the Company’s bitcoin-focused investment strategy and treasury operations was overstated; (ii) the various risks associated with bitcoin’s volatility and the magnitude of losses Strategy could recognize on the value of its digital assets following its adoption of ASU 2023-08 were understated; and (iii) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.” According to the announcement, Strategy disclosed an unrealized loss of $5.91 billion with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this month after adopting updated accounting methods this year, after previously using a different model. Following the SEC filing, Strategy warned investors that they might not “regain profitability in future periods.” According to BitcoinTreasuries.net, Strategy has 568,840 BTC worth over $59.8 billion, and announced another large purchase of coins on the same day the lawsuit was launched.

In a March 20 X post , Atai’s founder, Christian Angermayer, said “Bitcoin should be a part of ANY corporate treasury – especially, in fact, in the biotech sector.” Angermayer added in a blog post that Bitcoin can help the biotech hedge against inflation and stay solvent during the long periods before drug approvals.

According to a CNBC report , the veteran chief executive and chairman warned that rising prices and the chance of a recession are a bigger threat than the stock market shows. Speaking at the bank’s annual investor day in New York, Dimon said, “We have huge deficits; we have what I consider almost complacent central banks”. He added, “You all think they can manage all this. I don’t think they can.” Dimon said traders still have not felt “effective tariffs” and pointed to the swift rebound in U.S. stocks after a 10% slide in April as proof that investors are too calm. His remarks came three days after ratings firm Moody’s cut the U.S. credit outlook, citing the federal debt load. In recent months, markets have swung on fear that President Donald Trump’s trade moves could lift prices and slow the world’s largest economy. JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon believes S&P 500 profit forecasts will suffer Estimates for S&P 500 earnings began the year near 12% growth but have already fallen. Dimon predicted that in six months, the figure will read 0%, forcing share prices to be lower. “I think earnings estimates will come down, which means P/E will come down,” he said. He estimated the chance of stagflation, “basically a recession with inflation,” at about twice what the market now assumes. Elsewhere on Monday, Troy Rohrbaugh, co-head of JPMorgan’s commercial and investment bank, said corporate clients are mostly “wait-and-see” on deals. He expects second-quarter investment-banking revenue to drop by a “mid-teens” percentage from a year earlier, while trading revenue should rise by a “mid-to-high” single-digit rate. JPMorgan’s chief also addressed the long-running question of when he will step aside. He repeated the same answer from last year, saying he is likely to stay fewer than five more years as chief executive and then up to two years as executive chairman. “If I’m here for four more years, and maybe two more” in the chairman role, “that’s a long time,” he noted. Consumer banking head Marianne Lake spoke for a full hour during the presentations, the longest slot of any executive. She is seen as a leading contender to replace Dimon, especially after Chief Operating Officer Jennifer Piepszak said she will not pursue the top job.

Mutuum Finance’s native token, MUTM, has recently attracted over $500,000 in just 48 hours during its ongoing presale, catching the attention of investors looking for strong opportunities. With its combination of promising utility and an accessible entry price, many are asking: Could MUTM be the best cryptocurrency to invest in right now? What Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance is a decentralized platform built on blockchain technology, enabling users to lend and borrow assets without relying on a custodial middleman. Unlike many projects that focus solely on token speculation, Mutuum offers tangible financial services. Users can deposit supported crypto assets to earn interest passively or borrow funds by locking their assets as collateral, all managed through smart contracts without intermediaries. The current MUTM presale is in full swing, with millions already raised and thousands of wallets participating. Early phases have sold out quickly, and with price increments set for upcoming rounds, investors are rushing to secure tokens before the price climbs. This significant increase in interest highlights the strengthening trust in MUTM’s prospects for long-term growth. At just $0.025 per token during this phase, MUTM remains highly affordable, giving investors a rare chance to enter before wider market exposure. With a confirmed launch price of $0.06 looming and strong fundamentals backing the project, the presale is shaping up as one of the most promising in the DeFi crypto space. The platform operates by pooling assets deposited by lenders into liquidity pools. In return, lenders receive mtTokens—ERC-20 tokens that represent their share in the pool and accrue interest over time. Borrowers can access liquidity by providing overcollateralized crypto assets, ensuring security for lenders and stability for the system. This dual approach fosters a balanced ecosystem, where capital flows efficiently between lenders and borrowers without centralized control. The transparent and automated nature of smart contracts removes traditional barriers, making financial services accessible to anyone worldwide. Utility Beyond Lending and Borrowing Mutuum Finance is not just about loans. The team is working on an overcollateralized stablecoin fully supported by crypto assets held within the protocol. This stablecoin aims to provide a transparent and reliable alternative to centralized options, expanding the utility of the platform significantly. Furthermore, the upcoming Layer 2 scaling solutions will enhance transaction speeds and reduce costs, making Mutuum even more user-friendly. These technical enhancements will be essential for attracting a wider user base and maintaining the platform’s long-term growth. MUTM’s tokenomics reinforce its value proposition. A share of the platform’s collected fees is used to purchase MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens are then redistributed to active users, creating a natural demand cycle and rewarding engagement. The recent influx of over $500,000 in just two days highlights the accelerating momentum behind MUTM. Its impressive presale results, along with a functional model centered on real-world DeFi services, distinguish it in a highly competitive market. Currently, Mutuum Finance is in Phase 4 of its presale, with the token priced at just $0.025. This round is close to selling out, with over 88% of the tokens already allocated. After it concludes, the price will increase by 20% in Phase 5, bringing it closer to the confirmed launch price of $0.06. So far, the project has raised over $8.6 million, with more than 10,000 holders participating in the early stages. The growing number of investors signals strong trust in both the vision and functionality of the platform. With 11 total phases planned, this structured presale allows participants to enter early and benefit from lower pricing before the token reaches broader public markets. For those looking to make a strategic move, this phase offers a rare opportunity to secure tokens before the next price increase. For investors asking what crypto to buy now or exploring the best cryptocurrencies to invest in, MUTM presents a compelling mix of low entry cost, real-world utility, and strong growth potential that’s difficult to overlook. With the presale progressing rapidly and key platform features on the horizon, MUTM is not just a token to watch—it’s becoming a strategic investment for those ready to participate early in the next wave of decentralized finance.

In a new press release, authorities allege that the unnamed Wellington man participated in a scheme that fraudulently obtained the crypto assets by manipulating victims between March and August 2024. The U.S Department of Justice (DOJ) has charged the individual with racketeering, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Twelve other people are facing charges in connection with the case, including individuals from Auckland and California. According to prosecutors, the defendants laundered the proceeds of the scheme through various cryptocurrency exchanges before spending the funds to purchase luxury items such as handbags, clothes, cars, watches, private security, rental homes and expensive nightclub entertainment. The other members of the group were recently arrested and charged by the DOJ as well. According to previous reports, the organization had a team behind them made up of hackers, callers, organizers, money launderers and residential burglars. The team has been operating as early as October 2023. Last year, two members of the group, Malone Lam and Jeandiel Serrano, were arrested and charged in connection with a plot that allegedly saw them steal $230 million in crypto from a victim and then attempt to launder the funds using advanced methods.

Bitcoin (BTC) is worth more than one kilogram of gold, but many investors still favor the latter. On Monday, May 19, MEXC COO Tracy Jin shared her insights about Bitcoin’s relative performance with crypto.news. Jin pointed out that Bitcoin traded above $106,000, which is worth more than one kg of gold. The biggest crypto asset reached a daily high of $107,089 on May 19. However, she added that the volatile macroeconomic environment still favors gold.

This divergence highlights that, in times of heightened uncertainty, institutional capital continues to favor traditional safe-haven assets. Gold remains the preferred hedge — at least for now,” Tracy Jin, MEXC. Still, gold’s strong performance could be good for Bitcoin. This is because the current macroeconomic imbalances favor assets that are seen as safe havens. What is more, Bitcoin has more space to grow, Jin points out.

Compared to traditional markets, Bitcoin has shown resilience, and investors are increasingly starting to view it as a safe haven. “Bitcoin, however, is showing resilience. The asset has posted six consecutive weeks of growth, closing near $106,500. The $105,800 level is a key resistance zone: a confirmed breakout could open the way toward $109,000, with optimistic projections reaching $130,000 in Q3 and potentially $150,000 by year-end,” Tracy Jin, MEXC. Long term, there’s still significant potential for growth, especially if investors start using Bitcoin as a safe haven and a hedge against inflation. For instance, Jin pointed out that Bitcoin’s market cap is still well below gold’s, at $2 trillion compared to $21 trillion.

The average purchase price was $103,498 per bitcoin. The transaction took place between May 12 and May 18, as evidenced by a Report 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 19. Strategy's total bitcoin holdings have now reached an impressive 576,230 BTC. Their market value exceeds $59 billion, and the average purchase price is $69,726 per bitcoin. This was reported by the company's co-founder and executive chairman, Michael Saylor. The company's total cost to acquire the cryptocurrency was about $40.2 billion, including commissions and additional expenses. An impressive figure-Strategy now owns more than 2.7% of the total bitcoin volume, which is limited to 21 million coins. At the same time, the company's unrealized gains have reached approximately $18.8 billion. Financial mechanisms of cryptocurrency portfolio expansion Strategy's recent acquisitions have been funded through the sale of its Class A common stock (MSTR) and fixed-rate preferred stock (STRK). Last week, the company sold 1,712,708 shares of MSTR, raising approximately $705.7 million. As of May 18, Strategy still has $18.98 billion worth of MSTR shares available for offering and sale under this program. It also sold 621,555 shares of STRK for approximately $59.7 million, leaving a balance for future offerings of $20.79 billion. The STRK and STRF preferred shares complement Strategy's ambitious ”42/42” plan, which aims to raise $84 billion in capital through equity and convertible bond offerings to buy bitcoin through 2027. The plan was originally called ”21/21” and was for $42 billion, but its equity portion was recently exhausted, leading to an expansion of the program.

Cantor Fitzgerald, SoftBank, Bitfinex, and Tether recently announced the planned launch of a $3.6 billion bitcoin project, Twenty One Capital.
