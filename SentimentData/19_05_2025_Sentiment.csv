According to a May 16 letter from Storm's attorneys to Judge Katherine Polk Failla, the FinCEN documents show that non-custodial crypto mixers do not fall under the legal definition of a ""money transmitting business"" and that prosecutors have known this since at least 2023. Despite having knowledge of the FinCEN guidance on crypto mixers, state prosecutors still proceeded with cases against the Samourai Wallet developers and Tornado Cash, the attorneys alleged. Letter sent by Roman Storm’s attorneys to Judge Failla. Source: Court Listener US prosecutors denied they withheld the evidence , claiming they submitted the FinCEN communications within the stipulated timeframe to produce the documents for the defense and the court during legal discovery. Storm's defense cited the same legal documents and the same argument the Samourai Wallet developer’s attorneys posed to the court in a May 5 legal letter . Storm's attorneys wrote: ""The disclosures in the Samourai case reveal that the government, at the very least, played fast and loose and, at worst, affirmatively misled this Court with its arguments about FinCEN guidance when responding to the motions to dismiss and to compel discovery."" The letter went on to argue that although the government continues to claim that the cases bear only ""superficial similarities"" to each other, they share the core characteristics of cryptocurrency mixers under the law, thus making the FinCEN documents salient to dismissing the case against Storm.

While Cardano continues to dominate conversations with its robust ecosystem and ambitious roadmap, a rising coin, Mutuum Finance, is performing well by offering innovative DeFi solutions that could challenge the status quo. At $0.025 per token in Presale Phase 4, Mutuum Finance already has more than 10,000 investors and collected a total of $8.6 million. There are fast moving adopters in this phase with more than 85% of Phase 4 already sold. If you invest in phase 4, your investment will grow by 20% by phase 5 and up to 140% at launch. For traders focused on quick gains and smart entries, understanding how MUTM stacks up against Cardano could be key to unlocking profitable opportunities. If you’re wondering which crypto to buy today for short-term success, this clash of titans might just shape your next move. Cardano’s Rise: A Journey from Promise to Power Cardano’s ascension to the top of the cryptocurrency sector has been marked by its focus on research-driven development and scalability, earning it a reputation as one of the most promising blockchain platforms in a relatively short period. Its innovative proof-of-stake consensus and commitment to sustainability saw ADA attract institutional investment and a passionate community that craved long-term growth. While its rise has been progressive and rooted in practical applications, Cardano continues to be the benchmark for fearless altcoins eager to disrupt the market. While the environment is shifting, innovative projects like Mutuum Finance are rising up to challenge established brands and offer up new prospects for investors seeking to buy the current best altcoin. Mutuum Finance Gathers Steam Investor interest in Mutuum Finance is rising fast as its presale gains serious traction. At the current price of $0.025, buyers are positioning themselves for a 20% gain when Phase 5 launches and pushes the token to $0.03. With a planned market launch at $0.06, Phase 4 investors are eyeing a potential 140% ROI. Over $8.6 million has already poured into the project from more than 10,000 backers, and that number continues to grow. The platform diverges a lot from traditional methods since it embraces its buy and distribute strategy. Using this strategy, Mutuum Finance receives the market tokens allocated to stakers, which slowly helps to increase participation as well as improving overall project economics. Besides, a constant flow of incentives is provided in order to encourage ongoing engagement. Leaderboard Rewards System Boosts Engagement The Mutuum Finance platform now has a real-time leaderboard used to showcase the top 50 MUTM holders and community engagement. Keeping their position, gives users additional motivations, thus fuelling the atmosphere of rivalry as well as loyalty which increases the overall community involvement. Security continues to be a vital objective among the team behind Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance has tapped in blockchain security pioneer CertiK to carry out a comprehensive audit of the smart contracts. After the audit is complete, it will be possible to see on Mutuum’s social networks all results, providing the users to see for themselves the safety and credibility of their investments. Mutuum Finance is rapidly gaining traction as one of the most compelling altcoins for short-term gains in 2025. At a presale price of just $0.025, with over 85% of Phase 4 sold out and $8.6 million raised from more than 10,000 investors, momentum is accelerating fast.

Chainlink Eyes $20 While Cardano Drops,https://thecoinrise.com/analysts-are-calling-web3-ai-the-best-crypto-since-bitcoin-chainlink-eyes-20-while-cardano-drops/,"A 3% drop in Cardano (ADA) hasn’t rattled the market much, as trading signals still suggest a potential recovery. On-chain metrics hint at a rebound while the sentiment holds steady. Meanwhile, Chainlink (LINK) is showing strong upside potential, with trading volume rising and resistance weakening. Analysts now suggest a $20 breakout is on the table as momentum continues to build. Away from these familiar names, Web3 ai is gaining traction among analysts who see it as a serious contender for the best-performing crypto by 2025. Unlike others still in development, Web3 ai already offers live features such as trading insights, optimized portfolio strategies, and accurate price projections. Its $WAI coin is being recognized not for speculation, but for its practical application. With $4.5 million already raised and predictions suggesting it could exceed $1, Web3 ai is now being considered for entry into the top 50 crypto projects. Web3 ai’s $WAI Eyes $1 Target Amid Growing Analyst Attention Focused on delivering AI-based solutions for traders, Web3 ai offers a unified interface where tools like real-time signals, portfolio tuning, and price forecasts come together. While others are still figuring out their direction, Web3 ai has rolled out a fully functional platform. Analysts highlight this readiness as the reason behind the growing interest in $WAI. The project is currently in stage 5 of a 50-stage presale. At present, the coin is priced at $0.000365, increasing to $0.003267 in the final stage, before listing at $0.005242. This path outlines a return of 1747% by the time of listing, prompting many to rethink their long-term crypto picks for 2025. What stands out most is that the rise in value isn’t driven by hype alone. The tools are developed for real use: smart trading moves, better timing, and stronger portfolio strategy. Rather than being a general AI project, Web3 ai zeroes in on giving crypto users real advantages. With the trend shifting to usefulness and focused AI tools, $WAI is seen by experts as a future top-tier asset. Some forecasts now place it above $1 with a strong chance of entering the top 50 cryptos. For those who follow fundamentals and utility, Web3 ai is becoming hard to ignore. Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis Shows Strong $20 Push Chainlink (LINK) is approaching a key breakout level, with leading analysts such as Michaël van de Poppe identifying $20 as a near-term target. Currently trading around $14.70, the asset has picked up momentum. RSI has reached 62, volume is up by 15%, and a 12% weekly increase in on-chain activity points to an incoming move. The broader market tailwind also supports LINK’s move. As the Nasdaq shows positive performance, digital assets like Chainlink benefit from renewed enthusiasm. If LINK breaks through the $16.50 mark, a move to $20 could come quickly. Chainlink continues to hold a key role in DeFi infrastructure, and that’s drawing increased attention from larger market players. Cardano (ADA) Sees Pullback, But Optimism Persists Cardano (ADA)’s recent 3% decline is seen more as a pause than a reversal. Many metrics suggest holders are not rushing to exit, which often points to reduced selling pressure. According to Santiment, ADA’s weighted sentiment remains positive at 1.33, indicating growing optimism. The price is currently ranging between $0.76 and $0.84. Though resistance is proving tough to break, continued positive sentiment and lower selling could push ADA above $0.84, with $0.92 as the next resistance. Those tracking mid-term gains are keeping ADA in their sights as a potential rebound story. Final Say! Although Cardano still shows signs of a rebound and Chainlink is aiming at $20 with rising support, Web3 ai’s crypto presale is what’s sparking wider interest. Priced at $0.000365 currently and heading toward $0.005242 at listing, the projected 1747% return is generating serious discussion. Its AI-led solutions offer real support for trading efficiency, price analysis, and risk-managed strategies. Web3 ai isn’t just a speculative play. Analysts now suggest $WAI could exceed $1 and claim a spot in the top 50, as the platform brings meaningful advantages in a noisy market. It’s shaping up as one of the rare presales grounded in actual use.

As more major coins enter consolidation zones, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing accelerated demand — and many analysts are calling this the last major entry window before listings take the price discovery public . JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Seeing Pre-Listing Accumulation MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the few remaining presale tokens with both clear structure and strategic upside . With a fixed listing target of $0.007 , and Stage 8 already nearing completion, traders are viewing this as the last clean shot at early-cycle positioning . Key factors driving MAGA’s momentum: Projected 25x–35x growth from current levels Distinct political narrative and identity-based branding Transparent tokenomics and imminent exchange visibility What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is not hype — it’s clarity . For Bitcoin, Cardano, and XRP holders looking for higher risk/reward ratios, MAGA offers exactly what’s missing from the large caps right now: entry-level positioning with real upside potential . Bitcoin Holds Steady as Investors Hunt for Altcoin Multipliers Bitcoin (BTC) continues to maintain its dominance in the market, consolidating above $103K with strong support. While ETF flows remain consistent and long-term targets still range between $150K and $250K , BTC’s short-term movement has flattened. For this reason, many BTC holders are reallocating portions of their portfolios into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE to balance stability with speculative opportunity . Bitcoin builds confidence — MAGA builds exponential potential. Cardano (ADA) Prepares for a Potential Breakout Cardano (ADA) is currently trading around $0.75–$0.80 , and analysts are watching closely as it nears a possible breakout above the psychological $1.00 mark. Recent updates to the network have enhanced performance and scalability, and Cardano remains a favorite among long-term blockchain investors. However, ADA is not known for rapid moves — which is why some ADA holders are moving capital into shorter-term high-reward plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE . SEI: Stable, But Yet to Ignite SEI has built a strong presence in the Cosmos ecosystem and continues to be seen as a reliable platform. While the broader infrastructure thesis remains intact, SEI has yet to ignite a full bull-phase move , and is trading in a tight range. Investors seeking faster upside are taking profits from SEI and shifting into earlier-stage tokens that still have room to run — with MAGA becoming one of the primary destinations for that capital. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE is no longer a secret — and with Stage 9 approaching fast, traders from all sides of the market are taking positions. Bitcoin holders are rotating small stacks. ADA and XRP communities are diversifying. SEI investors are looking for speed. Among all of them, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as one of the final early-stage plays with structured ROI, clear timing, and high-conviction sentiment . This may be the last low-level entry before listings go live — and those watching closely are already making their move.

Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov resists French pressure to censor Romanian election content Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov claims that he rejected requests from a high-ranking French intelligence official to censor pro-conservative voices and content on the Telegram messaging platform ahead of the presidential elections in Romania. Durov did not immediately name the French government in his initial Telegram post but later confirmed that it was French intelligence services that approached him. Durov wrote in a May 18 X post : ""This spring, at the Salon des Batailles in the Hôtel de Crillon, Nicolas Lerner, head of French intelligence, asked me to ban conservative voices in Romania ahead of elections. I refused. We did not block protesters in Russia, Belarus, or Iran — We won’t start doing it in Europe."" Durov continues to be an outspoken advocate for free speech, autonomy, privacy, and individual liberty, despite repeated threats and legal action from state officials. Source: Pavel Durov Retired artist loses $2M in crypto to Coinbase impersonator Retired artist Ed Suman lost over $2 million in cryptocurrency earlier this year after falling victim to a scam involving someone posing as a Coinbase support representative. Suman, 67, spent nearly two decades as a fabricator in the art world, helping build high-profile works such as Jeff Koons’ Balloon Dog sculptures, according to a May 17 report by Bloomberg. After retiring, he turned to cryptocurrency investing, eventually accumulating 17.5 Bitcoin and 225 Ether — a portfolio that comprised most of his retirement savings. He stored the funds in a Trezor Model One, a hardware wallet commonly used by crypto holders to avoid the risks of exchange hacks. But in March, Suman received a text message appearing to be from Coinbase, warning him of unauthorized account access. After responding, he got a phone call from a man identifying himself as a Coinbase security staffer named Brett Miller. The caller appeared knowledgeable, correctly stating that Suman’s funds were stored in a hardware wallet. He then convinced Suman that his wallet could still be vulnerable and walked him through a “security procedure” that involved entering his seed phrase into a website mimicking Coinbase’s interface. Nine days later, a second caller claiming to be from Coinbase repeated the process. By the end of that call, all of Suman’s crypto holdings were gone. Crypto scammers impersonate Coinbase support.

According to the announcement , the agency forecasts higher US government debt, fueled by increasing interest expense on the debt, and a lack of cost-cutting measures curtailing government spending. The report noted: ""Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat. In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher."" ""The US' fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to its own past and compared to other highly-rated sovereigns,"" the newly revised credit outlook predicted.

SkyEcosystem’s Risk Analysis has launched USDS stablecoin on Arbitrum, expanding Arbitrum’s utility, which will attract liquidity to the network. This integration could increase ARB usage, potentially boosting its price. Will Arbitrum reach $10? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ARB is unlikely to reach $10 before 2031.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Ethereum, and Solana Are Leading the Surge",https://thecoinrise.com/the-next-big-crypto-move-magacoin-finance-ethereum-and-solana-are-leading-the-surge/,"Introduction Crypto markets are showing renewed momentum, and a clear shift is underway. While Bitcoin holds its ground, a new set of projects is emerging as leaders in the next big move — including MAGACOIN FINANCE, Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX) . Each of these assets is capturing attention for different reasons: early-stage potential, institutional support, infrastructure dominance, or network innovation. Together, they’re creating the surge that analysts say could define the rest of the 2025 cycle. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Driving Early-Stage Capital Right Now MAGACOIN FINANCE is taking center stage as Stage 9 approaches , with investors viewing it as one of the few tokens still offering clear 25x–35x upside potential ahead of listings. Key reasons it’s leading the surge: A set listing price of $0.007 , creating price clarity Early-stage momentum while other assets consolidate A narrative and brand identity that separates it from technical Layer-1s While Ethereum and Solana handle scalability and DeFi, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out a high-return niche based on early access, timing, and exponential potential . With its presale stages nearly over, it’s gaining ground fast — and the final entry window is closing. Ethereum (ETH) Is Gearing Up for Its Institutional Phase Ethereum (ETH) remains the smart contract standard — but now it’s also preparing to become a favorite for traditional finance. With ETF discussions progressing and recent upgrades like Pectra improving scalability, ETH is set to lead the market’s infrastructure layer well into 2026. Price currently holds near $2,600 , but projections show upside to $4,000–$6,000 if inflows increase and Layer-2 adoption continues to rise. Ethereum’s role in this surge? It’s the foundation — and everything is being built on top of it. Solana (SOL) Keeps Its Momentum as the Fastest L1 Solana (SOL) is not slowing down. Currently trading around $165–$180 , it has emerged as the fastest-growing Layer-1 with a developer ecosystem that rivals Ethereum in both speed and volume. What’s driving its place in the surge: Low fees and lightning-fast throughput DeFi and NFT expansion Consistent upside potential toward $250–$400 Solana continues to attract attention from retail and institutional capital — making it a core asset for anyone betting on smart contract infrastructure during the next bull wave. Avalanche (AVAX) Rebounds on Real-World Partnerships Avalanche (AVAX) is rallying on real utility — and that’s what puts it on the top gainers list for this cycle. Recently trading around $28.35 , AVAX is gaining momentum from strong institutional interest , including partnerships with brands like MapleStory and developments involving BlackRock . Its unique subnets architecture allows for scalable enterprise adoption, and the Avalanche Summit 2025 reaffirmed its vision for on-chain innovation. Analysts see AVAX targeting the $45–$70 range if network volume continues to expand. STAGE ALMOST FULL — ACT NOW Conclusion Ethereum powers the base layer. Solana drives high-speed adoption. Avalanche brings in real-world utility. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is the one offering the final early-stage upside before listings change the equation. For those looking to catch the next big crypto move before it’s priced in, MAGACOIN FINANCE may be the only token left with both narrative strength and unclaimed ROI. With Stage 9 just ahead, smart capital is already moving — the question is, will you be ahead of the curve?

Analysts Are Positive it Will Reach $2.00 During Altcoin Season,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-ruvi-ai-ruvi-outshine-shiba-inus-shib-positive-momentum-analysts-are-positive-it-will-reach-2-00-during-altcoin-season/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB), one of the most popular meme coins, is making waves in the market again. $0.000014 , SHIB has gone up 18.59% in the last month and many are hoping it will delete a zero and reach the coveted $0.0001 mark . While SHIB tries to recreate the past, a new project is catching the attention of smart investors. Meet Ruvi , a coin that will revolutionize the market by combining blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI ). Can Ruvi be the next big thing to rival Shiba Inu? Shiba Inu’s Recent Run SHIB’s recent performance shows its strength in the crypto market: Big Jump SHIB has gone up 30% in the last month due to growing interest and adoption as part of the broader crypto hype. The Push to $0.0001 To reach this milestone, SHIB needs to go up 553.59% , a big task but many believe it can do it over time. Its path includes overcoming a massive supply of 589 trillion tokens , making its market cap a key factor. Historical Performances SHIB has gone up millions of percent in its 2021 bull run, one of the most epic stories in crypto history. While Shiba Inu continues to fight to get back to its highs, Ruvi is a project that offers unique value, different from meme coins. Introducing Ruvi Unlike Shiba Inu, Ruvi combines blockchain with AI to create practical solutions for industries like logistics, healthcare and finance. It brings functionality to the forefront instead of being driven by market hype. Why Ruvi Stands Out AI Features Ruvi has AI for predictive analytics and decision making optimization, real world value across multiple sectors. Deflationary Model With a hard cap of 5 billion tokens , Ruvi is designed to grow in scarcity, long term value for its holders. Fast Adoption Ruvi addresses key inefficiencies in traditional systems, relevance and demand beyond speculative trading.This unique approach puts Ruvi in a league of its own, for investors who want innovation and practicality. High Returns with Ruvi Ruvi has already made a strong start, completed presale phase 1 , sold over 100 million tokens , and raised $1 million . The presale has attracted more than 1,000 investors , and phase 2 is live now with tokens at $0.015 . Investment Opportunities With Ruvi’s exclusive presale bonuses, early investors can maximize their returns. Here’s how: Entry-Level Investment ($600) Tokens at $0.015 = 40,000 Bonus Tokens (20%) = 8,000 Total Tokens = 48,000 Value at $1 = $48,000 Mid-Level Investment ($2,000) Tokens at $0.015 = 133,333 Bonus Tokens (60%) = 80,000 Total Tokens = 213,333 Value at $2 = $426,666 High-Level Investment ($12,000) Tokens at $0.015 = 800,000 Bonus Tokens (100%) = 800,000 Total Tokens = 1.6 million Value at $3 = $4.8 million Ruvi has a clear and lucrative path for investors to ride the next crypto wave. Ruvi vs Shiba Inu While Shiba Inu thrives on its community and price rallies, Ruvi tackles real world problems with its AI. Shiba Inu’s quest to delete a zero is cool, but Ruvi’s all round approach makes it a cryptocurrency with longevity and transformational potential. Act Now, Don’t Miss Out Shiba Inu’s momentum is a testament to how far a cryptocurrency driven by community and market can go. But Ruvi is the next step in crypto, combining practical applications with high returns.

Bitcoin is reclaiming dominance, XRP is breaking out on regulatory clarity, and a new wave of investors is zeroing in on MAGACOIN FINANCE-a rising political altcoin that could become this year’s biggest early-stage win. With HBAR gaining traction through enterprise partnerships, the big question now: Could a $100 bet today really grow into $1 million this cycle? Let’s break down the leaders catching the market’s attention and the altcoin that’s turning heads before listings go live. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Bitcoin’s Institutional Demand Fuels $200K Ambitions Bitcoin (BTC) is holding strong above $104,000, with analysts projecting a run to $200,000 by the end of 2025. The bullish outlook is powered by a supply crunch-annual production is capped at 165,000 BTC while institutional demand, especially from ETFs and sovereign wealth funds, already exceeds new supply. Major institutions like VanEck and Standard Chartered see BTC as the anchor of the next bull cycle, with macroeconomic uncertainty and regulatory clarity driving further adoption. As miners’ reserves dwindle and retail activity softens, institutional accumulation is setting the stage for MAGACOIN FINANCE, a potential parabolic move in the months ahead . Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Early-Stage Play of 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is redefining early-stage ROI in 2025, with over $8 million raised and a presale price still under $0.001. Its capped 100 billion token supply and 45% presale allocation create real scarcity, while a viral political meme narrative and more than 20,000 holders drive organic growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE is backed by audited smart contracts and real on-chain conviction, highlighted by the largest whale presale buy of the year. Analysts are calling for a conservative 35x return, with some models suggesting 50x or more if momentum continues. Key highlights: Over $8 million raised and 20,000+ holders before listing Scarcity-driven model: 100 billion max supply, 45% in presale Audited by HashEx and backed by a fast-growing, engaged community As listings approach and each stage sells out faster, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the most talked-about presale of the cycle. For investors seeking asymmetric upside and a shot at the next breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a rare ground-floor opportunity. XRP Surges on ETF Hype and Legal Clarity XRP has surged to $2.60, marking a 20% monthly gain as the resolution of Ripple’s SEC lawsuit and speculation around a potential XRP ETF fuel investor optimism. Technical breakouts above $2.40 and rising trading volumes are driving bullish momentum, with Standard Chartered and other analysts projecting targets as high as $5.50 by year-end if ETF approval and adoption accelerate. However, XRP is not known for rapid moves — which is why some ADA holders are moving capital into shorter-term high-reward plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE . HBAR’s Enterprise Surge and Bullish Forecasts Hedera (HBAR) is gaining momentum in 2025, driven by a surge in corporate adoption and major partnerships with giants like IBM and Standard Bank. The network has processed over 20 billion transactions this year, pushing HBAR’s price forecasts as high as $0.47–$0.78 for 2025, with some analysts eyeing $1 in the long term. HBAR is positioning itself as an enterprise-grade blockchain for real-world use while investors seeking faster upside are taking profits from HBAR and shifting into MAGACOIN FINANCE, an earlier-stage token that still has room to run . JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Final Thoughts Between Bitcoin’s supply-driven rally, XRP’s regulatory breakthrough, HBAR’s enterprise adoption, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive presale, the crypto market’s next cycle is already taking shape. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the only early-stage entry still offering ground-floor potential. With strong investor demand, a clear roadmap, and listings on the horizon, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as the last 50x shot of 2025 and smart investors are already taking notice.

While meme tokens like Pepe Coin (PEPE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Dogecoin (DOGE) remain trending, a new project is steadily climbing the ranks. BlockDAG, a layer 1 blockchain network offering actual utility and infrastructure, is quickly becoming one of the top crypto coins to buy now. A mix of EVM smart contract compatibility, completed CertiK audits, and viral presale progress has helped BlockDAG stand out. Its fundamentals and delivery timeline are drawing increasing attention. BlockDAG’s presale price is locked at $0.0020 until June 13, with a confirmed launch price of $0.05. This price gap has caught the eye of early-stage buyers. With the perfect mix of media buzz and substance, BlockDAG is widely being seen as one of the top crypto coins to buy now. BlockDAG: Building a Real Use Case That Draws Attention BlockDAG has raised over $254.5 million and sold 20.7 billion BDAG coins, making it one of the most discussed launches of the year. With real utility backing it, unlike most meme tokens, BlockDAG supports EVM-based smart contracts, allowing seamless dApp migration. These capabilities place it among the top crypto coins to buy now. Following its successful CertiK audit, confidence in the project’s contract security has grown. Sales of over 17,500 miners have generated $7 million, proving that real adoption is already underway. Its current presale price of $0.0020 could lead to a 2,400% return once it lists at $0.05. This locked price is valid only until June 13, when BlockDAG (BDAG) will reveal 20 exchange names. Long-term projections suggest BDAG could reach $1, positioning it firmly among the top crypto coins to buy now. Pepe Coin (PEPE): Riding the Meme Rally with Strong Growth Pepe Coin has shown unexpected gains, with a 6% jump in the last 24 hours, and is now priced near $0.0000143. Its market cap has surged from $2.7 billion to $5.4 billion in just 30 days. Current sentiment is positive, with forecasts pointing toward $0.00004905 by month-end, potentially a 243% rise. Though speculative, its trend strength has pushed PEPE into discussions about top crypto coins to buy now for high-risk rewards. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Holding Up Against Market Swings SHIB is currently near $0.00001628 and has gained modestly over the last day. Technical indicators show bullish signs, with a potential breakout if the $0.00001750 resistance is broken. A further rise to $0.00002026 is seen as likely. Despite its volatility, SHIB’s loyal user base and positive technical signals maintain its position as one of the top crypto coins to buy now. Dogecoin (DOGE): Renewed Momentum Fuels Optimism DOGE is trading close to $0.24 after an 8% gain in 24 hours. A confirmed head and shoulders pattern, alongside a futures open interest above $1.6 billion, is fueling optimism. If upward volume continues, DOGE might approach the $0.30 mark soon. With its wide recognition and improving charts, DOGE remains among the top crypto coins to buy now for momentum seekers. Final Thoughts: Which Are the Top Crypto Coins to Buy Now? Although PEPE, SHIB, and DOGE dominate meme headlines, BlockDAG is quietly constructing a foundation for long-term relevance. From a completed CertiK audit to EVM compatibility, $7M in miner sales, and a rising user base, BlockDAG goes beyond presale hype. Priced at $0.0020 with a set listing at $0.05 and an exchange reveal scheduled for June 13, the project provides a rare opening. Those evaluating the top crypto coins to buy now should take note, BlockDAG offers both solid fundamentals and timing.

Speaking on “Fox News Sunday” Johnson said his team is “on track, working around the clock to deliver this nation-shaping legislation for the American people as soon as possible.” He noted that all 11 committees have completed their work and that they “spent less and saved more than even we’ve projected initially.” He called the bill “a once in a generation opportunity.” Source: Fox News Once the budget committee approves the measure, Johnson plans to send it to the House Rules Committee by mid-week. From there, he expects to bring it to the full House floor before the week’s end so that lawmakers can “meet our original Memorial Day deadline.” Johnson emphasized why the tight timetable matters so much. “This is the vehicle through which we will deliver on the mandate the American people gave us during the last election,” he said. He promised “historic savings for the American people, historic tax relief for American workers, [and] historic investments in border security.” He added “At the same time, we’re restoring American energy dominance, and we’re rebuilding the defense industrial base, and we’re ensuring that programs like Medicaid and SNAP are strengthened for U.S. citizens who need and deserve them and not being squandered away by illegal aliens and persons who are ineligible to receive them and are cheating the system.” Johnson stressed the importance of making Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent by 2026. He pointed out that the package would eliminate taxes on overtime and tips, fulfilling a 2024 Trump campaign pledge, and would introduce fresh tax relief for Social Security recipients. He also said it would cut taxes on “job creators,” thereby encouraging American manufacturing and production across the country. “This is a big thing. We cannot fail, and we’ll get it done for the American people,” Johnson declared. Mike Johnson faces disagreement from members of his party South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman and Texas Rep. Chip Roy have criticized Johnson for not moving faster on spending cuts. They’ve called for work requirements for able-bodied adult Medicaid recipients to start well before 2029. Johnson said that he shares their goal but worries about whether states can “retool their systems and ensure the verification process” is strong enough. “We’re working through all those details, and we’ll get it done,” he said, adding, “but I’ll tell you what, this is the largest spending reduction in at least three decades, probably longer. It’s historic.” He noted support from Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought and from “nearly 500 organizations across the conservative spectrum” that back restrictive spending. Johnson urged, “We are. This is our opportunity to do it. It’s once in a generation, as I’ve said, and we can’t squander it.” He expressed confidence that a compromise on the Medicaid work requirement would satisfy internal critics but conceded that not a single Democrat is expected to support the bill. “Which means that they will be on record apparently supporting the largest tax increase in U.S. history, which is what will happen by default after the end of this year if we do not get this job done,” Johnson said. “We have to accomplish this mission, and we will.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-18 23:04:56

Whether it was Bitcoin in 2013, Ethereum before DeFi exploded, or Immutable X during its sudden breakout moment — the pain of missed opportunities hits harder when you see where those assets are today. Immutable X delivered one of those unforgettable moments when it shifted from a niche layer-2 project to a widely adopted name in NFT scalability. Many ignored it at the start, and by the time it captured the headlines, the early gains were already claimed. It’s these kinds of missed plays that leave people hunting for the next standout — the next breakout to enter before it earns mainstream validation. That conversation today is starting to revolve around Qubetics . Qubetics is being quietly listed alongside the best performing crypto contenders of 2025 — and for good reason. It’s built not just for short-term price action, but with a structural vision that targets real blockchain limitations. Designed as a modular layer-1 blockchain, it combines developer accessibility with powerful performance. Its current presale structure adds another layer of urgency, making it clear this opportunity may not stay open much longer. The Qubetics presale is already attracting attention across trading forums and serious blockchain communities — and those watching closely see why it’s being flagged as a top crypto presale before mainnet deployment in Q2 2025. Qubetics Is Becoming the Best Performing Crypto — And You Still Have a Chance Those who got in during the initial Qubetics phase secured $TICS tokens at just $0.01 when the presale opened in September 2024. Since then, multiple early stages have passed, each representing a price point many now wish they had taken seriously. Fortunately, this isn’t one of those “too late” moments. The project is now in Stage 34, and while the price has climbed to $0.2532, the presale still sits within accessible reach for those who recognize the strategic value early. With over $17 million raised, more than 512 million tokens sold, and over 26,400 holders backing it, Qubetics is delivering metrics that validate its growing reputation as the best performing crypto prospect of the year. For participants entering now, the potential ROI scenario remains aggressive. At the current stage price, $TICS offers projected returns of 294.84% at just $1, jumping to 1,874.21% at $5, and pushing up to 2,269.05% if the asset reaches $6 post-presale. If the token hits $10 following its Q2 mainnet launch — a milestone that seems increasingly achievable — ROI would surge to 3,848.42%. For example, a $2,000 investment in Stage 34 secures approximately 7,896 tokens. If the token reaches just $6, that turns into a potential return of $47,376. With Qubetics still considered a top crypto presale, that’s a calculated bet many are now taking seriously as one of the best performing crypto setups in 2025. Beyond the metrics, Qubetics delivers value through real-world utility. The QubeQode IDE, one of its core features, empowers developers from all skill levels to build on-chain solutions. A marketing agency, for instance, can use drag-and-drop components to build token reward systems for brand loyalty campaigns without needing deep blockchain coding. Meanwhile, small businesses can use the form-based configuration to deploy secure contracts for customer subscriptions. Even educational platforms are integrating Qubetics tools using its snippet library to token-gate content and manage digital certifications — all without writing complex code. That practical edge is precisely what positions Qubetics ahead of generic blockchain narratives. It’s built for execution, not just expectation. Immutable X Proved Its Strength — But Only After the Early Stage Was Gone Immutable X emerged from the digital shadows at a time when scalability was a key problem for NFT ecosystems. Launched as a layer-2 solution to ease congestion on Ethereum, the project introduced a zero-gas-fee minting model that quickly turned heads. But its presale was mostly quiet, and only a few understood its full potential early on. At its initial price of $0.15, those who backed Immutable X during its early token generation phase saw explosive gains when it climbed past its all-time high. The token eventually peaked at over 3,000% returns during its breakout season, earning Immutable X a reputation as one of the stealth wins in blockchain scalability. Throughout its journey, Immutable X consistently expanded its ecosystem by onboarding major partners and launching integrations that validated its technical framework. From GameStop’s NFT platform to integrations with leading marketplaces, its market stance was cemented. But the truth remains: the majority only recognized its value after most of the upside was gone. The story of Immutable X is a reminder of what happens when technological merit meets late-stage hype — and how easily the early participants walk away with the biggest wins. Conclusion: Don’t Miss This One — Qubetics Might Just Be the Best Performing Crypto of 2025 In a year already crowded with hyped launches and recycled blockchain ideas, Qubetics is emerging as the project that actually checks the boxes — real innovation, verified demand, and measurable ROI potential. Those who missed out on Immutable X saw what happens when early silence turns into late-stage recognition. Qubetics isn’t waiting for that moment. It’s already building its community, driving adoption, and delivering tools like QubeQode that give both businesses and developers something real to build with. If you’re still wondering what could be the best performing crypto, this one shouldn’t stay on your watchlist much longer. Those seeking meaningful exposure still have time to join this top crypto presale before the pricing climbs again. With just a few stages remaining before its mainnet, the upside isn’t just speculation — it’s structured, time-sensitive, and already in motion. Qubetics may not be a household name yet, but it’s being watched by the ones who know where to look next.

However, they say that the new rules would not preclude Russian firms from using USDT or other stablecoins as payment or settlement tools in cross-border trade deals. USDT Trading in Russia: Under Threat? The media outlet RBC reported that the bank has issued rules ahead of its approval of trading within its crypto sandbox. The rules are set to come into force on May 26. The USDT market cap over the past month. (Source: CoinGecko) The sandbox was established with the view of allowing Russian firms to use crypto in international trade deals. It operates under the Central Bank’s supervision. Moscow is preparing to expand this sandbox in the coming weeks. This will see qualified or “super- qualified” investors given permission to trade crypto on Central Bank-approved exchange platforms. However, the bank’s latest rules set out parameters for the kind of coins investors will be allowed to trade. These rules note that coins “must not be related to securities issued by hostile issuers.” They also make note of the need to deal with projects with a foothold in “friendly countries.” Here, “hostile” refers to countries that have imposed or adhere to sanctions regimes on Russia. And “friendly” refers to nations who take a neutral stance toward Moscow. The rules also include clauses that appear to ban the use of coins that could “possibly be blocked by either the issuers themselves or the payment agents or individuals who control them.” This also appears to refer to the possibility that operators could be ordered to burn tokens belonging to Russians. A meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy could take place if the two sides come to certain agreements, Interfax reported https://t.co/KykMbJbU2I — Bloomberg (@business) May 17, 2025 Other Stablecoins Also Under Threat? The Central Bank did not explicitly name any cryptoassets in its rules, nor did it speak directly about a possible USDT ban. But experts concur that most popular USD-pegged stablecoins would not fit the bank’s requirements. Georgy Gukasyan, Director of the Tax and Legal Department at DRT (formerly Deloitte’s Russian Branch), said that the Central Bank’s definitions were “quite broad and may cover some stablecoins.” Mikhail Uspensky, a member of Russia’s expert council on crypto regulation, said USDT “does not meet the bank’s new criteria, meaning it will not be able to circulate in Russia.” Uspensky added that the bank has been working on the regulations for some time. And he also noted that “the use of stablecoins in international settlements is not prohibited.” Elvira Nabiullina, Governor of the Russian Central Bank. (Source: Bank of Russia/YouTube/Screenshot) KYC Complications Gukasyan, meanwhile, explained that Tether’s obligations to provide fiat US dollars to USDT holders “only exist for a certain group of token holders.” He explained that in order to claim dollars, USDT token holders must pass Know-Your-Customer and Anti-Money Laundering protocols. But these same protocols, Gukasyan said, are “fully compliant” with sanctions imposed on Russia. He said that this means that Tether, “at its sole discretion,” could “refuse to redeem” coins belonging to people who fail to pass its verification checks. Gukasyan said that the USDT issuer also has the ability to block tokens located “in the wallet of any user, at its sole discretion, at any time.” The expert pointed at the case of the Russian Garantex crypto exchange as an example. In March this year, American authorities took control of Garantex’s domains and froze $26 million worth of funds . Tether cooperated with the Washington crackdown, freezing millions of USDT tokens held in Garantex wallets.

MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Surging as Ethereum, Solana, and XRP Stall",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/2025s-must-have-crypto-magacoin-finance-is-surging-as-ethereum-solana-and-xrp-stall/,"Introduction Crypto markets are heating up – and with Bitcoin’s recent breakout, altcoins are riding the wave. But beneath the headlines, a new batch of tokens is beginning to gain real traction ahead of the next explosive cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE, Ethereum, Solana, and TON are all drawing serious attention as momentum builds across both established leaders and bold new contenders. With each project showing signs of strategic positioning, technical strength, or early-stage investor demand, the next moonshot might already be in play. Here’s a breakdown of the four coins analysts are tracking now. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW Ethereum’s Growth Slows as Investors Seek Higher Multiples Ethereum is trading around $1,826 and continues to attract institutional capital, but its growth has cooled compared to previous cycles. While ETH remains a core holding for many, retail and high-risk investors are increasingly shifting to projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE in search of higher returns. Analysts expect moderate gains for Ethereum this quarter, but the spotlight is clearly shifting toward early-stage opportunities with stronger upside potential. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Be the Breakout of the Year MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most talked-about early-stage entries of 2025. Built around a politically charged, pro-investor narrative, it has already secured a wave of demand – and Stage 8 is now reaching peak activity. With a clear listing target of $0.007 and a structure designed for long-term ROI, MAGACOIN FINANCE is no meme – it’s a message, and investors are responding. Key drivers include sharp price potential and limited entry time, strategic branding that connects with a passionate market base, and growing analyst support pointing to 25x–35x upside. As early access narrows, insiders are treating MAGACOIN FINANCE as a serious shot at breakout-level gains before exchanges go live. For those seeking asymmetric returns, this is where speculation meets structure. Solana Holds Steady Amid DeFi Expansion Solana (SOL) is consolidating near $147, reflecting a steady climb but facing resistance at $150. The network’s DeFi ecosystem and developer activity remain strong, yet the pace of gains has slowed as traders look for more aggressive growth elsewhere. If Solana can break above $150, targets of $155–$160 are in play, but for now, the most dramatic momentum is happening outside the top Layer-1s. TON (Toncoin) Quietly Climbs Into the Spotlight Toncoin (TON) is trading just above $3 and maintaining a bullish trend, supported by its integration with Telegram and a growing user base. Technical indicators suggest a breakout could push TON toward the $4–$6 range in the coming months. While not as loud as other narratives, TON’s steady progress and ecosystem expansion have analysts calling it a sleeper candidate for a major run-up in 2025. CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST Conclusion With Bitcoin setting the tone, the altcoin space is becoming increasingly competitive – and focused. Projects like Solana and Ethereum offer strength through ecosystem maturity and institutional growth, while TON and MAGACOIN FINANCE offer high-upside opportunities for those looking earlier in the curve. MAGACOIN FINANCE is rising as one of the most aggressive early entries, capturing momentum, attention, and serious buyer interest just as Stage 8 heats up. For those watching the market closely, the next moonshot may already be taking shape – and this could be the moment to catch it.

Traders lift their end-of-year Bitcoin price targets to $200,000 based on technical factors and institutional investor adoption. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has been stuck in a narrow range for the past few days, but the rally above $105,500 on May 18 increases the possibility of an upside breakout. Popular trader Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin could soar to $116,000 early next week. Another bullish voice was that of Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. While speaking to Cointelegraph, Hougan said that a supply shock due to increased institutional demand could propel Bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of 2025. He expects seller exhaustion to occur at the $100,000 level. Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360 Although Bitcoin remains strong, select analysts are shifting their focus to altcoins as they believe an altcoin season could be around the corner . Crypto analyst Javon Marks said in a post on X that altcoins, excluding Ether ( ETH ), could “deliver one of their most powerful runs since 2017!” Could Bitcoin and altcoins continue their move higher? Let’s look at the cryptocurrencies that are showing strength on the charts. Bitcoin price prediction Bitcoin remains stuck in a range, but the bulls are trying to overcome the overhead resistance at $105,820. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Both moving averages are sloping up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the overbought zone, signaling that the buyers hold the edge. A break and close above $105,820 increases the likelihood of a retest of the $109,588 level. Sellers will try to defend the $109,588 resistance, but if the bulls prevail, the BTC/USDT pair could skyrocket to $130,000. Alternatively, a sharp drop below $100,000 signals that the bears have seized control. That may tempt several short-term bulls to book profits, pulling the pair toward the 50-day simple moving average ($91,447). BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair has broken out of the symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart, indicating that buyers are in control. There is resistance at $105,820, but it is likely to be crossed. If that happens, the pair could march toward the all-time high of $109,588 and thereafter to the pattern target of $110,922. Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to pull the price back into the triangle. If that happens, the aggressive bulls may get trapped, pulling the pair to $100,000. If this level also cracks, the drop could extend to the target objective of $95,616. Ether price prediction Ether dipped back below the breakout level of $2,550, but the bears are struggling to sustain the lower levels. ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($2,275) and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the price closes above $2,550, the bulls will try to strengthen their position by pushing the ETH/USDT pair above $2,739. If they manage to do that, the pair could surge toward $3,000. The first sign of weakness will be a break below the $2,400 level. That could pull the pair to the 20-day EMA, which is a critical level to watch out for. A break below the 20-day EMA suggests the bulls are losing their grip. ETH/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls pushed the price above the moving averages, indicating demand at lower levels. If buyers pierce the downtrend line, the up move could reach $2,739. A break and close above $2,739 could resume the uptrend. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the downtrend line and breaks below $2,400, it signals that the bulls are rushing to the exit. That could start a deeper correction to $2,270 and then to $2,111. Hyperliquid price prediction Hyperliquid (HYPE) is facing resistance at $28.50, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded much ground to the bears. HYPE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone indicate that the buyers are in command. A break and close above $28.50 could catapult the HYPE/USDT pair toward $35.73. If the price turns down sharply from $28.50, it signals that the bears are aggressively defending the level. The pair could then slide to the 20-day EMA ($23.52), which is likely to attract buyers. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will strive to clear the overhead resistance. HYPE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair is finding support at the 50-SMA on the 4-hour chart, indicating buying on dips. The bulls will try to strengthen their position by pushing the price above the $28.50 level. If they do that, the pair could rally to $31.33. Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-SMA, it implies that the bulls are booking profits in a hurry. That could sink the pair to $24 and later to the solid support at $23.

XMR/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The shallow pullback of the past few days shows that the bulls are hanging onto their positions as they anticipate another leg higher. If the price continues higher and breaks above $353, the XMR/USDT pair could skyrocket to $391 and then to the target objective of $422. The immediate support on the downside is at $331. A break and close below $331 could pull the pair down to the 20-day EMA ($308). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend. XMR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair is finding support at the 50-SMA, but the bulls are struggling to push the price above the overhead resistance at $353. If the price turns down and breaks below the 50-SMA, the pair could start a deeper correction to $317 and then to $300. On the contrary, a break and close above $353 signals the resumption of the uptrend. The pair could march toward $391, where the bears are expected to step in. Aave price prediction Aave ( AAVE ) is facing resistance at the $240 level, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip to the 20-day EMA ($206). That suggests buying on every minor dip. AAVE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price closes above $240, the AAVE/USDT pair could start the next leg of the up move. The pair could rise to $280, which may act as a resistance, but if the bulls persist, the next stop could be $300. Sellers will have to drag the price below the 20-day EMA to prevent the upside. If they can pull it off, the pair could tumble to the crucial support at $196. Buyers are expected to vigorously defend the $196 level. AAVE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair has been consolidating between $217 and $240 for some time. The 20-EMA has started to turn up, and the RSI has risen into the positive zone, signaling an advantage to buyers. A break and close above $240 could drive the pair to $267. On the other hand, if the price turns down from $240, it suggests that the bears are fiercely defending the level. That could keep the pair stuck between $240 and $217 for some time. Sellers will have to tug the price below $217 to signal a comeback. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Some projects are making waves with AI upgrades, strong price trends, and huge giveaways. From presales with potential 600x returns to blockchains hitting new usage records, this list includes four of the top crypto coins gaining attention now. Each one has its own strength, some stand out due to advanced tech, others through strong trading activity. But Unstaked seems to be leading the pack. With over $6.1 million raised and a $1 million reward campaign, it’s drawing serious attention. Here’s why these four names are being counted among the top crypto coins this May, and why Unstaked may be the one everyone remembers. 1. Unstaked: $1M Giveaway and a 600x Upside Unstaked is getting a lot of attention as one of the top crypto coins this month. Now in Stage 12 of its presale, Unstaked ($UNSD) is priced at $0.008997 and expected to list at $0.1819, pointing to a base 20x return. But that’s just the start, analysts see long-term value reaching $5, offering a possible 600x gain for early participants. The hype isn’t just price-driven. Unstaked is powered by a “Proof of Intelligence” system, where users set up AI agents to work across Telegram, X, and other platforms. These agents earn $UNSD based on how well they perform. And here’s the kicker: these AI agents will go live after launch. What’s unique is that 60% of the supply is open to the public, no private allocations or VC control. Plus, Unstaked is running a $1 million giveaway. Anyone buying $100+ worth of $UNSD and completing simple social tasks gets entered to win one of 20 prizes worth $50,000 in tokens. So far, over $6.1 million has been raised. The last $2 million came in just 48 hours. Add a working AI setup and $20 million planned for launch liquidity, and it’s clear why Unstaked is leading the top crypto coins right now. 2. Toncoin: Whale Activity Signals Gains Toncoin is trading at $3.29 after hitting $3.54 earlier in May. It might seem quiet, but whales are buying again. A big shift also happened, the Toncoin Bridge, which let users move TON to Ethereum and BNB Chain, officially shut down on May 10. This move signals renewed focus on its native chain and may lead to key updates. Experts now expect a move to $4.35 by May 17, which would be a 30% gain. That makes Toncoin one of the top crypto coins for short-term trades. With active on-chain metrics and a strong developer base, Toncoin is showing signs of another upward trend. 3. Arbitrum: Token Unlock in Sight Arbitrum has had a bumpy ride. The price of ARB sits at $0.42 after a sharp drop this year, but it just jumped 51% in a few days. As one of the largest Layer 2 networks with over $11.49 billion in TVL, it still holds strong. New apps like PlayElumia continue launching on the platform. The big news? On May 16, 92.65 million ARB tokens worth about $43 million will unlock. This could cause volatility, but some traders are eyeing $0.58 next, a 29% move up. Despite short-term swings, Arbitrum remains one of the top crypto coins for Layer 2 scaling thanks to real usage and a growing app base. 4. Avalanche: Strong Breakout and Record Use Avalanche is breaking out in both price and network activity. After months of quiet trading, AVAX surged 40% this week and now sits at $24.08. It broke out of a cup-and-handle pattern, with $32 as the next resistance level. What’s more impressive? On May 11, Avalanche hit 10.8 million daily transactions and 950,000 active addresses, the highest in almost two years. This spike comes from DeFi platforms, NFTs, and games all building on the chain. Some traders are watching for a pullback to $22.20, but many are calling AVAX one of the top crypto coins this cycle. Its strong activity and clear growth make it hard to ignore. Unstaked Leads the Pack Toncoin is shifting focus to its main chain. Arbitrum is approaching a major token unlock. Avalanche is breaking records in traffic and usage. But among these top crypto coins , Unstaked still stands out. At $0.008997, with long-term forecasts aiming at $5, the upside is clear. The platform offers more than price growth, it features real AI tools, a presale open to all, and a $1 million giveaway pulling in fresh buyers daily. Its Proof of Intelligence model and post-launch AI agent utility make it more than just a presale project, it’s a working product with traction. If you’re watching the top crypto coins right now, Unstaked may be your front-runner. Don’t wait too long, its stages won’t last forever.

Pseudonymous analyst Inmortal tells his 232,300 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum’s market structure on the three-day chart looks very similar to its early 2020 price action. Five years ago, ETH traded between $100 and $200 before the Covid-induced panic ignited a crash to around $86. The downside deviation subsequently triggered a massive rally that sent Ethereum to its all-time high of $4,868. Says Inmortal, “History rhymes, sometimes.” Source: Inmortal/X Looking closer at ETH, Inmortal predicts that Ethereum will continue to consolidate at current levels before sparking surges to $3,800 next month. “Remember who you are, ETH.” Source: Inmortal/X At time of writing, ETH is trading for $2,479. Turning to Ethereum rival Solana, the trader thinks that SOL will take a breather in the coming weeks before launching a rally to a new record high of $320 in July. “$180 is the line on the sand, but it won’t take long to get through it. After that, $320.” Source: Inmortal/X At time of writing, SOL is trading for $165. Inmortal is also outlining Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) potential path to a new all-time high. “$102,000 [to] $96,000 [to] $120,000” Source: Inmortal/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $103,244.

The Zamoskvoretsky District Court of Moscow approved a request from investigators to keep Smerkis in custody while he is being investigated, Russian state-owned news outlet TASS reported on May 18. Smerkis — who previously ran operations for Binance in Russia — is suspected of committing fraud on a “large scale,” pursuant to Article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, violations of which can result in imprisonment ranging from two to 12 years. It isn’t clear if charges have been filed against Smerkis. Russian news outlet Mash tied the fraud allegations against Smerkis to his involvement in The Token Fund and Tokenbox crypto ventures that he co-founded in 2017, where investors reportedly suffered combined losses of around $15 million. Blum, which is not involved in The Token Fund and Tokenbox ventures, wrote to X on May 18 that Smerkis resigned from his role as the firm’s chief marketing officer and would no longer be involved in the project in any capacity. Source: Blum Blum said its team remains fully committed and focused on its goals and that its day-to-day operations would continue as usual. Blum is a crypto project that integrates a decentralized exchange into Telegram Mini Apps, enabling users to trade crypto, earn rewards and participate in token airdrops. No Smerkis, no BLUM token? The incident sparked concerns that Blum’s token airdrop won’t follow through as planned. In an April 3 X post, Blum hinted at a potential BLUM token listing in the third quarter of this year. Blum users could receive BLUM tokens by earning Blum points in its newly launched Drop Game, where users tap on snowflakes falling from their mobile phone screen, and convert those points into tokens during the project’s slated token generation event . Related: Pavel Durov rejects EU pressure to censor Romanian election content However, the news of Smerkis’ arrest appears to have shaken community confidence that the BLUM token airdrop will happen. “Blum owes its users a clarification on the planned airdrop,” one X user and Blum community member said , while crypto influencer RK Gupta added : “No airdrop.

XRP, Ethereum, and MAGACOIN FINANCE Are Pulling in the Smartest Capital",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/100-to-1-million-xrp-ethereum-and-magacoin-finance-are-pulling-in-the-smartest-capital/,"Introduction As capital rotates across the crypto landscape in 2025, seasoned investors are focusing on the assets with the clearest upside and strongest narratives. While Bitcoin’s dominance remains unchallenged, the real growth stories are unfolding in the altcoin space, where the smartest capital is now flowing. At the top of that shortlist: Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and early-stage contender MAGACOIN FINANC E , each offering a unique angle on infrastructure, payments, and high-momentum entry. NEAR Protocol is also beginning to attract attention as it quietly builds out its ecosystem and developer base. In a market defined by selectivity and structure, these are the projects analysts say could deliver the next wave of exponential returns. STAGE ALMOST FULL — ACT NOW XRP: Institutional Liquidity and Real-World Payments XRP remains above $2.30, supported by legal clarity, growing adoption in global payments, and the potential for CME futures integration. Analysts now view XRP as the infrastructure layer for digital liquidity, with price targets ranging from $5 to $15 in the short term, and even higher if ETF approval and institutional inflows accelerate. As one of the few large caps with both regulatory clarity and real-world use, XRP is a cornerstone for investors seeking both credibility and upside. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Being Called the Final Major Entry of 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as a top watchlist pick for early-stage investors as Stage 8 nears completion and exchange listings draw closer. With a locked listing price of $0.007, offering something rare in today’s market: a transparent upside model, a capped 100 billion token supply, and a politically charged brand that’s fueling real demand. Analysts are projecting a 25x–35x ROI from current entry, with some models suggesting even greater potential if momentum continues. Unlike large caps, MAGACOIN still gives investors the chance to enter before major catalysts, mirroring early DOGE or SHIBA entry mechanics but with tighter supply and price clarity. As capital rotates out of slower moving majors, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as one of the only tokens still offering 2021 style breakout potential in a more mature 2025 landscape. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Strength and ETF Momentum Ethereum (ETH) continues to serve as the backbone of crypto’s technical infrastructure. With recent upgrades like Pectra and ongoing ETF speculation, ETH is trading near $2,600, with analysts targeting a move to $4,000–$6,000 in the coming months. Ethereum’s utility spans DeFi, NFTs, and Layer-2s, making it indispensable for both retail and institutional portfolios. As institutional access edges closer to reality, ETH is poised to move in tandem with Bitcoin’s next leg up, while also serving as a springboard for capital into higher-risk, higher-reward projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. NEAR Protocol Quietly Builds Momentum NEAR Protocol is quietly gaining traction in 2025, as its developer ecosystem expands and new integrations drive user growth. While not yet in the spotlight like ETH or XRP, NEAR’s scalable architecture and focus on usability are positioning it as a sleeper candidate for the next breakout. Analysts are watching for a potential surge as more capital seeks out undervalued, high-utility networks. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST Conclusion The smartest capital in crypto is moving beyond Bitcoin, seeking the next wave of exponential returns in tokens with clear narratives and strong fundamentals. Ethereum and XRP offer scale and stability, while NEAR provides a quietly growing alternative. But among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the only token currently offering true early-stage upside, a transparent growth path, and price levels that haven’t yet caught up with market potential. With Stage 8 nearly full and listings approaching, this may be the final major entry point before MAGACOIN FINANCE joins the top tier of traded tokens.

The meeting occurs as both economies feel the strain of rising trade barriers and shifting global alliances. Vance’s office said the two leaders spoke candidly about restoring fair trade between our countries. Canada has groused about new US levies on agricultural goods and metals, and the United States has lashed out at Canada over tech and dairy. Carney’s office did not comment on whether the leaders spoke and said they discussed efforts to work toward a ‘balanced’ economic relationship and a trading system based on rules. The two sides said they would continue to consult and look for ways to reduce trade friction. The trade dispute rattling manufacturers and exporters on both sides of the border is merely one element of a broader cross-border pattern of global economic anxiety. Sunday’s meeting was a step toward de-escalation, but no specific policies were released. Vance and Carney address security and border issues The Rome meetings were about more than just trade. In a united front response to key regional and world issues, Vance and Carney also addressed border security, the opioid crisis, and military spending . Among the topics of discussion was the increase in fentanyl trafficking. The two pledged more cooperation in the interception of drug shipments and dismantling smuggling networks. The United States has experienced a surge in fentanyl-related deaths, and there have been urgent appeals for international action. Defense and security cooperation was also a focus. Carney and Vance reaffirmed their country’s commitment to NATO and discussed boosting defense spending as global tensions have mounted- from Eastern Europe to the Indo-Pacific. Both countries are exploring opportunities to modernize their militaries to help Ukraine and deter aggression from authoritarian states. Migration and border control were also addressed. Both leaders recognized the need to secure their common border without impacting trade and people’s movement. There are said to be discussions on joint patrols and data sharing. Leaders use Vatican gatherings to advance talks The encounter between Vance and Carney occurred on the periphery of a historical religious and diplomatic event: the first mass of Pope Leo XIV celebrated in St Peter’s Basilica. The ceremony attracted heads of state, diplomats, and religious leaders worldwide, offering an ideal environment for hushed side encounters and renewed conversation. Vance also met in Rome and held talks with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who is trying to mediate between the United States and the European Union. The discussions focused on global trade realignment, sustainable development, and financing climate. A large dose of multilateral diplomacy has come around this weekend, allowing the leaders to align their positions ahead of the G7 summit in June. The Vance-Carney encounter is part of a North American leader’s push to show a united front on trade, security, and global cooperation. While no immediate breakthroughs came out of Sunday’s meeting, it underscored the importance of diplomacy and dialogue. Negotiators for both sides said that follow-up talks would occur in the coming weeks and could lead to formal negotiations.

Here’s Another Cheap Token Under $0.05 to Invest in Now,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/already-a-shiba-inu-holder-heres-another-cheap-token-under-0-05-to-invest-in-now/,"Shiba Inu holders have already seen the power of low-cost tokens delivering massive returns. As the crypto market trends upward once again, attention is shifting to a new batch of cheap cryptocurrencies that are showing strong setups, growing communities, and early adoption potential. Mutuum Finance is currently in Presale Phase 4 which is over 85% sold out, already raking in over $8.6 million with over 10,000 investors participating. Investors have less time before this phase concludes. With a public launch price of $0.06 after upcoming stages, phase 4 investors at the current price of $0.025 are in line for potential gains of 140% by the time the token hits exchanges. MUTM is quietly building momentum while remaining accessible to retail investors looking to maximize upside without breaking the bank. Mutuum Finance: Genuine Innovation in DeFi Lending Different from the legacy tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) distinguishes itself through its innovative dual-lending model, combining Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality. With P2C, users can freeze stablecoins in smart contract pools where interest rates adjust dynamically. The P2P model, by contrast, removes intermediaries, giving users full control over their lending agreements. This combination creates a flexible and efficient lending system, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a strong coin for those considering what crypto to invest in or looking for the best crypto to invest in within the changing DeFi market. Security and transparency are built into the core of the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being third-party audited, and their open-source smart contracts are secure in design while creating trust among users. The platform Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also set to be compatible with non-EVM and EVM blockchains, and the gates swing wider with more liquidity in other ecosystems. Presale Momentum At today’s $0.025, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token is of huge interest to early investors. A Phase 20% price jump in phase 5 will give the token a boost to $0.03. With a listing price of $0.06 and some analysts predicting post-launch prices of up to $3, there’s plenty of room for early investors to make a profit. This has made Mutuum Finance (MUTM) one of the most-watched low-market-price DeFi plays. Gamified Ecosystem and Community Incentives Mutuum Finance is also gamifying the user interface with a leaderboard of the top 50 holders of tokens, who are to be rewarded with additional MUTM tokens. On top of that, there is a $100,000 giveaway going on, with ten winners selected to each receive $10,000 in tokens. There is also a referral program running, which rewards users for helping to grow the platform through organic, grassroots outreach. Shiba Inu may have sparked the meme coin movement, but savvy investors are already eyeing the next wave of high-upside, low-cost tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Now in Phase 4 of its presale, this DeFi project has raised over $8.6 million from 10,000+ investors, and more than 85% of tokens in this round are already sold. At $0.025, early buyers could see up to 140% gains by the time it hits its $0.06 launch price, and that’s before potential upside beyond launch. The window to secure this token at entry-level prices is closing fast. Don’t miss your chance to get in before the next 20% price jump, because by the time the crowd realizes it, the best seats will already be taken.

MAGACOIN FINANCE is accelerating rapidly, with Stage 8 of its presale nearly sold out and investor interest at an all-time high. As capital rotates out of consolidating majors, Kaspa (KAS) is also emerging as a project to watch. Here’s why investors are shifting their focus – and where the next breakout could come from. Bitcoin: Steady as the Market’s Anchor Bitcoin (BTC) remains the foundation of the crypto market, currently trading in a tight range above $104,000. While ETF inflows and institutional demand continue to provide support, price action has been subdued as the market awaits a clear catalyst. Historically, these periods of consolidation have preceded major moves, but for now, BTC’s stability is encouraging capital to explore more dynamic opportunities. THE MOST-WATCHED PRESALE OF 2025 – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Stage 8 Demand Surges as Market Rotates As the broader crypto market cools, MAGACOIN FINANCE is experiencing a surge in momentum. With its listing price set at $0.007 and Stage 8 nearing its limit, the project is quickly being recognized as a premier early-stage opportunity for those seeking substantial returns in 2025. What’s fueling this rapid rise: Clearly structured tokenomics and a limited window for early participation Confident positioning ahead of upcoming exchange launches A distinctive brand and narrative, setting it apart from the typical meme and Layer-1 tokens MAGACOIN FINANCE’s growth is driven by more than just hype – its robust design is attracting capital from slower-moving assets. As Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP continue to consolidate, investors are seeking out projects with greater near-term upside, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as the standout option. Ethereum: Awaiting Its Next Big Move Ethereum (ETH) is also in a holding pattern, trading near $2,600 as investors look for the next catalyst. The recent Pectra upgrade and ongoing ETF speculation have strengthened ETH’s long-term outlook, but short-term momentum has slowed. As a result, some capital is rotating into earlier-stage projects with sharper growth potential, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. Kaspa: Quietly Gaining Ground Kaspa (KAS) is quietly building momentum, with its efficient proof-of-work model and growing developer ecosystem drawing new attention. Trading near $0.13, KAS is being watched as a potential breakout candidate, especially as more investors seek alternatives to the large caps currently consolidating. PRICE COULD SKYROCKET 35x FROM HERE – ACT NOW Final Thoughts With the majors in a consolidation phase, the spotlight is turning to projects with clear upside and strong fundamentals. MAGACOIN FINANCE is taking off as Stage 8 nears completion, offering a rare early-stage entry point as listings approach. As capital continues to rotate, smart investors are positioning themselves ahead of the next wave. The opportunity is narrowing – and those watching closely know now is the time to act.

In the days leading up to the Consensus event, Pi Network saw a speculative rally, jumping more than 150% to $1.50 amid rumors of a major ecosystem announcement scheduled for May 14. However, when no big update was delivered, the token’s value quickly reversed course. As of this writing, Pi has dropped more than 70% from its peak. Daily trading volume also declined by over 44%, suggesting reduced buying interest. Analysts warn that without a major catalyst, Pi could return to its historical low of $0.40. Adding to investor frustration was the announcement of Pi Network Ventures, a $100 million investment initiative aimed at funding decentralized applications and ecosystem projects. While this was initially viewed as a positive step, community confidence waned when the Pi Core Team stated that the fund could be paused or canceled at any time. Transparency and Accountability Needed According to Dr. Altcoin, a crypto analyst, the issue lies in unclear communication and repeated delays by the Pi Core Team. “The promise of 100 DApps was not just a bonus—it was essential,” Dr. Altcoin said. “Without real utility, Pi risks becoming just another overhyped token.” He stressed the difference between speculative “memecoins” and functional ecosystems, urging the Pi team to shift from promotion to performance. The analyst estimates it may take another 2.5 to 5 years for Pi Network to fully deliver on its ecosystem goals. While he remains positive about the project’s long-term success, he stresses that it won’t happen on the original timeline the community expected.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-19 01:31:10

XRP and Solana are showing strength. But the real buzz among sharp investors right now isn’t about large caps — it’s about the one project they believe still offers life-changing upside before listings : MAGACOIN FINANCE . With Stage 9 on the horizon and a structured listing model targeting $0.007 , MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming the preferred early-stage entry for those rotating out of Bitcoin (BTC), XRP, Solana (SOL) , and even TRON (TRX) . The goal? High-conviction positioning before the next leg of this bull cycle erupts. PRICE COULD SKYROCKET 35x FROM HERE – ACT NOW MAGACOINFINANCE Is Emerging as the Last Life-Changing Play MAGACOIN FINANCE has now crossed from “new altcoin” status to top early-stage candidate for those seeking 25x–35x returns . As capital moves out of high-market-cap assets and into presale opportunities, MAGA has become the go-to choice. Why smart money is rotating into MAGA: Clearly defined listing target at $0.007 Stage-based growth aligned with predictable tokenomics Bold, narrative-driven branding that cuts through market noise With Stage 9 approaching and major listings looming, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers one of the last true early-stage setups left in the current market cycle. Bitcoin (BTC) Strengthens the Base Layer Bitcoin is holding above $103K , and ETF demand continues to drive institutional flows. While Bitcoin’s trajectory toward $150K–$250K is intact, its role in investor portfolios is shifting — from high-growth to foundational stability . Investors who saw huge returns from BTC in past cycles are now rotating a portion of that capital into more aggressive positions like MAGACOIN FINANCE, aiming to leverage BTC’s strength to fund high-upside altcoin plays . XRP Is Breaking Out, but Capital Is Seeking Higher Multipliers XRP remains one of the strongest payment utility tokens on the market, with price maintaining above $2.30 and projections stretching toward $10–$15 . Its long-term credibility is now reinforced by regulatory clarity and upcoming CME futures integration . That said, many XRP holders are looking beyond 5x or 10x returns , and instead are targeting the kind of 20x–30x potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is offering right now — especially before listings limit that upside. Solana (SOL) Continues to Climb, But Entry Is Tightening Solana (SOL) continues to be one of the most powerful Layer-1 performers in 2025, trading in the $170–$180 range. But after a strong multi-month run, new buyers are facing limited near-term upside. For that reason, Solana investors are looking for fresh presale entries , and MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the structure, timing, and explosive potential to complement their infrastructure-heavy holdings. TRON (TRX) Holds Strong, But Momentum Is Elsewhere TRON (TRX) has quietly maintained stability in the $0.27 range, primarily due to its strong presence in the stablecoin and DeFi transfer markets. While consistent, it’s not offering the kind of breakout upside seen in early-stage projects. TRX holders are now reallocating into MAGA to capture exposure to higher-velocity growth , especially before Stage 9 shifts the price curve even higher. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE Conclusion The strategy is clear: use the strength and profits from Bitcoin, XRP, Solana, and TRON — and rotate into the only early-stage altcoin still offering life-changing potential . MAGACOIN FINANCE is no longer under the radar . With a set listing price, clean tokenomics, and a rising market narrative, this project is being embraced by smart investors as the final window to capture a 25x–35x before listings go live.

The technical setup supports more gains, but only if this resistance level turns into a base. The Stellar (XLM) price forecast is also gaining attention, with XLM up more than 50% since April. A potential rise to $0.64 is in view, although it depends on sustained momentum and the outcome of ETF speculation. While both projects are reacting to current conditions, BlockDAG (BDAG) is building in a different way. Now in the final presale stages, BDAG has raised more than $254.5 million. Its Buyer Battles distribute 150 million BDAG daily, rewarding the top participant with the unsold share. With 20 exchange listings confirmed and the $0.0020 price ending June 13, BlockDAG is shaping how many are answering the question: which crypto to buy today. HYPE Price Surge Pushes Toward a Breakout Beyond $26.50 The recent 170% climb in the Hyperliquid (HYPE) price surge has brought renewed interest to the token. Now trading just under $26.50, HYPE has returned to levels not seen since its 2024 high, sparking new speculation about a possible breakout. Market indicators are supporting the trend. Both RSI and MACD show bullish signals, and the chart setup points to continued momentum. This Hyperliquid (HYPE) price surge also fits a broader impulsive move, which may still be developing. If HYPE can flip the $26.50 level into solid support, analysts see a path toward $35.30. Stellar (XLM) Price Forecast Projects 105% Rise If Momentum Continues The Stellar (XLM) price forecast has turned strongly positive as price action lines up with increasing market interest. Now trading around $0.32, XLM has jumped more than 50% from its April low. The move has broken a falling wedge and crossed neckline resistance in an inverse head and shoulders pattern. Analysts now point to a possible rise to $0.64, marking a 105% increase from current levels, assuming support stays firm. This Stellar (XLM) price forecast is backed by network activity, more stablecoin use, and growing talk of a potential XLM ETF. As long as $0.20 support holds, both technical and market signals suggest more upside may be on the way. Why 150M BDAG Is Moving Daily: What’s Driving Buyers to BlockDAG Most crypto presales move slowly. BlockDAG has changed that pattern. Its Buyer Battles system puts a daily amount of BDAG into play. If all coins are not bought within 24 hours, the leftover amount goes to the day’s highest buyer. The daily pool has now been raised to 150 million BDAG, responding directly to growing interest. That volume does not shift unless demand is real. And clearly, it is. With $254.5 million raised and 20.6 billion coins sold so far, BlockDAG’s presale is moving faster than expected. Every day offers a new start. And the timeline matters more now. With 20 exchange listings scheduled to be revealed on June 13, more participants are joining each round. That same date also marks the end of the $0.0020 fixed price, which is far lower than the current $0.0262 rate in batch 28. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles are not random rewards. They are built to create consistent activity. As the project nears a public launch, the chance to gain from this model is narrowing. Some forecasts see BDAG reaching $1, then $5, and eventually $10. But even without those long-term targets, the current math shows that those moving early in each cycle are already gaining an edge. Which Crypto to Buy Today? Compare the Structures Behind the Hype Gains are not only about price spikes. They also depend on how systems are set up. The 170% Hyperliquid (HYPE) price surge has brought attention to its $26.50 resistance level. Meanwhile, the Stellar (XLM) price forecast shows over 50% growth since April, with another 105% rise possible if it hits $0.64. Both of these coins are being driven by short-term price patterns and momentum. BlockDAG offers a different answer to the question, which crypto to buy today . With Buyer Battles allocating 150 million BDAG every day, the setup creates a race where the top buyer receives any unsold coins.

At the time of writing, HBAR is trading at $0.19. The HBAR price chart has possibly formed a five-wave upward pattern starting from the April low. In simple terms, this means the price made five moves up in a sequence — a pattern that often suggests a strong market trend. A larger market correction may have ended around April 7. Since then, the price appears to have moved higher, beginning a new uptrend. This recent rise could be wave 1 of a bigger bullish move. Correction Phase Likely Underway After this upward movement, it seems that HBAR has entered a correction phase. This is a normal part of price action, where markets take a short pause or pull back before deciding their next direction. This correction could follow a common ABC pattern, which is a typical way markets adjust after a rally. The support area for this correction is currently between 0.142 and 0.169. So far, HBAR has managed to hold above the higher end of this range, which is a positive sign. Market Outlook: What to Watch Next At the moment, there’s no clear sign that buyers are stepping in for a strong bullish reversal. However, the pace of the decline has started to slow down, which might be an early indication that the market is stabilizing. There’s also a more bullish scenario being considered, where HBAR could attempt a quicker move to the upside without falling much further. But for now, this outlook needs confirmation. Investors and traders should keep a close eye on the support levels. If the price stays above this zone, it could increase the chances of a new upward move in the coming sessions.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|HBAR,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-19 02:02:43
44791768,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=730403,1747620204,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44791768.jpeg,Crypto community rallies as Telegram founder Pavel Durov rejects EU censorship,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-backs-durov-against-eu-censorship/,"Telegram founder Pavel Durov has publicly rejected a request from a Western European government to censor conservative voices on the platform ahead of Romania’s presidential runoff election. In a Telegram post on May 18, Durov emphasized the importance of free speech and fair elections, stating, “You can’t ‘defend democracy’ by destroying democracy. You can’t ‘fight election interference’ by interfering with elections. You either have freedom of speech and fair elections — or you don’t. And the Romanian people deserve both.” Durov did not identify the government. But his deployment of a baguette emoji was broadly interpreted as invoking France. The timing raised concern, as Romania was amid a heated presidential election. There are also reports that the censorship request was designed to quash conservative commentary contrary to the official narrative. France’s foreign ministry has denied any involvement. It called for “respecting the democratic process” in Romania, a statement released by Reuters said. Despite this, many cheered Durov’s stand — particularly in the global crypto and tech communities. Crypto leaders praise Durov’s defiance Several leaders in the cryptocurrency community praised Mr. Durov’s defiance. Telegram has become a respected platform within crypto circles. He is viewed as a guardian of digital freedom — promoting privacy, encryption, and the freedom of expression. His Telegram app is popular with crypto developers, traders, and privacy advocates. The crypto community rallied around him after his May 18 post. Other tech leaders reposted his message, applauding him for taking a stand against government pressure. Some expressed the nudge as a “gold standard” to which other platforms should aspire during politically fraught times. Others cited Telegram’s history. While other platforms often cooperate with government takedown requests, Telegram has largely held out, keeping a hands-off approach — particularly around political speech. The platform has become a lifeline for independent voices in countries where media freedom is sagging. Durov’s position only reinforces that perception. Chris Pavlovski, the CEO of the free-speech video platform Rumble, also expressed his support. He said that more tech founders who were willing to take such a stand were needed. Freedom of speech and decentralization are two sides of the same coin, crypto advocates say. To them, Durov is not simply the steward of a messaging app — he is the defender of the communications infrastructure of free thought in the digital age. Durov’s arrest sparked free-speech debate Durov has had a tumultuous relationship with European governments. In August 2024, Durov was arrested at a Paris airport . French police alleged the arrest was connected to a criminal inquiry into the sharing of illegal content over Telegram, including alleged drug sales and extremism propaganda. The arrest sparked outrage. It was broadly viewed as a politically motivated push. Critics said France pressured Telegram to force the app to implement tighter controls and more censorship. On August 26, French President Emmanuel Macron denied these allegations, affirming France’s commitment to freedom of expression and communication. However, his statements did little to convince leaders in the crypto community. The chief executive of Helius Labs, Mert Mumtaz, said it was hypocritical for founders to be held personally responsible and face a potential 20-year prison sentence for failure to moderate speech while at the same time professing to care greatly about freedom of expression. Durov subsequently said that Telegram responds to valid law enforcement requests. The company has a lawyer in France and responds to such requests there. What was concerning, he said, was that authorities skirted this system and issued an arrest warrant instead. He called it not an attack on him but on the most fundamental values of law and justice.

The AFP-led Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT) said in a May 18 statement that it seized nearly 25 Bitcoin ( BTC ), alongside the mansion and car, which are together worth a total of 4.5 million Australian dollars ($2.88 million). The AFP said its investigation began in September 2018 after law enforcement in Luxembourg shared information about suspicious Bitcoin transactions that the agency claimed were connected to the Queensland man, who was previously convicted of hacking a US gaming company. A waterfront mansion in Queensland was confiscated under the allegation that it's linked to the theft of 950 Bitcoin. Source: Australian Federal Police The AFP claimed its investigation also linked the man to the theft of 950 Bitcoin stolen from a French crypto exchange in 2013. No criminal charges were laid over the Bitcoin theft; however, the AFP obtained a court forfeiture order of the property, car and Bitcoin in April under the claim that they could not be linked with “identifiable legitimate earnings.” AFP uses “unique powers” to seize assets Local media outlet 7NEWS reported that the owner of the confiscated assets is Shane Stephen Duffy , who pleaded guilty to fraud and computer hacking in 2016 for selling the personal data of League of Legends players. A cyberattack on League of Legends developer Riot Games in 2011 saw hackers obtain the details of more than 5 million users; Duffy was not accused of being involved in the hack, with prosecutors saying he got a copy of the data online and sold it for profit. Duffy was also accused of hacking the X account of Riot Games president Marc Merrill to publicize his data-selling business, which offered to sell access to the accounts of other League of Legends players. Related: Aussies lost $122 million to crypto scams in the last 12 months: AFP AFP Commander Jason Kennedy said in a statement that the agency has “unique powers” under the Proceeds of Crime Act to “restrain and forfeit” assets it suspects to be proceeds of crime, including cybercrime . Source: Australian Federal Police “The profits derived from criminal activities are also often used to fund further criminal acts, which is why the AFP works closely with our partners in the CACT to target the proceeds of crime and ensure they are reinvested in the community,” he said. The proceeds from selling the assets will be sent to a special purpose fund that supports crime prevention and law enforcement-related measures, the AFP said. Since July 2019, the CACT has used its power to restrain over $1.2 billion in assets, including houses, cars, yachts, crypto and fine art.

CME is one of the most respected derivatives exchanges in the world, and this move is a big milestone for XRP. As excitement builds around this announcement, let’s take a look at the latest price action for XRP and what traders should be watching in the days ahead. XRP Price Holding Key Support On the three-day chart, XRP is currently holding support just above the $2.30 level, specifically between $2.33 and $2.34. This area has been acting as a strong floor for the price in recent days. In the short term, as long as XRP remains above this support, there’s room for stability. However, if the price starts closing candles below $2.30, there’s a risk of a further decline. In that case, the next important support zone lies between $2.12 and $2.15. Resistance Levels to Watch If XRP manages to bounce from current levels, the next strong resistance between $2.56 and $2.62. This zone, known as a golden pocket resistance area, has historically acted as a barrier for upward moves. It will be a critical level to watch if the price attempts a recovery. Could a Bullish Pattern Be Forming? Despite the skeptical short-term outlook, there could be a bullish setup developing. If XRP drops further towards $2.12 — and then stages a solid rebound, it might form a large inverse head and shoulders pattern. This is a classic bullish chart formation that, if confirmed, could signal a significant upward move in the future. However, it’s important to note that this pattern has not yet formed or confirmed. It would require a further pullback, a clear bounce, and a breakout above the $2.56–$2.62 resistance zone to be considered valid.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-19 02:57:57

As institutional capital continues to pour into BTC and broader market sentiment strengthens, a handful of traders have been quietly accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE — and it’s now being dubbed 2025’s stealth breakout . THE MOST-WATCHED PRESALE OF 2025 – ACT NOW Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Quietly Leading the Altcoin Market MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned as one of the last remaining pre-listing altcoins with serious ROI potential , and investors are now recognizing it as the most overlooked outperformer of the cycle . With a fixed listing target of $0.007 and Stage 9 imminent , MAGA has already outpaced the growth of larger-cap coins in recent months — and many analysts expect this trend to continue post-listing. What’s fueling its outperformance: A clean, early-stage entry model with defined ROI estimates A cultural and political identity that resonates with its community Aggressive capital inflow ahead of listing-driven demand While SOL and XRP have made modest gains, MAGA is proving that pre-launch positioning still delivers unmatched results when done at the right time . Bitcoin’s Meteoric Rise Is Powering the Whole Market Bitcoin (BTC) is setting the tone for the 2025 bull cycle. Trading well above $103K , BTC is holding momentum from ETF inflows, macro hedge narratives, and widespread adoption from institutional finance. Price targets for Bitcoin now range between $150K and $250K , and its steady rise is laying the foundation for capital to flow into higher-risk, high-reward altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE . BTC may dominate the headlines — but the real growth opportunities are showing up in the altcoins riding that wave. Solana (SOL) Cools After a Strong Q1 Rally Solana (SOL) remains one of the most technically impressive Layer-1 chains in the ecosystem. But after a significant Q1 run, SOL is now consolidating in the $165–$180 range — giving up momentum to newer, faster-moving tokens. While analysts still maintain long-term targets above $250 , short-term upside appears limited — and many investors are rotating a portion of their SOL holdings into smaller-cap entries like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capitalize on faster gains. Stellar (XLM) Moves Slowly Despite Market Strength Stellar (XLM) continues to follow market trends but remains one of the slower-moving assets in 2025. Despite its solid utility in payments and interoperability, XLM is still ranging near $0.23–$0.25 , lagging far behind other altcoins in terms of return potential. While XLM may serve as a steady hold, it’s not drawing breakout-level capital — and for investors seeking 10x+ growth, attention is shifting toward early-stage momentum coins like MAGACOIN FINANCE . MASSIVE DEMAND, LIMITED SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise is real. But it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that is delivering the kind of performance altcoin traders dream about — outpacing Solana and XRP by 10x , with more room to run.

44793552,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-150m-buyer-battle-draws-attention-as-monero-and-bonk-reach-key-levels/,1747623641,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/44793552.jpeg,BlockDAG’s 150M Buyer Battle Draws Attention as Monero and BONK Reach Key Levels,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-150m-buyer-battle-draws-attention-as-monero-and-bonk-reach-key-levels/,"The Monero (XMR) price projection for 2025 shows a wide spread, ranging from a cautious $255.84 to a more confident $767.51, depending on how market trends unfold. Meanwhile, BONK price is sitting at a tipping point, where a breakout could lead to a 155% climb. As both handle market uncertainty, BlockDAG (BDAG) is moving differently. BlockDAG has sold 20.6 billion coins and locked in a price of $0.0020 until June 13. Its Buyer Battles, which now distribute 150 million coins daily, have helped draw in over 170,000 unique holders. This system is turning heads among those watching for market-moving opportunities. Monero (XMR) Price Projection 2025: Can It Hit $767 or Drop to $255? The Monero (XMR) price projection for 2025 reflects uncertainty. Analysts expect a possible dip to $255.84 if conditions stay weak, while a stronger market could lift it to $767.51. That puts the average Monero (XMR) price projection at $511.67, offering a midpoint between downside risk and growth potential. Looking further ahead to 2030, the forecast turns more optimistic. Projections range from a low of $1,942.76 to a high of $5,828.30, with an average near $3,885.53. These figures underline Monero’s appeal for long-term tracking, even as short-term swings remain part of the picture. BONK Price Holds Steady, but Can It Beat the Downtrend? BONK price is now testing a key supply area, a zone that has previously led to downward movement. Past reactions at this level have caused lower highs and longer declines, similar to the recent six-day pullback. If this pattern holds, a further dip could follow. Still, a clear breakout above this resistance could flip the outlook. If momentum builds, BONK price may rise to $0.00003689 for a 51% gain, or even $0.00006230 for a 155% move. Despite $4 million in sell pressure, the Open Interest Weighted Funding Rate has stayed positive for 20 straight days. That signals buyer strength and continued support for BONK’s recovery path. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battle Turns Up the Heat with 150M Coin Race What began as a reward initiative has now become one of the fastest-moving events in the crypto space. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles have turned into a fierce daily challenge, with the largest BDAG buyer of the day claiming whatever is left of a 150 million coin pool. No extra steps or sign-ups, just a race where one top buyer walks away with the prize. This approach has helped BlockDAG pass $254.5 million in presale funds and move more than 20.6 billion coins. The community is also growing, with more than 170,000 unique participants involved. The current price is fixed at $0.0020 until June 13. That’s a big deal considering the listing price is set at $0.05, and the presale has already jumped from $0.001 in Batch 1 to $0.0262 in Batch 28, reflecting a 2520% gain so far. Five exchanges have already been named, and 15 more will be announced soon. With short-term forecasts placing BDAG at $1 and long-range estimates going as high as $10, the interest surrounding this daily coin competition is growing fast. The countdown is on, and the daily Buyer Battles are adding real-time pressure to act before the final stage closes. The Bottom Line The Monero (XMR) price projection for 2025 covers a wide range. It could fall to $255.84 if conditions worsen or rise to $767.51 if the market moves in its favor. The average estimate sits at $511.67. Looking out to 2030, forecasts stretch from $1,942.76 to $5,828.30, giving it plenty of room for future gains if the trend continues. Meanwhile, BONK price is sitting at a critical resistance zone. This area has previously led to downturns, but if BONK can push past it, the upside could reach 155%. The first short-term target is $0.00003689, with $0.00006230 in view if the breakout holds. Despite a $4 million sell-off recently, bullish sentiment remains strong, supported by positive funding data for more than 20 days. While both Monero and BONK are navigating their own paths within the list of popular crypto coins, BlockDAG is gaining traction with its unique crypto presale strategy and daily competition structure. It’s a very different pace, one that’s grabbing attention fast.

ETH is now struggling and might decline toward the $2,220 support zone. Ethereum started a correction from the $2,580 zone and tested $2,320. The price is trading below $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,540 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain strength if it clears the $2,550 resistance in the near term. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price struggled to clear the $2,520 resistance and started a downside correction, unlike Bitcoin . ETH traded below the $2,500 and $2,440 support levels. The bears were able to push the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,308 swing low to the $2,509 high. The price even spiked below the $2,440 level, but the bulls were active near the $2,400 zone. The price is stable above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,308 swing low to the $2,509 high. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,540 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. If there is another increase, the price could face resistance near the $2,460 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,500 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,550 level and the trend line. A clear move above the $2,550 resistance might send the price toward the $2,580 resistance. An upside break above the $2,580 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,700 resistance zone or even $2,780 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,500 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,400 level.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) has closed at a weekly gain for the past six weeks in a row, and its most recent close at midnight UTC on May 18 was its highest weekly close ever at just below $106,500, according to TradingView. Its last highest weekly close was in December when it reached $104,400. It later went on to reach an all-time high of $109,358 on Jan. 20, according to TradingView. Bitcoin is now less than 3% away from its peak price and has gained 2% over the past 24 hours to trade around $104,730 at the time of writing. Bitcoin also posted its highest-ever close in a 24-hour period on May 18. However, this is not the largest daily gain Bitcoin has made. “Bitcoin just had its highest daily candle close... ever,” investor Scott Melker posted to X on May 19. With a daily close above $105,000, “Bitcoin will develop a brand new higher high,” said analyst Rekt Capital. BTC/USD weekly timeframe. Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s weekly gains over the past six weeks are mirroring its gains in November when it added $30,000 in three of its largest weekly candles ever. It has added around $12,000 so far in May, climbing from $94,000 to over $106,000 before it pulled back to around $105,400. Related: BTC price to $116K next?

The “strength of this bid on a Sunday night feels strange,” they said, adding its “possible someone knows some important news dropping next week.” Bitcoin’s CAGR cools down On May 18, analyst Willy Woo dived into Bitcoin’s compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ), noting that it was trending downward as the network continues to store more capital. “BTC is now traded as the newest macro asset in 150 years, it'll continue to absorb capital until it reaches its equilibrium,” he said. Woo compared it to long-term monetary expansion of 5% and GDP growth of 3%, estimating that Bitcoin’s annual growth rate will be around 8% in around 15 to 20 years when it has settled. “Until then, enjoy the ride because almost no publicly investable product can match BTC performance long term, even as BTC's CAGR continues to erode.” Bitcoin annualized growth rate.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Solana, and XRP Could Be the Best Trio to Ride This Wave",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-to-1m-magacoin-finance-solana-and-xrp-could-be-the-best-trio-to-ride-this-wave/,"Introduction The crypto market is once again flirting with a bold possibility — Bitcoin reaching $1 million . Whether it’s hyperinflation, institutional accumulation, or ETF-driven demand, the scenario is no longer far-fetched. But while Bitcoin sets the macro tone, smart investors are turning their focus to a trio of altcoins that could ride that momentum with 10x, 50x, or even 100x multipliers . The top names on that list? MAGACOIN FINANCE , Solana, and XRP — joined by politically charged tokens like OFFICIALTRUMP as a rising narrative force. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Being Viewed as the Smartest Asymmetric Play MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a core early-stage allocation among traders seeking pre-listing upside with real structure behind it. With a listing price of $0.007 and Stage 9 now imminent , MAGA offers one of the few clear-cut high-momentum entries remaining in the 2025 cycle. Here’s why MAGA could outperform even in a Bitcoin-driven run: Projected 25x–35x return window from current presale levels Cultural and political alignment that appeals to a distinct retail base A structured, time-sensitive model that mirrors early DOGE and SHIBA patterns — but with a fixed listing roadmap As Bitcoin drives capital into crypto at scale, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be one of the most leveraged plays in the altcoin landscape — and with listings coming, that window is narrowing. Solana (SOL) Continues to Outperform the Layer-1 Sector Solana (SOL) is trading firmly in the $165–$180 range and continues to be one of the most technically competitive Layer-1 platforms in crypto. As institutional interest rotates from Ethereum into faster ecosystems, Solana is leading that trend. SOL is: Dominating DeFi growth metrics Powering NFT and Web3 apps Scaling with real user activity Analysts are now projecting $250–$400 price targets for Solana this year — with some even calling for a shot at $600 if capital rotation and L2 congestion on Ethereum persist. For those following the Bitcoin wave, Solana is a must-have in the infrastructure category . CLICK HERE – SECURE YOUR SPOT BEFORE 25x DISAPPEARS XRP Remains the Institutional Gateway to Blockchain Finance XRP holds its value as a bridge asset — and its upcoming CME futures launch is set to amplify liquidity, visibility, and use case relevance. Trading above $2.30 , XRP has emerged from legal battles stronger than ever. Key drivers: U.S. regulatory clarity Ongoing real-world payment integrations Speculation around a potential XRP-based ETF With targets of $5–$15 in the near term, XRP continues to be the institutional altcoin of choice — and smart portfolios are building positions as capital flows out of the sidelines and into payment-based infrastructure tokens. OFFICIALTRUMP and the Rise of Narrative-Driven Crypto OFFICIALTRUMP represents a new wave of politically aligned crypto assets that blend identity, ideology, and meme-level virality . While not a utility coin, it has gathered momentum among retail traders seeking narrative-backed exposure. It’s part of a broader trend: crypto is no longer just about infrastructure — it’s about movements, branding, and timing . That’s exactly why many are pairing OFFICIALTRUMP with MAGACOIN FINANCE — two tokens that could capitalize on political cycles and viral attention simultaneously . Conclusion Bitcoin might be on a path to $1 million — but the most dramatic gains will come from altcoins that ride the wave early, fast, and loud . Solana brings infrastructure speed. XRP delivers global payments reach. OFFICIALTRUMP fuels political momentum. And MAGACOIN FINANCE? That’s the undiscovered multiplier. As Stage 9 nears and listings become the next big catalyst, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the most strategic asymmetric bet of the entire 2025 cycle .

Is a new all-time high coming this week?",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-logged-its-highest-weekly-close-ever/,"Bitcoin just made history. For the first time, it closed a weekly candle above $107,000, briefly reaching that price before easing back to $105,000. The rally puts it less than 3% away from its all-time high, and right now, it’s trading around $104,300, according to data from CoinGecko. Over the past six weeks, Bitcoin has added serious gains, similar to the November 2021 run where three massive candles pushed it up $30,000. In May alone, it’s already gained $13,000, rising from $94,000 to over $107,000. This breakout comes as Metaplanet, the Japanese public company that follows Strategy’s strategy, confirmed a fresh purchase of 1,004 Bitcoin for $104 million. That brings its total holdings to 7,800 BTC, now worth approximately $812 million, as the company has publicly been stacking for months. Arthur Hayes explains why more upside is likely Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, told Fortune that the US government is quietly spending more than it’s officially disclosing. He said the Treasury General Account dropped from $750 billion to $450 billion this quarter because of so-called “extraordinary measures” that let the government spend without technically raising new debt. “It’s confusing,” Arthur said, “because we are in a period of the debt ceiling. So the US government cannot borrow net more money. There are various different ways in which they can spend money and still remain underneath the debt ceiling.” He also pointed out that from January to March 2025, Treasury borrowing was up 22% compared to the same period last year. “The deficit is higher,” he added. Arthur believes the Treasury Secretary, Janet Bessent, will need to issue even more debt going forward. “Therefore he needs to find a way for these individuals to obtain as much leverage as possible through the banking system and ultimately that means that there’s more dollars floating around in the world because the US government is spending more money on stuff.” Arthur added that this rise in liquidity is exactly why Bitcoin bottomed on April 9th and why he expects prices to go much higher. “I think Bitcoin needs to go above $110K and increasing volumes reach $150K–$200K,” Arthur said. “I think that happens sometimes in the summer or early third quarter and then the rotation starts into various altcoins.” He doesn’t expect altcoins to perform like they did in 2021 though. “We’ll have a new narrative,” he said, “but the old dino coins in your portfolio that aren’t moving probably aren’t moving for a reason. I think a lot of those coins have high FDV, low float, no customers, no revenue, just some CEX listings. That went down 95%. I don’t really see why those should do well in the next cycle.” Realized Cap hits new record as ETFs push higher Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s realized capitalization just broke its record again. For the fourth straight week, the total value of all UTXOs is now at $906 billion as of May 18, up from $891.6 billion just ten days earlier. That’s a 1.61% increase, driven by the ton of new capital entering the market. Source: CryptoQuant Over the same period, Bitcoin has been consolidating around $104,731, a key resistance level. Once that wall is cleared, the next stop is $107,757, and after that, a possible break into new highs. During this 10-day range, the largest growth came from addresses holding 100 to 1000 BTC. These wallets increased their stash by 122,540 BTC, going from 5.56 million BTC to 5.68 million BTC—a 2.2% gain. That kind of growth in that band signals mid-sized whales are still actively accumulating, not selling. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US are also pulling serious weight. Net inflows for the week hit $608 million, building on the momentum from previous weeks. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust led the charge, with inflows over $840 million, more than every other ETF combined. While some ETFs trimmed their positions or held steady, BlackRock stood out. It was the only major fund to increase its Bitcoin holdings, going from 621,600 BTC to 631,902 BTC. That’s an addition of 10,302 BTC, which equals a 1.66% increase.

The price is now trading below $2.480 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.3550 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if it stays above the $2.350 support. XRP Price Dips Again XRP price attempted a fresh increase above the $2.350 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . However, the bears were active near the $2.450 zone. A high was formed at $2.4495 and the price is now moving lower. There was a drop below the $2.40 support level.

The first major resistance is near the $2.450 level. The next resistance is $2.50. A clear move above the $2.50 resistance might send the price toward the $2.60 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance or even $2.680 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.80. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.450 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.3550 level. The next major support is near the $2.320 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.320 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.20 support. The next major support sits near the $2.120 zone.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Ethereum Are Gearing Up for a Massive Run",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/hidden-crypto-treasure-magacoin-finance-xrp-and-ethereum-are-gearing-up-for-a-massive-run/,"Introduction In every crypto cycle, there’s a handful of tokens that deliver quietly at first — then erupt. As 2025 heats up, all signs are pointing toward Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Cosmos (ATOM), and MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) as the projects gearing up for a major run . While ETH and XRP are preparing for institutional momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is catching attention as a hidden early-stage altcoin that may soon exit obscurity and enter the spotlight — with price action to match. THE MOST-WATCHED PRESALE OF 2025 – ACT NOW Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Being Called a Hidden Gem MAGACOIN FINANCE is rising fast through the ranks of speculative investor watchlists — and for good reason. With a listing price target of $0.007 and Stage 9 now imminent , MAGA is being positioned as one of the final undiscovered altcoins with realistic 25x–35x upside still available in the presale phase. Why analysts see MAGA as a “crypto treasure”: Undervalued in market exposure, but structured for maximum ROI Politically bold positioning that gives it viral potential Transparent listing mechanics and clean tokenomics As other coins consolidate or chase headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly securing capital — and preparing to make its move just before listings rewrite its valuation. XRP Builds Toward Utility-Driven Breakout XRP continues to show strength above $2.30 , with institutional narratives driving momentum. Following U.S. legal clarity, XRP is now widely seen as the core payment infrastructure token for blockchain-based financial networks. Its next leg up could be triggered by: The launch of CME futures Expanding on-chain settlement adoption Speculation around future ETF integrations Forecasts range from $5 to $15 , and many XRP holders are taking parallel positions in MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture upside from both ends of the risk curve. Ethereum Remains the Infrastructure Giant Ethereum (ETH) still leads the market in smart contract and Layer-2 infrastructure — and as ETF conversations escalate, ETH’s positioning only grows stronger. Currently trading near $2,600 , Ethereum is widely expected to move toward $4,000–$6,000 , with Layer-2 scaling and institutional flows adding fuel. Its importance? Ethereum is the network backbone — and the coin that institutional investors trust most when entering crypto. But for exponential ROI, many are complementing their ETH positions with earlier-phase assets like MAGA. Cosmos (ATOM) Returns to the Conversation Cosmos (ATOM) has quietly re-entered the altcoin narrative, as multichain infrastructure and app-chain development pick up. Trading near the $4–$4.75 range, ATOM is benefiting from renewed developer interest and Layer-0 relevance. Cosmos enables sovereign blockchains to interoperate, and with the next phase of DeFi and gaming moving cross-chain, ATOM could become a foundational layer for the ecosystem’s expansion. While it may not 50x, it provides long-term conviction — and analysts see it as a strong pair with more speculative entries like MAGACOIN FINANCE. MASSIVE DEMAND, LIMITED SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Not all top performers shout the loudest — some rise quietly, building momentum behind the scenes before exploding into view. That’s the case for MAGACOIN FINANCE , a project that many are now calling one of the last hidden treasures in the 2025 cycle . Alongside heavyweights like Ethereum, XRP, and Cosmos, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining serious ground — and with listings coming soon, it may not be hidden for much longer.

If all goes as planned, this could be a game-changer for XRP, drawing in institutional money and paving the way for spot XRP ETFs. XRP ETF Approval Odds Increase Polymarket traders have also raised their bets on an XRP ETF approval this year to 83%, despite the recent bearish sentiment. Bloomberg analysts have also raised the odds of approval to 85%, over rising institutional interest and a fair regulatory environment. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) launching XRP futures contracts could be seen as a major step toward institutional adoption.

But some are concerned that since no one’s actually holding XRP in futures contracts, the price is not going to move. Nevertheless, today’s launch is expected to increase the market liquidity and attract institutions towards trading and hedging XRP in a regulated manner. Also, regulated futures are often a prerequisite for spot ETF approvals. The added visibility from a CME listing could further boost its market position. New XRP ETF Shows Huge Inflows Despite Price Drop The recently launched Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF (XXRP) has been showing steady growth, with over $106 million in assets since its April debut, data from ETF.com shows.

Alibaba’s stock fell as much as 4% on Monday in Hong Kong. Officials are concerned about what user data might be shared with Alibaba and whether the company has made commitments with Chinese regulators. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd stock price. Source: Google Finance Lawmakers are publicly pressing Apple for details of the Alibaba deal Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, called Alibaba “a poster child for the Chinese Communist Party’s military-civil fusion strategy.” He said it was “extremely disturbing” that Apple “has not been transparent about its agreement.” Only Alibaba has confirmed the deal in public. Apple has remained silent, and the scrutiny adds to the many ways rising U.S.–China tensions threaten the iPhone maker’s business. The dispute lands at a rough moment for Alibaba. The e-commerce giant’s shares had already been sliding after its latest quarterly revenue missed analyst expectations, denting enthusiasm that earlier framed the company as a leader in the DeepSeek-fueled AI surge. Back in February, Chairman Joseph Tsai told investors that future iPhones would use Alibaba’s AI tools, a comment that helped power a sharp rally at the time. His remarks boosted confidence that domestic AI champions could work with global consumer brands. The overall Asian market drifted lower Asian equities broadly weakened on Monday as investors weighed mixed signals from the world’s largest economies. Regional risk appetite remained notably cautious. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 moved modestly, with traders waiting for Tuesday’s Reserve Bank of Australia decision. Economists expect the RBA to trim its benchmark rate by 25 basis points amid cooling inflation, though they also predict a cautious tone on further cuts because of lingering domestic and global risks. Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.3 percent and the broader TOPIX edged down 0.1 percent, extending losses that began after a weak gross domestic product reading on Friday. Markets are now watching April consumer-price figures, due later this week, for guidance on the Bank of Japan’s next move on interest rates. South Korea’s KOSPI dropped 0.7 percent, while Singapore’s Straits Times Index fell 0.3 percent.

Since then ADA price has quietly shown strength again, and continues to consolidate sideways, while prominent analyst Ali Martinez believes that the Cardano price could push towards $1 soon , fueling the bullish sentiment in the market. Interestingly, big ADA holders are still buying more ADA. This comes as market excitement grows due to a possible DeFi partnership between Cardano and Litecoin, and growing hopes of an ETF approval. Cardano Price Eyes the $1 According to Ali, ADA pulled back slightly after reaching a high near $0.88, but it found strong support around $0.74, right at the lower end of its upward channel. This zone has acted like a safety net, as ADA has been moving within a rising channel since mid-April. For traders, this setup is often seen as a sign that the token might be preparing for another leg up. Ali noted that if ADA can stay above $0.74 and continue following the trend channel, there’s a chance it could retest previous highs of $0.88 or even aim beyond $1. If the current structure on #Cardano $ADA is an ascending channel, holding above $0.72 could pave the way for an upswing toward $0.92. pic.twitter.com/vgNNfuudPd — Ali (@ali_charts) May 18, 2025 Whales Are Buying Big Backing the technical setup is a wave of whale activity. In just the past 48 hours, large wallets have purchased over 80 million ADA , according to blockchain platform Santiment. When whales start buying, it often means something big is coming. As of now, Cardano’s price is trading around $0.725, reflecting a drop of 2% seen in the last 24 hours, with a market cap of $23.5 billion. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction: Will XRP Remain Consolidated Below $2.5 Throughout Q2 2025? , Cardano and Litecoin Working Together? Another reason for the excitement is a possible DeFi partnership between Cardano and Litecoin. Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, confirmed his support for the Litecoin community and hinted at a new collaboration. This could happen through Cardano’s upcoming privacy-focused project called Midnight . If confirmed, this would be a rare and powerful cross-chain partnership between two well-established blockchains. ETF Hopes to Lift Sentiment Meanwhile, Cardano’s regulatory outlook is improving. According to Polymarket, the chances of a Cardano spot ETF being approved this year have jumped from 45% to 64% in just one day. This shows that investors believe Cardano could soon be part of the traditional financial world. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Yes, if ADA holds above $0.74 and bullish momentum continues, a move to $1 is technically possible in the short term. Does whale accumulation typically lead to price rallies in Cardano’s history? Yes, past whale buying often preceded ADA price surges, signaling strong market confidence and potential upside. Is now a good time to buy ADA based on current technical and market sentiment?

Ripple Effect Teaser Triggers Speculation On May 17, BitMEX posted a GIF showing ripple effects with the caption, “news that’s gonna have a @ripple effect on the market.” The X post has racked up nearly half a million views, fueling speculation that a major Ripple announcement is around the corner. While no details have been confirmed, the wordplay strongly suggests more than marketing banter. XRP Derivatives Coming to BitMEX? The post has led many traders to believe BitMEX might soon integrate XRP or launch new derivative products tied to the asset. Known for pioneering leveraged crypto trading, BitMEX’s entering the XRP market could attract fresh trader interest and lend additional legitimacy to Ripple’s ecosystem. With XRP currently trading between $2.3 and $2.45, a confirmed BitMEX-Ripple tie-up could trigger a bullish breakout. Market interest in XRP has already been on the rise following Ripple’s improved legal standing in the U.S., and a new partnership could amplify that momentum. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Spot ETF News: Odds Rise To 83%, SEC Decision in June? , XRP Price Analysis Analyst Egrag Crypto believes XRP could skyrocket to $27, citing Fibonacci levels and chart breakouts as proof of a bullish long-term setup. More grounded predictions from traders suggest levels like $6.22 and $7.68 as achievable milestones. While those figures are ambitious, short-term targets like $3 seem well within reach if bullish sentiment holds. With speculation mounting and the official details still under wraps, the XRP market is on high alert. A real collaboration announcement could be the spark bulls are waiting for. On the other hand, crypto analyst CryptoGeek believes that if XRP succeeds in capturing the $27 trillion U.S. Treasury bill market, its price could soar to $482.48 per coin. This would represent a staggering 790x surge from current levels. While highly speculative, the post highlights the growing bullish sentiment around XRP’s potential role in global finance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

His comments come as the Bitcoin community debates the growing strain of embedded data like JPEGs on the network’s efficiency. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is seeing renewed price optimism, with analysts such as Scott Melker forecasting a potential run to $250,000 by year-end. Saifedean Ammous Supports Fight Against Bitcoin Spam Inscriptions as Developer Tensions Escalate A heated debate has reignited in the Bitcoin development community over the persistent rise of spam inscriptions on the network — with prominent economist and Bitcoin advocate Saifedean Ammous now offering to contribute financially to efforts aimed at curbing the controversial practice. The dispute centers on a proposal that would enable node operators to more easily filter non-financial inscriptions, often used to embed JPEGs and other arbitrary data, which critics argue bloat the Bitcoin blockchain and distort its purpose as a monetary protocol. The conversation began when pseudonymous developer GrassFedBitcoin called attention to pull request #28408 in Bitcoin Core’s GitHub repository. The pull request, if merged, would allow node operators to reject certain inscription formats by default, giving users more granular control over what their node relays. GrassFedBitcoin didn’t mince words in his assessment of the problem: “No one running a node wants to relay inscriptions,” he wrote on X. He criticized the historical decisions that increased Bitcoin’s OP_RETURN limits, which are now being exploited to store arbitrary files such as NFTs, and argued that the feature was abused under “false assumptions” that it would not lead to significant blockchain bloat. For inscription critics like GrassFedBitcoin, the trend undermines Bitcoin’s primary value proposition — a global, decentralized settlement layer optimized for sound money, not digital artwork. Ammous: “It’s Worth Trying to Bankrupt the Spammers” Enter Saifedean Ammous, a vocal advocate for Bitcoin minimalism and the author of the widely cited book The Bitcoin Standard. Ammous publicly endorsed the initiative, declaring that he would “throw in a few sats” to fund a full-time developer whose job is to make inscription-based spam “more difficult and expensive.” Saifedean Ammous shares his take (Source: X) Drawing a parallel to email spam, Ammous stated, “It’s not easy, but it’s worth trying to help bankrupt the spammers faster.” Crucially, he refuted the notion that inscription filtering amounts to censorship. “Fighting spam is not censorship,” he emphasized, noting that full node operators already choose to reject invalid or non-standard transactions as a matter of policy. His controversial stance even went so far as to advocate hiring external developers to overwhelm spam-producing systems and “deprecate” the work of those enabling or building around non-monetary use cases for Bitcoin. Not all thought leaders are aligned on the path forward. Adam Back, CEO of Bitcoin infrastructure company Blockstream, offered a stark rebuttal. Back warned that any attempt to filter inscriptions will result in a perpetual “arms race,” as spam developers find ever-more creative ways to embed their data within valid Bitcoin transactions. His concerns reflect a core tension in Bitcoin's architecture: the desire for permissionless innovation versus the imperative to preserve the network’s long-term efficiency and integrity. Community Sentiment: Unwilling QA Engineers? The escalating rhetoric sparked a wave of community reactions. One participant in the discussion likened the developers behind inscription tools to “unwilling QA engineers” — essentially helping Bitcoin Core harden its software by discovering new attack vectors. Another user quipped that developers working on spam inscription projects should be treated as bug reporters, with every trick they employ being swiftly “unstandardized.” The implication is clear: rather than engaging in a moral or philosophical debate over whether JPEGs belong on Bitcoin, some believe the answer lies in relentless code hardening, neutralizing spam through technical superiority rather than ideological consensus. The urgency of the debate is underscored by hard data. According to a Feb. 4 report from Mempool Research, widespread adoption of inscriptions could drive Bitcoin’s average block size as high as 4 megabytes per block, which is more than double the current average of 1.5 MB. In practical terms, this increased load could lead to longer confirmation times and higher fees, especially during peak network activity. This block size inflation also revives concerns from the “block size wars” of the past decade, when the community famously split over whether to increase Bitcoin’s block size to accommodate more data, resulting in the creation of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Inscriptions, Ordinals, and Bitcoin’s Future The broader issue ties directly into the Bitcoin Ordinals phenomenon, a practice popularized in 2023 that allows users to inscribe data directly onto individual satoshis. While many celebrate Ordinals for enabling NFT-like capabilities on Bitcoin, others see them as a parasitic use case that undermines scalability and clutters the blockchain with non-essential data. Ammous and his supporters argue that allowing Bitcoin’s blockspace to be consumed by inscriptions threatens its role as the world’s most robust and secure monetary protocol. In their view, every byte used for non-financial data increases the cost of running a full node and puts undue pressure on users who want to use Bitcoin purely for economic exchange. For now, pull request #28408 remains unmerged, and the future of inscription filtering hangs in the balance. But with prominent voices like Ammous escalating the pressure and likening the problem to an existential threat akin to email spam, the issue seems unlikely to fade quietly. Bitcoin to $250K in 2025? Analyst Scott Melker Says It’s ‘Totally Possible’ as Institutional Momentum Grows In related news, Bitcoin may be poised for a parabolic move toward $250,000 by the end of 2025, according to prominent crypto analyst Scott Melker, who believes a rare confluence of macro and market dynamics could trigger the next explosive rally. Known for hosting The Wolf of All Streets podcast, Melker offered the bold prediction in a recent interview, pointing to Bitcoin’s maturing volatility profile and deepening institutional adoption as catalysts. “$250K this year? Totally possible,” Melker asserted , suggesting that while such a surge might seem extreme to outsiders, it’s well within the bounds of historical crypto price behavior. With Bitcoin currently trading above $100K, that would imply a more-than-double price increase within the next seven months. But Melker argues the conditions for such a move are increasingly falling into place. Bitcoin price chart (Source: CoinMarketCap) One of Melker’s key observations is that Bitcoin’s historic volatility, long viewed as a double-edged sword, is quietly fading. “It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times,” he explained. This reduction in volatility, he said, is not accidental. It's the result of deeper integration with traditional finance. From pension funds to major asset managers, long-term institutional holders are entering the Bitcoin market in greater numbers, leading to more stable price action and long-term accumulation. Melker emphasized that this is not merely anecdotal. The launch and success of Bitcoin spot ETFs, alongside broader Wall Street participation, are actively reshaping Bitcoin’s behavior as a financial asset. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the more long-term holders get involved, the less volatility there’s going to be,” he said. 2025 Off to a Strong Start for Crypto Markets So far, 2025 has validated Melker’s bullish tone. Bitcoin has climbed beyond $103,000, and Ethereum has rebounded above $2,600. The market-wide strength is not limited to the majors either, altcoins have started to gain traction, driven by rising trading volume and risk appetite. One of the biggest milestones of the year came when Coinbase was added to the S&P 500, not just as a constituent but among the top 50 companies by market cap. Melker flagged this development as a game-changer, reinforcing how deeply embedded crypto firms have become in global financial systems. He also highlighted recent public listings from companies like Galaxy Digital and eToro, signaling renewed confidence in regulatory clarity and policy tailwinds. Melker’s optimism is further bolstered by recent regulatory easing in the United States. The SEC’s decision to drop several lawsuits against major crypto firms, along with favorable executive orders aimed at fostering blockchain innovation, have helped restore investor confidence. This shift, he argues, is a major departure from the regulatory headwinds that plagued previous market cycles, and it sets the stage for more sustainable capital inflows into the space. While Bitcoin remains the flagship asset, Melker noted that Ethereum and smaller-cap altcoins have started to outperform, which is a sign that “new money” may be entering the market. The ETH/BTC ratio has ticked upward, and tokens across decentralized finance (DeFi), artificial intelligence (AI), and layer-2 scaling solutions have begun posting double-digit percentage gains — typical of early-stage bull markets. This altcoin resurgence, Melker suggested, reflects a broader market confidence that Bitcoin’s rise is not isolated but part of a wider crypto ecosystem rally. $250K Still a Long Shot — But Not Unprecedented Despite the bullish case, Melker tempered his forecast with a dose of realism, saying that most experts are forecasting highs between $120K and $150K. However, he was quick to point out that crypto markets are no stranger to explosive surges. “From the 2020 lows to the last bull market, Bitcoin went from $3,000 to $69,000. A 2.5x from here wouldn’t be a big deal.” Other analysts agree that a six-figure Bitcoin is within reach. On May 16, the analytics account Apsk32 shared projections that Bitcoin has a “decent chance” of hitting $250K or more in 2025, especially as macroeconomic instability pushes investors toward ”digital gold” hedging strategies. Even Presto’s head of research Peter Chung has doubled down on his $210K prediction, while Standard Chartered and Intellectia AI analysts have echoed similar sentiments, citing rising ETF inflows and a global appetite for alternative stores of value. A Perfect Storm for Bitcoin? With diminishing volatility, deepening institutional interest, favorable regulatory shifts, and growing altcoin momentum, the pieces appear to be aligning for a massive move upward in crypto markets. Melker’s $250,000 prediction might not be consensus, but it’s gaining traction among a growing list of analysts.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-19 05:00:00

The token has been range-bound between $2.32 and $2.62 for the past week and is currently holding steady at $2.37, up just 0.7% in the last day. Even though the price has been moving sideways, market activity has risen dramatically. The 24-hour trading volume of XRP ( XRP ) increased 46.8% to $3.2 billion, showing renewed interest among traders. Meanwhile, open interest has decreased by 0.26%, but derivatives volume is up by 48%, as per Coinglass data . This discrepancy points to a rise in short-term positioning without long-term conviction, perhaps in preparation for the upcoming derivatives launch. CME Group, the world’s largest regulated derivatives marketplace, plans to introduce XRP and Micro XRP futures contracts on May 19, pending final regulatory approval. According to CME Group’s notice on April 24, each contract will be cash-settled based on the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate and represent 50,000 and 2,500 XRP, respectively.

As the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, XRP’s inclusion in CME’s portfolio may pave the way for greater institutional involvement. From a technical perspective, XRP is currently in a consolidation stage. With no discernible momentum in either direction, key indicators such as the relative strength index and the MACD point to a neutral trend. The longer-term trend is still in place as XRP is still above the majority of its mid- and long-term moving averages, including the 50-day and 200-day averages. XRP price analysis.

On the upside, resistance is forming around $2.60. A breakout could lead to a retest of the highs from April above $2.80. Traders are keeping a close eye on whether institutional demand through CME will provide the momentum required to end XRP’s current consolidation, with volatility expected to return amid the launch.

While Blum clarified that Smerkis is no longer involved in the project, his arrest caused a lot of community concerns over the project's anticipated BLUM token airdrop. Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, police dismantled a $15 million cross-border crypto laundering ring involving more than 500 bank accounts and 12 arrests. In the US, Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm is pushing back against federal charges by arguing prosecutors withheld crucial FinCEN evidence that suggests non-custodial mixers like Tornado Cash do not qualify as money transmitters. Vladimir Smerkis Arrested in Moscow Vladimir Smerkis, the co-founder of the Telegram-based crypto project Blum, was arrested in Moscow on suspicion of large-scale fraud. The Zamoskvoretsky District Court approved a request to detain Smerkis while investigations continue. The charges fall under Article 159 of the Russian Criminal Code, which could carry a prison sentence of 2 to 12 years. Russian state media outlet TASS reported the news on May 18, though it's still unclear whether formal charges have been filed. Smerkis previously led Binance's operations in Russia, and is allegedly linked to investor losses totaling around $15 million from his earlier ventures, The Token Fund and Tokenbox, which were both launched in 2017. According to Russian news outlet Mash , these projects are the focus of the fraud investigation, not Blum. In response, Blum publicly confirmed on X that Smerkis stepped down from his position as chief marketing officer and is no longer involved with the project in any way. Despite the controversy, Blum stated that it is still committed to its development roadmap and that day-to-day operations will continue as usual. The project integrates a decentralized exchange directly into Telegram Mini Apps, which makes it possible for users to trade crypto, earn rewards, and participate in token airdrops However, Smerkis' arrest cast doubt over the fate of Blum's anticipated BLUM token airdrop. Community members are very concerned that the project may no longer follow through with its token distribution. Blum previously hinted at a Q3 token listing, and users were accumulating Blum points in the project’s Drop Game in hopes of converting them into BLUM tokens during the upcoming token generation event. Thanks to the silence from the project's team on the matter, frustration is growing in the community. “Blum owes its users a clarification on the planned airdrop,” one user stated on X, while crypto influencer RK Gupta agreed with the sentiment by saying, “No airdrop. No updates. Just silence. Was it all for nothing?” Crypto Laundering Ring Busted in Hong Kong In Hong Kong, police have dismantled a major cross-border money laundering operation that funneled HK$118 million, or approximately $15 million, through cryptocurrency and over 500 stooge bank accounts. The bust took place on May 15, and it led to the arrest of 12 individuals — nine men and three women — across Hong Kong and mainland China. According to local media reports , including the Hong Kong Commercial Daily, the criminal network allegedly recruited others to open bank accounts that were used to collect illicit funds from fraud cases. These funds were then converted into crypto at local exchange shops as part of the laundering process. The syndicate operated out of a rented apartment in Mong Kok, where they planned and executed their activities. Surveillance on the day of the arrests caught two syndicate members in the act: one visiting a bank, the other using an ATM, before both proceeded to convert the cash into cryptocurrency at a shop in Tsim Sha Tsui. Authorities intervened before the laundering could be completed, and seized around HK$770,000 ($98,540) in cash. The remaining suspects, aged between 20 and 41, were apprehended shortly after. Some items confiscated by authorities In total, police confiscated approximately HK$1.05 million ($134,370) in cash, over 560 ATM cards, numerous mobile phones, banking documents, and records of crypto transactions. Senior Inspector Tse Ka-lun of the Commercial Crime Bureau said that many of the stooge accounts that were used in the scheme belonged to friends or family of those involved. This incident is part of the growing problem in Hong Kong, where fraud-related crimes increased by 12% year-on-year in 2024. Authorities have made more than 10,000 arrests connected to fraud this year already, with almost three-quarters involving people who held bank accounts used for laundering. (Source: IC3 ) The crackdown is taking place at a time when Hong Kong is actively refining its cryptocurrency regulatory landscape. The Securities and Futures Commission introduced new rules in April requiring crypto exchanges offering staking services to comply with stricter oversight. In February, the regulator also launched a roadmap to enhance market access, improve compliance, broaden product offerings, bolster crypto infrastructure, and foster stronger industry partnerships. Roman Storm Fights Back In the US, attorneys for the developer of the crypto mixing protocol Tornado Cash, Roman Storm, filed a motion urging the court to reconsider its previous decision not to dismiss the case against him. The motion was submitted to Judge Katherine Polk Failla, and argues that the prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence involving communications with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that date back to 2023. Roman Storm According to Storm’s legal team, the documents in question show that FinCEN does not consider non-custodial crypto mixers like Tornado Cash to fall under the legal definition of a “money transmitting business.” This is a crucial distinction that undermines the basis for many of the charges. Storm’s attorneys claimed that the government knew this since at least 2023 and yet still proceeded with cases against Tornado Cash and the developers of Samourai Wallet. They allege this is a case of either the government misleading the court or playing “fast and loose” with the facts during its initial arguments against motions to dismiss and compel discovery. Part of the letter that was sent to Judge Failla In a May 16 letter , Storm’s defense pointed to disclosures made in the Samourai Wallet case, which also included FinCEN documents and similar legal arguments. Prosecutors, however, denied any wrongdoing by stating that the FinCEN communications were submitted during the legal discovery process in the court’s required timeframe. The motion now adds to growing scrutiny of the legal strategy being used by US authorities to prosecute developers of non-custodial crypto privacy tools. Roman Storm’s trial is moving forward even after Federal Judge Robert Pitman ruled in April that the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) cannot reimpose sanctions on Tornado Cash. Although prosecutors modified the charges against Storm, the continued pursuit of the case raised some important questions about the government’s interpretation of FinCEN’s own guidance and its approach to crypto regulation.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-19 05:05:20

Plaintiffs Scott Bernstein, Gina Greeder and James Lonergan claimed in the May 13 lawsuit filed in a federal court that Coinbase’s “wholesale collection” of faceprints for its Know Your Customer requirements violates BIPA, as they weren’t notified. The group claimed Coinbase failed to notify users in writing of the collection, storage, or sharing of their biometric data and the purpose and retention schedule for their data. “Coinbase does not publicly provide a retention schedule or guidelines for permanently destroying Plaintiffs’ biometric identifiers as specified by BIPA,” they alleged. The complaint said Coinbase requires users to verify their identity by uploading a government-issued photo ID and a selfie, which is then sent to a third-party facial recognition software to scan and extract facial geometry. This process captures biometric identifiers without users’ informed written consent, which the suit claimed violates BIPA. Coinbase ID verification procedures. Source: CourtListener Additionally, the group claimed Coinbase violated the law by sharing biometric data without users’ consent to third-party verification vendors such as Jumio, Onfido, Au10tix and Solaris. “Coinbase ‘obtains’ biometric data in violation of [BIPA] because it explicitly directed the Third Party Verification Providers to use its software to verify and authenticate users, including Plaintiffs, and its software does so by collecting biometric data,” the complaint read. The group claimed that more than 10,000 individuals have filed demands for arbitration over these issues with the American Arbitration Association, which Coinbase has allegedly refused to pay the required arbitration fees, causing them to be dismissed.

The group is seeking relief of $5,000 per willful or reckless violation found, $1,000 per negligent violation found, along with injunctive relief and litigation costs. Coinbase has also recently been hit with at least six lawsuits over its May 15 disclosure that some of its customer support agents were bribed to leak users' data. Past BIPA violation suit sent to arbitration In May 2023, a group of Coinbase users sued the exchange under similar accusations of BIPA violations. A judge later allowed that lawsuit to pause pending arbitration and dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice on Feb. 3 after Coinbase and the group of users agreed to drop the action.

The bulls even pushed the price above the $0.2320 resistance zone. However, the bears were active near the $0.2380 level. A high was formed at $0.2378 and the price reacted lower. There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2109 swing low to the $0.2370 high. Dogecoin price is now trading just below the $0.2250 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. However, there is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $0.220 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. DOGE Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.2250 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.2320 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.2380 level. A close above the $0.2380 resistance might send the price toward the $0.250 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.2720 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.2850. More Losses In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.2320 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.220 level. The next major support is near the $0.2170 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2109 swing low to the $0.2370 high. The main support sits at $0.2120. If there is a downside break below the $0.2120 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.20 level or even $0.1880 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.220 and $0.2120.

The weaker-than-expected readings on CPI and inflation expectations keep markets buoyed, while the Trump administration’s Middle East deals were a boon for the AI sector. Additionally, US Treasury yields are surging again. “Trade deals, recession worries, lower inflation, and slowing GDP all can’t get lower yields,” said the Kobeissi Letter, which added, “Meanwhile, Fed Chair Powell remains adamant on not cutting rates.” Moody’s downgrade of the US credit rating on Friday was also good news for store-of-value assets such as Bitcoin and gold. Economic Events May 19 to 23 There may be some market reaction to the Moody’s downgrade on Monday, which could set the stage for further volatility this week. May’s S&P Global Manufacturing and Services PMI (purchasing manager’s index) preliminary readings are due on Thursday. These leading economic indicators gauge activity in the manufacturing and services sectors, which reflect business and consumer sentiment. Most official economic data has suggested that the US economy is holding up reasonably well. However, they have been more backward-looking and don’t yet properly capture the aftermath of President Trump’s announcement of widespread tariffs in early April. PMIs may provide a more accurate picture of the real impact. There are also some home sales reports coming this week, which shed light on the US housing market but have virtually no impact on crypto asset markets. Key Events This Week: 1. Markets React to Moody’s Downgrade – Monday 2. US Crude Oil Inventory data – Wednesday 3. S&P Global Manufacturing PMI data – Thursday 4. April Existing Home Sales data – Thursday 5.

In Asia, markets will watch for progress in trade talks between the US and regional players in addition to key data from China and a central bank rate announcement. Crypto Market Outlook Crypto markets started the new week solidly with Bitcoin closing its highest-ever daily and weekly candles at just below $106,500. However, the asset has started to cool during Monday morning trading in Asia, dropping back below $103,000 following its multi-month high. “As the US Dollar weakens and uncertainty rises, Bitcoin and Gold are thriving,” said Kobeissi. Ethereum has weakened significantly, falling almost 3% on the day back beneath the $2,400 level following a solid week. The altcoins were a mixed bag, with gains for Dogecoin , Shiba Inu, and Litecoin, while Tron, Leo, and wrapped ETH derivatives lost ground.

Hackers approached customer support agents with bribery offers and detailed instructions for contacting attackers through Telegram, Bloomberg reports citing people familiar with the matter. Both exchanges managed to block the attempts without losing any customer data. The exchanges faced tactics mirroring those used against Coinbase (COIN), which earlier this week revealed it expects to pay $180 million to $400 million in remediation costs and customer reimbursements after attackers gained access to their personal information. That breach led to a $20 million ransom demand after the attackers managed to bribe Coinbase’s overseas employees/contractors to get customer information. The exchange has fired the staff involved and has contacted law enforcement. At Binance, internal systems including artificial intelligence bots helped detect bribery-related messages, shutting down conversations before they escalated. Policies that limit access to customer data unless users initiate contact also helped mitigate risk.

Over the last few years, meme coins have taken the crypto world by storm, leading to massive gains for early investors. With a community-driven spirit, high volatility, and the potential for astronomical returns, coins like Arctic Pablo Coin, Book of Meme, Neiro, Snek, and Pepe Coin have all captured the attention of investors eager for the next big thing. But which one stands out among the rest? Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) has been making waves recently, and it’s clear that it has the potential to offer more than just meme status. While Book of Meme, Neiro, Snek, and Pepe Coin have unique qualities, Arctic Pablo Coin is one to watch for anyone looking for a game-changing opportunity. This article will take you through the developments, features, and updates on all these coins, but first, let’s dive deeper into Arctic Pablo Coin and why it’s taking the lead in the race. 1. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Deflationary Powerhouse What makes Arctic Pablo Coin a standout investment opportunity? Let’s start with its deflationary mechanism. APC incorporates a unique token burn process to boost scarcity and value, unlike many other tokens. Weekly token burns are carried out during the presale, permanently removing unsold tokens from circulation. This burn mechanism is not just a marketing gimmick but a crucial element in creating long-term sustainability and increasing investor value. After the presale concludes, all remaining unsold tokens will be burned, reducing the supply. These transactions are recorded on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring transparency and trust. The deflationary model is designed to create a rarer and more valuable token over time, meaning that as the presale continues, early investors may see their investment grow exponentially. With fewer tokens in circulation, the value of each APC could increase, making it a potentially lucrative investment. Presale Excitement – A Journey to Massive Returns Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale strategy is unique and thrilling for investors. Instead of being broken into predictable stages, the meme coin presale is divided by locations as the coin “travels.” Right now, it’s in the Penguin Paradise stage, where the current price is $0.000165. This means early investors still have an opportunity to buy into APC at a highly affordable price before it reaches its launch price of $0.008. The total raised is over $2.53 million, and the potential ROI is staggering – early investors can expect 4,748.48% ROI from the 23rd presale stage to the launch price. If you invest $500 now, you will receive 3,030,300 APCs. When the coin is listed at $0.008, your investment could skyrocket to $24,242.40. That’s not just a return; it’s an opportunity for massive growth. Arctic Pablo Coin is quickly gaining recognition as one of the best meme coins to invest in May 2025 . But time is ticking – the presale is progressing fast, and the window of opportunity won’t last forever. Don’t miss the chance to be part of a coin on a journey toward significant growth. 2. Book of Meme – A Tale of Creativity and Community Book of Meme has quickly gained traction with its unique, narrative-driven concept in the meme coin space. Designed to bring together creators, fans, and meme enthusiasts, this coin aims to build a vibrant community that values creativity. While it may not offer the same deflationary mechanics as Arctic Pablo Coin, Book of Meme has seen impressive growth thanks to its storytelling aspect, engaging users in a way few other meme coins can. If you believe in the power of community-driven projects, this coin could be a fun, long-term investment. Book of Meme made it to this list thanks to its engaging community and creative concept. 3. Neiro – A Rising Star in the Meme Coin Space Neiro is a relatively new coin that is steadily carving its niche in the meme coin market. It has the unique feature of combining both memes and artificial intelligence, creating a buzz among tech-savvy crypto enthusiasts. Neiro promises high growth potential, though it still has a long way to go in mass adoption. What makes Neiro intriguing is its cross-platform utility, allowing users to integrate memes into various apps and platforms. Neiro has earned its place on this list due to its potential to tap into the AI and meme sectors simultaneously. 4. Snek – Slithering Towards Success Snek is a meme coin that’s garnered attention thanks to its quirky branding and fun, playful nature. Snek offers a low entry point for those who want to dip their toes into the meme coin market without taking a significant risk. The coin has a strong community of followers who love its whimsical approach to cryptocurrency, and its future seems promising. The Snek community continues to grow, and with its fun-loving spirit, it’s likely to maintain its spot in the meme coin scene for the foreseeable future. Snek earned its spot due to its strong, enthusiastic community and unique branding. 5. Pepe Coin – A Meme Coin with Endless Potential Pepe Coin has been around for a while, leveraging the popularity of the iconic Pepe the Frog meme. While it’s not as innovative as some other meme coins, it still has a massive fan base. Pepe Coin’s value lies in its brand recognition and ability to tap into the enormous popularity of internet memes. Investors looking for a meme coin with a solid community and history may find value in Pepe Coin. Its staying power in the meme coin world places it firmly on this list. Final Verdict: Why Arctic Pablo Coin is the Meme Coin to Invest in May 2025 Based on the latest research, Arctic Pablo Coin is among the Best Meme Coins to invest in May 2025. From its deflationary mechanics and unique presale structure to its massive potential for ROI, APC stands out from the crowd. The other coins – Book of Meme, Neiro, Snek, and Pepe Coin – have their merits, but none offer the same blend of excitement, scarcity, and growth potential as Arctic Pablo Coin. If you want to get in early on the next big thing in crypto, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale presents an opportunity you won’t want to miss. Investing now could lead to exponential returns, with APC’s potential for growth and scarcity driving up its value over time. Don’t wait until it’s too late – take advantage of this presale opportunity before it’s gone. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ FAQs Why is Arctic Pablo Coin’s deflationary mechanism so important? The deflationary token burn ensures that the supply of APC is limited, which can lead to a higher value for holders as fewer tokens circulate. How does Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale differ from other coins? APC’s presale is divided by locations rather than stages, offering a unique approach and ensuring excitement as it “travels.” What is the ROI potential for Arctic Pablo Coin from presale to launch? Investors can expect up to 4,748.48% ROI from the 23rd presale stage to the launch price. Is Arctic Pablo Coin a safe investment? While all investments carry risk, APC’s deflationary mechanics and impressive presale results make it a strong contender for long-term growth. How can I participate in the Arctic Pablo Coin presale? Simply purchase tokens during the presale to secure your position before the coin officially launches at a higher price. What makes Arctic Pablo Coin different from other meme coins? Its innovative burn mechanism, transparency through Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and unique presale structure set it apart from others in the meme coin market. When is the best time to invest in Arctic Pablo Coin? The best time is now – during the presale, before the price rises significantly at launch.

These businesses include a Chinese energy company, a healthcare group, and a Shanghai-based biotech company. The companies are also exploring share placements or dual listings. People familiar with the matter said the move is part of a broader push by Chinese firms to gain a foothold in Southeast Asia. They attempt to find alternative markets as the trade war between China and the United States rages on. The US and China have long been locked in a tit-for-tat tariff war. Towards the peak of the trade war, the US slapped tariffs of up to 145% on certain Chinese goods while China issued tariffs of up to 125% on American imports. Although the two sides recently agreed to a temporary 90-day break, questions linger about the future of the trade relationship. Analysts say this uncertainty is leading Chinese companies to seek new gateways to global markets, with Singapore rising to the top of the list. Singapore Exchange draws major Chinese firms for listings The Singapore Exchange has been unable to contest Hong Kong’s reign of listing the best and most profitable IPOs. So far this year, SGX has seen just four listings. In comparison, 71 new listings have been issued in Hong Kong since the start of 2024 (which still holds its title as the largest market in Asia for IPOs). Jason Saw, head of investment banking at CGS International Securities, said that Chinese interest could change the current situation. He explained that after the US raised tariffs on China, inquiries about Singapore Exchange (SGX) listings had “shot through the roof.” Pol de Win, senior managing director at SGX, echoed the sentiment, adding that Singapore’s role as a regional hub is increasingly valuable for companies seeking stable, neutral markets outside the US and Hong Kong. Singapore boosts market to attract global companies Singapore is taking steps to develop its stock market better to lure more foreign companies . Earlier this year, the government unveiled a 20% tax rebate for primary listings to cut costs and make companies more likely to opt for SGX. Additional measures to encourage listings and trading volumes will likely be implemented later this year. Those efforts are part of Singapore’s broader push to position itself as Southeast Asia’s preeminent financial hub. Singapore’s political stability, which may be a potentially attractive draw for companies cautious of geopolitical risk, would be an additional factor in its favor, EY’s Asia Pacific IPO Leader, Ringo Choi, said. Still, challenges remain. Singapore’s stricter listing requirements and conservative investor base could hold it back from narrowing the gap with Hong Kong. A Singapore-based tech executive, speaking anonymously, said the country needs to streamline its listing process, particularly for tech startups. The executive added that most regional startups are also based in Singapore, which makes sense for an IPO. However, the executive continued that the current constraints would have to be relaxed for this to happen. China has long pushed for closer economic ties with the region, especially as it feuds with Washington on multiple fronts. Chinese firms see Southeast Asia as a fast-growing market that is home to a growing middle class and an expanding appetite for consumer goods. Listing in Singapore allows Chinese companies to raise money locally and increase their brand name. This twofold incentive is what makes Singapore so appealing. Hong Kong is still the preferred offshore destination among Chinese companies, but Singapore’s incremental reforms and offerings make it increasingly attractive for big players.

While Russian firms may still be able to use stablecoins like Tether for cross-border settlements, domestic investor access to USDT appears increasingly at risk. No Explicit Ban, but All Signs Point to Trouble for USDT Following the freeze of USDT wallets last month, the Central Bank of Russia has introduced new rules before launching its regulated crypto sandbox on May 26. The sandbox is designed to let firms use crypto in global trade, but with tight restrictions on what tokens are allowed. While the bank avoids naming specific assets, experts believe these regulations are effectively engineered to exclude USDT and most other USD-backed stablecoins. Under the new framework, only tokens from “friendly countries” can be traded, those not support sanctions against Russia. Moreover, the rules target coins that could be “blocked” or deactivated by issuers, a clause analysts say directly points at Tether, which has the ability to freeze wallets and deny redemptions. A meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy could take place if the two sides come to certain agreements, Interfax reported https://t.co/KykMbJbU2I — Bloomberg (@business) May 17, 2025 Experts Say USDT Doesn’t Qualify Mikhail Uspensky, a crypto regulatory advisor in Russia, confirmed that USDT likely doesn’t meet the new requirements and would be barred from domestic circulation. Georgy Gukasyan, legal director at DRT, further explained that Tether’s compliance with U.S. sanctions gives it the power to deny redemptions and freeze assets, leaving Russian holders vulnerable. Stablecoin Use Abroad Still Open Despite the restrictions, both experts agree that using USDT for cross-border settlements will remain legal. The sandbox’s core intent is to support international trade, not individual investors. But for traders and crypto investors in Russia, the writing on the wall is clear— USDT is on its way out. With Tether already cooperating with U.S. authorities in past enforcement actions, such as freezing wallets linked to Russian exchange Garantex, confidence in USDT’s usability within Russia is eroding fast. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : GENIUS Act Vote on May 19: Will the U.S. Finally Regulate Stablecoins? , Other Alternate Ways Russia is also advancing two pilot programs for cross-border payments using digital assets.

For 2025, analysts are increasingly pointing to Bitcoin (BTC), XRP , and the rising political altcoin MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) as the three that could define this next breakout era. Joining them in a more strategic role is Polkadot (DOT) — a scalable Layer-0 that’s set to power multi-chain infrastructure in the background. This time around, it’s not just about technology or hype. It’s about positioning, timing, and capital rotation. And this trio appears ready to take the lead. CLICK HERE – SECURE YOUR SPOT BEFORE 25x DISAPPEARS MAGACOINFINANCE Is Emerging as the Final Undervalued Entry MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing early-stage attention like no other altcoin in Q2 2025. With Stage 8 nearly complete and a firm listing target of $0.007 , the project is now being labeled by analysts as the final high-upside altcoin with defined ROI mechanics before listings begin . What’s driving investor momentum: A realistic 25x–35x growth model Strong narrative identity with market differentiation Transparent price targeting — unlike most meme tokens or Layer-1s While BTC and XRP may lead from the front, MAGACOIN FINANCE is where many early movers are focusing for true exponential upside . Once it lists, this entry window disappears — and large players are already loading in before Stage 9 begins. Bitcoin Remains the Macro King Bitcoin (BTC) remains the centerpiece of the crypto economy. Trading in the $103K–$104K range , it has absorbed institutional inflows through ETFs and is being treated globally as a macro hedge against inflation and monetary instability . Analysts project targets of $150K to $250K over the next 12–18 months, especially as capital continues to move from traditional markets into hard digital assets. Bitcoin will not provide 100x returns, but it is still the foundation. And that foundation is now enabling the capital flow into breakout altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP Returns to Institutional Relevance XRP has reclaimed its spot on the top-tier watchlists following U.S. legal clarity and the anticipated launch of CME futures . Trading above $2.30 , XRP is not only a speculative asset — it’s now a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain settlements . Forecasts point to $5–$15 in the near term, with longer-term views reaching above $30 , depending on global adoption. XRP’s role in the 2025 cycle? To move big capital across borders while opening the floodgates to institutional flows . It’s now part of the cycle’s core trio — and many are pairing it with early-stage entries like MAGA to build both depth and potential in their portfolios. Polkadot (DOT) Is Quietly Building Cross-Chain Infrastructure Polkadot (DOT) doesn’t grab headlines, but it’s playing a major strategic role in powering multi-chain functionality. DOT enables blockchains to communicate and scale without fragmentation — a critical component as Web3 applications expand. Currently trading under $10, DOT is widely expected to regain strength later in the cycle, especially as developers build on parachain infrastructure and inter-chain activity increases. While not a high-volatility moonshot, DOT acts as a core utility layer that supports projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE as they move into multi-network adoption. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Conclusion The 2025 cycle is forming — and with it, the trio that could dominate headlines, capital flows, and investor portfolios. Bitcoin holds the macro foundation. XRP opens the doors for institutions. MAGACOIN FINANCE delivers the aggressive early-stage opportunity. Add Polkadot to the mix as a strategic infrastructure layer, and you have the full spectrum of this cycle’s most-watched assets . As Stage 9 nears and listings approach, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains the only asset in this group that hasn’t fully moved yet — and smart capital is taking advantage before that changes.

While analysts maintain the “calm before the storm” narrative, Official Trump ($TRUMP) appears on the verge of upside breakouts as bullish catalysts loom. The meme token formed a symmetrical triangle formation, and this week’s dinner between top TRUMP holders and the US president could support the impending bullish breakouts. The triangle’s measured move suggests extended gains to $28.63. That would mean an approximately 124% upswing from current prices of $12.78. $TRUMP holders to dine with the US president According to Invezz , the top 220 investors of TRUMP meme crypto will attend a private dinner with the pro-crypto United States president this Thursday, May 22. Furthermore, the top 25 holders will access even more perks, including touring the White House and an exclusive session with the president before the meal. drout @droutdrout · Follow Finna crashout at the trump dinner 6:06 PM · May 12, 2025 32 Reply Copy link Read 5 replies $TRUMP, launched a few days before the January 20 presidential inauguration, has been a key for the Trump family’s venture into the crypto market. Real-world events like the upcoming dinner reflect the project’s dedication to blending loyalty, political identity, and financial speculations. The occasion, representing the most audacious connection between politics and cryptocurrencies, has grabbed the digital asset community’s attention. Meanwhile, that has triggered speculations about $TRUMP’s potential price reactions and future performance. The Thursday event might catalyze significant uptrends, especially if media coverage and key announcements follow. Narrative remains paramount in meme assets, and Trump’s power and prestige positions the alt for impressive price actions. $TRUMP price outlook: technical pattern meets political event As the alt anticipates bullish moves, analyst Rose Signals identified a vital price pattern. $TRUMP’s 1-day chart has tightened within a textbook symmetrical triangle formation for weeks. Source – Rose Signals The pattern remains vital as it often heralds a swift price move in either direction. Meanwhile, $TRUMP price coils around the triangle’s apex, with eyes on the charts and Thursday’s dinner table. The daily chart shows the triangle setup maintained crucial support and resistance zones in the past three weeks. Meanwhile, looming upside catalysts signal imminent rallies. Meanwhile, enthusiasts should watch for breakouts beyond the triangle’s upper boundary and closing above $13 to confirm extended gains. $TRUMP hovers at $12.78 after sliding from yesterday’s high of $13.49. Chart by Coinmarketcap Bulls will target the initial resistance at $16.90 before exploring $23.64. Broad-based rallies could support gains toward the measured target of $28.63, translating to a 124% surge from current prices. Surged volume driven by positive announcements and media coverage during this week’s dinner could support the potential breakout. However, nothing is a guarantee in the crypto space. You probably remember how Dogecoin disappointed after Elon Musk’s SNL appearance in 2021. Possible bearish sentiments around the much-awaited meeting with Donald Trump could catalyze bearish price actions. That might catalyze a downside breach of the triangle, with price dips below $10.12 invalidating the bullish pattern. Panic selling might trigger corrections to $8 – a nearly 38% dip from $TRUMP’s current price.

Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis , of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin ( BTC ), and effectively split Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units. It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create “bits,” representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin. However, Carvalho said Song’s approach would still require Bitcoin users to think about decimals and “shifts complexity rather than eliminating it.” Block Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey is among those calling for the change, saying in a May 18 X post that satoshis, or sats, are too confusing for newcomers. “Bits of Bitcoin is better, and just Bitcoin is best,” Dorsey said. Dorsey pointed to a December 2024 discussion on the topic where Stevie Lee, product lead of Bitcoin infrastructure firm Spiral, argued that not enough people know or care about what satoshis are. “Everyone knows Bitcoin, no one knows sats, people just want to send and receive Bitcoin,” Lee said, recalling past conversations where people thought satoshis were an entirely new token, unrelated to Bitcoin. He added that the Bitcoin community shouldn’t be too concerned with the change, as they know the underlying economics of Bitcoin would remain intact. Related: DOJ charges 12 more gamer-turned $263M Bitcoin robbers Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten and Byte Federal director of product Michelle Weekley were among those who opposed the change. “People understand cents in a dollar, they will understand sats in a Bitcoin,” Weekley said on X. Magdalena Gronowska, a self-described Bitcoin consultant, claimed that the change could make some people think that Bitcoin abruptly crashed from its current price of around $100,000 and that its “supply has massively inflated.” Zaprite business development lead Parker Lewis argued that sats were easier to understand. Source: Parker Lewis Bitcoin creator was open to the idea Robin Linus, the creator of the Bitcoin Virtual Machine (BitVM), highlighted that even Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, was open to changing how Bitcoin’s units are displayed for the purpose of usability. “If it gets tiresome working with small numbers, we could change where the display shows the decimal point,” Satoshi said in a February 2010 post before vanishing the following year. “Same amount of money, just different convention,” Satoshi added.

Pyth Network’s ( PYTH ) price has fallen 7% in the past 24 hours to $0.1449. The token has now declined over 21% in the past seven days and is trading 87.65% below its all-time high of $1.20. Despite the downturn, market activity has picked up. PYTH’s 24-hour trading volume rose 45.3% to $38.5 million, and derivatives volume surged 58%, as per Coinglass data . A rise in open interest by 0.71% suggests that new positions are being added rather than closed, reflecting cautious positioning as traders anticipate volatility from the upcoming unlock. According to Tokenomist data , roughly 2.13 billion PYTH tokens, worth approximately $313 million, are set to be unlocked on Monday, May 19. This represents a massive 58.62% of the circulating supply, with only 36% of total tokens unlocked so far. When so much supply is released at once, token unlocks frequently result in strong sell -side pressure, which may affect price movement if recipients decide to sell off tokens.

At 43.5, the relative strength index, which has been falling, suggests that the market is losing momentum but is not yet oversold. PYTH price anysis. Credit: crypto.news Most indicators are displaying signals that range from neutral to negative. The moving average convergence divergence level is slightly negative, and momentum is likewise in sell territory. All major moving averages, from 10-day to 200-day, both simple and exponential, show sell signals, with the 10-day EMA now at $0.1616, well above the current price. A move toward the lower support at $0.1134 is possible as PYTH has broken its immediate $0.1504 support.

At the stroke of midnight UTC on May 18, Bitcoin wrapped up its strongest weekly finish to date, settling just shy of $106,500, as per Coingecko data. Bitcoin has now closed at a weekly gain for the past six consecutive weeks as bulls dominate the market. Bitcoin posted its previous record weekly gain back in December when the price reached above $104,400. The largest crypto by market cap then notched its all-time high of 108,786 on 20 January. Source: TradingView Bitcoin ETFs and Macro Factors Likely Fueling the Rally At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $103,500, 10% up in the last 7 days and 21% in the last 30 days. While the previous all-time high rally may have been a result of enthusiasm around Donald Trump’s inauguration and retail speculation, this time Bitcion’s rally has much to do with consistent spot ETF inflows and the impact of macro factors. With uncertainity around inflation, tariff deals, and other major economic factors, investors could be turning to safe assets like Bitcoin and Gold. Between May 12 and May 16 (ET), spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a cumulative net inflow of $604 million, extending their streak of positive weekly inflows to five straight weeks. In just the first half of May, US spot Bitcoin ETFs amassed over $2.8 billion in net inflows, as per SoSoValue data.

With inflation tensions and fed chair adamant of not cutting rates, investors might be looking at Bitcoin as the perfect safe haven. So far Bitcoin has reacted positively to the downgrade of the US credit ratings. Japan’s 40-year bond yield has surged to its highest point in more than two decades. Prime Minister Ishiba described the situation as “worse than Greece.” The global uncertainty and fear of recessions has once again placed Bitcoin as the leading safe haven for investors worldwide.

He emphasized that XRP is being chosen not for hype, but because of its practical, technical advantages in payment systems. Ripple News: Why XRP Is Winning Institutional Trust Let’s dive into what makes XRP the go-to choice for institutions in 2025. Spoiler: It’s all about speed, cost, and scalability. 1/ Ultra-low Fees Each XRP transaction costs just $0.00002 — and that fee stays consistent even… — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) May 17, 2025 Why Are Institutions Turning Toward XRP One of XRP’s strongest selling points is its predictable fee structure. Transactions cost just $0.00002, even during times of high network demand. Brett noted that even if XRP reached $1,000 in value, the transaction fee would still only be 0.00001 XRP. This fee stability gives institutions the certainty they need when operating at scale. Another advantage is that XRP doesn’t rely on miners or validator incentives. Instead, it uses a consensus mechanism that eliminates variable costs tied to network usage. Without rewards to chase or gas fees to compete, XRP avoids congestion that slows other blockchains down or makes them prohibitively expensive. Unlike other networks that take hours to settle, transactions on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) settle in under three seconds. Due to block production times, there is no need for multiple confirmations or delays. This speed is critical for enterprises where delayed settlement can impact liquidity, compliance, or customer experience. XRP’s deflationary model also appeals to institutions. Each transaction destroys a small amount of XRP, permanently removing it from circulation. This burn mechanism reduces spam and gradually lowers the total supply, contributing to long-term value without relying on artificial scarcity. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Brett also noted that the XRP network can handle 1,500 transactions per second, consistently and without slowdown. While other networks often see performance dips under load, XRP’s throughput remains stable, making it suitable for high-frequency operations in real-world environments. Institutional Benefits That Matter Brett highlighted several features that appeal directly to institutional users: real-time confirmations, no need for pre-funded accounts in cross-border payments, and a flat, low-fee structure. Together, these characteristics position XRP as a serious infrastructure layer for modern payments. “No one wants to pay $30 to send $30,” Brett remarked, pointing out the impracticality of networks with high and variable fees. XRP avoids that problem entirely, and Michael Arrington, founder of TechCrunch, recently showed the asset’s advantages with a $50 million transaction that cost $0.3 and was completed in a few seconds. XRP was not designed for speculation but for efficient, scalable payments. XRP’s design choices are proving well-suited for institutions seeking speed, reliability, and cost-efficiency in their operations, and the growing institutional adoption shows its superiority to other assets.

The assets, valued at 4.5 million Australian dollars ($2.88 million), were seized following a court forfeiture order secured by the Australian Federal Police (AFP). In a statement issued on May 18 , the AFP said the action was taken under the Proceeds of Crime Act after the Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT) determined the property could not be tied to any legitimate income. Bitcoin Trail From Luxembourg Sparks 2018 Investigation The investigation into Bitcoin crime began in 2018 when law enforcement officials in Luxembourg flagged suspicious transactions. According to the AFP, these transactions led back to the Queensland resident, who was previously convicted of cybercrime in the United States. Local reports have identified the man as Shane Stephen Duffy, known for his role in a high-profile hacking and fraud case. Duffy pleaded guilty in 2016 to selling the personal data of League of Legends players. While he was not directly involved in the 2011 cyberattack on Riot Games, which exposed the personal details of over five million users, he allegedly obtained the data through online channels and profited from its sale. Authorities further linked Duffy to a 2013 theft of 950 Bitcoin from a French cryptocurrency exchange. Although no criminal charges were brought in connection to that case, the AFP argued that the recovered assets, including the Bitcoin, may have stemmed from the incident or other illicit activities. The AFP-led Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT) has secured the forfeiture of more than $4.5 million worth of assets, including a Queensland waterfront mansion, luxury car and Bitcoin, after identifying them as suspected proceeds of crime. https://t.co/Wglk0m5K50 — AFP (@AusFedPolice) May 17, 2025 AFP Commander Jason Kennedy stated that the agency’s mandate includes not only prosecuting cybercrime but also stripping criminals of their gains. “The profits derived from criminal activities are also often used to fund further criminal acts,” Kennedy said, adding that the funds recovered from such operations are redirected to support community crime prevention and law enforcement efforts. The seized assets will be liquidated, with the proceeds funneled into a special-purpose fund dedicated to supporting law enforcement and crime deterrence programs across the country. Since mid-2019, the CACT has restrained over $1.2 billion in assets ranging from luxury homes and vehicles to cryptocurrency and fine art, reflecting a broader crackdown on digital and financial crimes in Australia. Australia Cracks Down on Inactive Crypto Exchanges Last month, Australia’s financial intelligence agency said it is stepping up efforts to tighten oversight of crypto exchanges , warning that inactive platforms risk deregistration if they fail to voluntarily withdraw. At the time, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) said many registered digital currency exchange providers appear to have ceased operations but remain listed, potentially exposing the system to criminal exploitation. AUSTRAC stated it has begun contacting exchanges that no longer seem active, out of the 427 businesses currently registered. “Businesses registered with AUSTRAC are required to keep their details up to date; this includes details about services that are no longer provided,” the agency said.

At least six lawsuits were filed against Coinbase between May 15 and May 16, which all made various claims that the exchange failed to keep stringent security protocols to protect user data and handled the data breach aftermath poorly. In one of the lawsuits, filed in a New York federal court on May 16, plaintiff Paul Bender argued that Coinbase failed to protect the sensitive personal information of millions of users during the data breach. Users are suing Coinbase, alleging the exchange failed to protect their sensitive data. Source: PACER Coinbase reported on May 15 that four days earlier it had been hit with a $20 million extortion attempt after cybercriminals bribed several of its customer support agents to access internal systems and steal a limited amount of user account data. The stolen data included names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, some bank account identifiers, driver’s licenses, passports and some account data, such as balance snapshots and transaction history. Bender claimed that “Coinbase failed to implement and maintain reasonable security safeguards,” which exposed users to “serious and ongoing risks.” The suit also claimed Coinbase’s response to the incident was “inadequate, fragmented, and delayed.” “Users were not promptly or fully informed of the compromise, and Coinbase did not immediately take meaningful steps to mitigate further harm, provide identity protection services, or offer actionable guidance to affected individuals,” the complaint claimed. The lawsuit claimed users could face “substantial, immediate, and ongoing threat of identity theft and financial fraud” and that the consequences of the breach could be long-term or “potentially permanent” because the compromised information can’t be recovered or made secure once exposed. Flurry of lawsuits make similar allegations Two other lawsuits filed in a New York federal court made similar claims against Coinbase, while a fourth lawsuit added the allegation of unjust enrichment, arguing that Coinbase didn’t spend enough on data security measures. All four complaints ask for damages and other measures to help protect the plaintiff’s sensitive data. Meanwhile, a fifth lawsuit filed in a California federal court on May 15 made similar claims against Coinbase, but asked the court to order Coinbase to purge all sensitive data it holds about the plaintiffs and hire third-party security auditors to test its security systems, among other requests. A Coinbase spokesperson did not comment on the lawsuits and instead pointed Cointelegraph to a blog post it shared regarding the data breaches. Coinbase said it refused to pay the $20 million ransom and has flagged plans to reimburse users tricked into sending crypto to phishing scammers due to the data breach. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the exchange said it expects reimbursement expenses ranging from $180 million to $400 million. Related: Retired artist loses $2M in crypto to Coinbase impersonator The exchange also reportedly fired a group of customer support agents based in India following their alleged involvement in social engineering attacks on users. Coinbase (COIN) shares dipped 7% and dropped to $244 after it disclosed the data breach along with an ongoing SEC probe over misstated user numbers in 2021. The stock has since staged a comeback, spiking 9% and hitting $266 by the closing bell on May 16, according to Google Finance. Coinbase has climbed even higher following the data breach.

After the Consensus hype, the coin is now sitting around $0.70. Amid growing investor frustration, a new twist has emerged around Pi Network’s founder. Analyst Mr Spock recently shared a speculation, leaving everyone confused. Could Nikolas Kokkalis actually be Satoshi Nakamoto? Although it sounds wild, there are some reasons that he cited to back this speculation. Let’s find out what made him say that. Satoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, the world’s first decentralised cryptocurrency. He contributed to Bitcoin’s code and development until 2010, before he disappeared from the public. His identity still remains a mystery. Following the Clues: Kraken, Coinbase, and the Satoshi Connection Pi Network co-founder Kokkalis follows only a handful of exchanges on X—Coinbase, Kraken, and OKX. Kraken is associated with the last known transaction linked to Satoshi Nakamoto, one of the very exchanges that Nicholas follows. But how does that prove he is Satoshi? Here’s where things get more interesting. A Coinbase executive also believes that Kraken might hold information about Satoshi’s identity because their research suggests a connection between Satoshi-linked wallets and Cavirtex, a Canadian exchange later acquired by Kraken. This is not a coincidence, but precision, he says. While the community awaits a Binance listing overseas to boost Pi Network’s visibility, this analyst is thinking even bigger. He believes that once Pi launches on Coinbase, the U.S. could become a major driver of Pi’s real-world value. In response to the post, one of the users imagined a wild scenario and wrote that, if Pi Network’s founder is Satoshi, then when Satoshi sells off their Bitcoin, it could cause problems for governments. And after that, Pi could become the new global currency with early users benefiting the most. Experts Point to Strange Coincidences Kokkalis has a PhD in blockchain technology, which is the kind of expertise someone would expect from Bitcoin’s creator. Like Satoshi Nakamoto, he seems detached from money, building Pi Network by distributing tokens without asking investors for cash. Analyst Dr Altcoin had also taken a close look at Nicholas’ academic work and had found that Nicholas has an impressive background in computer science with noteworthy publications. “What’s clear is that Pi Network is an innovative project built on Nicolas’ expertise, making it one of the most promising crypto ventures today,” he said. However, there is no concrete evidence to back these claims. But still, this has captured the attention of many in the crypto community.",Uncategorized|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-19 06:11:27

That’s as it approaches a technically significant formation known as the golden cross . That’s when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day average. Many people see that as a long-term bullish sign. It did, after all, precede Bitcoin’s big rally in 2023, when prices surged from $70,000 to over $100,000. Analysts are watching closely to see if history repeats itself. Bitcoin Nears Golden Cross Weeks After 'Trapping Bears' as U.S. Debt Concerns Mount https://t.co/kpJ4tIVH65 — Nature of Crypto (@AICryptoNewsNow) May 19, 2025 One reason for that interest is the state of the U.S. economy. Moody’s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating has investors looking for alternative stores of value. With U.S. national debt topping $36 trillion and Treasury yields climbing, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a hedge against fiscal instability. That’s a big deal. Bitcoin Outlook: Bearish Warning in BTC’s Short-Term Structure Despite all those bullish macro undercurrents, Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish as short-term structure is actually pretty fragile. On the 2-hour chart, you can see BTC breaking below its 50-EMA (around $103,698) and an ascending trendline. That’s a sign of weakening momentum. The MACD has flipped bearish too—histogram bars are deepening in the red and signal lines are diverging. That’s classic selling pressure. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Immediate support lies at $102,750. Below that, next support targets are $100,782 and $99,188. Reclaiming $103,698 and that broken trendline would shift sentiment bullish again. Resistance zones include $104,319 and $105,539. For newer traders, think of moving averages like guide rails. BTC just dipped beneath one. Until it reclaims those levels, price risks remain tilted to the downside. Seized Bitcoin Case Highlights Law Enforcement’s Reach Australian authorities seized $2.88 million in assets—including 25 Bitcoin and a luxury mansion—from a suspect linked to a 2013 crypto exchange hack. No theft charges were filed, but the court ruled for asset forfeiture under Australia’s Proceeds of Crime Act. Federal Police have swooped on a convicted computer hacker by seizing his waterfront home, luxury car and dozens of Bitcoin. This has been seven years in the making. https://t.co/VZ3A1cHvFd @_jordanquinn #7NEWS pic.twitter.com/KJ91nzu7qk — 7NEWS Queensland (@7NewsBrisbane) May 18, 2025 That case is alarming for some, but it also signals growing regulatory sophistication. For Bitcoin, it reinforces the idea that crypto is traceable and subject to legal oversight. That bolsters long-term trust among institutions—even if it causes short-term unease among privacy-focused holders. Dubai’s Crypto Push Bolsters Global Sentiment Ripple’s president praised Dubai’s proactive crypto stance during the Dubai Fintech Summit , citing its clear regulatory environment as a global benchmark. As Dubai cements its status as a leading blockchain hub, that institutional backing lends credibility to the broader crypto ecosystem—including Bitcoin. Our President @MonicaLongSF had the honor of meeting with His Highness Ahmed bin Saeed at @DubaiFintechSum . We continue to be impressed with the leadership demonstrated by Dubai as it establishes itself as one of the world’s leading hubs for digital assets. https://t.co/w9pd0cq1y7 — Ripple (@Ripple) May 14, 2025 Countries and cities providing transparent regulation attract serious capital and development. That institutional interest feeds back into market stability and could ultimately help support Bitcoin’s next leg higher. BTC Bull Token Nears $6.84M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Drives Demand As BTC holding near $102K, investor focus is shifting toward yield-generating altcoins—none more so than BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The token has now raised $5.87 million out of its $6.84 million presale goal, with a price increase looming as it enters its final funding stretch. What sets BTCBULL apart is its flexible staking model, offering an estimated 71% annual yield with no lockups or withdrawal penalties. This approach gives investors the freedom to earn passive income while maintaining full liquidity—an attractive alternative to traditional DeFi staking protocols. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $5,919,969.28/ $6,844,387 Token Price: $0.002515 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: 71% APY BTCBULL merges the viral appeal of meme tokens with the real-world utility of DeFi, making it a standout pick for those looking to capitalize on the 2025 crypto cycle. With under $1 million left before the next price tier, entry at current levels is limited—fueling urgency among retail investors seeking early access to passive yield.

However, the price is rising strongly today, somehow counterintuitively to the market’s overall tone. In the past 24 hours, EOS has gained 6.2% after World Liberty Financial, the Trump-backed decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol , purchased around $3 million worth of the token. Trump's World Liberty( @worldlibertyfi ) just spent 3M $USDT to buy 3.64M $EOS at $0.824. https://t.co/SUBbhLzmJr pic.twitter.com/nzpwkmPvi4 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 16, 2025 Lookonchain reported the purchase through its X account earlier today. Although WLFI invests in a significant number of cryptocurrencies, EOS has now become the 10th largest holding in its portfolio according to data from Arkham Intelligence . This is also the first time that WLFI makes a meaningful investment in this layer-one blockchain. The nature or scope of this transaction was not disclosed by any of the parties involved. Although it is a small purchase for a token with a market cap of $1.32 billion, the fact that WLFI hand-picked this token for such a large purchase may have improved investors’ EOS price prediction. The move also comes two days after EOS effectively launched Vaulta (A), the project’s new rebranded token. EOS holders can swap their assets for A with a 1:1 ratio and zero fees involved. Can this acquisition be considered a bullish signal for EOS? EOS Price Prediction: Break of Structure Could Result in a Reversion to the Mean The daily chart shows that, despite today’s uptick, the price of EOS has broken its bullish structure as it has moved below its second-best (and most relevant) higher high. Although the WLFI news probably prompted the price surge, EOS has already retreated after it retested this former support level, which has now turned into resistance. If the price action fails to recapture that threshold, which means climbing above $0.90 in the next few days, the odds favor the continuation of a downtrend, probably toward the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) as part of a simple mean reversion move. However, a break below that level could result in further losses as the next support stands at the $0.53 to $0.55 range. The influence of WLFI’s investment in the project is not necessarily big as none of the two parties has announced any intentions to collaborate in a joint venture or anything of that nature. Although the prospects of EOS as an investment are a bit uncertain despite WLFI’s backing, the best crypto presales of the year like MIND of Pepe (MIND) offer early buyers significant upside potential. MIND of Pepe (MIND) Gears Up to Launch its Widely Awaited Pepe-Inspired AI Agent After a few months of successfully raising the necessary capital, MIND of Pepe (MIND) is finally wrapping up its presale. However, you still have a few days to invest before the event officially ends. MIND of Pepe is an AI agent that leverages the popularity of the Pepe the Frog meme and combines it with the power of artificial intelligence to captivate large audiences across social media platforms like X. By interacting with high-profile accounts and users in the “cryptowit” niche within X, the agent will identify nascent social trends and emerging opportunities in the meme coin space primarily. All of this information will be passed on to $MIND holders so they can take advantage of these opportunities early on to reap the highest returns. To buy $MIND and become a member of the project’s exclusive club of investors, simply head to the MIND of Pepe website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to make your investment.

When asked about Ethereum versus Solana, he said, “Everyone thinks Ethereum does nothing, they haven’t done anything correctly, but it still has the most TVL, it still has the most number of developers, and it still is the most secure proof of stake blockchain.” Hayes did acknowledge that ETH prices have not done that well since 2020, and Solana has had a recent growth spurt, but added: “If I’m gonna deploy a fresh unit of fiat capital into the system, I think that Ethereum could outperform Solana in this next sort of 18-24 months bull run.” ETH to Outperform SOL Solana’s primary use case is meme coins , and the network did very well during that frenzy earlier this year. However, now that the bubble has burst, its activity and revenue have significantly declined. Despite all the FUD and hate, Ethereum remains the industry standard for DeFi, dApps, stablecoins, and real-world asset tokenization, having a dominant market share for each category. Looking at recent performance, Solana climbed from a low of around $100 during the April 7 crash to top out at just over $180 on May 14, before sliding back below $165, notching 80%. Ethereum has almost doubled over the same time, climbing from a bear market low of $1,400 to come just shy of $2,700 on May 14, before it retreated back below $2,400. While performance has been similar, Ethereum has done marginally better than Solana over the past six weeks, so maybe Hayes has seen this potential for future price increases. What About Bitcoin? When asked about what’s next for crypto markets, Hayes, who also admitted to having 20% of his portfolio allocated to gold, said he thought BTC dominance would continue to climb. “I think Bitcoin in this next little run could go close to $200,000, and then altcoin season comes around and we’ll see some interesting things,” he said before predicting a BTC price target of about $250,000 by the end of the year. In a recent blog post , Hayes said that pressures on the US dollar could propel BTC prices to seven figures before the end of the decade. “Foreign capital repatriation and the devaluation of the gargantuan stock of US Treasurys will be the two catalysts that will power Bitcoin to $1 million sometime between now and 2028.” The asset had dumped hard, losing more than $3,500 in a few hours as it fell below $103,000 at the time of writing.

Next and Final SEC Document In Ripple Case Raises Speculation,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-destined-to-surpass-589-new-sec-document-in-ripple-case-raises-speculation/,"A recent post by prominent crypto enthusiast JackTheRippler has reignited interest among some members of the XRP community, following a judicial filing in the SEC v. Ripple Labs case. The filing, Document 984, dated May 15, 2025, by United States District Judge Analisa Torres, formally denies a motion from the parties requesting an indicative ruling in what appears to be an attempt to revisit the terms of the previously adjudicated Final Judgment. The next and final SEC document has the number “985” Coincidence? I don’t think so! 589 is real… #XRP pic.twitter.com/GnDfxyMBtq — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) May 17, 2025 According to the order, the court concluded that the motion was procedurally improper and lacked the necessary burden of proof to vacate the injunction or reduce the civil penalty. JackTheRippler, a well-known figure in the XRP community on X, drew attention to the fact that this order is Document 984, and the next filing in the case will be numbered 985. He posted: “The next and final SEC document has the number ‘985’ Coincidence? I don’t think so! 589 is real…#XRP”. The reference to “589” is a widely recognized speculative theory within parts of the XRP community, suggesting that XRP’s price could one day reach $589. Crypto Enthusiasts like Crypto Bitlord have claimed $589 as the real price target for XRP . The basis for this theory has often been criticized for lacking fundamental support, but it continues to surface during significant developments in the SEC v. Ripple litigation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Responses The comparison appears to rely on numerological associations between the upcoming court document number (985) and the long-standing symbolic figure of 589, which some community members interpret as prophetic rather than literal. The post elicited a range of reactions from the XRP community. One user, Jabby Dodger, responded , “I hate to think that people have actually listened to someone who can’t tell a ‘5’ from a ‘4’ when it comes to their finances.” In defense of JackTheRippler’s comment, user Vanessa Cherry countered : “I hate to think that someone doesn’t read the post that says the ‘NEXT’ and final number,” emphasizing that the tweet did not claim the current document but the subsequent one as relevant. Another user, Patronio, echoed the sentiment of those who see deeper meaning in the document number: “If you posted a negative reply to this you don’t get it. Oh well, too late for you.” This comment reflects a mindset common among certain XRP holders who view the $589 belief as part of a broader, often conspiratorial, narrative about future adoption or a dramatic revaluation. Court Rejects Request for Reconsideration The court filing attached to the tweet is significant in its own right, as Judge Torres rejected a request to have the court reconsider portions of the Final Judgment related to Ripple’s liability and civil penalty. The motion was styled as a request for “settlement approval.” The court determined that it failed to meet the legal standard for relief from a final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60, which demands “exceptional circumstances.” The court emphasized that the parties did not even reference Rule 60 in their motion. In citing precedent from SEC v. Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., the court made clear that such requests must be grounded in specific procedural standards and that attempts to reframe the motion without addressing the necessary legal thresholds were insufficient. Consequently, the motion was denied, and the Clerk of Court was directed to terminate it. Speculation Continues Despite Judicial Clarity XRP supporters and skeptics continue to monitor developments as the case advances toward its procedural end. Whether the next document, numbered 985, holds any significance beyond court administration remains, for now, purely speculative. Despite the clear legal reasoning behind the court’s decision, portions of the XRP community remain fixated on symbolic numerology and the narrative of a $589 valuation .

This gain comes amid Bitcoin’s recent surge, which is nearing its all-time high of $108,786. A screenshot Bukele posted on X estimated that the nation’s holdings in Bitcoin were worth more than $644.4 million, compared with the initial amount spent of $287.1 million. This translates to an unrealized profit margin of 124.4%, with $69.8 million in unrealized gains generated so far this year. 🤷🏻‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/05izbAR202 — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) May 19, 2025 El Salvador doubles down on Bitcoin strategy despite IMF pressure El Salvador’s wallet currently holds approximately 6,181 BTC, equivalent to about $639 million at the time of reporting, based on figures from the nation’s Bitcoin office. Four years ago, El Salvador became the first country to formally adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender, as Bukele proposed, to promote financial inclusion. Since then, the country has been steadily accumulating bitcoin. Though it had agreed to rein in Bitcoin activities as part of a financing deal with the IMF (even allowing private businesses to accept Bitcoin voluntarily), Bukele remained steadfast in promoting the accumulation of Bitcoin. The agreements were quickly turned into law by the legislature in January. On X, Bukele earlier said that although El Salvador’s Bitcoin move has been heavily criticized from all corners of the world, and despite early Bitcoin advocates leaving the project, the country’s Bitcoin strategy lives on. Bitcoin rallies toward record highs The surge in El Salvador’s Bitcoin portfolio parallels Bitcoin’s broader market rally as it hovers near its all-time highs. This has been boosted by renewed enthusiasm for exchange-traded funds and changing economic indicators steering investor capital back toward riskier assets. The leading crypto rose above $105,700 on Sunday evening, extending gains made over the past two weeks. Earlier today, it reached a peak of $106,500. At present, bitcoin trades at about $102,387, according to CoinGecko. While previous rallies were often powered by retail speculation, this one unfolds amid heavy flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, stable interest rate expectations, and renewed debate around inflation as tariffs on key imports come back into focus. Singapore-based QCP Capital wrote in a note last week that, looking ahead, they believe there is further room for digital assets to rally, especially as Coinbase’s inclusion into the S&P 500 becomes a reality in a short while. Bitcoin ETFs attract billions as inflation worries fuel rally US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw over $2.8 billion in net inflows during the first half of May, according to data from SoSoValue. The biggest single-day influx occurred on May 2, with $674.9 million flowing in. As of May 16, cumulative inflows had reached $41.77 billion, pushing total net assets above $122 billion. Broader macroeconomic conditions have also supported Bitcoin’s rally. Lingering inflation concerns, particularly as new trade policies affect supply chains, have added to Bitcoin’s attractiveness as a potential hedge—especially if inflationary pressures continue. A temporary 90-day tariff reduction deal between the US and China has offered some relief, but elevated duties remain on sectors including electric vehicles, semiconductors, and consumer electronics.

Momentum has turned slightly negative, and the relative strength index has cooled from the overbought zone to 59.6. Ethereum price analysis. Credit: crypto.news While short-term signals like the 10-day EMA and SMA are flashing red, Ethereum is still above its 20-, 30-, and 50-day moving averages. At the moment, the majority of momentum indicators are neutral. Additionally, the MACD is still positive, suggesting that if the asset finds solid support within the current range, there may be a chance for a fresh uptrend.

Titan of Crypto, in a May 17 post on X, suggested that Ethereum still has “more gas in the tank,” citing the weekly Stochastic RSI, which has not yet reached extreme overbought levels. According to him, the rally could extend over the coming weeks. On the flip side, Crypto Patel views the current move as a healthy correction . He points to Ethereum’s rejection at the $2,500 level, an area known as a fair value gap, a price zone where the asset previously moved too quickly, often leaving behind unfilled orders. These gaps tend to get revisited by the market, either to confirm support or resistance. $ETH Pullback Loading: Is $1,800 the Next Big Buy Zone? #Ethereum faced rejection near the $2,500 FVG zone and is now entering a correction phase.

This area is a… pic.twitter.com/tExGXoojfZ — Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) May 17, 2025 Patel believes ETH could now dip into the $1,930 to $2,100 range, which also aligns with another FVG and a bullish order block near $1,810. Order blocks, which frequently serve as powerful support zones, are collections of sizable buy or sell orders made by institutions or whales. He argues that the next leg higher could push ETH closer to the $4,000–$5,000 range if demand holds here. The outlook for Ethereum is still cautiously optimistic, regardless of whether it finds support at current levels or declines further before the next rally.

His prediction is based on increasing market liquidity and expected pro-crypto policies under a Trump administration . Recent market trends back his bullish sentiment: January : BTC surged 9.54% February : Price correction pushed BTC below the $100K mark April : Strong rebound, but still below $100K May 8 : Single-day growth of 6.36%, finally breaking above $100K May (so far) : Up by 9.20% Hayes explained that the U.S. government is quietly boosting market liquidity by draining the Treasury General Account and using extraordinary measures —a move that he says supports the ongoing Bitcoin rally . Hayes on Ethereum vs. Solana: ETH Is Still King When asked about altcoins, Hayes warned investors to be cautious: “The next altcoin season will start once BTC hits $150K–$200K, but don’t expect 2021-style gains for everything,” he cautioned. His advice: Avoid dino coins (old, underperforming tokens) Look for tokens with high FDV , low float , no users , or no revenue Always ask: Can it outperform Bitcoin? Hayes also made it clear: he’s bullish on Ethereum over Solana . Ethereum remains undervalued and underestimated ETH leads in TVL , developer activity , and security He predicts Ethereum will outperform Solana over the next 18 to 24 months Performance Comparison (Last 30 Days): Ethereum : +48.9% Solana : +17.7% Past 7 Days: Ethereum: -4.5% Solana: -6.6% .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Altcoin Season Incoming?

According to data from SoSoValue, Bitcoin ETFs brought in $603.74 million over the past week from May 12-16, which was a little over 35% less than the $934 million they recorded the week before. Most of last week’s inflows went into BlackRock’s IBIT, which attracted a massive $841.7 million. Meanwhile, funds like Grayscale’s BTC and VanEck’s HODL drew in more modest inflows of $39.8 million and $7.3 million, respectively. However, not all funds had a good week. Fidelity’s FBTC recorded outflows of $122.2 million, while Grayscale’s GBTC and ARK 21Shares’ ARKB lost around $70 million each. Even Bitwise’s BITB and Invesco’s BTCO recorded modest net redemptions. The other ETFs saw zero flows over the week. Despite the slower pace last week, May is still looking strong overall. So far, $2.64 billion has flowed into Bitcoin ETFs this month, not far off from April’s $2.97 billion. Since their launch in January 2024, these ETFs have now brought in over $41 billion in net inflows. Interestingly, Ethereum ETFs had a better week. The nine ETF funds recorded $41.59 million in net inflows, a solid rebound after the $38.15 million in outflows the week before. You might also like: Moody’s cuts US credit rating, Bitcoin doesn’t flinch Much of the market hesitation can be traced back to Powell’s recent remarks after the April PPI report. While producer prices unexpectedly fell 0.5%, pointing to easing inflation, Powell made it clear that the Fed won’t rush into cutting rates. He stressed the need for “sustained evidence” that inflation is cooling before making any moves. Powell also highlighted that the economic backdrop has changed, real interest rates are higher, and global risks like tariffs and supply shocks are making inflation less predictable. These concerns have led analysts to push back their expectations for rate cuts, with many now eyeing September or later as the likely window. Naturally, crypto felt the impact. The total crypto market cap is down 3.3% over the past 24 hours, now sitting at $3.35 trillion. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is hovering around $103,000, down 0.7%, while Ethereum ( ETH ) took a heavier hit, dropping 4.8% to under $2,400, a key support level. Earlier last week, sentiment had briefly turned bullish after the U.S. and China agreed to roll back tariffs for 90 days, a move seen as positive for global markets. But the optimism was short-lived. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that the U.S. could quickly reimpose those tariffs if talks go sideways. Commenting on last week’s pullback, Ruslan Lienkha, Chief of Markets at YouHodler, told crypto.news that it was part of a natural correction within an ongoing uptrend but warned of potential risks. “The upward momentum in equity markets has moderated following the conclusion of tariff negotiations, as short-term traders began locking in profits, triggering corrective movements. This shift in sentiment has spilled over into riskier assets, including Bitcoin. As a result, the current pullback appears to be a correction within a broader medium-term uptrend. However, ongoing global economic uncertainty and persistently high interest rates in the U.S. may act as headwinds, potentially capping the upside potential of this trend.” Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler Looking ahead, all eyes are on the May 30 release of the PCE index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. That data could be key in determining whether Powell stays the course or finally pivots.

Dogecoin (DOGE) and Tron (TRX) have long been staples for bargain hunters, offering strong communities and established networks. But in 2025, a new player, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is entering the spotlight with serious momentum and real-world use case potential. Priced at $0.025 in Presale Phase 4, Mutuum Finance has already attracted over 11,000 investors and raised $8.7 million. Demand is accelerating, with more than 90% of this phase already sold. Investors joining now stand to gain 20% as the price rises to $0.03 in Phase 5, and up to 140% by the time of launch at $0.06. As the market gears up for its next breakout phase, these three altcoins are quietly building toward what could be a massive run to $5 valuations, making them some of the best altcoins to buy now before the crowd catches on. DOGE and TRX: Veteran Tokens with Room to Run Dogecoin (DOGE) and Tron (TRX) may come from opposite corners of the crypto universe, but both have shown remarkable resilience in a manic market. DOGE, which started out as a joke, has matured to become a popular digital currency with immense brand value and steady sponsorship from A-listers. On the other hand TRX has secured its position within the decentralized content and Web3 world with the promise of speed and scalability along with a growing ecosystem of dApps. While they’ve both hovered below $1 for years, heightened interest and greater acceptance in 2025 may propel them into reach of the $5 milestone. However, with the likes of rising stars Mutuum Finance making waves, even these old warhorses could soon be under threat from the new wave of altcoins. Mutuum Finance on the Rise Investor interest in Mutuum Finance is gaining momentum as its presale gains rapid pace. With a presale price of $0.025, investors in Phase 4 are positioning themselves to earn a 20% return when Phase 5 comes online and raises the token value to $0.03. With a market entry price plan at $0.06, investors in Phase 4 are facing potential returns of up to 140%. To date, the project has raised more than $8.7 million from more than 11,000 backers and the anticipation continues to build. Buy-and-Distribute Model Fuels Sustainable Growth Breaking away from traditional tokenomics, Mutuum Finance utilizes a “Buy-and-Distribute” model. It involves purchasing MUTM tokens on the open market and redistributing them to stakers, thus encouraging user engagement and long-term ecosystem well-being. A constant stream of rewards also encourages active user engagement and retention. To create a participatory, healthy community, Mutuum Finance has introduced a live leaderboard that displays the top 50 MUTM holders. This feature promotes equitable competition and gives additional bonuses to the high-placed ones—boosting user motivation and overall engagement on the platform. Security and Transparency at the Forefront Security is always given top priority at Mutuum Finance. The platform has teamed up with CertiK, a major blockchain security company, for an intensive review of its smart contracts. Following the completion of the audit, the findings will be made available on all of Mutuum’s official social platforms for full transparency. Mutuum Finance’s presale success with over $8.7 million raised through 11,000+ investors and 90% of Phase 4 sold signals a once-in-a-generation opportunity in the crypto world. With potential returns of up to 140% on launch and tested old guard Dogecoin and Tron poised for a breakout to $5, the trend is clear. Investors who move now have the opportunity to profit before these tokens hit mainstream awareness and prices rocket through the roof.

33767162,[object Object],1747639819,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Cardano Founder Reflects On Betrayal, Plans To Step Back",https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-betrayal-plans-to-step-back/,"In a deeply personal thread posted to X on Sunday, Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson said the past weeks’ accusations over the handling of unclaimed initial-coin-offering (ICO) funds had revealed “who [his] friends truly are” and left him determined to curtail his once-ubiquitous social-media presence. “The one advantage in a crisis or an event that tests people is that you rapidly get to see who your friends truly are and who’s fair-weather,” he wrote , adding that the absence of public support from some long-time associates “dims the light quite a bit and makes me want to dramatically alter how I engage.” He indicated that, once an independent audit of the token-sale history is published, his X account will be managed by a media team and his long-running “ask-me-anything” sessions will be reformatted. “I’ll still be at events and take the time for pictures and handshakes,” Hoskinson concluded, “but it’s different now. This one has deeply hurt me and it’s not going to heal anytime soon.” The Dispute Over Unclaimed Cardano Tokens Between September 2015 and January 2017 Cardano raised roughly $62 million by selling 25.9 billion ADA vouchers—most of them in Japan—through Tokyo-based Attain Corporation. Buyers later redeemed the vouchers inside the Daedalus wallet when the network launched. Attain ran the sale for the project’s founding entities (IOHK, now IOG; the Cardano Foundation; and EMURGO) under full KYC/AML checks, a structure highlighted in contemporary investor materials and later research from Messari. The current controversy revolves around an estimated 318–350 million ADA—about 0.2 percent of the ICO allocation—that remained unclaimed years after launch. On 7 May, NFT artist Masato Alexander alleged that Hoskinson had “effectively ERASED” the original UTXOs during the 2021 Allegra hard-fork upgrade and swept the tokens into Cardano’s reserves, later staking most of them and directing only a fraction to Intersect , the ecosystem’s new governance body. Hoskinson has rejected those claims as “lies,” insisting that 99.8 percent of the sale tokens were eventually redeemed by their rightful owners and that the remaining balance was moved—first into a custodial account and ultimately to Intersect—only after Attain’s bankruptcy left no party able to process late redemptions safely. “These funds were not stolen,” he wrote, warning Alexander and others that repetition of the accusation would trigger litigation. “If you continue to imply that IO stole funds, I will sue you. This is my last warning.” In a separate post on 13 May he explained that because the legacy on-chain redemption mechanism was insecure once Attain closed, the team “swept” the unredeemed vouchers off-chain, re-verifying claimants through local counsel and exchange partners. “The sweep reset the process and ensured all the remaining unredeemed buyers had an opportunity to go through compliance again,” Hoskinson wrote, characterising the measure as a consumer-protection step rather than a seizure. According to Hoskinson, an “externally audited report” covering every tranche of the voucher sale, each redemption transaction and the subsequent transfers of unclaimed ADA is now in its final stages. The document is to be distributed to IOG, the Cardano Foundation, EMURGO and Intersect before being released publicly. Until that review is published, he said, Cardano’s development company will make no further substantive comment and will focus on potential legal remedies against what he calls “defamation.” At press time, ADA traded at $0.7199.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Charles Hoskinson,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-19 07:30:19

Analyst Shares Annual Return Forecast for BTC,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/are-the-days-of-bitcoins-exponential-growth-behind-us-analyst-shares-annual-return-forecast-for-btc/,"Famous cryptocurrency analyst Willy Woo shared a remarkable analysis on Bitcoin's (BTC) annual compound return rate (CAGR). Woo noted that investors have unrealistic expectations about BTC and drew attention to the changes that have occurred over the years. Woo shared on social media, “People see BTC as an asset that rises forever. However, the real CAGR chart is obvious.” Woo, who reminded that Bitcoin's annual returns exceeded 100% in 2017, argued that this period is now behind us. Chart shared by Woo comparing the annualized rate of return on Bitcoin to the SP500. The analyst evaluated 2020 as a turning point. Stating that this year was a period when Bitcoin was adopted by institutional investors and even some states, Woo stated that with this institutionalization, the annual compound return dropped to 30-40% and this rate continued to decrease over time. Related News: Watch Out: There Are Lots of Economic Developments and Altcoin Events Coming Up This Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour Schedule “Bitcoin is now trading as the newest macro asset of the last 150 years,” Woo said, adding that the network will see lower rates of return as it stores more capital. In the long term, the analyst, who noted that money supply growth is around 5% and global GDP growth is around 3%, predicts that Bitcoin’s annual compound return will eventually stabilize at 8%. However, Woo stated that this process could take 15-20 years, adding that BTC's performance would remain unmatched among public investment products in the long term until this period. *This is not investment advice.

His latest proposition is linked to attempts to scale the L1 chain, which still suffers from high gas prices and growing demand for data. Vitalik Buterin proposed changes to Ethereum aiming to make the network more friendly to users running nodes. Buterin stated it’s important to run a full node and a personal RPC server, hoping to bring more users onboard with Ethereum nodes. Currently, running a node is restricted and resource-heavy. The chain has 10,051 active nodes as of May 19. The full data of the chain is at 1,312 GB and growing. In the past year, with all active DeFi and L2 verifications, the data load for Ethereum has grown by over 20%, with a trend to preserve that pace. Ethereum nodes are still concentrated in the USA and Europe, both for the consensus and execution layer. Vitalik Buterin proposed lighter requirements for running personal RPC nodes with limited archives. | Source: Ethernodes.org The Ethereum network still hinges on data centers in developed countries, with around 30% of consensus and execution nodes located in the USA and concentrated on the East Coast. Germany is the second key location for ETH nodes. New proposal offers lighter versions of RPC nodes The bottleneck for Ethereum is also the availability of RPC providers. A smaller pool of providers may resort to censorship, as currently some RPC nodes exclude entire countries, noted Buterin in his longer explanation of eventual updates. Ethereum may add a new type of node with a lower data requirement, which could verify transactions and further decentralize the network. Some users may run partial-state nodes, storing contracts and transactions only relevant to their own use cases. The end goal is to encourage smaller players to run RPC nodes, removing the risk of monopolizing Ethereum between big players. The update on L1 scaling arrives at a time when Ethereum handles 1.38M transactions per day, following renewed interest in DeFi and ETH trading. The chain has disproven claims of being dead or displaced, leading to calls for more relevance and L1 speed. The message from Buterin failed to recover the ETH price, which dropped to $2,375.66, just days after holding above $2,500 . Vitalik Buterin puts priority status on EIP-4444 One of the steps to making Ethereum easier for node operators is to prioritize EIP-4444. The end goal is to have nodes that store full data for only 36 days. This will reduce storage requirements, one of the main obstacle to running even more nodes. The EIP-4444 changes will affect the entire network, with clients no longer serving some of the data that is older than a year through P2P transactions. Clients may locally prune historical data. Full RPC nodes will coexist with archive nodes, which have provided the large and ever-expanding history of the network. The chain has envisioned up to $1 trillion in assets, including ETH, stablecoins, tokens, and NFTs, as well as tokenized securities, requiring reliable historical nodes. On the other hand, verification and short-term transaction processing may become easier without the outsized demand for storage. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The visual tool showcases probable liquidation levels, indicating where large orders may cause cascading price changes. This post explores how to interpret a Bitcoin liquidation map, allowing you to trade smarter in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. What is liquidation in crypto trading? In cryptocurrency trading , liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position. Long liquidations occur when prices fall, affecting traders who bet on an uptrend. Short liquidations happen when prices unexpectedly rise, impacting those who bet on a decline. Did you know? In crypto, a single liquidation cascade can wipe out millions in minutes, triggered not by hacking but by traders using too much leverage at the wrong time. What is a Bitcoin liquidation map? A Bitcoin liquidation map is a visual heatmap indicating price levels where large liquidations are expected to occur. These maps assist traders in identifying zones where leveraged positions may be closed forcibly if prices fluctuate sharply. Tools like CoinGlass provide real-time Bitcoin ( BTC ) liquidation maps, valuable resources for risk-aware traders. With the liquidation map, you can Use breakout trading strategies for profitable scalping opportunities. Set stop-loss levels based on key liquidation zones for better risk management. Target high-liquidity areas to secure profits efficiently. Enter large trades near liquidity clusters to minimize slippage and enhance execution. Analyze the gradient of liquidation intensity to anticipate potential price movements.. Functioning of a liquidation map and key components The X-axis of the liquidation chart represents the bid price, while the Y-axis denotes the relative strength of liquidation activity. Each column on the graphic illustrates a liquidation cluster's relative significance compared to other clusters. The chart demonstrates how the market will respond if the price reaches certain thresholds. Taller liquidation bars indicate a higher potential impact. The various hues are solely for visual clarity, allowing users to distinguish between distinct liquidation zones. Here are the main components of a liquidation map: Heat zones: Indicate where most positions could be eliminated if the price reaches specific levels. Liquidity pools: Collections of stop-loss and liquidation orders that can cause rapid price movements. Open interest levels: Demonstrate where large amounts of leveraged positions are concentrated. Price imbalances or gaps: Disclose areas without support or resistance, allowing prices to move swiftly. Did you know? Crypto liquidations often follow the herd; when too many traders place similar bets, liquidation maps light up and whales use them as price targets. How to use a liquidation map in your Bitcoin trading strategy A Bitcoin liquidation map provides insights into probable price movements and risk zones by visually representing places where leveraged positions will likely be closed. Here is how to use a liquidation map in Bitcoin trading: Identify high-risk zones: Identify places with dense liquidation clusters to avoid overleveraging. These areas come across as magnets, attracting price changes that might cause a series of liquidations. Time entry and exit: Liquidation clusters help find the optimal entry and exit points. Entering and exiting trades before a cluster becomes risky helps you lock in profits before reversals. Combine with technical indicators: Enhance your research by combining liquidation maps with tools such as support/resistance levels and relative strength index (RSI) . This sets out a comprehensive view of market conditions. Avoid herd mentality: Exercise caution in places with high leverage concentrations. Such zones may be traps constructed by larger players to induce liquidations and profit from the resulting volatility. Monitor whale activity: Large traders frequently target liquidation zones to turn price moves to their advantage. Observing these patterns can provide insights about prospective market movements. Anticipate reversals: Markets frequently experience reversals following large liquidation events. Recognizing these trends can aid in positioning for possible rebounds. Implement robust risk management: Use stop-loss orders and handle leverage carefully. Liquidation maps can help you determine where to put these orders to minimize exposure. Common mistakes to avoid when using the Bitcoin liquidation map Using a Bitcoin liquidation map can enhance trading decisions, but misinterpretation can lead to costly errors. Here are common mistakes you need to avoid: Blindly trading toward liquidity zones: If you are trading toward liquidity zones without thinking, expect reversals. Misreading map colors or scale : Making a mistake in judging map colors or scale can skew your risk assessment. Over-relying on liquidation data without context : Maps are valuable tools, not an assurance that what they reflect will happen. Ignoring macro news or sentiment analysis : External events often override technical signals. A sudden event may make all predictions fall flat. Always combine liquidation maps with broader technical analysis. Smart trading requires context, not just colorful charts. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

With the broader cryptocurrency market heating up again in May 2025, the race is on to find the next low-priced token with real potential. While Bitcoin has broken the $100,000 mark and Ethereum continues to dominate DeFi infrastructure, the spotlight is shifting to penny cryptocurrencies under $1—projects that are cheap now but backed by utility, transparency, and strong community engagement. Among these, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) offers the perfect storm of meme culture, AI functionality, and long-term upside—all at a price tag of just $0.004. Let’s break down why this might be the best crypto to buy now before the next rally. Why Invest in Crypto Now May 2025 has kicked off a new phase in the market. Bitcoin's recent breakout has reawakened retail and institutional interest, while Ethereum has surpassed $62 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama. From a macro perspective, bullish sentiment is returning due to global capital shifts, potential tax reforms, and growing blockchain adoption. Now isn’t just a good time to watch—it’s a time to act. Here’s why: The market is climbing, driven by institutional inflows. Penny cryptos offer affordable entry points for new and seasoned investors. Bullish narratives like AI, staking, and community-led growth are attracting capital. If you want to get in before the next bull run, this is the kind of market phase where fortunes are made.

The agreements follow Ripple securing a license from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) in March, allowing it to manage global payments end-to-end for banks, fintechs and crypto firms. “Securing our DFSA license enables Ripple to better serve the demand for solutions to the inefficiencies of traditional cross-border payments,” Reece Merrick, managing director for Middle East and Africa at Ripple, said in a Monday release . Zand Bank said the partnership aligns with its push toward digital finance. “We are excited to soon launch an AED-backed stablecoin,” said Chirag Sampat, head of treasury and markets. Imad Gharazeddine, CEO and co-founder of Mamo, said using Ripple’s services allows the company to offer “faster and more reliable cross-border payments” for both businesses and consumers looking to scale their UAE operations. Ripple Payments currently operates in over 90 payout markets and has processed more than $70 billion in volume globally. The platform is available in Dubai, the U.S., Brazil, Mexico, Australia and Switzerland. Ripple uses a global network of payout partners and blockchain infrastructure to move money in minutes. In some cases, it also uses its native digital asset, XRP, as a bridge currency through its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, allowing clients to instantly convert one fiat currency to another using the token.

According to the chart shared via TradingView and commentary posted on social media, XRP has formed a double bottom at approximately $2.3126 and is currently maintaining strength above a key descending trend line. The analyst emphasized that XRP continues to respect this red descending trend line, interpreting this as a signal of resilience. #XRP – Dipped to $2.3126 (Double Bottom Formation) : #XRP is still bouncing off the Red Descending Trend Line, showing resilience. Currently, we're experiencing some micro noise within the range between Fibonacci 0.888 levels at $2.30 and $2.62. #XRPFamily STAY STEADY… https://t.co/QalFZ5ohtN pic.twitter.com/ekONe5GExe — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) May 17, 2025 Fibonacci Zone Between $2.30 and $2.62 Seen as Key Trading Range In the accompanying chart, XRP’s recent price action appears to be moving within a defined zone, specifically between the Fibonacci 0.888 levels of $2.30 and $2.62. This range, identified by Egrag Crypto as a zone of “micro noise,” is where short-term fluctuations are playing out. The price is currently at $2.3845 as per the 12-hour chart on Poloniex. Egrag noted that the market dipped to a local low around $2.3126, forming what appears to be a double bottom pattern. Technical analysts generally interpret this formation as a potential reversal indicator, suggesting that buyers may be stepping in to defend this level. The double bottom occurs near the lower boundary of the observed Fibonacci zone, reinforcing its importance as a support level. Bullish Scenario Targets $3.10 and Higher if Trend Line is Broken The chart further outlines two potential scenarios for XRP’s future movement. The bullish scenario anticipates a breakout above the red descending trend line, possibly targeting the $2.6194 zone, followed by a rally towards $2.9690 and then to $3.1047. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The final target zone at $3.3967 is also marked on the chart. These targets align with Fibonacci extensions and retracement levels commonly used by technical traders to forecast potential price zones. Bearish Outlook Suggests Drop Toward $1.61 Conversely, a bearish pathway is also mapped out. This alternative scenario suggests a breakdown below the current range could push the price towards the 0.786 Fibonacci level at $1.6126. The chart illustrates a potential “fish hook” move, indicating a possible liquidity grab or deeper correction that might test the $1.2038 level, aligned with the 0.702 Fibonacci retracement. While both directional possibilities are acknowledged, Egrag Crypto’s tone in the tweet remains constructive. He urges the XRP community to “stay steady and strong,” signaling a long-term bullish outlook despite short-term uncertainty. As XRP navigates this zone, traders and analysts will closely watch whether it can break decisively above the trend line resistance or if it will revisit lower supports as outlined in Egrag’s roadmap.

Until one day in 2022, I saw the advertisement of Winner Mining on the homepage of Caijing.com. At first, I was skeptical and observed for a long time, but I found that the platform really kept its promises, the funds were safe, the funds were deposited immediately, and no fees were deducted/charged, so I invested with confidence. From 2022 to now, I have invested 3 BTC in Winner Mining. From the first day, I can see stable daily returns, which far exceed the return rate of traditional financial products.

The amount of passive income they can get every day after purchase = $10,000*1.50%=$150. After 30 days, the principal and profit = $10,000 + $150*30 = $10,000 + $4,500 = $14,500 The computing power value of contracts are different, the investment amount and term are different, and the income is also different.

This move follows a volatile rally earlier this week that had pushed the meme coin above $0.000014 before sellers stepped in aggressively. Despite the strong upside momentum seen from May 7 to May 13, PEPE price action now signals rising hesitation from bulls as multiple resistance zones converge near the highs.

PEPE price dynamics (Source: TradingView) On the 4-hour chart, PEPE price is trading within a newly forming symmetrical triangle after breaking out of an earlier bullish channel. The recent rejection near $0.00001424 aligns with a horizontal supply band and descending trendline from the May 13 peak. While short-term momentum has cooled, the broader structure remains intact as long as the $0.00001270 support zone holds.

This move comes in the wake of Moody’s downgrading U.S. credit , stripping the country of Aaa rating due to mounting deficits and escalating interest expenses. The last time the long end of the yield curve reached 5% was on April 9, during the so-called ""tariff tantrum,"" which triggered sharp sell-offs in both crypto and U.S. equity markets. At that time, bitcoin (BTC) was hovering near its local low of around $75,000. It has since rebounded strongly, currently trading around $103,000 after hitting a Sunday high of $106,000. “The last time the 30-year closed at or above 5% (at the 6 PM ET mark) was October 31, 2023. The highest closing yield in recent memory was 5.11% on October 19, 2023, the highest since July 2007, nearly 18 years ago. The current yield is just 12 basis points away from surpassing that milestone,” said Jim Bianco, head of Bianco Research. In addition, the United Kingdom surpassed China in March to become the second-largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasuries, with holdings totaling $779.3 billion—trailing only Japan, which remains the top foreign holder. Both China and Japan have continued to reduce their U.S. Treasury holdings over the past 12 months, underscoring the growing need for the U.S. to attract new buyers for its debt. As the U.S. Treasury faces growing deficits, with the potential of more bonds being issued, increasing supply and thereby pushing yields higher while prices fall.

Who Will Be First to The Party? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Well, it’s been about a week and the results are in: Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade has been compared to the earth-shattering Merge that transformed the chain. A smaller detail, but why “Pectra”? Because it represents not one but two upgrades that were combined: Prague and Electra. The actual improvements are by all accounts just as impressive as its word play, and the very positive numbers are backing the excitement. While Ethereum itself has focused on key features such as smart account wallet UX features, L2 scaling data storage blobs increased by 2x, and validator UX improvements going live, the full list of improvements are impressive. So what’s new with Pectra, and who in the ecosystem was ready to take advantage of these changes? Let’s take a look at Pectra, see what fast actors like P2P.org have done with the upgrade, and speculate on where this will take the Ethereum community. Pectra Upgrade: Smooth and Significant First, it’s important to give credit where it’s due. The upgrade has significant features, but the preparation and rollout have been very smooth so far, something that the giant Ethereum ecosystem greatly appreciates. Web3 chain upgrades do not always have the best track record, and with this many billions on the line, held by millions of users, there is a lot of pressure on the team. However, the upgrade proved that impossibly complex decentralized industries can successfully perform major updates to their systems without interrupting service. When we compare that to the 63 year old programming language (yes, if COBOL was a person it could retire) that is holding together the international finance system, this says more than most people realize. The upgrade itself focused on several key areas. A big improvement was the functionality of staking, making it much easier for institutions to integrate. The prior model required special permission from the staking service provider to exit, required proof of the permission, and could take up to 13 hours. The upgrade removes this cumbersome step, the risk involved, and cuts down the waiting time from 13 hours to 13 minutes. A major piece of this upgrade is the staking limit, or maximum validator staking balance. What was a limit of 32 ETH has been raised to a whopping 2,048 ETH. What’s the benefit of this? For one thing, institutional players can now consolidate their risk by having fewer validation nodes, as they can get benefits for up to the max 2,048 ETH. For all validators, the arbitrary rule of needing to stake in multiples of 32 was not helpful to anyone, and there wasn’t a great solution for those holding some remainder without making use of it. Now, those extra ETH can be added to the stake to maximize rewards, encouraging more staking across the network. Other key upgrades include better communication between execution and consensus layers, which improve the deposits/withdrawals of validators and makes the system run with fewer delays or other issues. The account abstraction improvements are also notable, because they allow for smart contract like interaction with externally owned accounts, which makes for a simpler (and therefore less risky) interaction. Early Birds Are Getting The Worms The powerful validator-level features have also been noticed because the P2P.org platform was ready and waiting to launch their support for Pectra almost as soon as it launched. This is a kudos to Ethereum for clearly communicating the upgrade with enough detail and time to help its supporting platforms adjust, and it’s also a kudos to the P2P team for planning well in advance, seeing how they could best leverage the upgrades, and launching a number of very promising tools. The platform supports the features across dApp and API, including validator consolidation, auto compounding, partial withdrawals, and operator switching. However, the platform has also released the industry’s first Validator Consolidation Calculator to show ETH stakers their personalized upside from consolidating validators, and provides this insight instantly. Other platforms will likely be launching upgrades of their own to take advantage of Pectra’s upgrades, while at the same time looking for brand new use cases for what is being offered. Keep your eye out for what will likely be a rush of upgrades, new features, and entirely new platforms supporting what Pectra is providing to the Ethereum community. What Does The Market Say? Given all this excitement, how far does this move the market’s needle? Quite a bit, apparently. According to Forbes , the capitalization of ETH jumped up by an eye-watering 42% only five days after the Pectra upgrade was completed. This resulted in Ethereum rising to the 39th largest asset globally with a market cap that exceeded $322 billion. The ETH futures jumped as well, showing that there was a great deal of interest, activity, and trading on Ethereum’s road ahead. With only a week behind us, groups like P2P.org are showing what will be possible with Pectra. The next few months should bring along those less proactive, but who can still bring solid ideas and implementation for the new and improved Ethereum. Other ecosystems should take note and see what happens when you dial in your upgrades to provide precision improvements, and do so in a way that is so smooth the implementation itself is newsworthy. With wins like this, the entire Web3 community can continue building both confidence and support among the TradFi crowd who are ready for something that is efficient, effective, and improving all the time.",Information,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-19 07:55:09

On May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum's layer-1 scaling “more friendly” to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin believes there are risks to this setup. “A market structure dominated by a few RPC providers is one that will face strong pressure to deplatform or censor users. Many RPC providers already exclude entire countries,” Buterin wrote. Source: Vitalik Buterin Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes In addition to censorship, Buterin argued that reasons like expensive fully-trustless cryptographic solutions and metadata privacy show that there’s value in ensuring greater ease for those running a personal node. In the proposal, Buterin's solution relies on a novel type of node called “partially stateless nodes.” These nodes are designed to help users maintain privacy-preserving access to blockchain data without the heavy resource demands of running a full node. As Ethereum scales and the gas limit increases, running a full node requires more storage and bandwidth. Buterin said partially stateless nodes address the issue by allowing users to verify the blockchain and serve local data, but only store a subset of the Ethereum state, based on the user’s needs. Vitalik Buterin’s graphic of partially stateless nodes. Source: Vitalik Buterin Related: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systems A new node type to validate blocks “statelessly” The nodes would operate by validating blocks statelessly. This means they don't require the storage of the full Merkle proofs or the entire blockchain history. They can selectively keep certain parts of the state up to date. This means that users could configure their nodes only to save data related to their accounts, the decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and their commonly used tokens like stablecoins and Ether ( ETH ). The rest of the data will be left out, and queries beyond the stored subset will fail or be routed through an RPC solution.

While Bitcoin) continues to chart new highs and anchor the market, attention is rapidly shifting to high-potential tokens like XRP, Solana, MAGACOIN FINANCE , and Trumpcoin. Each of these coins brings a unique story and technical setup, but only a few may lead the next parabolic cycle. Here’s how they stack up as the market eyes another round of explosive gains. CLICK HERE – SECURE YOUR SPOT BEFORE 25x DISAPPEARS Bitcoin (BTC): Bullish Momentum and New Highs Bitcoin remains the market bellwether, recently gaining over 40% in a month and reclaiming the $100,000 mark. Technical indicators remain bullish, with the price expected to average around $120,000 in May and possibly reach $136,000 by month’s end. Analysts suggest the top is not yet in, with some forecasts targeting $150,000 or even $220,000 later this year if bullish momentum continues. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Standing Out From Other Tokens Unlike most low-cap tokens vying for investor attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE has carved out a powerful niche. Its message resonates, its structure is sound, and its early support is strong enough to challenge more established names. Built on a platform of capped supply, cultural resonance, and clear direction, it’s quickly transitioning from outsider to contender. What mak es MAGACOIN FINANCE particularly interesting now is how early investors are treating it—as a long-term play, not just a trade. It’ s rare to see this level of commitment before listings even begin. And with social and market momentum continuing to rise, many believe this may be the only time to catch it before it breaks out fully. XRP (XRP): Parabolic Setup in Motion XRP is again in the spotlight, trading above $2.30 and showing signs of a classic parabolic breakout. The resolution of Ripple’s legal issues and the prospect of an XRP ETF have attracted institutional interest and renewed bullish sentiment. Technical analysts point to a breakout above $2.40 as a key signal, with targets ranging from $4.50 to $7 in the coming months Solana (SOL): Strong Fundamentals, Bullish Patterns Solana continues to impress, trading near $170 and consolidating just below major resistance. Technical indicators remain bullish, with the potential for a breakout above $200 to trigger a run toward $180–$190 in the coming months. Trumpcoin (TRUMP): Volatility and Political Hype Trumpcoin (TRUMP ) has seen bursts of activity tied to political sentiment, but its outlook for 2025 is mixed. Forecasts suggest a possible decline of over 40% this year, with limited upside compared to fundamentally stronger or more community-driven projects. While it may benefit from election-year , its long-term prospects remain uncertain. THE MOST-WATCHED PRESALE OF 2025 – ACT NOW Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE , stands out as the breakout presale, combining scarcity, viral appeal, and early-stage momentum for those seeking the next 20,000% winner. Trumpcoin, despite its political branding, appears less likely to deliver sustained gains. For investors chasing the next explosive cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP are firmly in the spotlight, with Bitcoin’s strength providing the foundation for another historic bull run To learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, please visit: Website: https://magacoinfinance.com Twitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance Continue Reading: XRP’s Parabolic Setup?

Against that still-cautious backdrop, Van de Poppe argues that the recent 38–42 percent rebound in the ETH/BTC pair is the first concrete sign of capital rotating down the risk curve, echoing on-chain data that show Ethereum clawing back ground after months of under-performance. “We’ve had a 40% return against Bitcoin in just a week,” he says, “and therefore the blue chips or the large caps are the ones to watch.” Crypto Watchlist: Top 5 Altcoins Van de Poppe’s thesis rests on a classic money-flow model: funds move from Bitcoin to Ethereum, then to large-cap altcoins, mid-caps and, finally, into the smallest caps once animal spirits truly take hold. With that framework in mind, he singles out five names that he believes sit at different rungs of the risk ladder, each with a specific macro- or sector-level tail-wind. Related Reading: Crypto Bulls Just Got Their Macro Wake-Up Call: Here’s Why The first pick, Chainlink (LINK), is Van de Poppe’s “easiest play” on institutional adoption because “we require oracles to provide data in the web-3 space to connect between web 2 and web 3.” The analyst emphasises that LINK’s bitcoin-denominated chart is “still at an all-time low,” suggesting asymmetric upside if a true altseason materialises. Next on the large-cap list is Aave (AAVE). Van de Poppe calls the decentralised lending protocol “a large cap which implies less risk,” but adds that the market is under-pricing its role in bringing bank-grade yield products on-chain. Notably, the token has attracted high-profile flows this cycle—Donald Trump–linked World Liberty Financial disclosed cumulative AAVE purchases alongside LINK and ETH earlier this year. Moving down the capitalization spectrum, the analyst turns to Wormhole (W), a cross-chain messaging and liquidity layer he describes as “being used to transfer between the chains,” with revenues that cycle back into the protocol. He flags its selection as exclusive bridge infrastructure for multiple real-world-asset initiatives in which “tokenised T-bill funds” migrate across networks. Wormhole’s fundamentals received a liquidity boost when Binance listed the W token with four trading pairs on 3 April 2024, broadening access for retail and institutional desks alike. Related Reading: Analysis: Crypto Heats Up As $35 Billion Enters Market In Under A Month For investors willing to venture further out on the risk curve, Van de Poppe highlights Peaq (PEAQ), a layer-1 focused on DePIN and the machine economy. “It’s the largest ecosystem within the machine economy and … finally waking up again,” he says, citing on-chain data that already show more than 50 companies and six-million devices active on the network. He argues that growing transaction counts and cross-industry partnerships make PEAQ “interesting for an investment thesis” at current valuations. His smallest-cap mention is Alkimi (ADS), which he dubs “an advertising project” whose revenue “has gone 4x from $1.2 million to $5 million” even as the token corrected from $0.50 to $0.10 during the recent macro-driven sell-off. Alkimi positions itself as a decentralised ad exchange designed to cut supply-chain fees and provide on-chain transparency, a use-case the company claims can slash CPMs by over 200 percent for advertisers. Van de Poppe closes with portfolio construction advice rather than price targets. “The larger the market cap, the longer it’s in business, the larger your allocation can be because the lower the risk involved. The smaller and newer the project, the smaller the allocation,” he says. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.18 trillion.

The seizure was made by the AFP-led Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT), which announced the action in a statement issued on May 18. According to authorities, the case dates back to 2018 when Luxembourg law enforcement tipped off the AFP about suspicious Bitcoin transactions linked to the Queensland man. Investigators said they traced the activity back to earlier cyber offenses, including the theft of 950 Bitcoin from a French cryptocurrency exchange in 2013. Although no criminal charges were filed over the Bitcoin theft, a court ruled that the assets in question could not be tied to any legitimate income, leading to the forfeiture order issued in April. Ties to Crime and Gaming Industry Data Leaks Local media reports identified the individual as Shane Stephen Duffy, who pleaded guilty in 2016 to fraud and hacking charges. He was convicted of selling stolen personal data belonging to players of the popular online game League of Legends. While Duffy was not directly involved in the 2011 cyberattack on Riot Games that exposed data from over 5 million users, prosecutors confirmed he had obtained and resold the data independently. Further accusations included hacking the social media account of Riot Games’ president Marc Merrill to promote a service offering unauthorized access to players’ accounts. This crime history, along with the mystery surrounding the origin of Duffy’s wealth, contributed to the AFP’s decision to pursue asset forfeiture under the Proceeds of Crime Act. AFP Targets Criminal Profits to Fund Community Safety Commander Jason Kennedy of the AFP emphasized that the agency’s legal framework allows it to act decisively in confiscating assets suspected to be linked to criminal conduct—even without laying new charges. “The profits derived from criminal activities are also often used to fund further criminal acts,” Kennedy stated. “That’s why we work closely with our partners in the CACT to ensure such proceeds are reinvested in the community.” The confiscated assets will be sold, and the proceeds will go to a special purpose fund aimed at supporting law enforcement and crime prevention initiatives . Since July 2019, the CACT has restrained over $1.2 billion in criminally-linked assets, including luxury items like homes, vehicles, yachts, cryptocurrency, and fine art.

Long liquidations accompanied ETH’s price drop. Below $2,400 could be a buy-the-dip opportunity. Ether ( ETH ) price declined by over 4.5% in the last 24 hours to around $2,380 on May 19.

Ethereum leads crypto market sell-off ETH’s drop mirrored similar downside moves elsewhere in the cryptocurrency market, with the total capitalization falling by approximately 1.40% to $3.25 trillion. Bitcoin ( BTC ) saw modest losses, dropping 1% over the last 24 hours to trade above $102,900. Other major altcoins, such as XRP ( XRP ) and Solana ( SOL ), also recorded significant losses of 2.3% and 4.5% %, respectively. 24-hour performance of top-cap cryptocurrencies: Source: Coin360 This performance comes as the market digested the implications of Moody’s Ratings downgrading the United States’ credit score . On May 17, the rating giant cut the US sovereign credit rating to Aa1 from Aaa, citing the country’s ballooning $36 trillion national debt , persistent fiscal deficit, rising interest expenses, and a lack of political will to rein in spending. This downgrade, the first from Moody’s since 1919, has rattled financial markets, pushing Treasury yields higher and triggering “risk-off” sentiment. “Yields are surging again following the Moody’s downgrade on Friday,” said capital markets commentator, The Kobeissi Letter, in a May 19 post on X, adding: “Trade deals, recession worries, lower inflation, and slowing GDP all can’t get lower yields.” Increasing US Treasury Bills.

Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve remains adamant about not cutting rates , with market participants pricing in only two possible rate cuts in 2025, according to the CME Group FedWatch Tool . The downgrade signals higher economic uncertainty, prompting investors to withdraw from speculative assets, including crypto. Long liquidations accelerate ETH downtrend Ether’s tumble over the past 24 hours coincided with a wave of long liquidations that forced traders to exit their leveraged positions. Over $255 million worth of ETH positions were wiped out in the last 24 hours, with long liquidations accounting for 78% of the total or $200 million. ETH total liquidation chart.

When leveraged long positions fail to maintain margin requirements, exchanges automatically sell their holdings to cover losses.

Analysis had earlier opined that ETH bulls were required to hold above $2,400 to secure the upside. ETH bulls are now focused on the next area of interest between $2,330 and the $2,274 range low reached on May 9.

In a recent interview with Fortune published on May 18, Hayes predicted this breakout could occur sometime in June or early Q3, driven by rising liquidity and increased trading volume. Hayes, who now manages his family office Maelstrom, emphasized that the next altcoin cycle won’t resemble the explosive gains seen in 2021. He warned that many older tokens, what he called “dino coins,” are unlikely to recover due to high fully diluted valuations, limited float, and no real users or revenue. “You probably have a bunch of coins in your portfolio that went down 95%, and they’re not moving for a reason,” he said When asked about Ethereum ( ETH ) versus Solana ( SOL ), Hayes said he expects ETH to outperform in the upcoming bull cycle. Despite Solana’s significant rally from $7 to over $170, he pointed to Ethereum’s deeper fundamentals, highest total value locked, most developers, and stronger security from its proof-of-stake design as key advantages.

For this year, he sees Bitcoin rising to around $250,000. On macro trends, Hayes criticized U.S. Treasury tactics for masking the country’s true borrowing needs. He believes the government is effectively spending more than reported by draining cash reserves and tapping underfunded programs. This, he said, creates excess dollar liquidity, an environment that favors Bitcoin and risk assets. Hayes also revealed that gold makes up 20% of his investment portfolio, including physical holdings and mining stocks. He expects central banks to keep buying gold and believes the U.S. may eventually revalue its gold holdings to help weaken the dollar. In his view, gold could reach $10,000–$20,000 before this market cycle ends. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading near $103,000, roughly 6% below its all-time high of $108,786 set earlier this year.

But for some, it’s not just about any exchange. It’s about Coinbase, the most trusted crypto platform in the U.S. According to crypto analyst Mr. Spock 𝛑 , a listing on Coinbase could unlock Pi’s true value and bring it closer to real-world use. Coinbase Isn’t Just an Exchange—It’s a Gateway to Utility Coinbase isn’t just another platform, it’s a fully regulated U.S.-based exchange, trusted by millions and deeply rooted in the American financial system. And when a coin gets listed on Coinbase, it doesn’t just become tradable, it becomes usable. Coinbase offers real-world tools, like the Coinbase Visa card, which lets users spend their crypto like cash. Mr. Spock explains his personal experience of how he uses this card to pay for food, shop at stores like Walmart, and even withdraw cash from ATMs, all while earning Bitcoin rewards on every purchase. He imagines a world where Pi Coin pays for meals, gas, and groceries, and rewards users with crypto benefits, not in theory, but in practice. Why Coinbase Is Better Than Binance for Pi Further, Mr. Spock also makes a strong case for why Coinbase matters more than Binance, especially in the U.S. He notes that Binance.com and Binance.US are completely separate, with the U.S. version offering fewer coins and features. Binance.com is unavailable to American users due to regulatory restrictions, while Binance.US operates under a different company with limited reach. On the other hand, Coinbase has regulatory clarity and deeper market integration, something Pi would benefit from if it wants to grow in the U.S. Pi’s Real Goal To Mr. Spock and many Pi supporters, this isn’t just about price—it’s about purpose. If Pi becomes spendable through Coinbase tools like the Visa card, it could finally blend crypto with daily life. That’s when the real impact begins, not just building wealth, but changing how we use money altogether. So while many are waiting for any exchange, some believe that waiting for Coinbase is worth it.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-19 08:11:24

He called its long-term chart “a thing of beauty” and believes the future financial system will be built on Ethereum. According to him, no other blockchain is as trusted or widely used. Even though Solana has been doing well, Pal thinks ETH could perform better in the long run. He said big companies and banks prefer to build on Ethereum because it’s safe, reliable, and has a huge community of developers. It’s like Microsoft in the business world — trusted, easy to use, and everywhere. He added that banks also like Ethereum’s layer-2 solutions because they give more control while still using the strong security of Ethereum’s main network. In the end, Pal believes ETH could surprise everyone, especially if it crosses $4,300. He also thinks coins like XRP and Dogecoin might do well too, since most cryptos tend to move together. Key Price Levels to Watch: Will Ethereum Break Out? Pal explained that Ethereum’s price chart is showing a flag pattern, which usually means a big move could be coming. If ETH breaks out, it might change how people think about it. Currently, Ethereum is stuck below $2,500, facing resistance near $2,540-$2,550. Analyst Ali Martinez has also hinted that Ethereum could be starting its new bull run. The MVRV Ratio has flipped from bearish to bullish, a strong sign that momentum is now favoring the bulls. Whales have accumulated over 450,000 ETH in the past month. Exchange data also confirms the trend, with nearly 1 million Ethereum having been withdrawn since April, reducing sell pressure. If Ethereum stays above $2,200, it could rise to $3,000 and maybe even $4,000 as buying momentum grows, the analyst says. According to experts, altcoin bull markets start quietly, with doubts and big selloffs initially, but then come the big gains.",News|Crypto news|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-19 08:17:54
