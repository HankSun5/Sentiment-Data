By 2028, ADA/USD could decline and reach $5.50. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $6.44. Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.861 Market Cap $30.49B Trading Volume $1.17B Circulating Supply 35.12B ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.9079 24-hour Low $0.8667 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 8.76% 50-day SMA $0.925 14-Day RSI 44.18 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 73 (Greed) Green Days 15/30 (50%) Cardano price analysis: Cardano’s resistance is at $1.091, while support lies at $0.783 ADA price analysis 1-day chart ADA/USD 1-Day Chart On January 5, the 1-day Cardano (ADA) chart shows a price of $1.087, with the upper Bollinger Band at $1.091 acting as immediate resistance and the lower band at $0.783 providing strong support. The middle band, currently at $0.937, has been tested as support, signaling potential bullish momentum. RSI at 61.68 indicates a bullish trend nearing overbought levels, suggesting continued strength but caution for a potential correction. Volume at 8.37M confirms active trading interest. A breakout above $1.091 could lead ADA toward the $1.20 level, while rejection may prompt a retest of $0.937. Consolidation above $1.00 could strengthen bullish sentiment. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart ADA/USD 4-hour Chart The 4-hour Cardano (ADA) chart shows the price at $1.087, with resistance at the upper Bollinger Band of $1.146 and support at the lower band of $0.966. The middle band, at $1.056, serves as immediate support, holding against recent pullbacks. The Balance of Power (BoP) is at -0.16, suggesting mild bearish momentum. The MACD reflects consolidation, with the MACD line at 0.044 closely aligning with the signal line at 0.040, hinting at waning bullish momentum. A breakout above $1.146 could lead to gains toward $1.20, while failure to hold $1.056 may trigger a retracement to $0.966.

On the daily chart, the price at $0.878 is below the 20-SMA ($0.975), with resistance at $0.975 and $1.158, while support stands at $0.793. RSI near 42 indicates weak buying momentum. On the 4-hour chart, ADA trades below the 20-SMA ($0.878), with resistance at $0.903 and support at $0.854. The Balance of Power and MACD confirm bearish sentiment. A break below $0.854 may trigger further downside toward $0.793, while a recovery above $0.975 could signal a bullish rebound. Caution is advised amid weak momentum. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2024, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Based on our analysis, Cardano is likely to reach $5 by 2027, with a forecasted range of around $5.53. This projection is driven by Cardano’s continued technological advancements, growing adoption, strategic partnerships, and increasing market confidence, indicating a positive long-term growth trajectory for the cryptocurrency market. Will Cardano reach $10? ADA is predicted to reach $8.98 by 2030. While this brings it closer to the $10 mark, it is not expected to achieve that level yet. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano is trading around $1, with an all-time high of $2.80 in early 2021. While not impossible, reaching $50 in the next few years is highly uncertain. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. Predictions indicate that by 2030, Cardano could see significant growth, with estimates suggesting a rise to around $9. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges.

It initially gained investor support and popularity for being affordable and environmentally friendly due to its unique PoS mechanism called Ouroboros. In 2021, Cardano implemented the smart contract feature with the Alonzo update. This update came on the ADA test network and brought the interoperability and scalability that was promised to the users earlier. The ADA price reached its all-time high during the bullish cycle of 2021 when it hit $3.09. However, its price started plummeting at the beginning of September 2021 and reached a low of $0.220 in June 2023. In 2024, Cardano peaked at $0.810 in March before dropping to $0.401 in April due to heavy selling. It traded between $0.52–$0.401 in April and $0.317–$0.423 by July, with strong support at $0.33 in August. After peaking at $0.37 in September and dipping to $0.33 in November, ADA surged to $1.1999 at the start of December, hit a maximum price of $1.3264, and closed the year at $0.8451. In January 2025, Cardano is trading between $1.02 to $1.09.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-05 20:53:38

Is This Possible?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/can-all-bitcoins-really-be-mined-in-the-us-after-trump-takes-office-is-this-possible/,"Bitcoin mining has become a major industry in the United States, with American miners currently contributing around 40% of the global Bitcoin mining hashrate. But could Donald Trump’s return to the White House make the US the sole hub for all future Bitcoin mining? Experts say that’s unlikely. During his campaign, Trump made numerous pro-crypto promises, including one bold statement: He wanted all remaining Bitcoin to be mined in the U.S. But achieving that would require shutting down mining operations worldwide and transferring that capacity to America, a move seen as impractical by industry professionals. Related News: Analytics Firm Shares Critical Levels for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana - Here's What to Watch “I think it’s impossible,” said Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s director of digital assets research. He explained that global mining networks are too entrenched for such a shift to happen. CJ Burnett, chief revenue officer at Compass Mining, echoed that sentiment, noting that the U.S. lacks the infrastructure, affordable energy and mining equipment needed to undertake such a monumental task. Bitcoin mining is inherently a globally distributed network, driven by factors such as energy availability, market economics, and regulatory environments across countries. “The US cannot be the sole location for mining all of the remaining Bitcoin,” Burnett said. However, he acknowledged that better US policies could attract more miners to set up operations domestically and accelerate the growth of the sector. Frank Holmes, CEO of Hive Digital Technologies, also expressed optimism that a Trump presidency could bring “continued support for Bitcoin innovation.” *This is not investment advice.

Kiyosaki tells his 2.6 million followers on the social media platform X that a “giant” market crash has arrived that will force the financial system to create more money, widening the gap between the rich and the poor while boosting the prices of gold, silver and BTC. “GIANT MARKET CRASH here. Q: How can I be so bullish on gold, silver, and Bitcoin? A: Because the idiots running the Fed, Treasury, Banks, and Wall Street only know how to print money, which makes things worse. FYI: When fake money is printed, the rich who own real assets get richer…. while the poor and middle class, who save fake money, get poorer due to inflation and taxes. Let inflation make you richer, not poorer. Save gold, silver, and Bitcoin. Take care. Crash is here.” Kiyosaki predicts that Bitcoin will rally between 78% and 257% before this year comes to an end. “MY PRICE PREDICTION for BITCOIN 2025: $175,000 to $350,000″ The best-selling author recently referred to the US dollar as “fake money,” noting that the government can always print more units out of thin air. “I stopped trusting my government in 1965 when I noticed our silver coins were now alloys of cooper. In 1971, President Nixon continued the theft of our wealth via our money, when Tricky Dicky Nixon took the US dollar off the gold standard… If you do not [like] being ‘bent over’ and your wealth stolen via your fake money…. Keep being ignorant, working hard for fake money, and continue listening to financial planners who will tell you what to do with your fake money.” Bitcoin is trading at $98,079 at time of writing.

However, as the president will soon be sworn in, cryptocurrency’s fate stands in the balance; it could go mainstream or be brought down by a cast of villains. There are strong beliefs that the Trump administration will accommodate crypto’s plea for official recognition as a store of value. The idea of Paul Atkins assuming the SEC chairperson has rekindled these hopes because he has been warm towards crypto, unlike his predecessor, Gary Gensler. During the US presidential election campaign, Trump floated the idea of establishing a national Bitcoin reserve. Such sentiments could mean that regulatory frameworks will favor crypto, even though some critics saw the promise of a Bitcoin reserve as a scam . Criminal activities might be on the rise with crypto going mainstream While everything looks exciting, cryptocurrency has a dark side that few people understand. Already, criminals, notorious Irish gangsters, Hamas, Russian arms dealers, and North Korean hackers have moved billions of dollars through stablecoins, including Tether. Trump’s victory has impacted Tether’s outlook so much. With the current state of Tether as the world’s favorite stablecoin and Trump as the president, Tether might present serious problems. The growth of Tether will leave it exposed and interconnected with Wall Street firms like Cantor, putting the broader financial system at risk in case of crypto crises. Also, a vibrant Tether would create an enabling environment for illegal activities, undermining the government’s ability to fight crime, counter terrorism, and enforce sanctions. The current happenings are breeding confidence in the crypto space. However, there is no legal foundation or documentation to enforce these brilliant moves. Therefore, it is very difficult to predict how Bitcoin’s future will look. Will crypto be a team player or an outlaw in 2025 and beyond? Crypto optimists, including Aaron Brown, have mixed feelings about crypto, although he holds that crypto will likely go mainstream in 2025. He analyzes the journey of cryptos from 2014 when many people thought Bitcoin and other altcoins would not survive and that blockchain technology would remain a minor innovation for a niche application. He further outlined how people believed crypto was here with us but wouldn’t deliver a social revolution like the internet did. In 2022, the discussion was if crypto could integrate existing financial regulations and markets or if it would operate similarly to the dark web. We all have the outcomes of the first two scenarios Aaron explored. The year 2025 will answer the third question. If President Trump walks the talk, the cold war between crypto innovators and governments may conclude. The scenario will allow capital to move freely between the traditional and crypto sectors, enhancing financial inclusion. Moreover, Bitcoin and other dominant altcoins may go mainstream. Should this happen, dubious projects and acts of shadowy groups of hackers, anarchists, and libertarians might remain, but the struggles with the law will be out of the equation. This would increase the value of Bitcoin and other respectable digital assets.

At today’s prices, that’s about $726 million worth of Bitcoin. The company says this is part of a calculated plan to generate yield and cover rising operating expenses. MARA’s Director of Investor Relations, Robert Samuels, shared that these loans are “short-term arrangements with well-established third parties,” but he didn’t name names. In its production update, MARA revealed it mined 9,457 BTC throughout 2024 and went shopping for an additional 22,065 BTC at an average price of $87,205. That’s nearly $2 billion spent on Bitcoin. As of press time, MARA held 44,893 BTC, valued at about $4.4 billion. Modest returns, bold strategy The company’s lending program isn’t pulling in massive profits yet. Samuels called the returns “a modest single-digit yield,” adding that MARA experimented with Bitcoin loans throughout 2024. “The long-term objective is to generate sufficient yield to offset operating expenses.” This approach is risky in a market still licking its wounds from the collapse of lenders like BlockFi, Genesis, Celsius, and Babel in 2022. Those meltdowns exposed just how dangerous counterparty risks can be, but MARA appears confident in its choice of partners. Despite the risks, MARA raked in $3.9 million in interest income during Q3 2024. Most of this came from cash on its balance sheet and Bitcoin loans. By mid-2024, the company had already generated $4.8 million in interest income, though earlier filings didn’t specify Bitcoin lending as part of the haul. MARA also broke the 50 exahash per second (EH/s) mark, ending the year with an energized hashrate of 53 EH/s. Though the realized hashrate—what’s actually contributing to the Bitcoin network—remained steady at 47 EH/s. That consistency didn’t go unnoticed in a year where Bitcoin miners faced halved block rewards following the April 2024 halving. Bitcoin miners break record as 2025 begins The Bitcoin mining industry has started 2025 with a bang. On January 3, the network’s total hashrate hit 1,000 exahashes per second (EH/s)—double the 510 EH/s recorded in January 2024. This comes despite the halving, which cut mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. It slashed miner revenues in half, but instead of slowing down, miners threw billions into better rigs and energy-saving systems to stay profitable. The investments are paying off. These massive upgrades are driving efficiency like never before, even as rewards dwindle. The result? Bitcoin’s mining infrastructure is now more powerful than ever, with miners proving they can adapt to anything the market throws at them. As Bitcoin prices soared past $108,000 in December, miners started exploring new ways to cash in. Securities lending is one of the hottest trends. Miners are lending Bitcoin to get shares in ETFs, which they then loan out for a profit. Then there’s high-performance computing (HPC). Companies like BitDigital and Terawulf are turning their mining operations into hubs for AI and HPC tasks, making the most of their energy setups. This is expected to rake in billions by 2027.

A portion of his post stated, “We’re going straight to Mars. The Moon is a distraction.” This post immediately received a lot of replies, including one from the former CEO of Binance, Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao. Elon Musk Triggers Prioritization Talk in Crypto For those in the crypto ecosystem, “moon” is synonymous with making huge profits and massive investments. This concept likely triggered Zhao to respond to Musk’s tweet. CZ pointed out that chasing price is a distraction. This statement echoes the Binance founder’s long-term stand on crypto enthusiasts changing their priorities. He is more concerned with getting these entities to focus on the big picture and develop products that make a difference. Zhao says this is more sustainable and creates value than chasing short-term market movements. There you have it. Elon just said price is a distraction. Keep building. 🤣 https://t.co/Ilf7Lq4V2h — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) January 5, 2025 Once crypto enthusiasts develop products that can sell themselves, a price increase is likely to follow naturally. CZ Bullish About 2025 Before this time, CZ had clearly stated that 2025 would be a “send it” year, aligning with his view of cycles in the cryptocurrency market. He believes recovery years and initial bear markets always come before bull market years. CZ, seeking a pardon from Donald Trump , has already categorized 2024 as a recovery year and 2025 as a bull market year. With this in mind, the focus should not be on prices and their pursuit of the “moon.” Bitcoin Price Dips In 24 Hours Meanwhile, the prices of quite several cryptocurrencies have been fluctuating sideways in the last few weeks. Some factors likely trigger this outlook. The firstborn digital asset, Bitcoin (BTC), trades at $98,320.19 after losing 0.4% of its price level within 24 hours. A few analysts believe there will be a further drop in the coming weeks. They warn that Bitcoin price may slump below $60,000 by January 20, during Donald Trump’s inauguration. There have been signs of incoming bearish sentiments, including the movement of over 33,000 BTC, worth $3.23 billion, to exchanges.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As the crypto market braces for a potential bull run in 2025, iDEGEN, PATRIOT, and Akuma Inu emerge as top altcoins to watch for explosive growth. The new year is just around the corner, and with it comes the prospect of the mother of all bull runs. Consequently, traders and speculators are falling over themselves trying to find the next big cryptocurrency to invest in before the bulls come a-knockin’. The trouble is that hunting for the next crypto to explode can often blow up in your face if you don’t research. And therein lies the rub—not everyone has the time to spend hours in the deepest, dankest corners of X or Discord searching for the next biggest crypto no one has heard of before. That’s where this guide comes in. We’ve researched the best crypto to invest in ahead of 2025, so you don’t have to. Without further ado, we’ve drilled it down to the top 3 monster tokens to watch next year. iDEGEN: The most intriguing AI crypto experiment takes flight PATRIOT: The best bet in the PolitiFi meme coin arena for 2025 Akuma Inu: Hard-charging new meme coin drawing a crowd Read on to discover why these three choice cuts are being tipped as the next big crypto gainers of the bull cycle. You might also like: Bitcoin or altcoins? Find out who will win the holiday season iDEGEN: The most intriguing AI crypto experiment takes flight The AI crypto sector was the hottest narrative to dominate 2023 and 2024 alongside meme coins. And as the year ends, the spotlight is circling back to AI with the rise of sector-adjacent tokens and memecoins like ai16z and Fartcoin going parabolic even as the wider market takes a breather. AI is where the smart money and the whales are at, and we’re not even remotely close to scratching the surface of the market’s vast moon potential. Unsurprisingly, the AI crypto space is home to a gold mine of tokens with the potential to dominate the discourse in 2025, and the best of the bunch hasn’t even hit the open market yet. We’re talking about iDEGEN . It’s conducting the most unhinged AI social experiment on X. iDEGEN has unleashed a witty, autonomous AI agent trained exclusively by prompts from the most far-out fringes of Crypto Twitter. It is creating the most based and red-pilled agent never before seen in the brief history of AI crypto. The result? An AI agent without politically correct programming, without corporate brainwashing, and without the baked-in woke mind virus most AI comes out of the box with. This agent trains its algorithms on the most brilliant, deranged takes this side of Crypto Twitter —posting an hourly stream of tweets, images, and, very soon, video content on social platforms. iDEGEN responds to every mention or interaction without any filters, constantly feeding itself with input from the best and brightest that Crypto Twitter has to offer. But X is just the beginning—iDEGEN is designed to create the most attention across numerous social channels—which is expected to translate into big-time gains for its native token IDGN in 2025. You’re still early for the moon mission, too. Currently available at just $0.0410, iDEGEN is still in its adaptive auction presale phase until it hits the open market in January. With its presale raising a sensational $8.6m so far, it’s all just a matter of time before IDGN goes parabolic. Visit the iDEGEN website to learn more. PATRIOT: The best bet in the PolitiFi meme coin arena for 2025 PolitiFi was another narrative that gained major traction earlier this year ahead of the US presidential elections in November. But soon after that, the circus appeared to have left town after Trump was elected. But lo and behold, one contender has emerged from the wreckage as the next big crypto in the PolitiFi meme coin arena with the launch of PATRIOT. Using the infinitely memeable Trump for its branding, PATRIOT has popped off on an 18x run since launching in November. Investors are betting on PATRIOT to pump in the weeks leading up to Trump’s inauguration in January, making it the best bet left on the PolitiFi board in 2024. Akuma Inu: Hard-charging new meme coin drawing a crowd Meme coins have always been and always will be the main draw to crypto. Like it or not, that’s just how it is. One of the best new meme coins, as the year ends, is Akuma Inu, a canine-themed meme coin launched on Base. Since launching, Akuma Inu has recorded a staggering 3,000% gain even as the market rests up for the next leg up in 2025. Akuma Inu has blown past a $120 million market cap as of press time—and given the fact that dog-themed meme coins continue to dominate the narrative, Akuma Inu has plenty of legroom to go on a big run next year.

Trump’s Pet Doge (TRUMDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Pet Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Pet Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Pet Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Pet Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Pet Doge by entering its contract address – 6e6jZxV1zG7GGLF5MoJZf8nY4u17x8dceDatSWiTE573 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 21:55:00

The recent leak from a Baidu Tieba forum post, a popular Chinese site shows the sides, the back, and a little bit of the front of the Joycon. New Joy-con Photos from Chinese SNS by u/SwordfishAgile3472 in NintendoSwitch2 The leak shows that new controllers still slot in as one does expect from Nintendo’s console. It looks like the console will stick with the genesis of the original Switch design. The Joycons themselves seem longer and bulkier though. This detail adds to what to expect from the upcoming console , implying the Switch 2 could be a larger device. Switch 2 Joycons reportedly have some new features stealing the spotlight Not surprising that it’s sticking with the hybrid format. Although the Joycons have some new features stealing the spotlight, revealing that these controllers have more than meets the eye. We have much clearer insights than earlier leaks. It features an optical sensor (mysterious in its purpose) and a reworked locking mechanism as one standout feature. Moreover, eagle-eyed fans noticed a serial number in the leaked photos. This detail could also reveal the leaker. However, the serial number doesn’t provide enough details about the product to indicate the images are real. These new controllers are considerably more robust than the original Joycons. Unlike some other pieces of joy tech, these seem to go straight into the console rather than sliding in, and a button near the shoulder button probably to release them. There is also another noticeable upgrade; the larger concealed buttons which allow for easier play with just one Joycon. Even though one can’t really see what the front of the Joycon looks like, these leaks seem to be very promising for the Switch 2, as they imply the controllers will get some big upgrades compared to their predecessor.

Freezing Criminal Assets “By working closely with authorities across jurisdictions, Tether has been instrumental in freezing criminal assets and ensuring that bad actors do not exploit stablecoins like USDT,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether. “Criminals now have 100 million reasons to think twice before using TRON,” said Justin Sun, founder of the Tron network , who added: “T3 FCU’s rapid success in freezing criminal assets sends an unmistakable message: if you’re using USDT on TRON for crime, you will be caught.” T3 Financial Crime Unit Marks Enforcement Victory: $100 Million in Criminal Assets Frozen Across Five Continents Read more: https://t.co/HReVLYRfxz — Tether (@Tether_to) January 2, 2025 The T3 Financial Crime Unit has already analyzed millions of transactions across five continents, monitoring over 3 billion in USDT volume, according to the announcement. Chris Janczewski, head of global investigations at TRM Labs, said surpassing 100 million USDT in frozen assets is just the beginning. “In 2025 and beyond, as more and more lawful users enter the growing crypto ecosystem, it is more important than ever to keep it safe. T3 is dedicated to that mission.” Are Tether’s EU Woes About to Deepen? Tether’s market capitalization has started to shrink for the first time since late 2022, having fallen by 3 billion USDT from its peak of around $140 billion in mid-December. The decline in supply may be due to deepening concerns in Europe as its restrictive Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations were activated, raising uncertainty about USDT’s status on exchanges in the bloc. The implementation of MiCA in Europe on Dec. 30 has created an uncertain future for stablecoin issuers such as Tether since the regulations do not clarify whether USDT is compliant. However, Ardoino dismissed the concerns as FUD earlier this week as the firm added $700 million worth of Bitcoin to its treasury. “Don’t believe the FUD,” he said before adding, “Competitors are just desperate to make you believe things that don’t exist.” The post Tether-Led Crime Unit Hits $100M Milestone in Global Crypto Asset Seizures appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Tether (USDT)|Tron,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-01-05 22:05:38

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rexas Finance (RXS) outpaces Solana and Ripple, offering a unique asset tokenization approach with a 490% presale surge, making it a standout investment opportunity. Forget Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) if you want a high-growth crypto investment this crypto cycle. Although both tokens have recently enjoyed small increases—SOL growing 7.38% over the past 60 days to $186.45 and XRP flying 321.98% to $2.17—they pale compared to the explosive ascent of Rexas Finance (RXS). With a 490% increase during its presale, RXS is emerging as the standout token of this cycle. It offers a realistic path to turning $450 into $45,000. A presale performance that commands attention Rexas Finance began its presale in early September 2024 at just $0.030 per token. Since then, it has climbed an astonishing 490% to $0.175 in its 11th presale stage, raising over $34,151,703 and selling 385,864,593 RXS tokens. This impressive growth translates to a 6x return for early investors and demonstrates the token’s strong bullish momentum. Market analysts project that RXS could rise 100x during the next bull cycle, reaching $17.50. If this prediction holds, an initial $450 investment today could transform into a staggering $45,000. Notable whale activity supports this promise; Ethereum and Solana’s investors are pouring money into RXS at its present price. This is not only conjecture. Rexas Finance is distinguished mainly by its dedication to security and openness. Certik has thoroughly audited the project, giving investors faith in its code and practices. Unlike many initiatives that depend on venture capital investment, Rexas Finance has taken a community-centric approach, drawing individual investors who share its vision. This choice guarantees that the initiative stays aligned with its long-term plan of transforming asset tokenization. Already having listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, Rexas Finance has established itself. These systems increase the token’s legitimacy by offering real-time tracking and comprehensive analytics, enhancing its visibility. These listings provide a consistent supply of information for investors so they may decide on RXS with knowledge.

The competition promises 20 lucky winners $50,000 worth of RXS tokens, each with 681,868 entries thus far. Tasks on the Rexas Finance website and campaign sharing will help participants raise their chances of winning. This endeavor benefits society and emphasizes its dedication to diversity and expansion. Why Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) can’t compete Although Solana and Ripple are making news, RXS’s exponential expansion has been the star of recent performance. Though spectacular in isolation, Solana’s 7.38% increase and Ripple’s 321.98% leap fall short of the 490% rally seen in RXS. Furthermore, neither SOL nor XRP presents the revolutionary idea of actual asset tokenization that Rexas Finance proposes. Investors are noting RXS’s unique value proposition. A well-known Ethereum whale recently disclosed plans to purchase RXS for $0.175 and cited its potential to grow 100x in the next cycle. This assurance from high-net-worth investors confirms the coin’s potential for growth even more. Rexas Finance is mainly based on its capacity to tokenize actual assets. Whether it’s fractional ownership of real estate, money, or fine art, the platform lets anyone easily buy, sell, or exchange physical objects. The ramifications are significant since it creates investment prospects that were once only accessible to a few people. The platform’s support of several token standards—including ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155—guarantees the blockchain ecosystem’s flexibility and interoperability. Thanks to this capacity, Rexas Finance links conventional finance with blockchain technology. Conclusion: the time to invest is now Rexas Finance (RXS) is a transforming enterprise that can upend sectors valued in trillions of dollars, not simply another coin. With its outstanding presale performance, Certik audit, and emphasis on actual asset tokenization, RXS presents an intriguing investment possibility. Although some would find Solana and Ripple appealing, they lack the explosive innovation and expansion that RXS offers. RXS is the token to watch for anybody wishing to turn $450,000 into $45,000, as RXS could rise 100x from its current price of $0.175, which shows massive bullish momentum. Invest in the RXS presale right now to seize the opportunity to be part of this innovative project and set yourself up for lifetime-transforming results.

Here’s a simple breakdown of why these coins are worth watching. Let's dive in! 1. Altura ($ALU): The #1 Coin of AI and Gaming Altura ($ALU) has quickly gained attention as a game-changer in the gaming and NFT space. The platform enables developers to mint, distribute, and update smart NFTs seamlessly, opening the door to innovative in-game assets. With the gaming industry projected to hit $300 billion by 2025, Altura’s potential is immense. Its strong partnerships with gaming studios and recent updates to its platform make it a top contender for exponential growth.Why Watch? Altura is the #1 leader in integrating AI into gaming. As both the AI and gaming industries grow, Altura’s market cap is projected to reach between $1-3 billion or more, potentially resulting in significant price increases of over 1000%. With its innovative technology and expanding influence, $ALU stands out as a must-watch altcoin. 2. Dogecoin ($DOGE): The Original Meme Coin Dogecoin remains a popular choice among crypto enthusiasts, thanks to its active community and ongoing mainstream adoption. With consistent mentions by high-profile figures like Elon Musk and new use cases emerging, Dogecoin has maintained its relevance in the crypto market.Why Watch? As Trump won the election, Elon Musk has become close friends with him and has consistently been promoting Dogecoin. There are rumors of $DOGE becoming an official payment method for the X (Twitter) platform, which could drive significant utility and create a pro-crypto environment due to Trump's influence. Despite its playful origins, $DOGE continues to be a serious contender in the altcoin market. Its accessibility and active development make it a strong pick for those looking for a low-cost investment. 3. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): The ""Dogecoin Killer"" Shiba Inu has made waves in the crypto space as a strong competitor to Dogecoin. With a robust ecosystem that includes ShibaSwap, NFTs, and its growing Shibarium blockchain, $SHIB is more than just a meme coin. The project’s commitment to community and innovation keeps it in the spotlight.Why Watch? Because Shiba Inu launched their own network and still maintains one of the greatest hypes in the meme coin world since 2021, $SHIB continues to make a buzz. Its strong community and ongoing developments keep it at the forefront of the meme coin space, offering significant growth potential. 4. Bonk ($BONK): Solana’s Top Meme Coin $BONK has emerged as the leading meme coin on the Solana blockchain, a network celebrated for its scalability and lightning-fast transaction speeds. With Solana’s market cap surpassing $100 billion, $BONK is well-positioned to capture a substantial portion of this ecosystem.Why Watch? If $BONK captures just 10% of Solana’s market cap, it could see a 5x increase from its current levels. As the Solana ecosystem expands, $BONK has the potential to become a dominant player in the meme coin category. 5. Brett ($BRETT): A New Coin with Big Dreams Brett ($BRETT) is a newer cryptocurrency that’s catching people’s attention. It’s often referred to as the ""best friend of Pepe"" and is one of the top meme coins on the Base chain. Brett has a playful and relatable brand that draws in the meme-loving crypto crowd.Why Watch? If the Base chain continues to grow and attract more users, interest in Brett could skyrocket. With more people using the Base chain, Brett’s popularity and value might increase significantly, making it a serious contender to hit $1. Conclusion: Altura Leads the Pack While all five altcoins have the potential to deliver impressive returns, Altura ($ALU) stands out as the most promising pick. Its innovative approach to integrating AI into gaming and NFTs sets it apart, offering long-term growth potential. That said, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Bonk, and Brett are also worth keeping an eye on as they ride the wave of increasing crypto adoption. Diversifying your portfolio with these altcoins under $1 could be a winning strategy this month. Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

Here’s Your Second Shot With BTFD Coin!,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-out-on-the-cat-in-a-dogs-world-craze-heres-your-second-shot-with-btfd-coin/,"Cryptocurrencies—once a niche fascination for tech geeks—are now a global sensation. Everyone, from college kids to Wall Street hotshots, is trying to ride the crypto wave. Among them, meme coins have carved out a wild, unpredictable, and ridiculously profitable niche. Remember Dogecoin’s meteoric rise? Or Shiba Inu’s life-changing gains? Yeah, we all know someone who “got in early” and is now lounging on a beach somewhere, sipping margaritas. For the rest of us who missed the boat, it’s easy to feel like the party’s over. But here’s the kicker: the meme coin scene is just getting started. Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD) . This fresh contender is shaking up the game in ways even the OGs didn’t. BTFD isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a full-blown movement. With its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, sky-high staking rewards, and a fiercely loyal “Bulls Squad,” BTFD is setting the stage for meme coin 2.0. So, if you’re hunting for the best meme coin presale to join this month, keep reading. This might be your shot to turn FOMO into pure joy. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Meme Coin with Serious Game (Literally) BTFD Coin isn’t just cashing in on the meme coin hype; it’s redefining it. For starters, its P2E game is a massive hit. Think of it like Fortnite meets crypto: you battle it out, level up, and earn real rewards in $BTFD tokens. Whether you’re gaming on your phone during a lunch break or grinding all weekend, you’re stacking crypto while having fun. How’s that for multitasking? And then there’s the staking. Let’s get real: who doesn’t want to earn passive income? With a jaw-dropping APY that’s turning heads across the crypto world, staking BTFD is like planting money trees in your backyard. You park your coins, let the Bulls Squad do their thing, and watch your stash grow. Speaking of the Bulls Squad, this community is next-level. Over 4,700 holders strong and counting, these are die-hard believers in BTFD’s vision. Whether it’s hyping the coin on social media or diving into strategy chats, they’re all in—and it shows. Now let’s talk numbers, because we all know numbers don’t lie. BTFD’s presale is on fire. Starting at a humble $0.000004 per coin, it’s already climbed to $0.000142 in Stage 13. Over $4.9 million has been raised so far, with $1 million pouring in within just 10 days of launch. That’s the kind of momentum meme coin dreams are made of. To put it in perspective, if you dropped $15,000 during Stage 5 at $0.00005 per coin, you’d have snagged 300 million BTFD tokens. When the price hits $0.0006 at the end of the presale? You’re looking at $180,000. Yup, six figures. How’s that for ROI? With analysts predicting an even brighter future for BTFD, the buzz is real. The presale is already in full swing, so if you’ve got “get in early” on your 2024 bingo card, now’s the time. Sign up, secure your spot, and join the Bulls Squad—before it’s too late. Cat in a Dog’s World: The Underdog (or Should We Say, Undercat?) While BTFD is stealing the spotlight, Cat in a Dog’s World is carving out its own niche—and doing it with some serious style. Imagine the ultimate underdog story: a feisty feline taking on the big dogs (literally). This coin’s charm lies in its quirky narrative and tight-knit community that’s as loyal as it is creative. Cat in a Dog’s World operates on the idea that you don’t have to be a top dog to dominate. Its focus on utility-driven growth sets it apart from meme coins that rely purely on hype. The team is working on integrating their coin into NFT marketplaces and Metaverse projects, creating a use case that’s both innovative and practical. And while they’re keeping specifics under wraps, early adopters are buzzing about a possible NFT launch that could make their coin even more valuable. Price-wise, Cat in a Dog’s World is in its infancy, which means it’s dirt cheap to get in. But don’t let that fool you. Analysts predict a strong upward trajectory as the project develops and gains traction in the crypto community. For those who missed out on Dogecoin and Shiba Inu when they were fractions of a cent, this could be your chance to get in on the ground floor of the next big thing. Still, let’s be honest: it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. Unlike BTFD’s fully fleshed-out ecosystem, Cat in a Dog’s World is more speculative at this stage. But hey, high risk, high reward, right? If you’ve got a soft spot for scrappy projects with big dreams, this one’s worth keeping on your radar. Seamless BIG50 Activation Access the Presale Page now.

As the best crypto to buy now for 100x returns, Web3Bay offers a strong combination of secure data handling, versatile token advantages, and a visionary plan for growth. Here’s an in-depth review of why Web3Bay is a sound investment choice. Securing Data Privacy with Decentralized Storage In today’s digital world, data privacy is crucial, especially on e-commerce platforms where users’ sensitive information is involved. Web3Bay tackles this by incorporating the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) into its structure. IPFS uses a decentralized storage method, spreading data across various nodes to boost security and dependability. With IPFS, Web3Bay ensures that user data is protected against the vulnerabilities and failures common in centralized systems. Every transaction, be it a purchase or token exchange, is securely logged and stored, keeping personal details private. This method not only protects data but also supports blockchain’s values of openness and user control. For both buyers and sellers, this decentralized method offers assurance. Customers can shop without fear of their data being stolen or misused, while sellers face lower risks of data breaches, which can be expensive and harm their reputation. Moreover, Web3Bay’s use of IPFS puts users in control of their data, significantly reducing unauthorized access. As global concern about digital privacy grows, Web3Bay stands out as a dependable platform for secure online shopping. Enhancing Value with 3BAY Token Utility The 3BAY token is central to improving the user experience and boosting engagement on Web3Bay. More than just a currency, the token opens doors to unique benefits and rewards. Owning 3BAY tokens gets you a 5% discount on all Web3Bay transactions, promoting token use over traditional payment methods and integrating users into the platform’s expanding community. From daily purchases to exclusive sales, this discount offers real savings for active participants. The token presale is in its third phase, priced at $0.0039675, with over $320,000 raised so far. Its target launch price is $0.1959, giving early investors a potential for substantial gains. 3BAY tokens also provide governance rights, allowing holders to vote on important platform decisions, from new features to policy updates, creating a strong sense of community and ownership. Additionally, community involvement is rewarded. Users can gain extra tokens through staking, promotions, or contributing to the platform’s growth, fostering an environment where community participation brings tangible benefits. The token’s value is also supported by a deflationary model, with periodic token burns to ensure scarcity, aligning with long-term investment benefits as demand increases. Charting the Future: Web3Bay’s Strategic Growth Plan Web3Bay is dedicated to sustainable growth through a strategic plan that consistently enriches its ecosystem and enhances user engagement. At the heart of this strategy are advanced blockchain technologies poised to revolutionize decentralized e-commerce. A key upcoming feature is the integration of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), which will allow trading of unique items like art and collectibles, expanding Web3Bay’s market reach. This move not only capitalizes on the burgeoning NFT market but also opens new opportunities for creators and merchants globally. Web3Bay is also set to expand into decentralized finance (DeFi), enabling services such as loans, savings, and staking directly on its platform. This integration aims to provide a comprehensive environment for users to manage both their commercial and financial activities effortlessly. Further, Web3Bay will support interoperability with leading blockchains like Ethereum and BNB Chain, facilitating seamless transactions across different networks and encouraging wider user adoption. Plans are also underway to develop user-friendly mobile apps and integrate conventional payment options alongside cryptocurrencies, making the platform accessible to a broader audience and bridging the divide between blockchain enthusiasts and the general public. Wrapping Up: Why Web3Bay is Best Crypto to Buy for Massive Returns Web3Bay distinguishes itself in the crypto presale market with its strong emphasis on data privacy, beneficial token utility, and innovative expansion plans. It integrates IPFS technology to ensure top-tier data security, crucial for e-commerce integrity. Additionally, the versatile 3BAY token enhances user value through discounts, governance participation, and various rewards, appealing to both platform users and investors. The platform’s ambitious growth roadmap further establishes its prominence. By integrating NFTs, DeFi capabilities, and cross-chain functionality, Web3Bay shows its commitment to maintaining a cutting-edge position in blockchain technology. For investors searching for crypto with significant growth potential, Web3Bay represents an appealing option. With major advancements anticipated and a clear vision for development, Web3Bay combines utility, security, and expansive future prospects.

Pepe the Boss (PEPEBOSS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEBOSS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe the Boss can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe the Boss could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe the Boss launched with over $8,500 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe the Boss on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe the Boss by entering its contract address – 5pgsjH712NZ6eaKunsEfZarG9UotHaxvheW5E39a8NFX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEBOSS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 23:24:00

Multiple media outlets and social media users have raged after a “Polish tourist” posted a report and a video appearing to show that ASIC Bitcoin (BTC) miners are operating in rural parts of Abkhazia. These reports come just days after Russia began providing Abkhazia with “humanitarian supplies” of electricity. Abkhazia: Crypto Mining Crisis The Caucasus-based de facto state is closely allied with Moscow and is considered a breakaway Georgian republic by most Western and Western-aligned nations. The “tourist” testified: “Entire villages are humming; mountains and caves are buzzing [with the sound of ASIC mining rigs]. Cables carrying free electricity are stretching out into the forests. And the forests are also buzzing, too.” Russia is moving to restrict online images and maps showing one of the country’s oil refineries in an effort to protect the crucial infrastructure from Ukrainian drone attacks https://t.co/5s7BL0kQxh — Bloomberg (@business) January 3, 2025 The “tourist” also posted a video entitled “the sound of ASIC rigs over Abkhazia.” This video captures what appears to be the sound of whirring fans outdoors in a rural Abkhazian settlement. A journalist for the Russian media outlet Noviye Izvestia wrote: “Mining equipment in this backward, half-ruined country is installed in villages, mountains, forests, and caves.” The article was titled: “‘Thank you, Russia!’ The Illegal Miners of Abkhazia are Burning up our Free Electricity.” On Telegram, the popular Russian blogger Sergei Kolyasnikov mused: “Look at this video! Can you imagine how many devices need to be operating to make so much noise? And each ASIC rig uses 3.5 kW of power. It seems that Abkhazia has become a Russian crypto mining offshore.” Russia declared a regional state of emergency in Crimea, as workers cleared tons of contaminated sand on either side of the Kerch Strait following an oil spill in the Black Sea https://t.co/1HPbw3wMA5 pic.twitter.com/G11wVr10Zb — Reuters (@Reuters) January 5, 2025 ‘Crypto Miners to Blame’ as Rolling Blackouts Return in Abkhazia Timur Dzhindzholiya, the head of the Abkhazia power provider Chernomorenergo, said last month that illegal miners are using up “about 350 million kWh” per year . Despite the influx of Russian power, Chernomorenergo has been forced to act, turning off power supplies for a fixed period every day. The power grid, the firm claimed, cannot cope with “excessive loads.” It claims that “the main reason for” these loads “is illegal mining.” The Ministry of Finance of Abkhazia has claimed that it expects to receive over five billion rubles (over $45 million) worth of aid from Russia in 2025. China has allowed companies to send items with both civilian and military applications to Russia – while also claiming to want to help bring peace to Ukraine.

In my native Sverdlovsk Oblast, we will pay between 12.6% to 19.5% more for energy this year.” Russian blogger Sergei Kolyasnikov Crypto mining-related controversies have led to public violence at the highest level. Last month, media outlets reported an Abkhazian lawmaker was shot dead during a parliamentary debate on banning crypto mining. In previous years, Abkhazian communities have taken action, forcibly expelling suspected crypto miners to leave their villages. The de facto state endured a torrid end to 2024, with its only power station – which is only partially located in Abkhazia – shutting down on December 11. The Enguri Hydroelectric Power Station. (Source: Paata Vardanashvili [CC BY 2.0]) Activities at the Enguri Hydroelectric Power station were paused “due to critically low water levels” in one of its main reservoirs. The day prior, the government forced internet providers to cut the entire de facto state’s internet access for seven hours . The republic has also seen relations with Moscow deteriorate after politicians voted against agreeing on a new investment deal with Russia. Moscow responded by cutting its funding to the de facto state. In recent days, however, the Abkhazian government has moved to repair its relationship with Russia. Its President claimed he would “try to strengthen relations with” Moscow. “We very much appreciate Russia’s constant support in overcoming the energy crisis that Abkhazia is experiencing.

Normally, the chart is released before the firm purchases new Bitcoin the next day. Thus, analysts are predicting MicroStrategy will make another Bitcoin purchase on Monday. Saylor did similar before a recent BTC acquisition Michael Saylor, co-founder of Microstrategy, posted the firm’s Bitcoin Tracker chart on December 29. The next day, the company made another Bitcoin acquisition. MicroStrategy bought 2138 BTC all on Dec 30, spending about $97,837 on each coin. On January 5, Saylor shared a similar chart tracking all of Microstategy BTC purchases. Given its history, analysts now believe the firm is ready to make another BTC acquisition, particularly on January 6. MicroStrategy’s 21/21 plan also adds to analysts’ expectations since the company will invest about $42 billion in its Bitcoin acquisitions, using $21 billion in equity and $21 billion in fixed-income securities. The company even requested its shareholders to raise the authorized shares of preferred stock from 5 million to over 1 billion. Similarly, it is requesting an expansion of its Class A common stock authorization from 330 million to 10.3 billion shares. Moreover, MicroStrategy has disclosed its intention to pursue a $2 billion perpetual preferred stock offering. This raise initiative, separate from the firm’s 21/21 Bitcoin financing strategy, is projected for Q1 2025, contingent on internal approval. Some believe MicroStrategy will slow down on its Bitcoin purchases in 2025 BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes expects the crypto market to fall, especially after President Donald Trump’s pending inauguration. Hayes’ early investment fund, Maelstrom, claimed it would make future crypto purchases at lower prices, suggesting the fund is waiting for crypto prices to drop. However, with a projected market slowdown in January 2025, analysts believe MicroStrategy will pause its BTC acquisitions, which could affect the firm’s shares and convertible bonds distribution. Michael Saylor, however, advocated for the company to acquire Bitcoin during peak prices in early December. He said: I’m sure that I will be buying Bitcoin at $1 million a coin—probably $1 billion dollars a day of Bitcoin at $1 million a coin. ~ Michael Saylor This, however, means that Microstartegy might still make more BTC purchases, especially if its trading prices decline.

On Dec. 25, 2024, in Karachi, Pakistan, seven suspects—including an officer from the Counter-Terrorism Department—were taken into custody on suspicion of participating in the kidnapping of a cryptocurrency trader and demanding a ransom of $340,000. While confirming that one CTD officer had been arrested, Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon stated that attempts were still underway to capture another police officer implicated in the crime. The victim, 30-year-old Mohammed Arsalan, was kidnapped from Manghopir, a well-known neighborhood in the northwestern part of Karachi. According to Arsalan, the abductors forced him to transfer $340,000 from his Binance account to several wallets they controlled before releasing him hours later near the Quaid-e-Azam mausoleum. You might also like: Pakistan proposes new crypto framework to central bank rules Arsalan later shared additional details on Facebook, but independent sources largely unverified his claims, including the specific amount transferred and the exact sequence of events. He claimed that $277,000 of the stolen amount was transferred to a specific wallet through decentralized exchanges before being moved off-chain to Binance . Arsalan Malik’s Post | Source: Facebook While Arsalan assured the public that law enforcement was actively working to trace the transactions and identify the individuals behind the wallets, experts have pointed out the challenges of tracking funds through decentralized finance systems, where anonymity is often a core feature. Arsalan also posted a screenshot of his Binance withdrawal history on Facebook , showing multiple forced transfers in various cryptocurrencies, including significant amounts in USDT and other tokens, totaling over $340,000. Although screenshots can provide useful evidence, investigators must authenticate this data to fully corroborate his account. The suspects, identified as Mohammed Rizwan Shah, Tariq Hasan Shah alias Amir, Muzamil Raza, Umer Jilani, Umer Irshad, Noman Riffat, and Haris alias Ashar, were apprehended by the Anti-Violence Crime Cell. According to a statement by AVCC officials, the team, led by SSP Aneel Haider Minhas, conducted multiple operations throughout Karachi to capture the suspects. However, details about the exact timeline of their arrests and the evidence linking each suspect to the crime remain unclear. The AVCC described the arrested individuals as habitual offenders who had been jailed for similar crimes in the past, but public records or court documents to substantiate this characterization were not immediately available. Arsalan’s account of the lead-up to his abduction also raises some unanswered questions. Weeks before the incident, he claimed that a man named Hamid approached him to purchase US dollars. Despite Arsalan’s refusal, Hamid persisted and eventually set up a meeting with Arsalan’s friend Zohaib. On Dec. 24, 2024, three men, including Muzamil and Hammad, visited Arsalan’s office and invited him to a restaurant where other suspects joined them. It remains unclear why Arsalan agreed to meet with individuals he was reportedly suspicious of or whether any measures were taken to verify their identities. Such details could be critical in understanding whether this was a premeditated targeting of Arsalan or an opportunistic crime. Later that night, Arsalan said he was abducted by a group of armed men in an unmarked police vehicle. They gagged him with a cloth and detained him near the Saddar FIA office. There, they allegedly forced him to unlock his Binance account and transfer his money to multiple wallets. After resetting his phone, they released him near a local point of attraction, known as Quaid-e-Azam Mausoleum at 4 a.m. The choice of location for his release and the precise steps taken to reset his phone suggest a level of planning and technological know-how among the kidnappers. In an interview with Dawn , IGP Memon called it a singular instance of misconduct by individual officers and stressed that the police force does not tolerate unlawful activities. However, his remarks have been met with skepticism, given the significant role that rogue officers allegedly played in the crime. Critics argue that a more transparent internal investigation is required to restore public confidence in law enforcement. Arsalan, in a Facebook post , expressed his devastation over the loss of his hard-earned money. He condemned those accusing him of fabricating the incident, stating that the DIG was personally supervising the investigation. He also clarified that no investors or relatives were implicated in the case and vowed to repay any losses incurred by others. Arsalan promised not to spare any of the culprits responsible for orchestrating the crime. Arsalan Malik’s Post | Source: Facebook Although individuals impacted may find some solace in Arsalan’s promises, his assertion that he will reimburse losses may raise questions about his post-theft financial status and whether more investigation into his business activities is necessary. Additionally, making such assurances could unintentionally divert attention from holding the offenders accountable. Serious questions have been raised by the occurrence regarding the security of cryptocurrency traders in Pakistan as well as the abuse of authority by law authorities. The region’s increasing use of cryptocurrencies exposes traders to these types of crimes due to a lack of governmental control and education on the security of digital assets. According to observers, this case might act as a wake-up call for more robust legislative measures and a thorough examination of Pakistan’s legal framework’s protections for digital assets.

Elon Loves MAGA (ELOMAGA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Loves MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Loves MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Loves MAGA launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Loves MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Loves MAGA by entering its contract address – 6mRLPcgWXUBYNfXouCxBoyjFzNjww9HNVFpBJkrqmFeE – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Inmortal tells his 222,400 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks Ethereum is gearing up for rallies this quarter. The trader believes that ETH is about to follow in the footsteps of its Q1 2024 price action. “ETH about to have a good Q1.”‘ Source: Inmortal/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that ETH will hit a new all-time high of $5,300 by March. At time of writing, ETH is worth $3,646. He also thinks old altcoins and artificial intelligence (AI)-focused projects will ignite rallies in the next three months. “In Q1: 1. ETH outperforms. 2. SOL go +$300 3. AI coins mega-pump 4. Memes underperform 5. Dino coins have a good run.” While the analyst believes memecoins will not see huge rallies in Q1 of this year, he says that Floki ( FLOKI ) will be an exception. “High conviction on the memecoin leader. FLOKI.” Source: Inmortal/X Based on the trader’s chart, he appears to suggest that FLOKI is mirroring Pepe’s ( PEPE ) late 2023 to early 2024 price action when the Ethereum-based memecoin went parabolic after months of sideways movement. The trader seems to predict that FLOKI will hit a new all-time high of $0.0005 before the end of Q1. At time of writing, FLOKI is trading at $0.00019.

The CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, Hunter Horsley, has suggested that the economic policies of the Trump administration could have a major impact on the cryptocurrency sector. In a recent tweet, Horsley noted that the potential deregulation of mergers and acquisitions could allow major companies like Google or Amazon to expand even further through strategic acquisitions. M&As refer to the consolidation of companies, either through the merging of businesses or the purchase of one company by another. This process often helps corporations achieve economies of scale, expand market share, or acquire critical assets. Trump administration may unfreeze M&A. Large corporates — mag 7, etc — may finally be able to wield their market cap. Amazon could buy Instacart. Google could buy Uber. etc etc The big may get bigger, and the middle may shrink. If that happens, I think it will accelerate… — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) January 5, 2025 Horsley argued that this concentration of power could drive the adoption of decentralized systems, aligning with the core tenet of cryptocurrency: the skepticism toward centralized organizations. He believes that as large corporations gain more control, the demand for cryptocurrencies—designed to offer an alternative to such institutions—could grow. Corporate behemoths like Google and Amazon are becoming increasingly interested in blockchain technology and digital assets as they look for ways to enter the crypto markets. One example of a blockchain-related service that Amazon Web Services has introduced is Amazon Managed Blockchain , which enables companies to create and oversee scalable blockchain networks. With this action, Amazon establishes itself as a major force in the expanding enterprise blockchain market. By establishing strategic alliances with prominent blockchain initiatives and participating in campaigns to incorporate blockchain technology into its cloud infrastructure, Google has also increased its presence in the cryptocurrency sector. Blockchain-as-a-service is now available on Google Cloud , allowing companies to create and implement decentralized apps. These initiatives demonstrate how major companies are using blockchain technology to diversify their business models while leveraging traditional M&As to expand their reach, thereby further driving the adoption of decentralized systems.

Trump’s victory has been welcomed by many in the cryptocurrency industry, given his pro-business stance and policies that are seen as supportive of digital assets and blockchain technology. These policies have fueled a bullish trend in the market, with experts attributing much of the surge to a more favorable regulatory approach under Trump’s administration. Since Trump’s election win, the cryptocurrency market has seen notable growth, with the biggest example being Bitcoin which surged from approximately $69,000 on Nov. 8, 2024, to over $100,000 in early December.

Experts also believe this rise is driven by the political shift and the potential loosening of regulations, which may create a more favorable environment for digital assets. Horsley is the CEO of Bitwise , an investment firm that has exclusively focused on cryptocurrency investments for the past seven years. The company offers a range of products including crypto-focused funds, ETFs, and others, designed to provide investors exposure to the crypto and Web3 markets. According to Horsley, the influence of major market players—along with regulatory changes—could shape the future of both digital assets and traditional financial systems in 2025, making this an exciting time for both M&A activity and the cryptocurrency sector.

Sebagai pemimpin koin meme, DOGE saat ini menguji resistensi kritis di sekitar level $0,40, yang dapat menjadi penentu langkah selanjutnya. Analis ternama Bluntz baru-baru ini membagikan analisis yang mendalam, menekankan bahwa Dogecoin sedang berada dalam fase akumulasi strategis. Menurut Bluntz, fase ini menjadi dasar untuk lonjakan agresif di siklus selanjutnya, yang berpotensi memberikan keuntungan signifikan bagi DOGE. Fase akumulasi seperti ini sering kali menjadi pertanda pergerakan naik yang eksplosif, terutama untuk aset dengan dukungan komunitas yang kuat seperti Dogecoin. Hari-hari mendatang akan menjadi penentu bagi DOGE dalam usahanya menembus level resistensi $0,40. Jika DOGE berhasil melakukan breakout, ini dapat memicu rally bullish yang memperkuat posisinya sebagai favorit pasar. Sebaliknya, kegagalan untuk menembus zona ini dapat menyebabkan konsolidasi jangka pendek, yang akan menunda lonjakan yang diantisipasi. Dogecoin Menyiapkan Rally Dogecoin menunjukkan aksi harga bullish yang kuat sejak awal November, melawan volatilitas pasar dan menarik perhatian investor. Meskipun sempat mengalami koreksi, harga DOGE berhasil pulih, menandakan potensi pertumbuhan lebih lanjut di masa depan. Bluntz baru-baru ini membagikan analisis teknis di X (platform media sosial) , yang menunjukkan fase akumulasi pada rasio DOGE/BTC. Menurutnya, rasio ini “masih dalam fase akumulasi,” mengindikasikan bahwa Dogecoin sedang mempersiapkan rally signifikan dalam siklus ini. Bluntz dengan percaya diri menyatakan bahwa tidak ada kemungkinan DOGE gagal melonjak selama bull run kali ini, mencerminkan pandangannya yang optimis terhadap koin meme ini. Meskipun prospek Dogecoin terlihat menjanjikan, risiko tetap ada. Volatilitas adalah karakteristik utama pasar kripto, dan Dogecoin tidak terkecuali. Selain itu, lanskap ekonomi global yang lebih luas juga menambah ketidakpastian, dengan kenaikan suku bunga, inflasi, dan tekanan ekonomi global memengaruhi sentimen investor. Faktor-faktor ini dapat menyebabkan fluktuasi harga yang tajam bagi DOGE. Bagi investor jangka panjang, fase akumulasi Dogecoin saat ini mungkin menjadi peluang untuk masuk ke pasar sebelum breakout potensial terjadi. Namun, pendekatan yang hati-hati dan manajemen risiko tetap sangat penting, terutama mengingat sifat pasar kripto yang tidak terduga serta dinamika ekonomi global. Jika Dogecoin berhasil melewati level resistensi kunci, ini dapat memvalidasi tesis bullish Bluntz dan memperkuat statusnya sebagai salah satu performer terbaik di siklus ini. Harga dalam Konsolidasi Saat ini, Dogecoin diperdagangkan pada $0,38 setelah menghadapi resistensi di level $0,40. Level ini untuk sementara menghentikan momentum kenaikan DOGE, menempatkan harga dalam fase konsolidasi. Fase perdagangan sideways seperti ini bukanlah hal yang langka dan dapat berlangsung selama beberapa hari atau bahkan minggu saat pasar mengumpulkan kekuatan untuk pergerakan berikutnya. Meskipun ada jeda, optimisme tetap tinggi di kalangan investor dan analis. Level $0,43 kini muncul sebagai resistensi kritis bagi DOGE. Jika berhasil melakukan breakout yang bersih di atas level ini, momentum bullish yang diperbarui dapat mendorong Dogecoin ke level tertinggi dalam beberapa tahun terakhir atau bahkan mencetak all-time high baru. Pencapaian ini kemungkinan besar akan menarik perhatian baru dari investor ritel maupun institusi, yang selanjutnya mendukung pergerakan naiknya. Namun, jalur ke depan tidak tanpa tantangan. Sentimen pasar dan tren kripto yang lebih luas akan memainkan peran signifikan dalam menentukan apakah Dogecoin dapat mengumpulkan kekuatan untuk bergerak lebih tinggi. Jika fase konsolidasi disertai dengan peningkatan volume perdagangan dan dukungan pembelian yang kuat, skenario breakout menjadi semakin mungkin terjadi.",Dogecoin,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-06 01:13:18

With Bitcoin and Ethereum continuing to dominate headlines, forward-looking investors are hunting for hidden gems that promise substantial returns. Among these opportunities is Qubetics ($TICS), an ecosystem poised to revolutionise Web3 infrastructure with innovation and unmatched functionality. Alongside industry giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, this best altcoin for exponential returns stands out as a smart pick for savvy investors. 1. Qubetics: The Ultimate Web3 Platform for the Best Altcoin for Exponential Returns Qubetics ($TICS) is redefining the Web3 landscape with its forward-thinking features, particularly its decentralised VPN (dVPN). Unlike centralised VPNs that can track, restrict, or censor user traffic, Qubetics introduces a fully peer-to-peer network. This blockchain-based solution ensures users’ unmatched privacy, security, and freedom globally. The decentralised architecture eliminates any central authority, offering complete censorship resistance and transparency. Using blockchain technology, Qubetics dVPN guarantees secure, anonymous internet access with multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption. Users also benefit through tokenised incentives, as participants providing bandwidth are rewarded with TICS tokens. This dynamic creates an efficient, user-driven marketplace while enhancing accessibility and privacy. Currently in Presale Phase 15, Qubetics is setting the stage for massive gains. With weekly phases bringing a 10% price hike and a final-stage increase of 20%, early adopters can lock in substantial profits. The $TICS token is priced at just $0.0414, with over $8.7M raised, more than 399M tokens sold, and 13,300+ holders already on board. Analysts predict a target of $0.25 per token post-presale, presenting an impressive ROI potential of 503% for investors entering now. Some forecasts even suggest Qubetics could soar to $10–$15 after the mainnet launch, highlighting its status as one of the best altcoins for exponential returns . 2. Bitcoin: The Undisputed King of Crypto Bitcoin needs no introduction. As the original cryptocurrency, it revolutionised digital finance and earned the title of “digital gold.” Bitcoin’s decentralised network and fixed supply of 21 million coins continue to make it the go-to asset for institutional and retail investors. With growing adoption as both a store of value and an inflation hedge, Bitcoin remains the benchmark for stability and trust in the volatile crypto market. Bitcoin made this list because it continues to lead the way in market dominance and institutional confidence. 3. Ethereum: The Foundation of Decentralised Applications Ethereum stands at the heart of decentralised finance (DeFi) and smart contracts. Its robust ecosystem enables developers to build decentralised applications (dApps), NFTs, and protocols that shape the Web3 future. With the recent shift to Ethereum 2.0 and its proof-of-stake consensus, the network now offers greater energy efficiency and scalability. Ethereum’s versatility and functionality fuel innovation across multiple sectors, making it a key player in crypto. Ethereum earned its place here because its infrastructure powers blockchain technology’s most innovative use cases. Conclusion: Best Cryptos for Exponential Returns Are Here Based on the latest research, the best cryptos for exponential returns include Qubetics ($TICS), Bitcoin, and Ethereum. Among these, Qubetics leads the charge with its innovative decentralised VPN service and unmatched presale opportunity. With the presale phase nearing a 10% price hike and an ROI potential of 503%, investors have a rare chance to enter at the ground level before exponential growth.

Trump’s Pet Doge (TRUMDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Pet Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Pet Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Pet Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Pet Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Pet Doge by entering its contract address – 6e6jZxV1zG7GGLF5MoJZf8nY4u17x8dceDatSWiTE573 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-06 02:22:00

With names as quirky as their concepts, these coins have become a cultural phenomenon, captivating Gen Z and Millennials alike. Today, we’re diving into three standout projects: BTFD Coin, Cat in a Dog’s World, and Dogs. These coins are not just about laughs; they’re serious about giving you solid returns. Before we get into the details, let’s rewind to 1973—a year when the global economy experienced a major collapse. What did smart investors do? They bought the dips, turning chaos into opportunity. Sound familiar? Let’s talk about why meme coins could be your golden ticket this week. Best new meme coins to join this week have redefined what it means to invest in crypto. They started as a joke but quickly morphed into legitimate assets with massive communities. The likes of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu paved the way, but now BTFD Coin is setting a new standard. With its P2E (Play-to-Earn) game, referral program, staking rewards, and strong community backing, BTFD Coin isn’t just another coin; it’s a movement. Let’s explore why it’s topping the charts and how it compares to Cat in a Dog’s World and Dogs. BTFD Coin: The Bull’s Charge to Glory BTFD Coin has exploded onto the crypto scene, raising over $4.9 million in its presale. Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, it’s now in Stage 13 of its 16-stage presale, priced at $0.000142. By the time it’s listed at $0.0006, early investors are looking at life-changing gains. To put it into perspective, investing $2,000 at the price of $0.000142 would get you 14.08 million BTFD coins . When the price hits $0.0006 at the end of the presale, your investment would soar to $8,448 . That’s the kind of return you can’t ignore! The coin’s appeal isn’t just its numbers. It’s backed by a robust ecosystem, including a P2E game that keeps players engaged while earning rewards. The referral program adds another layer of excitement, incentivising users to spread the word. And let’s not forget the staking rewards, offering a passive income stream for holders. What truly sets BTFD Coin apart is its community. Over 7,700 Bulls are already on board, creating a buzz that’s hard to ignore. Analysts are predicting big things for BTFD, and with its current momentum, it’s shaping up to be one of the best new meme coins to join this week. Oh, and don’t miss the BIG50 bonus code. Use it on the presale page to snag the bonused price. Simply head to the presale page, connect your wallet, enter the bonus code, and confirm your purchase. It’s as simple as that. Cat in a Dog’s World: The Underdog with Nine Lives Cat in a Dog’s World is the rebel of the meme coin universe. It flips the script by putting a cat at the centre of a dog-dominated market. Its tagline? “A cat that barks louder than dogs.” This project is as quirky as it sounds, but don’t let the humour fool you—it’s got some serious potential. The coin has garnered a dedicated community that thrives on its cheeky branding and unique tokenomics. Cat in a Dog’s World focuses heavily on social engagement, making it a hit among Gen Z. It’s not just about memes; the project plans to launch Cat NFTs and a DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation) to give holders a say in its future direction. Financially, it’s still in its early stages, making it a high-risk, high-reward option. Unlike BTFD Coin, it doesn’t have a P2E game or staking rewards yet, but its roadmap promises some exciting developments. If you’re looking for a project with a rebellious spirit and the potential to disrupt the market, Cat in a Dog’s World might just be the best new meme coin to join this week. Dogs: The OG Meme Coin with a Twist Dogs is a nostalgic nod to the early days of meme coins, but with a modern twist. It’s built on the premise that every dog has its day, and for Dogs, that day is now. With a focus on charity, Dogs aims to give back while making you rich. A portion of every transaction goes to animal shelters, making it a feel-good investment. The project has already made waves with its transparent team and clear roadmap. It’s not just about charity; Dogs also features a staking program and plans to launch a P2E game. However, it’s worth noting that its ROI potential doesn’t quite match BTFD Coin’s explosive numbers. That said, Dogs is a solid pick for those who value community and sustainability. Why Now Is the Time to Invest The 1973 economic collapse taught us a valuable lesson: in times of uncertainty, buying the dips can yield incredible rewards. Meme coins are the modern-day equivalent of that strategy. They’re not just investments; they’re cultural movements with the power to create generational wealth. BTFD Coin’s presale performance is a testament to this. With over 58 billion coins sold and a community that’s growing by the day, it’s a prime example of why meme coins are the best new meme coins to join this week. And don’t forget, the BIG50 bonus code is your ticket to maximising returns. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale Ready to dive in? Here’s how: Go to the Presale Page at https://www.btfd.io/buy-now/. Click “Connect Wallet” and select your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Enter the Bonus Code BIG50 and click “Apply.” Input the amount of $BTFD you want to buy and review the bonus coins.

The Bottom Line Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as the top pick among the best new meme coins to join this week.

From Bitcoin smashing new highs to altcoins carving out unique niches, it’s a whirlwind of opportunity. But for those looking to make smart short-term investments, understanding which coins are hot right now is key. The best coins to invest in for short term are often the ones riding waves of innovation and adoption. Enter Qubetics ($TICS), a revolutionary Layer 1 blockchain that’s turning heads with its focus on real-world asset tokenisation. It’s bringing an entirely new dimension to the blockchain space by making tokenisation accessible to everyone, not just the elite. Let’s explore how Qubetics, along with Polkadot, Ripple, Ethereum, and Solana, are redefining short-term crypto investments. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Democratising Real-World Asset Tokenisation Qubetics is making waves in the crypto community, and its presale numbers speak for themselves. In its 15th stage, the presale has already raised over $8.7 million from more than 13,300 holders. With 399 million tokens sold and a price tag of $0.0414, the presale is nearing a 10% price jump as it moves to the 14th stage this weekend. Investors are catching on quickly to what makes Qubetics unique. At its core, Qubetics is about solving the big issues that have held blockchain back. While other projects focus on single-use cases, Qubetics is creating a broad ecosystem centred on interoperability and real-world applications. It’s not just about holding a token; it’s about owning a piece of the future. Real-World Asset Tokenisation: A Game-Changer Picture this: you’ve always wanted to invest in high-end real estate or art, but those opportunities were reserved for the wealthy. With Qubetics’ tokenisation marketplace, everyday investors can own fractional shares of these assets. A single parent saving for their child’s college tuition could buy a share of a tokenised real estate property. A small business owner could diversify their investments by purchasing fractionalised shares in fine art or vintage cars. Qubetics isn’t just about making these opportunities accessible; it’s about ensuring transparency and security. The marketplace uses blockchain to verify ownership, reducing fraud and eliminating intermediaries. Whether you’re a tech-savvy millennial or someone dipping a toe into crypto for the first time, Qubetics makes it simple. Why did this coin make it to this list? Qubetics is revolutionising the way we think about investments, bringing opportunities that were once exclusive to high-net-worth individuals to the masses. Its presale success and innovative approach make it one of the best coins to invest in for short term. 2. Polkadot (DOT): The Interoperability Leader Polkadot has been busy expanding its ecosystem, and the results are showing. Its parachain auctions have attracted significant interest, enabling new projects to launch on its network. The ability to connect blockchains seamlessly has made Polkadot a favourite for developers and investors alike. Market Performance and Short-Term Potential With DOT trading around $4.80, it’s seen steady growth driven by developer activity and ecosystem expansion. As new parachains go live, the demand for DOT as a staking and governance token is expected to rise, presenting a solid short-term investment opportunity. Why did this coin make it to this list? Polkadot’s focus on interoperability and its thriving developer community position it as a top pick for short-term gains. 3. Ripple (XRP): The Cross-Border Payments Pioneer Ripple continues to dominate the cross-border payments space, and recent developments are only bolstering its position. With its RLUSD stablecoin gaining regulatory approval and partnerships with major financial institutions, XRP’s ecosystem is stronger than ever. Market Performance and Growth XRP is currently trading at $2.40, following a 400% increase in recent weeks. Its use in real-world applications, coupled with regulatory clarity, has made it a favourite for short-term traders looking to capitalise on momentum. Why did this coin make it to this list? Ripple’s resilience and its ability to innovate in a heavily regulated space make it one of the best coins to invest in for short term. 4.

Pepe the Boss (PEPEBOSS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEBOSS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe the Boss can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe the Boss could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe the Boss launched with over $8,500 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe the Boss on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe the Boss by entering its contract address – 5pgsjH712NZ6eaKunsEfZarG9UotHaxvheW5E39a8NFX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEBOSS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-06 03:50:00

The island plans to use these digital cards, which will be linked to NFTs, to provide discounts and travel subsidies to visitors. The island has been trying to leverage crypto-powered growth since 2018 but has faced challenges due to South Korea’s strict regulations on ICOs and NFTs. However, Jeju officials are now pushing for change. As reported by Maeil Kyungja, the initiative is aimed at appealing to the Millennial and Gen Z demographics, encouraging them to explore Jeju and increase the likelihood of return visits. The NFT cards will be issued in the second half of this year, with a pilot program for domestic visitors set to begin later in 2025. Additionally, the region plans to integrate its NFT project with the local blockchain-based stablecoin, Tamna Jeon, which was introduced in 2019 to support the local economy. The stablecoin is already used for rechargeable prepaid cards offering incentives to both merchants and customers. Jeju Island plans to offer domestic tourists digital tourism resident cards, which will provide various benefits such as travel subsidies, memberships, and discounts on local attractions. The travel subsidies will be paid in the island’s local currency. The Jeju Island Governor Oh Young-hoon had previously said, “This year, we are gradually making preparations to focus on digital transformation. The core of all this is Web3. We can apply Web3, including the use of NFTs, to all areas of the government.

According to a recent Bloomberg report , Diggle said in a phone interview that fundraising could begin as soon as the first quarter. His previous firm, Artradis, made a staggering $3 billion during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Today, Diggle sees market risk levels not seen since 2008 and is putting himself in a position to capitalize on coming opportunities in potentially volatile times. The former hedge fund manager rode the turbulence of one of the most turbulent market periods in history to wealth, and he thinks there’s a repeat brewing. Steve Diggle’s former firm is worth nearly $5 billion Making his most significant move since shutting down his former firm, Artradis Fund Management, in March 2011, Steve Diggle is coming back to volatility trading in a big way. In 2008, when Artradis was still in Singapore, the company was nearly worth $5 billion thanks to winnings it made when betting on market crashes and banking problems. However, the firm struggled in the end, as an unprecedented turn in central bank intervention shifted market dynamics. Diggle sees similarities with the pre-crisis ­years, 2005–2007. The number of fault lines is higher, and the chance of something going wrong is way higher,” but risk prices have dropped,” he said. He believes years of easy monetary policy have resulted in a brittle market landscape, but now the market is effective for a sudden wave of volatility.

Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin are gaining momentum, but Rollblock is stealing the spotlight as a rising GambleFi powerhouse. Table of Contents Ethereum tokens being accumulated in vast numbers Solana ETF looks like a lock Dogecoin rises 12% as whales return Rollblock puts power back in the hands of gamers Conclusion 2025 brings the promise of huge gains across the crypto board. Analysts remain unswervingly bullish on the prospects of Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin heading into the new year as these projects look primed to dominate the entire crypto space in the coming months. Now is the time to accumulate before the huge surge expected later this year. Ethereum tokens being accumulated in vast numbers The price of Ethereum has gained 8% in the last 7 days as it now sits above $3.6k. ETH bulls recently made an attempt to break the critical $4k level, but Ethereum sellers stepped in to take profits in this area. It has emerged that Ethereum whales have been accumulating behind the scenes as wallets that hold at least 100,000 tokens now make up more than 57% of the total Ethereum supply. This accumulation could see Ethereum reach $8-10k during 2025. Solana ETF looks like a lock Solana is another promising layer 1 chain that has shown increasing strength in recent days. Solana has been one of the best-performing coins in the crypto top 10 lately, with a 14% rally in the last 7 days sending Solana back above $200, where it currently sits at $216. The odds of a Solana spot ETF are looking better by the day thanks to the incoming crypto-friendly administration and a change of leadership at the SEC. The crypto betting site Polymarket currently has the odds of this being approved in 2025 at around 85%, suggesting that Solana could soon see a dedicated Wall Street fund. This could send Solana flying to $500 within weeks. Dogecoin rises 12% as whales return The price of Dogecoin rose by a whopping 12% in the last 24 hours, bringing the weekly Dogecoin candle to a mighty 21%. Dogecoin is now trading at $0.38, following increased whale activity on-chain. Transactions worth more than $100,000 on the Dogecoin chain are currently valued at over $23 billion. This suggests that Dogecoin whales are bullish on Dogecoin’s prospects looking forward, with many in the space suggesting that Dogecoin to $1 is inevitable and will merely mark the start of a coming monster rally that could take Dogecoin all the way to $10 this cycle.

Rollblock recently celebrated over 40,000 presale registrations , as more than $8 million has poured into this blockchain-backed betting powerhouse. The bullish momentum and community sentiment have been nothing short of staggering in the last few months as Rollblock has staked its claim as a leading force in bringing trust and transparency back to this industry where it rightfully belongs. The Rollblock platform is already fully live and bringing in masses of revenue, as over 7,000 casino games are proving exceptionally popular with its gamers. A sports betting league has also recently launched, creating a chance to place live bets across thousands of international sporting events, from golf to soccer and Formula One racing. The list goes on. The RBLK token is popular for good reason as regular token buybacks will ensure a diminishing supply. Each week the casino will take a portion of its profits to buy up RBLK, of which 60% will be destroyed immediately and the rest allocated to stakers who can earn a generous yield. Conclusion Rollblock will likely outperform the likes of Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin with its exponential growth curve and unrivaled GambleFi offering. Stage 9 RBLK tokens are available at the discount price of $0.0445, but investors should hurry as they are selling out fast. To learn more about Rollblock, visit the website and socials.

As the sector moves into the new year, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse believes this could mark a transformative period for digital assets. In a recent statement, Garlinghouse emphasized the growing momentum within the industry, stating , “The journey is just beginning.” He pointed to the start of the 119th U.S. Congress, which he described as the “most pro-crypto Congress in history.” His remarks underscore the industry’s anticipation of meaningful progress in regulatory clarity during the year ahead. Today, here in the US, we welcomed the 119th Congress—better known as the most pro-crypto Congress in history. The journey is just beginning, but you can’t deny the energy & excitement already building across the industry. Let’s get to work. — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 3, 2025 Anticipation of Regulatory Changes Garlinghouse’s comments come at a time of significant change for the regulatory landscape in the United States. The impending departure of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler and the appointment of a new AI and crypto czar have fueled expectations that 2025 could usher in a new chapter for the crypto sector. Many within the industry view these changes as an opportunity to address long-standing uncertainties around digital assets. The Ripple CEO’s statements echo the sentiment of many stakeholders who believe the groundwork has been laid for substantial advancements. With the U.S. now positioned to adopt clearer regulatory frameworks, the stage is set for increased investment, innovation, and adoption of cryptocurrencies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Performance Reflects Optimism The renewed optimism is mirrored in the performance of major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin recently surged past $98,000, reflecting a strong start to the year. Similarly, XRP , one of the leading digital assets, has risen by over 13% since the beginning of the year. These gains highlight growing investor confidence, supported by the perception of a more stable regulatory environment. Garlinghouse’s call to action—“Let’s get to work”—serves as a rallying point for the crypto community to capitalize on these developments. By fostering collaboration and advocating for clear and consistent policies, industry participants aim to solidify the role of digital assets in the broader financial ecosystem. A Year of Potential As the 119th Congress begins its term, many consider it a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. The Congress is described as the most crypto-friendly legislative body in U.S. history. The Congress is expected to address critical issues such as regulatory clarity, investor protections, and the integration of blockchain technology into traditional financial systems. Garlinghouse’s optimistic outlook aligns with the industry’s collective sentiment that 2025 could be a defining year. By seizing this opportunity, the crypto community aims to advance the development and adoption of digital assets while ensuring compliance with emerging regulations.

Top Analysts Make Predictions On Remittix",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ethereum-eth-chainlink-link-or-remittix-top-analysts-make-predictions-on-remittix/,"The crypto market is brewing with innovation, and with every new cycle, investors monitor projects with unmatched growth potential. As a clear indicator, 2024 ended with Ethereum reclaiming its title as the undisputed king of smart contracts after it rallied above 4,000 on two separate occasions. On the other hand, Chainlink dominated the decentralized oracle space and edged all its holders in green. This time, analysts are shifting their focus to Remittix, a fresh presale token making waves in the PayFi sector. Remittix offers what crypto traders have been craving: fast and seamless cross-border payment and instantaneous FIAT transactions. With this unique use case, Remittix is cementing its stance as the best crypto to buy now amid the proven track records of Ethereum and Chainlink. Why Remittix’s crypto presale is the most promising amid crypto giants With its PayFi solutions, Remittix is fast becoming the next crypto to explode in 2025—and this shouldn’t come as a surprise. Remittix is making its mark in the cross-border payment industry, expected to reach $250 trillion in 2027. It does this by granting users access to a platform that allows seamless cross-border payments. The Remittix platform acts as a bridge that facilitates international payments. With this innovation, users can receive and send 50+ crypto pairs, including ETH and LINK, which they can instantly convert into over 30 fiat currencies. This makes Remittix the perfect platform for businesses looking to begin accepting crypto as a payment method. But it doesn’t end there; Remittix enables its users to easily exchange many cryptocurrencies for any popular fiat currency and transfer the funds to bank accounts globally. This new method of transacting eliminates the time, high charges, and complications characteristic of most cross-border transactions. Ethereum price surge to continue after ETF boom and US Election Aftermath Since the US election, investor confidence in risk assets like Ethereum has surged. This trend is partly fueled by expectations of a more favorable regulatory environment. Although Bitcoin led the surge with its monumental all-time high prices, the price of Ethereum has been climbing steadily. Despite its recent 4% decline on the daily chart, analysts believe Ethereum is among the best crypto to buy now in anticipation of a rally in 2025. They believe the Ethereum price has the potential to surge 37%, with technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and moving averages suggesting strong bullish momentum ahead. Positive developments to fuel the LINK price above $30 The LINK price experienced a shift in Q4 2024 after consolidating within a falling wedge pattern since March. Amid this recovery, Donald Trump’s World Liberty Finance has bought LINK tokens worth over $2.3m due to speculation about the Blackrock partnership. While this trend makes LINK one of the best crypto to buy now, caution still looms, and investors are turning to projects with higher upside potential. Conclusion Ethereum and Chainlink have impressed with their previous market performance. However, this time, analysts are turning heads to Remittix, whose unmatched use case could see it rival crypto giants. Currently, Remittix is available at $0.0185 and is quickly cementing itself as an investors’ best bet for massive gains in 2025 making now the best time to take action before it is too late!

In 2025, this meme coin frenzy is only set to heat up, with new and exciting projects springing to life. While the market may be volatile, savvy investors see it as a golden opportunity to get in on the ground floor of the next big thing.

BTFD Coin (BTFD) BTFD Coin has quickly emerged as one of the most exciting meme coins in the market. Launching with an incredibly low presale price of $0.000004 per coin, BTFD Coin has skyrocketed to a current price of $0.000142 during Stage 13 of its presale. In fact, it raised over $4.9 million in a matter of weeks and has already sold over 62 billion coins. The presale journey isn’t over yet, with 16 stages planned, meaning there’s still a chance to get in early before it hits the exchange at $0.0006. What makes BTFD Coin stand out from the crowd is its exciting features like the Play-to-Earn (P2E) game and staking rewards. The BTFD Play 2 Earn game is designed to give holders a chance to earn rewards while having fun. By participating in the game, players can stake their coins and earn additional tokens, building their portfolios while enjoying the process. The staking feature offers impressive APYs, providing a passive income stream that can really pay off in the long run. Why did this coin make it to this list?

Non-Playable Coin (NPC) Non-Playable Coin (NPC) has carved out a niche for itself by targeting the gaming community. As the name suggests, this coin is all about the world of video games, and it’s got the hype to back it up. NPC aims to bridge the gap between in-game assets and cryptocurrency, allowing players to monetise their gaming experiences. Whether you’re grinding in your favourite RPG or enjoying an intense battle royale, NPC is looking to make your in-game achievements truly valuable. The real draw to NPC is its community-driven model. The coin’s ecosystem encourages users to engage with its network by playing games, staking tokens, and contributing to the development of in-game assets that can be traded for NPC coins. This level of interaction is appealing to gamers who want to earn while they play. Furthermore, with gaming on the rise as a mainstream entertainment avenue, the demand for coins that facilitate in-game economies is only going to increase. Why did this coin make it to this list?

Named after the Japanese city of Osaka, this coin taps into the global fascination with Japanese pop culture and technology. The protocol focuses on integrating blockchain with real-world applications, aiming to create a more inclusive and decentralised economy. One of Osaka Protocol’s most exciting features is its potential for real-world use.

COQ Inu (COQ) COQ Inu is another meme coin that’s gaining traction with its quirky name and lively community. This coin plays on the humour and fun associated with meme coins but also integrates a solid roadmap for growth. COQ Inu has focused on community engagement, offering rewards and incentives for holders who actively participate in the coin’s development. While COQ Inu may seem like just another meme coin at first glance, its team is serious about building something sustainable. The project has plans to launch a series of NFT collaborations and a series of utility-based applications for its token. This approach sets COQ Inu apart from other meme coins that only rely on hype without a clear roadmap for the future. Why did this coin make it to this list? COQ Inu made the list because of its community-first approach and its focus on long-term sustainability. While it’s still in the early stages, its roadmap is filled with exciting initiatives that could drive demand for the coin. If these plans come to fruition, COQ Inu could easily be one of the most promising meme coins of 2025. 5. Cheems (CHEEMS) Cheems has quickly become one of the most well-known meme coins in the crypto world, thanks to its adorable Shiba Inu mascot and playful vibe. Originally a joke based on the Cheems meme, the coin has grown into a full-fledged community with a strong following. What makes Cheems unique is its ability to combine light-hearted fun with serious community building.

While MicroStrategy hints at another significant Bitcoin acquisition as part of its ambitious 21/21 plan, Japan-based Metaplanet is setting its sights on growing its Bitcoin holdings more than fivefold. These moves come amid bullish market predictions that could see Bitcoin's price soar past $200,000. Metaplanet Eyes Massive Bitcoin Expansion Amid Bullish Market Predictions for 2025 Metaplanet , the Japan-based venture capital firm, has announced ambitious plans to significantly expand its Bitcoin holdings in 2025, aiming to more than quintuple its current stash to 10,000 BTC. This bold move comes amid growing optimism in the cryptocurrency market, with analysts projecting Bitcoin could reach or surpass $200,000 by the end of the year. Metaplanet emerged as a major player in the Bitcoin ecosystem in 2024, emulating MicroStrategy’s pioneering Bitcoin investment strategy. Currently, the firm holds 1,762 Bitcoin, worth approximately $173.4 million, accumulated over 19 purchases. These acquisitions have positioned Metaplanet as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder in Asia and the 15th largest globally among publicly listed companies, according to BitcoinTreasuries data . In a Jan. 5 post on X, Simon Gerovich, CEO of Metaplanet, outlined the firm’s vision for 2025, and said that its aim this year is to increase its holdings to 10,000 BTC “by utilizing the most accretive capital market tools available to us.” Metaplanet’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy aligns with the optimistic outlook from prominent asset managers such as VanEck and Bitwise. Both firms forecast Bitcoin could surge to $180,000–$200,000 in 2025, driven by a mix of institutional adoption, increasing scarcity, and favorable geopolitical trends. The potential for a US strategic Bitcoin reserve, possibly under a crypto-friendly Trump administration, could further fuel this growth. Speaking at Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin New Year’s Eve party in Florida, Gerovich suggested such a move could trigger a global domino effect. “Countries around the world will follow,” he said. “Japan is one of those countries where they do look to the US as their big brother, following their footsteps, so if President Trump does adopt it as a strategic reserve, then Japan and many other countries in Asia will do the same.” Metaplanet’s Bitcoin holdings increased significantly in 2024, a year when Bitcoin appreciated by roughly 120%. The firm’s most substantial acquisition came on Dec. 23, when it purchased 619.7 BTC—representing over 35% of its total holdings. This strategic buy coincided with a 27.5% increase in Metaplanet’s share price since it began its Bitcoin investment journey on April 23, with an average purchase price of $77,196 per Bitcoin. To achieve its ambitious 2025 goal, Metaplanet plans to employ a combination of financial instruments, including loans, equity, and convertible bonds. This multi-pronged approach is part of the firm’s commitment to scaling its Bitcoin holdings while maintaining financial flexibility. Adding to the optimism, Metaplanet projected an operating profit for the fiscal year ending Dec. 31, 2024, marking its first profitable year since 2017. Bitcoin’s Role in Japan and Beyond Gerovich is a vocal advocate for Bitcoin’s transformative potential, particularly in Japan, a country with a strong regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. He sees Bitcoin not just as an investment but as a tool to foster innovation and economic resilience. With Japan poised to follow global trends, the potential adoption of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset could further solidify the country’s position as a leader in digital currency innovation. Metaplanet’s ambitious plans to expand its Bitcoin holdings to 10,000 BTC suggest a growing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term value. As the firm leverages innovative financial tools to scale its investments, it also aims to champion Bitcoin adoption in Japan and beyond. With analysts forecasting a historic bull run and potential geopolitical shifts favoring Bitcoin, Metaplanet’s bold strategy could position it as a key player in the next wave of cryptocurrency adoption. MicroStrategy Prepares for Bold Bitcoin Expansion with 21/21 Plan MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor has sparked excitement among Bitcoin enthusiasts once again, hinting at an imminent Bitcoin acquisition in a cryptic post on Jan. 5. Sharing a Bitcoin price chart from the SaylorTracker website, Saylor's comment, ”Something about SaylorTracker.com is not quite right,” suggests that the tech entrepreneur and his company are gearing up for another significant Bitcoin purchase. This subtle clue comes as MicroStrategy aggressively pursues its ambitious 21/21 plan—a groundbreaking initiative to secure $42 billion worth of Bitcoin by issuing $21 billion in equity and $21 billion in fixed-income securities. Saylor’s recent post follows a familiar pattern. On Dec. 29, 2024, he shared the same chart, only for MicroStrategy to announce a purchase of 2,138 BTC at an average price of $97,837 per coin the following day. This purchase brought the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to new heights, reinforcing its position as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally. The company’s consistent Bitcoin accumulation strategy is indicative of its unwavering belief in the cryptocurrency’s potential as a long-term store of value and a hedge against inflation. As part of its 21/21 plan, MicroStrategy aims to amass unprecedented Bitcoin reserves, setting a new standard for corporate cryptocurrency adoption. MicroStrategy’s recent addition to the Nasdaq 100 index, achieved on Dec. 23, 2024, marks a significant milestone. The inclusion of the company in this prestigious index introduces traditional investors to indirect exposure to Bitcoin through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other financial instruments tracking the index. Capitalizing on this momentum, MicroStrategy held a special shareholder meeting to discuss increasing its stock issuance. In a Dec. 23 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company proposed increasing authorized Class A common stock from 330 million to 10.3 billion shares. Additionally, it sought approval to raise authorized preferred shares from 5 million to over 1 billion. On Jan. 4, MicroStrategy also announced plans to issue a $2 billion perpetual preferred stock offering. The offering, designed to attract institutional investors, would hold seniority over Class A common stock in bankruptcy scenarios and take priority in financial distributions during corporate liquidation. The offering is expected to be finalized in Q1 2025, pending shareholder approval. MicroStrategy’s 21/21 plan represents one of the most ambitious cryptocurrency strategies ever undertaken by a publicly listed company. By aligning its financial strategy with Bitcoin’s growth trajectory, the company aims to redefine corporate treasury management while solidifying Bitcoin as a mainstream asset class. The plan’s scale and timing coincide with optimistic predictions for Bitcoin’s price. Analysts foresee Bitcoin surpassing $200,000 in 2025, bolstered by increasing institutional adoption, scarcity-driven price dynamics, and geopolitical trends favoring digital assets. Saylor’s vision goes beyond MicroStrategy’s bottom line. In previous statements, he has floated the idea of a US crypto framework anchored by an $81 trillion Bitcoin reserve plan, positioning Bitcoin as a strategic asset for national economies. MicroStrategy’s Impact on Bitcoin Adoption MicroStrategy’s bold moves have ripple effects far beyond its corporate treasury. The company’s strategy has inspired other firms to consider Bitcoin as a core component of their financial strategies, much like Saylor’s efforts encouraged a wave of institutional adoption in 2020. Moreover, MicroStrategy’s Nasdaq 100 inclusion introduces Bitcoin to a broader audience, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Investors holding ETFs tracking the index indirectly participate in Bitcoin’s performance, further embedding the cryptocurrency in mainstream financial markets. Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy continue to push the boundaries of corporate Bitcoin adoption. From their ambitious 21/21 plan to innovative financing strategies like the perpetual preferred stock offering, the company is not only doubling down on Bitcoin but also reshaping the narrative around corporate treasury management. As the world watches for the next Bitcoin purchase, MicroStrategy’s unwavering conviction serves as a testament to Bitcoin’s transformative potential. If successful, the company’s vision could inspire a new era of Bitcoin-backed corporate strategies, solidifying its legacy as a pioneer in the digital asset revolution.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-06 05:30:00

As reported by BizWatch today, the rebranding is interpreted as a major strategic change. Apart from the name, the focus has changed to investment operations, forming a new entity within Bithumb. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Bithumb rebranded and injected another 1 billion KRW or 6,80,099 USD, bringing the total capital for the subsidiary under 100% ownership of Bithumb to around 2 million dollars. In 2023, previous investors in Bithumb Meta-such as LG CNS, CJ OliveNetworks, and SK Square-have now officially departed, given that the subsidiary did not live up to its expectations from NFT and metaverse projects.

This is in contrast to Bithumb Investment, which mostly engages in external investments. Moreover, Bithumb has historically invested in convertible bond investments in KOSDAQ -listed companies Iwin, Barunson, and T&R Biofab. For the time being, Bithumb Partners is looking to continue overseeing existing short-term stationary investments in addition to potentially extending into a full-fledged strategic or financial investor. There was a common sentiment among industry experts regarding Bithumb Partners, and the intended ‘spinoff’ Bithumb has been reported in the first half of 2023. There was a vision to set up an investment company used for holding operations to manage investments and real estate through leasing. Nevertheless, Bithumb Partners is the brainchild of the previous vision but takes on a more streamlined process than the initial plan. “We restructured Bithumb Meta into Bithumb Partners to streamline operations and focus on managing assets like stocks and bonds, as well as short-term financial investments. Creating a new entity from scratch and liquidating the old one would have been time-intensive.” Bithumb spokesperson. You might also like: South Korea plans to explore crypto ETFs and let firms launch security tokens in 2025 Bithumb’s IPO positioning This development coincides with an announcement made by Bithumb that it intends to undertake an IPO in 2025. Forming an investment-centric subsidiary will likely fall under a wider optimization effort of its corporate structure and financial works toward the planned IPO. Some of them said your company reorganized Bithumb Meta into Bithumb Partners to streamline operations more easily and focus on asset management related to stocks and bonds and short-term financial investments. Creating a new asset from scratch and liquidating the old one would take way too long. This follows in parallel with Bithumb’s proposal and announcement to go for an initial public offering in the United States by 2025. Forming an investment-focused subsidiary forms such a great effort to put corporate structure and operations into order before the IPO itself.

Meanwhile, traders will look at key U.S. economic reports this week for more information on what it means for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. According to a Reuters report , the Chinese yuan, on the other hand, was in the spotlight after weakening past the critical 7.3 per USD mark in the onshore market on Friday. It was the first time in 14 months that the PBOC had worked hard to keep its level flat throughout December. The onshore yuan fell 0.05% by Monday, while the offshore yuan rose 0.15% to 7.3487 per dollar. Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank (NAB), said, “The PBOC seems to have stopped defending the 7.30 level.” He added, “This raises questions about whether they are now letting the dollar-yuan pair move into a higher range, which could impact other Asian currencies, as well as the Australian and New Zealand dollars.” The PBOC set the midpoint rate, at which it trades with banks, ahead of the market’s opening on Monday at 7.1876 yuan per USD, within the 2% range.

This figure increased to 31.61% from 2023 which shows that there are still lingering threats in the cryptos space. This week’s crypto hack report will present the key events of the week, known phishing cases, and a look at the year 2025. 2024’s Surge in Crypto Hacks: $2.36 Billion in Losses As for 2024, crypto was a new favourite among hackers, who began attacking this industry more actively than ever before. CertiK’s annual report showed that there were 760 breaches and as a result led to the industry losing nearly $ 2.36 billion. The attacks also became more frequent and aggressive, even though all types were significantly differed; nonetheless, the phishing attack turned out to be the most numerous and profitable for the cybercriminals because the stolen funds reached $1.05 billion. Phishing; The Most Used Attack Vector Phishing attacks were still the most commonly used tactics in 2024 accounting for 40% of the crypto stolen. With 296 instances of the phishing attack , the average sum lost per case amounted to $2.8 million. This has made phishing, one of the most deadly threats in the crypto space which rose by 328% between 2023 and 2024. While traditional fraud is already a big problem, phishing is even worse because of the non-reversible nature of the crypto transactions. Wazirx and Coindcx: Possible Takeover as Litigations Emerge The CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta has been dropping hints about an acquisition at least in a bid to recover users who had been scammed in the WazirX incident. Statements of Gupta on Twitter show that general security troubles have been present in the Indian crypto sphere since hacks like this have occurred and big personas can have a big impact with their moves. Scammers Turn To YouTube to Scam Minor Thieves Some fake users posing to be innocent expose their wallets containing thousands of dollars on YouTube comments and then they make the victim pay a couple of dollars as a gas fee. This particular scam utilises multi-signature wallets in order to further their fraudulent activities and pull off a theft. A typical case of thieving the thieves. Superchain Ecosystem Twitter Hack: Phishing Links Spread The official Twitter account for the Superchain Ecosystem was compromised, with the hackers spammed with links that were designed to steal users’ information. For the account, Superchain had to regain the account and users were warned not to click the links posted by the hackers. Of course, there have been unprecedented cyber catastrophes that occurred in the year 2024, but the world of cryptocurrencies is changing all the time. We step into the year 2025 with the hope of better security for our cryptos and better space for investments. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Elon Loves MAGA (ELOMAGA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Loves MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Loves MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Loves MAGA launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Loves MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Loves MAGA by entering its contract address – 6mRLPcgWXUBYNfXouCxBoyjFzNjww9HNVFpBJkrqmFeE – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELOMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-06 05:40:27

Investors banking on a year-end boost to their portfolios got nothing but coal this time. U.S. markets made a small comeback on Friday—the S&P 500 rose 1.26%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite surged 1.77%. Not bad, right? Except it actually didn’t matter. These gains barely dented the damage left behind by earlier selloffs. The S&P 500 fell 0.48% for the week, the Dow dropped 0.60%, and the Nasdaq slid 0.51%. The Santa Rally refers to stocks rising during the last five trading days of the year and the first two of the new year. It’s like an annual tradition—only last year, Santa skipped Wall Street, even after a historic performance. Bitcoin rallies a bit, thanks to big money But Bitcoin bulls seem to be coming back. The apex crypto was worth $99,285 at press time, after weeks of whiplash-inducing volatility. After Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $108,850 on December 17, a series of Fed-driven selloffs dragged it down. The central bank made a hawkish rate cut and added to the fire by saying it has no desire to associate with Bitcoin ever. But as the calendar flipped to 2025, traders got optimistic again. Retail investors are piling back in, driving up prices. Analysts have made so many bold predictions. Some say Bitcoin will smash $150,000 by the end of Q2 2025. Some are expecting prices to at least double to $200,000 before the year is over. January Effect: The markets’ second chance With the Santa Rally gone, the January Effect seems primed. Sidney Wachtel, an investment banker, first spotted this anomaly in 1942. He noticed that small-cap stocks tend to outperform in January. Why? Smaller stocks usually see less trading action, but when investors start fresh in the new year, these stocks get a boost. Research backs it up. A 1976 study found that, from 1904 to 1976, January returns averaged 3.5%, compared to just 0.5% for other months. From the mid-1980s to the 2000s, the Russell 2000 Index—your go-to for small-cap performance—averaged a 1.7% gain in January. That’s second only to December. But don’t get too excited. Since 2014, January’s gains have slowed to a measly 0.1%. What’s behind the January Effect? Tax-loss harvesting is one theory. Investors sell losing stocks in December to offset gains, then reinvest in January. Another theory? New Year’s resolutions. People decide to “get their finances in order” and shuffle their portfolios. And then there’s the cash influx. Year-end bonuses mean more money to invest, and a lot of it goes into small-cap stocks. Now stocks and crypto are like dance partners, especially after last year. They practically move together now. When stocks rise, crypto tends to follow. That makes the January Effect a big deal for Bitcoin. But there’s another wildcard: Donald Trump. His inauguration is coming up, and while he has already signaled he’s genuinely pro-crypto, actions speak louder than words. If he fast-tracks crypto-friendly policies in his first 100 days, it could be a game-changer. Markets could explode. On the flip side, if he drags his feet, expect a major correction.

Here’s the Truth!,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-wall-street-secretly-manipulating-bitcoin-for-big-profits-heres-the-truth/,"The post Is Wall Street Secretly Manipulating Bitcoin for Big Profits? Here’s the Truth! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin, the king of cryptocurrencies, is often seen as a symbol of financial freedom. But recent discussions suggest Wall Street might be manipulating its price for their gain. Altcoin Daily recently shared insights on potential market manipulation and upcoming opportunities for Bitcoin. Interestingly, Bitcoin’s bull case this year can be greater than just a Bitcoin stockpile. There is a real possibility that Trump will implement not just a stockpile but also a strategic Bitcoin Reserve where the US starts the process of buying 1 million Bitcoin over the next 5 years. This is what the US Bitcoin Reserve bill spearheaded by Cynthia Lumis would mean for Bitcoin and the US. This tactic aligns with how big players in traditional markets often operate: push prices down to scare off smaller investors, then quietly buy-in. Media’s Role in Shaping Sentiment Mainstream media often highlights Bitcoin’s short-term negatives, like ETF outflows, while downplaying positives, such as BlackRock recommending a 2% Bitcoin allocation. This narrative could discourage retail investors, allowing institutions to quietly accumulate. BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, faces accusations of influencing ETF flows and sentiment to keep prices low for strategic buying. Adding to this, Jim Cramer’s bearish Bitcoin predictions align with claims of market manipulation, especially given his admitted history of influencing markets. Together, these actions fuel speculation about Wall Street’s role in controlling Bitcoin’s price. The U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Rumor Some believe the U.S. might be quietly building a Bitcoin reserve. Advocates like Michael Saylor and Senator Cynthia Lummis have floated this idea, suggesting it could strengthen the dollar and help reduce national debt. With the U.S. already holding over 200,000 Bitcoin from asset seizures, this theory gains some credibility. If true, Wall Street’s alleged manipulation could be part of a larger strategy to position the U.S. as a Bitcoin powerhouse. What This Means for Crypto Wall Street’s actions might seem like bad news for retail investors, but they could signal something big. Institutions are quietly preparing for Bitcoin’s next major move, while the media’s bearish tone might just be noise. For retail investors, the takeaway is clear: don’t let short-term narratives cloud the long-term potential of Bitcoin. With 2025 expected to be a pivotal year, staying informed and ahead of the curve could be the key to capitalizing on Bitcoin’s next big rally.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-06 05:47:46

On Saturday, a trader on crypto exchange Deribit spent over $6 million to purchase the $100,000 strike call options set to expire on March 28, according to data source Amberdata. ""This trade anticipates that new highs for bitcoin will be broken just a few months after Trump officially takes office,"" Amberdata said on X. Traders are also net buyers at the $120,000 strike, indicating strong anticipation of a rally pushing prices above that level. The $120,000 call is the most popular option on Deribit, boasting a notional open interest of $1.52 billion at press time. A call option gives the buyer the right to buy the underlying asset at a specific price later in time. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market, looking to make asymmetric gains from an expected price rally. The renewed interest in the call options comes as BTC looks to regain the $100,000 handle. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency by market value traded above $99,500, marking an 8% recovery from the Dec. 30 low of $91,384, according to data source CoinDesk and TradingView. ""The inauguration and right after will be a prime-time for bullish announcements and policies that could be bullish catalysts for bitcoin to move higher,"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in a weekly newsletter. Regulated cryptocurrency index provider CF Benchmarks voiced a similar opinion while warning that potential delays in policy development, if any, could temper the bullish mood. ""A restructured SEC under procryptocurrency leadership may reduce enforcement risks and foster innovation. These changes, coupled with streamlined compliance requirements, could enhance investor confidence,"" CF Benchmarks said in an annual report shared with CoinDesk. ""We believe that an industry framework will come, however, implementation delays or policy shifts may temper market optimism, creating short-term volatility,"" the firm added. Expectations for pro-crypto regulatory changes have bolstered the crypto market sentiment since Donald Trump won the U.S. election in early November. BTC rose from roughly $70,000 to new lifetime highs above $108,000 weeks after the election. However, the rally has lost steam in the second half of December, likely due to year-end profit-taking and hawkish Fed rate projections.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Bitcoin Options|Trump,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-06 05:51:32

After a brief retracement and correction, the star token has revamped a calculated ascending trend, aiming to surpass the $100K milestone shortly. Meanwhile, the uncertainty over the aftermath of the new president assuming office has lowered the bullish activity within the markets. Moreover, the upcoming FOMC meeting has also added icing to the cake. With the bullish sentiments piling up, will the BTC price sustain above $100K or face another rejection after rising above the levels? The spot ETF accumulation spiked gigantically as the BTC price displayed some momentum. As per the data from Coinglass, the spot BTC ETF witnessed over $900 million in inflows during the last trading day, recording one of the biggest numbers. On the other hand, the USD weakness is anticipated in the coming days, which is believed to fuel the positive momentum for the BTC price rally. What’s next? With the CPI data & Trump’s inauguration , will the price form a new ATH as it did before or face another sell-off? Bitcoin has entered one of the major liquidity zones after rising above $99,000. After nullifying the zones at $99,373 and $99,534, the token is trying hard to validate a rise above the crucial liquidity zone at $99,694.98, where more than $28.78 million in longs have been leveraged. The price retraced slightly after the previous encounters but maintained a consolidated ascending trend. Therefore, a similar price action is expected now that may slightly drag the levels close to $99,500 but trigger a strong rebound to mark the milestone at $100K shortly. The daily chart of BTC prices suggests the price is experiencing some compression due to the drop in volume. As a result, the Bollinger bands have squeezed but the DMI levels have displayed a bullish crossover, with the ADX displaying a bullish divergence. Now that the BTC price has entered the crucial resistance zone between $98,602 and $99,561, a breakout from the zone could push the price above $100K. Meanwhile, the token is yet to test the liquidity zone just above $100K at $100,016 and $100,177, where more than $55 million longs have been leveraged collectively. Therefore, the BTC price could face some liquidations here but as the sentiments are bullish, a quick rebound should be in place. The crypto markets and the Bitcoin price have entered 2025, reportedly assumed to mark the last and most exciting year of the bull run. As a result, the higher targets of the bull run are pretty tough to estimate, as the veterans and the popular analysts believe it to be somewhere above $250K to $300K. Hence, the Bitcoin price appears to be in track, aiming to form a new ATH above $110K anytime this month.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-06 05:52:13

This is a bold move from Japan’s MicroStrategy which started accumulating BTC in May 2024 and already holds over 1,761 BTC on its balance sheet. As a result, the stock price has also skyrocketed more than 2000% on the yearly chart and is currently trading around 3,600 JPY levels. Metaplanet CEO Outlines Ambitious Goals for 2025 Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich has outlined an ambitious goal for this year 2025, looking to take the company’s Bitcoin holdings to more than 10,000 BTC. This would increase its BTC holdings by 5.6x from the current levels. In order to achieve this milestone, the company would be using advanced capital market tools and might follow the MicroStrategy blueprint of fundraising through a mix of debt and equity. Furthermore, Metaplanet CEO stated that the firm will continue to seek innovative opportunities to amplify its impact within Japan as well as the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. In his message on the X platform, Gerovich wrote: “Your belief in our vision fuels our commitment to excellence. Together, we’re not just building a company but driving a movement. Stay tuned—2025 is going to be another monumental year. Here’s to a year of progress, innovation, and success”. Furthermore, the Japanese firm is planning to roll out new initiatives to boost transparency and increase shareholder engagement. Leveraging strategic partnerships, the firm aims to promote Bitcoin adoption both in Japan and on a global scale, added Gerovich. Following Footsteps of MicroStrategy Metaplanet has successfully adopted MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy of accumulating more BTC as part of the company’s reserves and increasing shareholder value. As a result, the Metaplanet stock surged 2000% over the past year. Earlier today, the stock gained another 5% shooting past 3640 JPY following the revelation of 2025’s ambitious plan. With its massive Bitcoin buying in 2024, MicroStrategy’s MSTR stock price outperformed Bitcoin gains by nearly 3x hitting an all-time high of $473 in November. However, it has retraced significantly since then and is currently trading at $330. Market analysts predict that the MicroStrategy stock rally can continue moving into 2025 surging all the way to $500. Besides, Metaplanet’s Simon Gerovich is also betting big on the United States’ official announcement of a Bitcoin reserve plan after Donald Trump takes charge. He wrote: “The U.S. adopting a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve could trigger a global domino effect. As game theory kicks in, nation-states will race to accumulate Bitcoin, knowing the last to act will pay the highest price. Fixed supply. Infinite demand”. Following the cues, other countries like Hong Kong and Germany are also exploring Bitcoin reserve options to deal with global economic uncertainties.

Trump also said he would unleash American energy, which will be made up of tariffs from countries that have taken advantage of the U.S. for years. The president-elect urged the Republicans to unite and quickly deliver the aforesaid victories for the American people. He also implored the Members of Congress to send the Bill to his desk for his signature as soon as possible. Trump seeks to renew Trump Tax Cuts Members of Congress are getting to work on one powerful Bill that will bring our Country back, and make it greater than ever before. We must Secure our Border, Unleash American Energy, and Renew the Trump Tax Cuts, which were the largest in History, but we will make it even… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2025 The president-elect included the renewal of Trump Tax Cuts, which he described as the largest in history. Trump hopes his administration will work towards a tax code that raises more revenues, is more progressive and equitable, and supports investments that make the economy work for everyone. The Bill indicates that the tax system needs to raise more revenue from wealthy people and profitable corporations to offset any tax cuts extended or expanded for those with incomes below $400,000. Trump’s tax cuts include reducing the maximum corporate income tax rate to 21%. The Bill aims to provide a deduction for pass-through income and redesigned international tax rules. The tax cuts also aim to eliminate personal and dependent exemptions and will remove tax on people without adequate health insurance coverage. Trump will also eliminate corporate alternative minimum tax and introduce spending on equipment investment. The tax cuts also increased the standard deduction, the estate tax exemption, and the individual alternative minimum tax exemption. The American politician also disclosed that Bill aims to unleash American energy. He hopes that America’s energy revolution will produce affordable, reliable energy for customers and stable, high-paying jobs for small businesses. Trump believes that he can unlock American energy while dropping U.S. carbon emissions to their lowest level in 25 years. Trump suggests no tax on tips and revenue to be compensated by tariffs The proposal suggests eliminating taxes on tips, meaning service workers would keep the full amount of tips they receive without any portion being taxed. The post highlights that no tax on tips would be compensated by imposing tariffs on countries that have been taking advantage of the U.S. economically. The president-elect disclosed that tariffs increase the cost of imported goods, making them less competitive compared to domestic products. He believes that they can lead to retaliatory tariffs from other countries, potentially increasing the cost of U.S. exports and affecting domestic industries. Trump is confident that tariffs can slow economic growth by disrupting established trade flows and increasing business costs. Trump’s idea aims to increase the take-home pay of tipped workers, potentially boosting their income without increasing their tax burden. The businessman highlighted that the tariffs might protect certain domestic industries by reducing foreign competition. Nevertheless, the president-elect also believes that tariffs can also raise prices for consumers and businesses that rely on imported goods. Kimberly Clausing of the Peterson Institute told CBS MoneyWatch that the biggest impact of higher import tariffs would likely fall on low and middle-income consumers because they spend a larger share of their income on goods and services than wealthier Americans. “If you are an economist, you know right away that tariffs are taxes. If you put a tariff on imported goods, it means they become more expensive, and competitors can raise their prices.” -Kimberly Clausing, Former Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary. The non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics revealed that Trump’s proposal would likely backfire and act as a tax on U.S. consumers. The Institute admitted that Trump’s proposed levy of 60% or more on Chinese imports would cause a typical middle-class household in the U.S. to face an estimated $1,700 a year in additional costs. The American Progress has also crunched the numbers and projects roughly $1,500 per year in extra costs for the typical household. The organization reasoned that companies in the United States that import goods from abroad typically pass the cost of tariffs on American consumers, and domestic manufacturers then often raise their own prices.

Speculation surrounding the case has intensified, with many wondering how it will ultimately play out. Jeremy Hogan, a well-known legal expert, recently suggested that the case might settle in April or May, which could lead to a favorable outcome for XRP holders. However, some have raised questions, asking why a settlement is necessary if the SEC lost the case. Former SEC attorney Marc Fagel provided clarity on the matter, explaining that the SEC did not lose entirely; rather, they won in part and lost in part. Both parties have appealed the portions of the case they were dissatisfied with, as is their legal right. Fagel elaborated that the court ruled in favor of the SEC by agreeing that Ripple had illegally sold over $700 million in unregistered securities, particularly in institutional sales, and imposed a $125 million penalty on Ripple for the violation. Despite this, both Ripple and the SEC are currently in the process of appealing the aspects of the case they lost. This has led to the penalty being put on hold until the appeal process is resolved. Fagel noted that the new SEC administration may decide not to pursue the appeal further, potentially paving the way for a settlement in line with the court’s previous ruling. SEC Under Paul Atkins: President-elect Donald Trump has selected Paul Atkins, a former SEC Commissioner, to become the next chair of the SEC. Atkins, who served as an SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush, will replace the outgoing SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, who is set to depart on January 20, 2025. Experts believe that Atkins is a solid and experienced pick because he understands the importance of regulation and oversight, particularly within the securities market.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-06 06:04:04

Presales are quite long, which means that the first quarter of 2025 is full of opportunities to invest in these meme coins being their launch. A presale is the best time to invest in a token because that’s when the prices are lowest. However, you’re likely to benefit from crypto fanatics like us, who can point you towards the best meme coins . In this article, we’ve compiled a list of the top 6 crypto presales you can consider investing in in the first quarter of 2025. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) With more than $40 million raised in its ongoing presale , $WEPE is all set to be the next 10x token, if not the next 100x meme coin. The biggest reason for its popularity and staggering presale numbers is its community-driven approach. Every WEPE holder gets unique insights into the crypto markets, alongside the same tools that Wall Street traders use to make their bets. This is a huge relief for retail investors who often had a hard time making a profit with the crypto whales controlling the entire market. $WEPE is currently listed at $0.00036642, but the prices will increase in less than 24 hours from now, so this is the lowest you can buy $WEPE for. 2. Flockerz ($FLOCK) FLOCK is a first-of-its-kind vote-to-earn project, where the investors get to decide the future of the project. The platform will roll out a question, for example, asking what exchange FLOCK should be listed on. Then, the users get to vote on it. Even better, regardless of what the ultimate outcome is, every user who votes will get some tokens. What’s more, this meme coin also has a robust NFT-based ecosystem that allows investors to engage in a gamified metaverse and mint, trade, and collect digital birds for fun. $FLOCK presale is ongoing and has already raised over $8.9 million. The presale is in its final stretch with around 16 days to go. So, for anyone interested in investing, this is the right time. Each token is currently available at just $0.0066351. It’s also worth noting that in the first quarter of 2025, once the token is listed, its prices are expected to go up by more than 100%. Some experts are even predicting it to be the next 100x coin. 3. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) As the name suggests, the Best Wallet Token is the native cryptocurrency of Best Wallet, a popular online crypto wallet where you can seamlessly buy, sell, or swap cryptocurrencies. It’s been a great start to the year for both the wallet and the token. The wallet is on its way to claim more than 40% of the non-custodial wallet industry by 2026, and the token just hit the $6.5 million milestone in its presale, which went public in late November 2024 after a $1 million private round. Each $BEST token right now is priced at $0.0235, and investing in it in its presale can set you up for a handsome gain, seeing the token’s high potential. $BEST holders get reduced transaction fees within the Best Wallet ecosystem, higher staking rewards, and the authority to vote on key ecosystem decisions. 4. Catslap ($SLAP) Catslap is a unique token that combines crypto with a fun clicker game. It features an angry cat that likes to slap anyone that gets in its way. The usual victims are Pepe, Gary Gensler, and Kamala Harris. Do note that there are a bunch of other options to choose from as well. Its ‘slap-to-earn’ mechanics have garnered some serious attention, with over two billion total slaps registered at the time of writing. Furthermore, the higher the ‘slapometer,’ the scarcer $SLAP tokens become, which would reduce supply and therefore spike demand. The token went into presale in November 2024 and is still in its first season, meaning its current price of $0.00343712 per token is the cheapest you can get $SLAP for. Speaking of expected growth, by the end of 2025, $SLAP is expected to hit an average price of $0.00877, which is roughly a 166% jump. 5. Race to a Billion ($RACE) Race to a Billion is a unique crypto project that allows users to place predictions on the outcomes of virtual races between meme-inspired characters using $RACE tokens. This is comparatively a smaller project, though, as it has so far raised around $225,000. Users will appreciate that every race outcome and transaction is recorded on the blockchain. This means everyone can verify the results. Currently, the tokens are priced at $0.00827 each and the prices are expected to increase in the next couple of hours, so this is the best time to get in. 6. Lightchain AI ($LCAI) Lightchain AI, or LCAI, is a new crypto project that merges AI and blockchain technologies. It basically rewards users who contribute to AI development without sacrificing network security. The tokens went into presale in 2024 and have managed to raise over $7 million so far. The initial listing price was $0.003, which has now increased to $0.004875. The bull run for this token is expected to last till the final quarter of 2025, with prices potentially hitting $0.05. The biggest reason why we think that LCAI might have considerable growth in 2025 is because the project plans to launch a lot of features. The tenet that will help developers and operators validate token staking is slotted for January. Other goodies, such as an open-source innovation hub and overall ecosystem growth, are also expected this year. Improve Your Crypto Game in 2025 Each of these 6 tokens promises a positive trajectory in the first quarter of 2025, if not for several months thereafter, too. With that said, our top choices are $WEPE and $FLOCK, given their unique offerings, positive market sentiments, and proven presale numbers. However, it’s worth mentioning that crypto investments are subject to market risks, so make sure you do your own research before investing your hard-earned money. Remember to look at the fundamentals first and then the technicals to make sound choices.",Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-06 06:11:56

These releases will provide insights into the nation’s economic performance, influencing market sentiment and investor decisions in various markets, including the cryptocurrency market . Here is a quick purview of what to expect. S&P Global Services PMI The S&P Global US Services PMI index tracks variables such as sales, employment, inventories and prices. It covers sectors including consumer (excluding retail), transport, information, communication, finance, insurance, real estate and business services. In December, 2024, it surged to 58.5 from 56.1, contrary to the expectations that it would drop to 55.7. The index will be released today. A higher-than-expected PMI signals economic strength. If growth leads to tighter monetary policies, it may pressure crypto prices. JOLTs Job Openings The Job Openings and Labour Turnover Survey index evaluates the unfulfilled demand for labour in the US labor market. In September, it dropped from 7.86 million to 7.37 million. In October, it rebounded from to 7.74 million, marketing a sharp growth. This index will be released today. The expectation is that it may drop to a range between 7.69 million to 7.65 million. A drop in job openings may signal economic cooling, potentially reducing the risk of interest rate hikes. This could support crypto as investors shift toward alternative investments during uncertain times. ADP Employment Change The US ADP Employment change index assesses levels of non-farm private employment. The report is prepared jointly by the ADP Research Institute and the Standard Digital Economy Lab. In October, it increased from 159K to 184K. In October, it declined to 146K. The index will be released on Wednesday. The expectation is that it may slip to a range between 143K and 140K. Lower employment growth could indicate a slowing economy, encouraging the Federal Reserve to maintain or ease monetary policies. This might boost crypto as a hedge against traditional market instability. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is Wall Street Secretly Manipulating Bitcoin for Big Profits? Here’s the Truth! , Unemployment Rate The US Unemployment rate index calculates the number of genuine job seekers as a percentage of the labour force. In September, it slightly declined to 4.1% from 4.2%. In October, it remained unchanged. In November, it rebounded to 4.2%. The index will be released on Friday. The expectation is that it may either remain unchanged or grow slightly up to 4.3%. A stable or slightly rising unemployment rate may suggest a slowing economy, potentially leading to less aggressive rate hikes. This could create a favourable environment for crypto as risk appetite grows. In conclusion, this week is pivotal for the US economy, with major macroeconomic releases shaping market sentiment. Additionally, the release of the Fed meeting minutes and eight Fed speaker events will provide further insights into monetary policy directions. Keep an eye on these events for a comprehensive view of the market’s trajectory. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Interestingly, though, their key active whales that hold between 1M-10M LINK have accumulated 3.58M coins (worth $76.9M) in just the past 3 days. 👀 9:31 am · 28 Dec 2024 536 Reply Copy link Read 25 replies The data showed that investors holding 1 million to 10 million of the token purchased another 3.58 million LINK coins (worth approximately $76.9 million). Further details show whales with 100,000 – 1 million tokens also scooped the latest dip. These trends reveal a crucial strategy where investors leverage price crashes to accumulate at discounted prices. That confirms confidence in solid recoveries after bearish moves. Moreover, popular analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that whales continued to purchase Chainlink early in 2025. The dip-pocketed players added more than 1.40 million tokens to their bags in January week 1 Source – X The continued accumulations hint at investor trust in LINK’s long-term performance. Chainlink’s price performance The altcoin has maintained bullish trends in the first week of 2025 and looks ready for more gains. LINK trades at $23.90 at press time, with a $600 daily trading volume highlighting significant bullishness. Chart by Coinmarketcap The latest gains propelled Chainlink past $22.54 – a zone that previously restricted further upswings. Moreover, the alt experiences notable buying activity around the flipped resistance, suggesting renewed buyer interest. The Relative Strength Index of 57.27 suggests balanced sentiments with a bullish edge. Bulls will likely target the next crucial resistance zone around the $24.50 mark. Overcoming this hurdle will likely support more gains towards $26.90 and last month’s high above $30. Nonetheless, losing the $22.54 support zone could catalyze retracements toward $19.16 before sentiments define Chainlink’s trajectory.

Such is the demand that the SOL price reached an all-time high of $263.83 on November 23, 2024. Since hitting an all-time high, SOL price, like several other cryptos, took a nosedive in an enduring bearish market, reaching a low of $175.91 in December. But the SOL price climbed above $210, with an aim for $300. Considering SOL’s bullish nature, many wonder why SOL whales are paying attention to another token. Let’s explore the Solana ecosystem further and examine the latest update influencing SOL price action. SOL Price To Boost Following Solana Security Upgrade Against Quantum Computers Solana has included a new security mechanism in response to concerns that quantum computers may compromise user funds. The goal of the “Solana Winternitz Vault,” a quantum-resistant system that employs sophisticated encryption, is to protect digital assets from the dangers of quantum computing attacks. The current cryptographic techniques safeguarding networks like SOL may be vulnerable to quantum computers. One example is the foundational elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) used in digital wallets. The SOL Winternitz Vault hopes to fix this problem using a signature scheme that creates fresh keys for each transaction. This strategy will make it much more difficult for quantum computers to exploit the system and decipher the secret keys safeguarding SOL users’ cash. SOL’s technique involves generating 32 private key scalars and hashing each one 256 times to generate a safe public key. The vault keeps only the hash of the public key for verification purposes rather than the whole key. To further mitigate risk, it generates fresh keys automatically after every SOL transaction. To simplify, each time a transaction is conducted on SOL, the vault generates a new set of keys, ensuring that the keys exposed during that transaction cannot be utilized in future assaults. The system stores a hash of the public key rather than the whole one, improving security and making verification easier. Despite its significance, not all SOL users must upgrade to the Winternitz Vault. SOL users may only store their money in the vault for quantum security if they request the service. This extra safeguard for SOL wallets is expected to increase the wide adoption of the token and SOL price. SOL ETF Might Become a Reality Soon According to Matthew Sigel, head of research at VanEck, the likelihood of an SOL ETF being authorized in the US in 2025 is strong, surpassing current predictions. Sigel claims that Polymarket’s 77% predictions fall short of this potential. Should the SOL ETF get approved, institutional and individual investors might have much easier access to the SOL coin. If Sigel’s prediction comes true, incorporating SOL into more conventional investment strategies will be a significant step forward. Conclusion With the SOL security upgrade and ETF potential approval, SOL’s price looks set for an all-time high of $300 target at minimum. Yet, Several Solana investors are ramping up Remittix presale, which is understandable considering the hot new crypto potential. Remittix (RTX) is a crypto-to-fiat PayFi using a cutting-edge payment infrastructure that enables the movement of fiat money across international boundaries.

There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $0.3825 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could gain momentum if it clears the $0.3880 and $0.3920 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Holds Support Dogecoin price started a fresh increase from the $0.3120 support, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE was able to surpass the $0.3350 resistance and $0.350. It even cleared the $0.3880 level before there was a downside correction. A low was formed at $0.3750 and the price is now rising. There was a move above the $0.380 resistance. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $0.3825 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair.

Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.380 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.3880 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3986 swing high to the $0.3750 low. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.3920 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.40 level.

Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.3880 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.380 level. The next major support is near the $0.3750 level. The main support sits at $0.3650. If there is a downside break below the $0.3650 support, the price could decline further.

His return is already affecting global financial systems, forcing policymakers from Tokyo to Toronto to rethink their strategies. The year is expected to bring more rate cuts worldwide, but the pace is slowing. Economists predict advanced economies will shave off just 72 basis points in 2025, far less than in 2024. Fed freezes the action as inflation lingers The Federal Reserve isn’t in a rush to hand out more rate cuts. December saw a modest quarter-point reduction, but policymakers are hitting pause for now. Projections for 2025 suggest only an additional half-percentage point cut is on the table, as inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% goal. Chair Jerome Powell is holding firm, saying current monetary policy is tight enough to bring prices under control. Still, some on the committee are skeptical. Trump’s influence isn’t subtle here. His love for low rates and booming stock markets has created friction with the Fed before. In 2025, the gap between U.S. and eurozone rates is expected to widen, and Trump’s administration is likely to criticize the Fed for holding back. Add his tariffs to the mix, and the Fed’s balancing act becomes even trickier. Eurozone sticks to steady cuts and Japan hesitates The European Central Bank (ECB) is moving cautiously but steadily, cutting rates to fight sluggish growth. Policymakers are on track to bring the deposit rate to 2% by mid-year, using small, predictable quarter-point reductions. Calls for larger, more aggressive cuts have been brushed aside. Inflation in the eurozone is behaving oddly though. Headline inflation is expected to meet the ECB’s 2% target this year, but services inflation is still double that, largely due to wage pressures. Private spending is expected to pick up, but the central bank is not ready to declare victory. In Japan, Governor Kazuo Ueda faces a tough call. Inflation has stayed above the 2% target for over two years, and the economy is showing signs of life. A rate hike would help strengthen the yen, but timing is everything. With Trump’s inauguration just days before the Bank of Japan’s January meeting, Ueda might wait until March for more clarity. The yen is already under pressure, and Trump’s trade policies could worsen the situation. Domestically, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s minority government is working on a budget. BOE takes it slow and Canada braces for impact The Bank of England (BOE) isn’t in a rush either. Governor Andrew Bailey is holding firm on a “once-a-quarter” pace for rate cuts, despite rising domestic inflation and wage growth surprises. Markets expect another cut in February, but of course more will depend on the Labour government’s budget and global trade developments. Trump’s policies are a big threat here too. Renewed trade tensions could hurt the UK’s fragile recovery, forcing the BOE to rethink its gradualist approach. Meanwhile, Canada’s central bank is playing defense. After two big cuts in 2024, the Bank of Canada is now slowing down, focusing on fine-tuning its approach. Inflation is stable near the 2% target, but economic growth remains weak, weighed down by sluggish business investment. Trump’s proposed 25% levy on Canadian goods could devastate the economy. The bank’s governor Tiff Macklem called the tariffs “a major uncertainty” that could already be chilling investment. China pivots and Russia keeps its cool China is shifting gears. For the first time in 14 years, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) is adopting a “moderately loose” monetary policy. Officials have promised rate cuts and lower reserve requirements for banks to counteract looming headwinds from Trump’s potential trade war. But the PBOC’s options are limited. Rampant yuan depreciation and narrowing bank profit margins are serious concerns. Trump’s aggressive trade stance could push China into a corner, forcing policymakers to act carefully to avoid more economic instability. The Bank of Russia is an outlier. It held rates at a sky-high 21% in December, despite accelerating inflation. Governor Elvira Nabiullina defended the decision, citing tighter-than-expected monetary conditions. Analysts had expected a hike, but the bank chose to wait. Persistent inflation tied to Russia’s war in Ukraine has forced the central bank to delay its 4% target to 2026. While Trump looks determined to maintain his friendship with Russia’s president Vladimir Putin, he has also threatened 100% tariffs on any country that ditches USD, something Putin is really into.

Reportedly, with its launch of a tokenized GPU marketplace for AI computing, this altcoin has gained significant attention from the crypto space. Considering the present market statistics, will Injective Price maintain its bullish streak and outperform top altcoins in terms of gains this week? In this article, we bring you the short-term market analysis, technical sentiments, and possible Injective (INJ) token price targets. INJ Price Soars Over 37% in 6 Days! Following the launch of Injective’s INJ 3.0 proposal, its native token has experienced a significant jump in its valuation. Notably, the altcoin has jumped ~12% in 24 hours and 37.36% this year. This makes it one of the best-performing altcoins. TradingView: INJ/USDT Moreover, with a consecutive inflow for 6 days, the Injective token is currently valued at $26.152 with a daily trading volume of $227.52 million, a change of +108.23%. With a market capitalization of $2.56 billion, this altcoin has secured the 55th position in the global crypto list. Injective Technical Sentiments The Relative Strength Index (RSI) successfully retests its oversold range in the daily time frame. This has resulted in it recording a sharp rise toward its overbought range with its average trendline experiencing a positive crossover. Further, the EMA 50/200-day shows a Golden Cross in the Injective price chart. This suggests a bullish outlook for the altcoin during the upcoming time. How High Will INJ Price Go? Suppose, the bullish sentiment sustains, under such a situation the Injective coin price will retest its $27 mark. Further, if the momentum is intact, this altcoin could reach its important resistance level of $32 this week. On the flip side, if a trend reversal occurs, the INJ token may retest its immediate support level of $22.80. However, if the bearish sentiment intensifies at that point, this could result in it plunging toward its low of $20. Planning on stacking this undervalued altcoin before the altcoin season kickstarts?

Oil prices skyrocketed, inflation spiralled, and stock markets plummeted. It was chaos. But for investors willing to navigate the storm, it also presented golden opportunities —buying the dips proved transformative for those who played it smart. Fast forward to today, history is echoing. This time, the chaos isn’t just in traditional markets but also within crypto, specifically meme coins. And leading this revolution is BTFD Coin, standing tall alongside competitors like Neiro and Osaka Protocol. Meme coins have been the wildcards of the crypto universe, captivating Gen Z and Millennials with their quirky charm and massive potential. From Dogecoin to Shiba Inu, these coins have shifted from being jokes to legitimate investment opportunities. But BTFD Coin is rewriting the rulebook. With its innovative Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, lucrative referral program, and robust staking rewards, it’s becoming more than just a meme—it’s a movement. Let’s dive into how BTFD stacks up against its competition . BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution We’ve Been Waiting For BTFD Coin is smashing expectations, making waves as one of the Best New Meme Coins to Join in December 2024 . This isn’t just hype. With over $4.9 million raised in its presale so far, BTFD has proven it’s here to dominate. Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, it’s now in Stage 13, priced at $0.000142—a staggering 837.5% ROI for early investors. When the presale wraps up, analysts predict a listing price of $0.0006, making this a golden ticket for savvy buyers. Why the buzz? BTFD isn’t just another meme coin. It’s backed by tangible value. 1. BTFD Coin has launched the full version of its play-to-earn (P2E) game, enabling users to play and earn $BTFD tokens. The project also offers a referral program and staking rewards, establishing a multi-faceted ecosystem for long-term growth. Now, let’s talk numbers. Imagine you invested $20,000 in Stage 13 when BTFD was priced at $0.000142. By the time it hits $0.0006, you’d be sitting on a cool $187,500—yes, that’s life-changing money. And don’t forget to use the BIG50 bonus code during the presale. This code slashes the price, making an already irresistible investment even sweeter. Early bird gets the worm. Check out the presale page and become part of the movement shaking up the meme coin scene. Boost your coin haul by 50% with the BIG50 bonus code. Neiro: A Futuristic Vision, but Can It Compete? Neiro is another contender vying for a spot among the Best New Meme Coins to Join in December 2024 , but it’s a different beast altogether. While BTFD rides on community strength and P2E innovation, Neiro takes a high-tech approach. Built on a cutting-edge AI-driven blockchain, Neiro’s aim is to merge decentralisation with advanced data analytics. Sure, that sounds fancy, but does it excite meme coin lovers? Unlike BTFD, Neiro lacks the cultural and social appeal meme coins thrive on. It’s more about tech-savvy investors than the everyday Aussie looking to make a splash in crypto. And while Neiro’s AI-powered ecosystem might revolutionise some industries, it doesn’t have the same pull as BTFD’s P2E game or community rewards. Financially, Neiro’s presale performance has been solid, raising $2.8 million in two months. But compared to BTFD’s $4.44 million within the first month, it’s clear who’s leading the pack. Neiro’s token price is climbing steadily, but without the same explosive ROI that BTFD offers, it feels more like a slow burn than a rocket ship. Osaka Protocol: Big Promises, Little Delivery Osaka Protocol entered the meme coin arena with a bang, branding itself as the future of decentralised finance and gaming. But let’s cut to the chase—hype isn’t everything. While Osaka’s focus on metaverse integration sounds intriguing, its execution has been underwhelming. Where Osaka stumbles, BTFD Coin soars. Osaka Protocol’s presale raised just over $1.5 million in three months—a number that pales in comparison to BTFD’s meteoric rise. And with no clear timeline for product launches, many investors are left scratching their heads, wondering if Osaka can live up to its promises. The coin’s current price is $0.000021, and while that might seem enticing, its lack of momentum is concerning. BTFD, on the other hand, is powering through its presale stages with no signs of slowing down. Osaka might have the bells and whistles, but BTFD has the substance, community backing, and ROI that investors crave. Why Buy the Dips: Lessons from 1973 If there’s one thing the 1973 economic collapse taught us, it’s that chaos breeds opportunity. Those who bought assets when markets crashed reaped massive rewards when stability returned. The same principle applies today, especially in crypto. Meme coins like BTFD, Neiro, and Osaka Protocol are volatile, sure, but they’re also where the big bucks are made. The trick is to spot potential during the presale phase, where prices are low and ROI is sky-high. And with BTFD’s presale surging past $4 million, it’s clear which coin is the standout choice. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale Ready to get in on the action? Here’s how: Visit the BTFD presale page . Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.). Enter the code BIG50 in the bonus field and click “Apply”. Input the amount of $BTFD you want to purchase and review the discounted price. Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Bottom Lines Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as the top choice among the Best New Meme Coins to Join in December 2024 . Its presale success, innovative features, and community-driven approach make it a no-brainer for investors looking to multiply their money. While Neiro and Osaka Protocol have their merits, neither comes close to matching BTFD’s explosive growth and potential. Don’t miss your chance to ride the wave .

Furthermore, with the support of the HTX DAO, the platform’s decentralized ecosystem continues to grow steadily. The goal of “The People’s Exchange” is becoming increasingly defined, reinforcing its leadership in the industry. ● Confidence Journey: Rebuilding User Trust In December 2024, HTX launched the “Confidence Journey” campaign across four cities, to reconnect with users and rebuild trust. During this journey, HTX engaged in open dialogues with the DOGE community, traditional finance players, and emerging venture capital groups, discussing both opportunities and challenges within the blockchain industry. ● Safety First: Multifaceted Protection of User Assets In the face of various security threats in the crypto space, HTX proactively implemented robust security measures, including: 1. HTX has partnered with global leading security companies such as Fireblocks and Cobo to conduct comprehensive audits of every chain and product on the platform, ensuring the utmost security of user assets. 2. The exchange has published the Merkle Tree-based Proof of Reserves (PoR) for 12 consecutive months in 2024, maintaining a reserve ratio consistently exceeding 100%. It has also introduced policies such as the futures security deposit and anti-theft mechanisms, guaranteeing 100% compensation for any fund losses attributable to platform-related issues. ● Tech-Driven Product Innovation: Leading Industry Trends In 2024, driven by technological innovation, HTX launched a series of industry-leading products, including four major mining-related features. In February 2024, Liquid Restaking was introduced, improving users’ asset management efficiency while maintaining strong security. This feature was later upgraded to SmartEarn, enabling users to earn a 6% annual percentage yield (APY) on the assets in their Futures account, regardless of whether they are holding a position or not. There are no entry requirement and no lock-up period. Launched in November 2024, “Borrow & Earn” centers on USDT flexible loans. This feature empowers users to effortlessly share in the platform’s growth through regular borrowing, eliminating the need for complex operations. In addition, “Trade to Earn” and “Earn with Pending Orders” incentivize user participation through subsidies, boosting platform liquidity while creating a mutually beneficial outcome for both users and the platform. Notably, HTX’s collaborative ecological project, SunPump, swiftly gained traction upon its launch, igniting a meme coin frenzy. ● In-Depth Research: Seizing Market Opportunities As @HTX_Molly mentioned in the livestream, HTX boasts a dedicated investment research team, providing users with precise market analysis throughout the year. For example, HTX was one of the first exchanges in the industry to predict that BTC would reach $100,000 in 2024. By strategically positioning itself early in the Base and TON-related ecosystems, the platform successfully capitalized on market opportunities. ● Curating Quality Assets: Driving Wealth Creation HTX listed a total of 218 high-quality assets throughout the year, covering popular sectors such as DePIN, RWA, meme coins, and more, with 171 being pioneering offerings on the platform. @HTX_Molly emphasized that moving forward, HTX will continue to optimize its listing strategy, prioritizing top-tier assets and adhering to the “strict selection by Justin Sun” principle. Meanwhile, the platform will focus on community engagement, listen to user feedback, and strive to establish itself as “The People’s Exchange,” solidifying its position as the “go-to platform for high-quality assets.” Looking Ahead to 2025: Building the People’s Exchange and Expanding Global Reach Based on @HTX_Molly’s analysis, 2025 is poised to be a pivotal year for the crypto industry. It is anticipated to witness accelerated growth, continuous technological advancements, and increased adoption of innovations, presenting unprecedented opportunities for all industry participants. As a leading force in the crypto industry, HTX will concentrate on the following key areas: 1. “The People’s Exchange”: Accelerating the realization of “the People’s Exchange” goal in 2025, by promoting community governance and the construction of the DAO model through the HTX DAO forum and the regularly updated governance committees. 2. Global Expansion: Expanding HTX’s global reach with a particular focus on the CIS region, while enhancing brand visibility through comprehensive, multi-faceted campaigns and exploring new opportunities for business development and user growth. 3. AI + Crypto: Diving into the AI + Crypto frontier, for example, conceptual AI applications, memes, and the combination of AI agents with intent and smart contracts. 4. $HTX: Gradually Refining the $HTX economic and community governance models, offering long-term empowerment to $HTX and preparing for its future explosive growth.

Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President rallied over 42 percent in the past 24 hours to trade about $3.58 at the time of this writing. As a result, the small-cap altcoin , with a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of about $163 million and a 24-hour average traded volume of around $53 million, has pumped more than 124 percent in the past week. Factors Influencing MAGA’s Rally The Ethereum-based memecoin, focused on charity to US veterans and children, has attracted significant attention from whale investors. According to on-chain data analysis, 52.40 percent of MAGA token holders are whale investors, despite the majority encompassing cruisers. The notable rally of MAGA in the past 24 hours is heavily influenced by the upcoming inauguration of US President Donald Trump. As the first pro-crypto US President, heavy speculation on his impact on the ongoing crypto bull market is visible. According to Ripple Labs CEO brad garlinghouse brad garlinghouse Brad Garlinghouse is the CEO of the financial technology company Ripple Labs, he is an extremely popular name across the global crypto landscape. He has previously served as the CEO of Hightail, a file-sharing service, and is also an active angel investor.

Moreover, more institutional investors have gained significant confidence in the crypto industry, as shown by the major cash inflows to digital assets investment products.

However, the memecoin must consistently close above the daily falling logarithmic trend to confirm a successful bullish breakout. In case of a failed bullish breakout and the memecoin continues in the macro falling trend, the support level above $1.32 will likely hold until the buyers gain control. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

WLD and DOT have shot up 26.25% and 88% in the last 90 days. Crypto Altcoin Season Index is valued at 55, in favor of altcoins. Altcoin whale activity is on the rise as whales increase their long positions in assets: Worldcoin (WLD), Polkadot (DOT), Arkham (ARKM), COTI (COTI), DOGS (DOGS), and My Neighbor Alice (ALICE). This raises the likelihood of volatility, especially when these positions are closed, for smaller investors. Understanding the Impact of Whale Positions Large investors, or “whales,” can significantly influence the price of altcoins. Their substantial holdings give them the power to trigger price swings, especially in less liquid markets. When whales open or close positions, it can create volatility and impact other traders.

Notably, the coin’s marketing lead, Lucie recently revealed that the token launch is set to take place just 8 days ahead. In turn, market participants are now immensely enthusiastic about the overall performance of SHIB in the coming days. Shiba Inu Community Discloses TREAT Token Launch Date A significant buzz across the Shiba Inu community has prevailed as the week kicks off, primarily as renowned community members spotlighted the TREAT token launch date. According to an X post by Lucie as of January 6, the upcoming token launch is set to occur on January 14. This statement has sparked noteworthy market optimism surrounding the renowned dog-themed meme token’s ecosystem. Notably, Shytoshi Kusama previously confirmed the TREAT token launch this month, as reported by CoinGape. Following the ‘SHIB: The Metaverse’ launch recently, this looming development has added optimism to the leading dog-themed token ‘s endeavors. However, flagging the upcoming launch, Kusama also warned against potential scams. Overall, the community members have unveiled the launch date, reverberating substantial optimism among traders and investors globally. Also, the upcoming token is also much-touted to be a revolutionary endeavor for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. As a result, market participants are also bullish, anticipating gains in SHIB price. What’s Ahead For SHIB? At the time of reporting, SHIB price traded at $0.00002409, down marginally by 0.22%. Its 24-hour low and high were 0.00002346 and $0.00002424, respectively. Despite the volatile intraday movement, market watchers remain optimistic about future movements in light of recent developments and the TREAT token launch. Notably, despite the slump in price, CoinGlass data showed that SHIB Futures Open Interest rose over 3% today. Simultaneously, a recent Shiba Inu coin price analysis by CoinGape revealed that the coin eyes an extended consolidation ahead. This uncertain prediction comes against the backdrop of recent market technicals and whale movements. Nevertheless, traders and investors are extensively eyeing the coin for further price action shifts amid recent ecosystem developments. In addition, the recent shifting focus toward the top meme coins has further fueled speculations over a potential rally ahead.

But now, Rollblock is stepping in as a strong competitor. It’s grabbing attention because it offers cool casino games and shares profits with users. While Pepe and Shiba Inu have lots of fans and are doing well, Rollblock’s unique features might make it even better. Why Rollblock Is The Best Crypto Presale Of 2024 Rollblock is a GambleFi project aiming for massive 100x growth by 2025. It’s using blockchain to transform online gambling. Rollblock offers a DeFi Casino packed with over 7,000 AI-powered games in its exciting GambleFi ecosystem. To make things even better, Rollblock has added sports betting to its ecosystem , letting users bet on major sports events with crypto. This new feature has already drawn in thousands of new users eager to join the action. Rollblock is different from regular gambling platforms because it uses Ethereum-based encryption to keep games secure and fair. All transactions are stored on the blockchain, ensuring your data stays safe and protected from third parties. On top of that, Rollblock offers a revenue-sharing model that lets users earn weekly passive income. Each week, Rollblock uses up to 30% of its revenue to buy back RBLK tokens. Of those, 60% are burned forever, reducing the supply, while the rest supports the RBLK staking community. This has drawn huge interest from investors, especially with Rollblock’s operations expanding month on month – seeing nearly $2M in bets wagered last month in December. Recently, Rollblock hit a major milestone by registering with the Anjouan Gaming Authority. This approval means Rollblock can operate in most international markets. Anjouan is known for its strict rules, so this registration is a big step for Rollblock’s global expansion. Analysts Predict Pepe (PEPE) Could Multiply Its Price 5x In 2025 Pepe became one of the top-performing tokens of 2024, with a huge price surge that grabbed a lot of market attention. Right now, Pepe’s price is $0.00002063, which is down 2.57% from yesterday. Despite this drop, analysts believe Pepe could grow 5-10x in January after Elon Musk changed his profile picture to a Pepe meme last week. CoinCodex analysts predict the price could reach $0.0001, but this will depend on whether Pepe can keep up its momentum after the current market hype fades. Shiba Inu Whale Activity Spikes Shiba Inu is now priced at $0.00002376 after a 3.62% drop today. However, its RSI has moved into the oversold zone on the one-day chart, hinting at a potential trend reversal. If bullish predictions hold true, Shiba Inu could reach $0.00005297 by the end of January 2025. This optimistic outlook is backed by a major increase in Shiba Inu’s burn rate, which surged nearly 300% in the last 24 hours, with 11.8 million tokens burned. Additionally, Shiba Inu has announced plans for a dedicated SHIB Marketplace to support decentralized commerce. This development is expected to increase demand for peer-to-peer transactions within the ecosystem. Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Nearing Completion Fast With Pepe and Shiba Inu facing recent declines, smart traders are looking for new investment opportunities to diversify for 2025. Rollblock’s GameFi project has emerged as a top choice, raising over $8 million in record time during Q4’s bull market. Now in its last couple of presale stages, Rollblock is seeing huge demand, thanks to its potential for 1,800% growth by 2026 . The token is currently priced at $0.0445 in stage nine, but with its rapid success and ongoing developments, prices are expected to climb quickly.

According to local media, Maeil Kyungjae, the popular South Korean tourist destination, will introduce NFT-based digital tourism resident cards in the second half of 2025. The cards, powered by an unspecified blockchain, will reportedly offer tourists exclusive benefits such as travel subsidies, membership perks, and discounts at local attractions. Jeju Island has a rich history of embracing blockchain and cryptocurrency innovations to stimulate economic growth and establish itself as a web3 hub. In 2019, the island launched the Blockchain Hub City Development Research Service, aiming to explore advanced blockchain applications. By 2021, it had expanded its initiatives across the public sector in areas such as traffic management systems and VAT refunds for foreign tourists. In 2020, Jeju initiated efforts to become a cashless international city by introducing Tamna Jeon, a regional digital currency, and expanded these efforts in 2024 with plans to integrate cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Adding to the initiatives, Tamna Jeon will be used for travel subsidies through the new tourism card in a bid to stimulate local spending and support economic activity within Jeju Island. Meanwhile, tourists using the NFT-based tourism card will be able to document their travel experiences, including visit locations, time, photos, and videos, on the underlying blockchain.

The development comes amid a broader push to adopt blockchain and cryptocurrencies across South Korea. The nation has been actively investing in blockchain technology to enhance both the public and private sectors, complemented by a crypto-savvy population . On Feb. 29, 2024, web3 firm Dispread partnered with Ethereum layer 2 Arbitrum to foster the local blockchain developer ecosystem. Subsequently, in June, the Ministry of Science and ICT, along with the Korea Internet & Security Agency, announced a 20 billion won (approximately $14.5 million) investment in blockchain support projects. In 2023, Busan, the second-largest city in South Korea, disclosed plans to become a leading blockchain city by developing a public blockchain network compatible with major platforms like Ethereum and Cosmos.

Cardano’s steady rise faces a fresh challenge as Lightchain AI gains momentum with its AI-driven blockchain solutions. Table of Contents Cardano’s strengths and hurdles moving forward Lightchain AI rising challenger What to watch for in January 2025 Cardano (ADA) has delivered impressive returns in 2024, rising 77% despite facing market fluctuations. Its commitment to sustainable growth and technological development has solidified its position as one of the leading blockchain platforms. However, as the market looks toward 2025, emerging competitors like Lightchain AI are gaining traction with unique offerings that challenge Cardano’s dominance. With both projects set for critical developments, January 2025 could mark a turning point for their respective trajectories. Cardano’s strengths and hurdles moving forward Cardano has built its name by using a careful and study-focused way to grow, putting importance on strict research and growth. In 2024, it kept growing its system by pushing ahead with its shared finance (DeFi) apps and drawing in builders through its impro͏ved framework. These steps have helped strengthen its place in the blockchain field and raised user interest. Still, problems stay. Cardano has met disapproval for the slow speed of its growth and the need for faster changes to keep its edge. As new platforms with better skills come into the market, Cardano’s skill to pull in builders and grow its system will be key to its future wins. Looking toward 2025; backers are especially keen on how it can create real partnerships and show clear results from what it comes up with.

Its presale success, raising over $7 million at a price of $0.004 per token, highlights the growing confidence in its vision. Lightchain AI stands apart by addressing gaps in traditional blockchain systems, offering smart solutions designed to handle complex computational tasks and support decentralized collaboration. The platform’s appeal lies in its commitment to fostering an ecosystem of developers and enterprises that can leverage its tools to build next-generation applications. Lightchain AI’s roadmap outlines ambitious milestones, including the launch of its mainnet and initiatives aimed at creating robust partnerships. These plans indicate a clear strategy for achieving rapid growth, potentially positioning it as a leader in decentralized intelligence. What to watch for in January 2025 As 2025 begins, both Cardano and Lightchain AI are set to play pivotal roles in shaping the blockchain landscape. For Cardano, the focus will be on accelerating its development timeline and strengthening its DeFi ecosystem. Any major announcements or partnerships could serve as catalysts for renewed investor interest, bolstering ADA’s price and market position. For Lightchain AI, January 2025 represents a critical period for transitioning from presale momentum to real-world adoption. The success of its upcoming mainnet launch and ability to onboard developers will be key factors in determining its trajectory. If executed effectively, Lightchain AI could establish itself as a serious contender, offering a unique blend of innovation and accessibility that appeals to both institutional and retail investors.

He added that the team was confident in building the AGI superintelligent tool that surpasses all human thinking and data processing capabilities. Altman claimed that his team believed in the possibility of building AGI when OpenAI started. He, however, stated that there were still many unknowns and that much had yet to be understood during the early stages of this novel technology. Altman said he was transfixed by the idea that OpenAI would develop AGI when he became CEO in 2019, according to a Bloomberg interview report. He asserted that OpenAI’s mission was to ensure that AGI benefited all of humanity, claiming that the technology outperformed humans in almost all areas of intelligence. Altman claims AGI will hit the workforce in 2025 BREAKING: OpenAI's Sam Altman writes that the company has discovered ""how to build AGI"" and that this year ""the first AI agents"" will likely start joining companies to ""materially change the output of companies."" pic.twitter.com/Q8EdXQyH63 — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) January 6, 2025 The OpenAI CEO said in a Sunday blog post that his company was turning its attention to superintelligence because it had discovered how to build AGI. He said the product would start impacting the world this year when the first AI agents join the workforce and materially change company outputs. OpenAI believes that developing and putting AGI in the hands of people in 2025 will lead to greater and more distributed outcomes across all industries. Altman said OpenAI was turning to superintelligence in the ‘true sense of the word,’ saying that the team already loved their product that was ready for a glorious future. He added that with superintelligence, the world could massively accelerate scientific innovation and discovery well beyond what humans could achieve on their own. Altman emphasized that people would be able to see and understand his team’s vision in a few years, although it currently sounded like science fiction and crazy talk. He claimed that AGI would, in theory, dramatically outperform humans at nearly everything. Strategic recruitment forms the foundation of OpenAI’s success According to Altman, one of the strengths of the original OpenAI team was recruiting top AI researchers. The billionaire CEO said the people he initially approached about building AGI were afraid to talk to him. Some even feared ruining their careers, but they mostly urged him to talk to one guy, Ilya. He disclosed that his pitch was simple: ” Come build AGI.” Altman said this outlandish pitch was really powerful since it filtered out 99% of the world to get the talented original thinkers. It was successful in pushing out all the senior experts in the field, leaving only the ‘ragtag’ young talents that were good to start with. Altman said most of the team members were working full time on the project ‘doing their own things’ before everyone settled in their roles. The OpenAI co-founder said the team’s ambitions were high and believed their work would benefit society in extraordinary ways. He pointed out that Ilya had articulated how the team would build AGI during their first dinner meeting. Altman was, however, quick to mention the difficulty of assembling his team. He said it was not easy convincing people to join his team to do what nobody else was doing, which narrowed his set of talents to a very small group. Altman expressed his excitement for getting the team to work together in what he called the ‘band of brothers approach.’ He further claimed he was extremely lucky to get his team together, calling it a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Last week, centralized exchanges recorded a hefty net inflow of $227.21 million in SOL, the token powering Solana's smart contract blockchain, marking the highest influx since the third week of March, according to Coinglass . Back then, exchanges saw a net inflow of over $300 million in SOL. Interestingly, that moment coincided with SOL's the-then price rally peaking near $200 and paving the way for a seven-month range play between $120 and $200. A large movement of coins to exchanges indicates that holders may be gearing up to either sell their coins or put those at work in derivatives trading or DeFi strategies. The latest inflow, thus, clouds the positive technical outlook that suggests prices could re-visit the November high of over $260, having recently defended key support in a bullish ""throwback"" pattern .

The TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the $XRP 4-hour chart, anticipating a price rebound! pic.twitter.com/QitMbED2DA — Ali (@ali_charts) January 5, 2025 Previously, the same analyst warned that XRP could drop toward $2, which might be followed by another impressive rally that could propel the asset to as high as $11. While that eventual price target sounds a bit far-fetched now, the TD Sequential has already showcased several proper buying opportunities in the past few weeks. During the late December broader market crash, it flashed green for BTC when its price struggled below $95,000. Although the largest cryptocurrency dipped hard a week later, it ultimately bounced off and now sits above $99,000, marking a 4.5% increase since then. Its success is even more profound for DOGE. It presented a ‘buy signal’ on December 24, when the asset’s price dumped to $0.312. Since then, the OG meme coin has skyrocketed by more than 22% and now sits above $0.38. It has been more modest when predicting future gains for SHIB. It flashed again on December 24 when the second-largest meme coin traded at $0.000023, but it has forecasted only a minor 3.8% increase since then, with SHIB now standing close to $0.000024.

However experts are now pointing to this promising $0.07 altcoin for maximizing gains. Read on to find out what’s in store for XRP and Ethena and why the said altcoin should be your top choice. XRP: A Historical Powerhouse With Modest Upside It’s no surprise that XRP is still remaining as a top 10 crypto in the market. First launched in 2012 as a means of facilitating cross border payments, it has now become one of the most well-known cryptocurrencies. XRP reached its ATH in January 2018 of roughly $3.84. Like a lot of digital assets, it corrected sharply during the ensuing bear market. XRP’s price has been up and down based on market sentiment and the challenges of evolving its regulatory status. A critical factor in its performance has been the ongoing lawsuit with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). XRP’s continued solid performance despite such challenges is what makes it so resilient, currently trading around $2.45. This is a 12% increase since the year started, and it might suggest a different price action for XRP in 2025. However, with its large market cap, it doesn’t have the same explosive upside that might fire up investors looking for life-changing gains, such as the aforementioned altcoin. Ethena: An Emerging Contender With Volatility Ethena (ENA) is a newcomer to the DeFi space filled with novel propositions for the decentralized finance enthusiasts. In April 2024, ENA reached an all-time high of $1.52 thanks to its distinct monetization of blockchain technology in financial services. Still, Ethena has not been free from the market’s broader volatility prior to November. Since its ATH in April ENA’s price decreased all the way down to just $0.1953 in September 2024. However, the price rebounded and is showing signs of recovery with the price rising to about $1.19, where it’s currently sitting. Its upward trend shows that it will be able to regain investor confidence and will push further to cement its position in the market. Ethena’s good narrative and volatility in the past suggest, however, that in terms of scaling, it may struggle to maintain growth. More dynamic options like the talked about altcoin are becoming more popular with traders looking to maximize returns in a shorter time frame. IntelMarkets (INTL): The $0.07 Game Changer Experts are pointing to IntelMarkets (INTL) as the go to investment for 2025. With artificial intelligence integrated across all levels of its platform, IntelMarkets lets users execute advanced trading strategies faster and more accurately than before. Real time analysis of very large datasets is a feature of all the self learning trading robots of the platform, which by doing so, optimize trading decisions for maximum profit. The AI-powered platform is set to change the way traders interact with digital assets, introducing useful tools and technologies that were previously unavailable to retail investors. Furthermore, its dual chain architecture, which allows it to support both Ethereum and Solana, makes it not only truly scalable but also interoperable, adding to its appeal. At the current presale price of $0.07, IntelMarkets presents a favorable entry point for early investors. IntelMarkets has also already raised over $5.6 million in investor confidence, making it a potential leader in the next bull. The risk averse investors may not be looking at XRP due to its regulatory challenges and Ethena due to its past volatility. On the other hand, IntelMarkets offers a novel approach backed by evidence of significant progress in trading technology and market infrastructure. Its low market cap and early stage status make the coin a perfect candidate to grow exponentially, whereas established coins simply don’t hold the same potential. Conclusion IntelMarkets (INTL) is poised to revolutionize crypto trading with its AI-powered platform, offering tools and technology that outpace competitors like XRP and Ethena. While these established coins provide stability, IntelMarkets’ early-stage potential and projected 75x returns make it a standout opportunity for investors seeking significant gains. As the presale continues to gain momentum, this innovative project is quickly becoming a must-watch for those looking to capitalize on the future of DeFi. Don’t miss your chance to join early.

In a January 5 blog post , Buterin noted that more than 12 months have passed since he first outlined his ethos for techno-optimism, advocating for “decentralized and democratic, differential defensive acceleration (d/acc).” Buterin summarized the philosophy as the belief that technological advancements have allowed humanity to circumvent many dangers in the past, but that future innovation could lead society towards either a positive or harmful future. As such, Vitalik argues that extending the underlying values of web3 — such as decentralization, resistance, and open economy — to mainstream technological development could help to combat associated risks, including centralization, cybersecurity, and bio-defense. “We want to build specific things that make the world safer and better,” Buterin said. “Build technologies that shift the offense/defense balance toward defense, and do so in a way that does not rely on handing over more power to centralized authorities.” Vitalik outlines new ideas for d/acc Buterin builds on his previous post by outlining ideas for how d/acc technologies can help humanity “thrive,” rather than merely “survive.” For example, Vitalik noted that zero-knowledge proofs both enable privacy preservation and increase the scope of data available for scientific analysis, while prediction markets provide value in the context of both “high-cooperation” and “high-adversity” environments. However, Buterin also acknowledges that his initial d/acc manifesto prescribed “good” technological development at the expense of offering strategies for combating “bad” innovation. One example is the rapid advancement of artificial technology (AI), with some analysts predicting that artificial general intelligence (AGI) could become a reality within the next half-decade. As such, d/acc critics suggest that regulatory intervention may be necessary in order to mitigate the threats associated with AGI. Buterin retorts that regulations aren’t necessarily incompatible with d/acc values, arguing that d/acc technologies would be consonant with regulations that impose liability on AI users for their actions. D/acc Discovery Day unites innovators Vitalik also highlighted the success of the November 14 “d/acc Discovery Day” at the latest Devcon conference. The event hosted speakers representing a wide range of specialized fields including biotech, cyber, and neurotech, facilitating collaboration between disparate actors. “One of the most positive takeaways from the d/acc event at Devcon was the extent to which the d/acc umbrella successfully brought people together from very different fields, and got them to actually be interested in each other’s work,” Buterin said. Vitalik continued that the Devcon Discovery Day proved d/acc efficacy as a vehicle for “broad coalition building,” concluding that such efforts are vital in advancing technological development for the betterment of mankind.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. DOGE is on a bullish path, with predictions of a rise to $1-$2. DTX, priced at $0.14, offers a new trading platform with tremendous growth potential and high returns. Table of Contents DOGE: Analysts see potential surge to $2 amid rising adoption DTX Exchange: Poised to transform the crypto market Key takeaways All the augurs seem to be claiming a considerable upsurge for Dogecoin (DOGE), and some have recently begun to highlight the potential of DTX Exchange (DTX) as the next Dogecoin. Current prices on DOGE hover around $0.35, and predictions have shown that it could eventually escalate to between $1 and $2 in the following months. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange , now priced at $0.14, is quickly becoming a buoyant investment opportunity, especially with its success in its presale and trading platform. As we pursue the latest developments around these cryptocurrencies, we ensure that both DOGE and DTX will get positive marketing words from investors who desire significant payoffs. DOGE: Analysts see potential surge to $2 amid rising adoption Dogecoin has been promisingly rebounding from its lows lately and is expected to have a bullish direction going forward. A very optimistic scenario puts DOGE between $1 and $2 by the early months of 2025. The scenario could see increased volume in trading, and the easy environment in the market plays a role in this strong surge. Also, establishing the Department of Government Efficiency, which draws mainstream attention to DOGE, further raises expectations concerning its future boost. Technical analysis indicates that Dogecoin is tracing an upward trajectory within an ascending channel pattern. This bullish setup has led some analysts to forecast a staggering increase of up to 6,77% in value. In this case, DOGE seems to be an attractive speculation due to its ability to expose many retail investors to a more accessible entry point. Social media buzz, celebrity endorsements, and community-driven buying could soon propel DOGE to unprecedented levels.

Now in its seventh presale stage, DTX has raised an astonishing $11.2 million; each token is priced at just $0.14. The curiosity around this exchange is so high that experts predict the possibility of a 3,000% jump as early as 2025. DTX Exchange is the next possible game changer because it will present a hybrid trading platform using the best centralized and decentralized exchanges. They will enjoy an improved use of more than 120,000 asset classes, from cryptocurrencies to stocks and forex to ETFs, all without KYC checks. This improves confidentiality, and traders can leverage their investments up to 1000 times. For instance, $100 can access up to $100,000 of liquidity. DTX holders also enjoy public governance rights and profit sharing enabled through the rebate program extended within the platform. Those with some of the more extensive holdings can share in the exchange’s success while voting on its future direction. Having established over 300,000 wallet addresses and a strong showcase of speed in transaction testnets (100,000 TPS), DTX is sure to grow huge without any doubt. Key takeaways Amid the meme-driven hype that continually keeps the eyes of retail investors hoping for quick profits, DTX makes for more organized investing through a robust trading platform and community-driven governance model.

Financial firm Ripple Labs, which offers payment rails and the RLUSD stablecoin using the XRP Ledger, is reporting a bump in local deals and hiring efforts ahead of Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20 — pinning growth on the upcoming administration’s campaign promises. “2025 is here and the Trump bull market is real,” CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in an X post late Sunday. “For Ripple, this is even more personal after Gensler's SEC effectively froze our business opportunities here at home for years. The optimism is obvious and very deserved.” “We signed more US deals in the last six weeks of 2024 (since the election) than the previous six MONTHS. Say what you want, but the “Trump effect” is already making crypto great again – through his campaign, and in the Administration’s day 1 priorities,” he added. Garlinghouse added that the company is now almost exclusively hiring in the United States, which is a shift from the company's expansion offshore during the previous Joe Biden administration. Ripple now has 75% of its open roles in the U.S., Garlinghouse said. As such, the firm is also donating to Trump's upcoming inauguration and has pledged $5 million worth of XRP tokens to the effort. Since November, the speculative optimism among traders has been that a crypto-friendly Trump administration could benefit tokens linked to U.S.-based companies, such as Ripple Labs (related to XRP) and Uniswap (UNI), as the firms are more involved in boosting value for token holders. XRP prices have increased more than 300% since Trump’s win, outperforming growth in all other major cryptocurrencies, mainly on the U.S. narrative. Traders from other countries are piling in, too. Last week, XRP surged more than 11% even as majors remained rangebound, led by $1.3 billion worth of trading volumes on Korea-focused exchange Upbit. A CoinDesk analysis previously flagged unusually high trading volumes for XRP stemming from South Korean exchanges, which has historically acted as a harbinger for price volatility with a bias to the upside. XRP was trading just above $2.40 during the Asian afternoon hours Monday, little-changed in the past 24 hours alongside the broader market.",Markets,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-06 08:01:59

In a new interview with venture capitalist Preston Pysh, Gromen says it wouldn’t make sense for Trump to announce plans to accumulate Bitcoin right after being sworn into office. According to Gromen, investors would likely jump in to front-run the US government, sending Bitcoin higher before it has a chance to establish a position. Instead, the macro guru says it would be better for Trump to accumulate BTC behind the scenes while expressing his optimism for the largest crypto asset by market cap. Gromen also says that Trump should announce the reserve after the US builds its position as the tactic would inspire Bitcoin rallies and immediately enrich the government’s coffers. “From an optics and narrative perspective, it makes more sense to not announce it on day one, continue to talk positively about it, buy it in the background and manage the chart as you talk positively about it. And then after the fact say, ‘Hey, by the way, I have established the Bitcoin reserve,’ because then the market’s going to run away from you versus doing it on day one.” Donald Trump, once a vocal critic of the asset class, has pivoted and is now seen as a pro-crypto president. While speaking at the Bitcoin2024 Conference, Trump said that he would keep the government from unloading its seized BTC on the open market and instruct officials to hold the trove as an investment. He also said he could use crypto to pay off the country’s rapidly growing national debt but didn’t elaborate on how. His words have sparked rumblings that his administration may establish a Bitcoin reserve. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $99,147.

This level has halted buying activity in the past hour but it is expected to continue if the volume level increases. Last December’s drop took many by surprise as several altcoins including ARB broke down to a month low during the market-wide correction. Technically, that correction was healthy for the market to enable robust growth in the future, although it caused a serious panic in the market but the sellers short-lived their expectations as the price bounced back. While the sellers aim to resume pressure during the brief consolidation phase, the bulls took advantage of the bounce this week and pushed higher amid current rising demand. Fortunately, the wide but short correction halted and the price increased consistently. Looking at the latest setup, the bulls are back in action, although they are yet to recover all the lost grounds. A clear break above the previous monthly high should set the stage for a massive bullish move. Conversely, a rejection there could subject the price to a consolidation before breaking up. Now that ARB is starting the new year in a grand style, we can expect an explosive move when a break-up occurs. ARB’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Aside from the close $0.96 resistance, the key target level for the bulls right now is $1.1. If they overcome it, the $1.24 level would be the next resistance to watch with a potential breakout to $2 in the near term. A drop from the current trading level could trigger a small pullback to $0.74. Meanwhile, the latest move is supported by $0.7. Lower levels to watch for a breakdown are $0.613 and $0.57.

After riding GOAT’s rapid ascent, he sold all GOAT with a total of about $5.2 million, netting an estimated $5.14 million. His performance with ai16z – a decentralized AI-powered trading fund on the Solana blockchain – is similarly impressive, as he spent one $123,000 to acquire 6.17 million tokens at a market cap of $22 million. Lookonchain’s data indicates that he sold 4.67 million ai16z tokens at around $1.78 each and still retains 2.65 million tokens currently valued near $2.9 million. According to Lookonchain, this amounts to a total ai16z profit of more than $4.5 million. The analysis also highlights significant gains from Fartcoin, which the trader bought at a market cap of under $7 million, paying $121,000 for around 9.46 million tokens. He sold 6.81 million of those tokens for $610,000 while keeping 2.65 million tokens that are collectively valued at $3.55 million, bringing his net profit on Fartcoin to roughly $4 million. A similar pattern emerged in his ARC position, where he invested $212,000 to acquire 11.6 million ARC tokens when the project’s market cap was approximately $15 million. After selling 1.6 million tokens for $212,000, he currently holds 10 million arc tokens worth about $4 million, resulting in another $4 million profit.

A screenshot provided by Lookonchain shows that he financed part of these purchases by selling Fartcoin in two batches of 25,000 units for $31,446.35 and $29,681.37, respectively. Additional funding appears to have come from selling Wrapped SOL (WSOL) in multiple transactions, including 100 units for $21,611, 50 units for $10,805.50, and 153 units for $33,069.42. The distribution of these WSOL sales suggests a methodical approach to securing liquidity before deploying funds into CREATE, PIPPIN, SANDY, MOLE, and FORGE. In total, he allocated $202,255 to acquire stakes in the memecoins. He spent $61,127 on CREATE, $21,611 on PIPPIN, $21,611 on SANDY, $65,486 on MOLE, and $32,420 on FORGE. At press time, GOAT traded at $0.52.

Leading the charge for 2025 are AI-powered cryptos IntelMarkets (INTL), Render (RNDR), and NEAR Protocol (NEAR), all of which are redefining what’s possible in the crypto space. With INTL’s advanced dual-chain model, RNDR’s rapid adoption, and NEAR’s expanding infrastructure, these cryptos are making waves. Here’s why these three are predicted to make waves in the coming year. IntelMarkets 2025 Potential: Is INTL Leading AI-Powered Cryptos to New Heights? In the world of crypto trading, IntelMarkets is leading the way with accessible and efficient solutions. Its dual-chain setup, built on Ethereum and Solana, delivers unmatched flexibility for traders. Ethereum ensures broad access to DeFi applications, while Solana delivers fast transactions with minimal fees. This integration ensures users can customize their strategies without compromise. One standout feature is IntelMarkets’ 1000x leverage, opening opportunities to maximize gains from even small price shifts. Enhanced liquidity and diverse asset pairs provide traders with endless possibilities, whether focusing on mainstream tokens or exploring niche markets. These features allow traders to take advantage of market trends with precision and ease. The real-world utility of IntelMarkets goes beyond mere speculation. Its robust tokenomics ensures price stability, addressing volatility concerns that plague other platforms. This stability distinguishes it from rivals, proving its worth as more than just another exchange. RNDR on the Rise: Experts Predict $12 Render Network has emerged as a major player in the world of AI-Powered Cryptos. Recently, RNDR achieved a $5 billion market cap, solidifying its place among leading tokens. Adding to Render’s momentum is Robinhood Crypto’s launch of RNDR trading in Europe. Investors can now trade RNDR against Euros, boosting accessibility and market interest. In December 2024, the AI-Powered Cryptos star saw a rise from $8.22 to $10.99. Despite a subsequent dip to $6.85, experts remain optimistic about RNDR’s bullish forecast. Experts project RNDR could reach $12 by 2025, fueled by growing demand for AI-Powered cryptos. NEAR Protocol’s 2025 Vision: Pioneering the Future of AI-Powered Cryptos NEAR Protocol is positioning itself as a leader in the evolving AI-Powered Cryptos space. The NEAR Infrastructure Committee (IC), established in April 2024, has been pivotal in fostering innovation. Its transparent and sustainable approach has streamlined resources toward solving critical issues in the ecosystem. The IC’s plans for 2025 include proactive funding for AI development and chain abstraction innovations. This aligns with NEAR Protocol’s broader goals of expanding decentralized infrastructure, wallets, and AI applications. Experts believe this strategy could redefine NEAR’s role among AI-Powered Cryptos. The focus on innovation and growth is expected to drive interest in AI-Powered Cryptos like NEAR Protocol. In December 2024, NEAR’s price fell from $8.064 to $5.008. Despite this dip, projections remain optimistic, with analysts predicting a potential rise to $10 in 2025. $5.6M Raised: IntelMarkets’ Presale Signals Big Wins As 2025 approaches, IntelMarkets, Render, and NEAR Protocol exemplify the immense potential of AI-powered cryptos. These projects, most especially IntelMarkets, stand out not just for their innovative technology but for their practical solutions and market foresight. INTL is currently in Stage 8 of its public presale, with tokens priced at $0.07. Over $5.6 million has already been raised, showcasing the community’s belief in its potential. Industry experts forecast a 100x post-launch return, positioning IntelMarkets as a leading contender among AI-powered cryptos. With AI gaining traction, IntelMarkets is positioned to set new benchmarks in 2025. For anyone seeking a blend of innovation and stability in AI-powered cryptos, IntelMarkets is the clear choice.

Within an hour, the servers returned; however, players on social media believed the outage was due to a blown power transformer in Sacramento, where the data centers are located. The game has had technical problems, and this outage is merely another in that series. DDoS, or distributed denial of service, seems to have struck Final Fantasy 14 servers repeatedly in 2024, flooding the servers with distracting traffic. Source: downdetector.com This led to high latency and server disconnects, making the game virtually unplayable. Square Enix introduced steps to minimize the damage from DDoS attacks, but nothing like this is 100% preventable. In such incidents, players often rely on virtual private networks, or VPNs, to stabilize their connections. Final Fantasy users heard an explosion According to posts on the r/ffxiv subreddit , moments before the outage, some users felt an explosion or a large pop. These same sources said the noise was consistent with a blown transformer, and it’s believed that the transformer was responsible for the brief power outage that affected the data centers. Square Enix confirmed around 9 PM Eastern that servers were back online and said it was investigating the incident. North American servers were slower to recover, while the game’s European, Japanese, and Oceanic servers remained unaffected. First to come back were the Aether, Crystal, and Primal Data Centers, which remained offline longer, while the Dynamis Data Center remained down. With Final Fantasy 14 already planning an ambitious 2025 that includes a mobile version , these server problems are all too familiar. While it’s still unclear how these continued issues will impact the game’s future, Square Enix is still left with the task of managing a consistent gaming experience for its globally dispersed player base.

This shift comes amid the bullish momentum sparked by the launch of the Bitcoin ETF earlier this year. At the start of 2024, an estimated 8 million BTC were categorized as “Lost Coins,” referring to coins that had lain dormant for years or had not moved at all. However, this figure has since dropped by a significant 460,000 BTC to 7.54 million. According to Alphractal, the renewed activity among these long-dormant coins reflects the actions of long-term holders who have benefited from the market’s upward trajectory. These forgotten assets, locked away in wallets for years, are now re-entering the market, directly affecting Bitcoin’s supply and demand dynamics. Related News: Attention: There are Loaded Token Unlocks in 31 Altcoins in the New Week! Here is the Day by Day, Hour by Hour List! The firm highlighted the “Lost Coins vs Active Supply” metric, which measures the balance between inactive Bitcoins and those actively in circulation. A high ratio of lost coins highlights Bitcoin's scarcity by reducing the effective supply and generally supports its value. However, as these dormant coins come back to life, liquidity increases, potentially affecting market stability and price dynamics. This trend not only adds depth to Bitcoin’s story as a financial asset, but also offers valuable insight into how changes in active supply could shape Bitcoin’s future. *This is not investment advice.

Elon Loves MAGA (ELOMAGA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Loves MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Loves MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Loves MAGA launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Loves MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Loves MAGA by entering its contract address – 6mRLPcgWXUBYNfXouCxBoyjFzNjww9HNVFpBJkrqmFeE – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELOMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-06 09:25:00

His “Bermuda Triangle $27” chart provides an in-depth roadmap for XRP enthusiasts, highlighting key levels and events expected to shape its price movement. Below is a detailed breakdown of his chart and insights. The Seven Arcs: Egrag’s Fibonacci Circle projections, termed “The Seven Arcs,” outline XRP’s price targets. Each arc represents a critical resistance or support level the price must breach. As of now, XRP has successfully moved past Arcs 1 through 4. The focus shifts to Arcs 5, 6, and 7, with March 10, 2025, identified as a pivotal date for potential further advancement. Equilibrium: The concept of “Equilibrium” represents a zone of price stability that XRP has decisively cleared. While Egrag acknowledges the possibility of a retest, he emphasizes that the equilibrium zone remains structurally intact, underscoring its significance in providing a stable foundation for future price movements. The Atlas Line: The “Atlas Line” is a critical support zone that has sustained XRP through periods of extreme volatility. Named metaphorically after the Titan who holds the sky, this line symbolizes a robust foundation that shields XRP’s price during market downturns. The Final Wake-Up Line: This line marks the threshold to a highly volatile price zone known as the “Red Lake.” According to Egrag, the journey through the Red Lake signifies a crucial phase of price discovery that transitions into the “Blue Ocean,” a region of potential rapid price appreciation. The Red Lake: The “Red Lake” reflects an area of intense market battles between bullish and bearish forces. Having successfully navigated this zone, XRP has tested and confirmed several previously identified targets. This phase has prepared XRP for its entry into higher price zones. The Stratosphere: The “Stratosphere” is described as a pivotal portal that catapults XRP to unprecedented levels. Its breach has allowed the price to enter the “Blue Ocean,” setting the stage for significant upward movement. The Blue Ocean: This region represents an opportunity for XRP holders, with high volatility characterized by the presence of large market participants (sharks and whales). Egrag advises rational profit-taking strategies while holding a portion of XRP for potential long-term gains. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Wave 3 Targets: Egrag outlines potential price targets based on Elliott Wave Theory. Wave 3 is expected to deliver a significant price surge: A 540% gain could take XRP to $13. If Wave 3 extends to 161.8% of Wave 1, the price may reach $21. Wave 5, expected to follow Wave 3 and Wave 4 corrections, could propel XRP to $27 or higher. March 10, 2025 (A Red Line): The date marks the approach of a Total Lunar Eclipse (March 13-14, 2025), which Egrag, citing fellow analyst WatersAbove, associates with potential market volatility. The alignment of this astrological event with technical indicators makes it a point of interest for XRP’s price action. Egrag Crypto’s analysis blends technical expertise with astrological considerations, presenting a unique perspective on XRP’s potential trajectory . The path to $27, as projected, hinges on XRP’s ability to navigate critical price zones and external influences such as market sentiment and macroeconomic factors. For investors, the chart underscores the importance of strategy, patience, and preparedness for volatility in the coming months.

He further pressed on the need to make AI agent networks robust. However, currently the hardest part for each AI agent network is setting goals with a long time range, especially when the agents are first being made. Natural language hints limit agents to following simple directions. It’s possible for agents to trade with prestructure by responding to signs, but this doesn’t give them freedom and independence. https://twitter.com/lordOfAFew/status/1876132213345153377 This poses the biggest problem because it stops agents from acting on their own to reach such long-term, complicated goals. For this to work, complex task networks and the ability for strategies to explore and change on their own are needed. To fulfill Stage three autonomy requires changes in hardware, firmware, and software, which is a tough task. It is only through rapid improvement in technology, such as HTNs, that agents can handle complex, long-term tasks.

Despite a consolidated close to 2024, the 2025 trade began on a bullish note with the price surging above $3500 after a long time. The indicators flipped to bullish, suggesting a bullish continuation for the long time ahead. Meanwhile, the current ETH price action suggests no major price action may be anticipated for another few days. Has the ETH price rally halted? Is a new ATH out of the way? The ETH price is juggling around $3600 after the rise from a consolidated range of $3350, breaking the descending pattern. The technicals are neither in favour of bulls nor the bears, which suggests a stable market. The volume data seems negative, which implies a lack of buying interest. In such a scenario, the question arises whether it is a good time to buy Ethereum or to sell. The current price action indicates the ETH price is trading under bullish influence as it sticks within a rising parallel channel. As the RSI remains incremental, the possibility of maintaining a continued ascending trend remains higher. Meanwhile, the +Di & -Di levels raise some concerns as they have converged, aiming for a bearish crossover, while the bulls have managed to keep up the trade above the support. As a result, both levels are going parallel to each other with less deviation. Secondly, as seen in most of the cryptos, the volume has drained and reached the lowest levels, suggesting a massive squeeze. The key support and resistance levels are around $3678 and $3608, respectively. As the technicals do not display any major deviation, the risk assessment indicates mixed signals leading to a HOLD recommendation. Besides, the trader’s interest has also dropped as the volume remains restricted while other technicals are currently indecisive.

Market analysis highlights diverging signals The excitement surrounding Bitcoin call options coincides with other optimistic signals in the cryptocurrency market. Deribit reported that perpetual swaps, a key trading instrument, have shown increasing stability, exhibiting a pattern akin to pre-downturn patterns, suggesting renewed confidence among traders. “Options markets tell a mixed story, with short-tenor volatility skewed slightly toward out-of-the-money puts, while longer-tenor options display a stronger bullish tilt,” Deribit noted in a January 2 report. December’s year-end expiration of a significant proportion of options open interest (OI) failed to create the dramatic price swings some had predicted, indicating more measured market behavior. BTC Open Interest chart. Source: Deribit.com The regulated cryptocurrency index provider CF Benchmarks has echoed the optimism, pointing to potential regulatory changes under the Trump administration. In an annual report shared with media houses, the firm highlighted how a restructured US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could encourage innovation while reducing enforcement risks. These changes may enhance investor confidence, but CF Benchmarks also warned that delays in policy implementation could temporarily dampen market sentiment. Adding to this perspective, Bybit, in collaboration with Block Scholes, released its latest crypto derivatives report on January 3. The derivatives research analyzed open interest trends for Bitcoin and Ethereum during the critical year-end options expiration period. It revealed that while perpetual swaps open interest has not returned to early December 2024 levels, the market has remained stable. “This stability suggests that traders did not heavily rely on perpetual contracts to hedge the delta of expiring options, contributing to the muted volatility during the year-end,” the release stated. Trading volumes also dipped during the winter holiday season, leading to a significant drop in realized volatility, the lowest seen in December.

While it has achieved significant milestones in accessibility and innovation, scalability remains a pressing concern. As DeFi gains traction, ensuring it can handle larger user bases and transaction volumes is essential. This article explores how scalability, interoperability, and Web3 adoption are shaping DeFi’s future. The Importance of DeFi Scalability Scalability in DeFi refers to the ability of decentralized systems to grow and handle more users and transactions without compromising performance. Traditional financial systems rely on centralized networks that can be upgraded easily. In contrast, DeFi systems operate on blockchain technology , where scaling involves complex coordination among multiple decentralized participants. Current blockchain networks often face issues like high fees and slow transaction speeds when demand surges. These limitations deter potential users and create bottlenecks for financial applications. Achieving scalable DeFi is not just about improving speed but also about maintaining affordability and accessibility for all users. Interoperable Blockchain as a Solution Interoperability means the ability of different blockchain networks to interact with and share data between them. In the early days, most DeFi projects were built on one blockchain, such as Ethereum. Now, with the increasing number of networks, the need to connect them for scaling is also growing. Bridges between Ethereum and younger blockchains like Solana and Avalanche pave ways for users to move assets between these chains. A resulting effect is the clogged situation experienced in any single chain; the work just gets distributed across a couple of chains. With interoperability, developers will further develop more effective and adaptable financial applications based on strengths related to various blockchains. Web3 Adoption Driving Scalable DeFi Web3 is a more modern generation of the internet; by nature, it’s both built and user-controlled, using decentralized technologies. In other words, its more increased adoption, meaning demand for DeFi functions as more users would want alternatives apart from traditional banking. But bringing Web3 into the mainstream requires solving technical issues characteristic of decentralized systems. Web3 will be way more user-friendly, faster in transaction speed, and a stable network. In this case, by fixing those issues, DeFi can be more inclusive, and with the inclusiveness, further innovation and scalability can be achieved. Challenges in Decentralized Finance Despite the potential, a number of obstacles still hinder the path of decentralized finance. Security is of utmost importance, and the vulnerability of smart contracts can bring huge losses. Besides, DeFi systems usually require advanced technical knowledge, which may discourage new users. Another challenge is governance . Decisions about protocol upgrades or changes often rely on token-based voting systems. While this approach is decentralized, it can also lead to unequal representation if large token holders dominate the process. Ensuring fair governance is vital for building trust and encouraging participation in scalable DeFi systems. Promising Developments in Scalable DeFi Several advancements are addressing the scalability issue in decentralized finance: Layer-2 Solutions : Technologies like Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups process transactions off-chain before finalizing them on the main blockchain. This reduces congestion and speeds up transactions. Sharding: By splitting a blockchain into smaller, more manageable parts called shards, networks can handle more transactions simultaneously. Ethereum’s transition to a sharded structure is a significant step in this direction. Cross-Chain Protocols: Projects like Polkadot and Cosmos focus on enabling blockchains to operate together, fostering greater interoperability and scalability. Decentralized Identity: Integrating identity solutions can streamline user verification processes, reducing redundancies and improving efficiency across platforms. Key Metrics for Scalable DeFi To understand the progress in scalable decentralized finance, monitoring specific metrics is useful. Here’s a table summarizing some of these metrics and their significance: Metric Description Importance Transaction Speed Average time for processing transactions. Reflects network efficiency. Transaction Cost Fees required to complete a transaction. Affects user affordability. Network Throughput Total number of transactions a network can handle per second (TPS). Measures scalability. Active Users Number of unique wallets interacting with DeFi platforms. Indicates adoption levels. TVL (Total Value Locked) Total assets locked in DeFi protocols. Demonstrates platform trust and usage. Real-World Impact The progress in scalable DeFi has already started to impact real-world use cases. Microfinance platforms are leveraging blockchain technology to provide loans to underserved communities. Insurance protocols are offering decentralized, transparent coverage for various risks. Payment solutions powered by DeFi are enabling instant cross-border transactions without relying on intermediaries. These applications highlight the importance of building systems that can grow with demand. By addressing scalability and interoperability, DeFi can transform traditional financial services and empower users globally. Looking Ahead As we move closer to 2025, the road to scalable financial systems will require collaboration between developers, users, and regulators. In reality, the right blend of innovative solutions, inclusiveness, and transparency makes DeFi more reliable and approachable. Only then-if these current challenges are overcome-comes a realization of its full potential for truly decentralized, scalable financial services.",Reviews|DeFi,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|FORKS,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-01-06 09:48:01

By 2025, they will act as the backbone of blockchain payments. By design, stablecoins prove to be one of the most feasible mediums of processing a transaction and an asset for any stakeholder dealing with it. Let’s go in-depth into the ways in which stablecoins rewrites the rules with digital money and enables fast adoption of blockchain-based means of paying for goods or services. Why Stablecoins Matter in Blockchain Payments We all know that cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin are quite inconsistent. Because of this feature, they are excellent for traders but not the best choice for consumers looking for a trustworthy means of payment. Stablecoins, on the other hand, maintain a stable value. This stability makes them perfect for everyday use and long-term storage. Blockchain payments with the use of stablecoins are fast, secure, and very affordable. Most of the traditional forms of payment include intermediaries, which increase processing time and fees. Stablecoins, however, work on decentralized networks that have no middlemen; thus, users can send funds anywhere in the world in minutes and at a fraction of the cost compared to traditional methods. Use Cases of Stablecoins in 2025 Stablecoins have expanded their applications significantly. Below are some of their most prominent use cases: Cross-Border Payments Sending money across borders has become seamless with stablecoins. Users can avoid high fees and lengthy processing times associated with traditional remittance services. Everyday Transactions From buying coffee to paying rent, stablecoins are being used for daily purchases. Merchants appreciate the reduced transaction costs and instant settlements. Crypto Trading and Investments Traders use stablecoins to hedge against market volatility. They serve as a hedge during market downturns. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Stablecoins power various DeFi applications , including lending, borrowing, and earning interest. They offer users a way to engage with financial services without needing traditional banks. Smart Contracts Developers integrate stablecoins into smart contracts for automated payments and settlements. This ensures that contract terms are executed without price fluctuation risks. Benefits of Stablecoins for Blockchain Payments Feature Benefit Price Stability Users avoid risks associated with volatile crypto markets. Fast Transactions Funds are transferred instantly , regardless of geographical boundaries. Low Fees Minimal transaction costs make them ideal for small and large payments. Security Blockchain technology ensures transparency and protection against fraud. Accessibility Anyone with an internet connection can use stablecoins for payments. Challenges and Solutions Despite their benefits, stablecoins face some challenges. One significant concern is regulation. Governments worldwide are scrutinizing stablecoins to ensure they comply with financial laws. This increased regulation may introduce hurdles but also provide greater trust and adoption. Another challenge is centralization. The fact that many stablecoins are run by centralized organizations raises the possibility of issues like poor management or user money loss. In order to improve security and transparency, developers are developing decentralized stablecoins that function without centralized authority. Finally, the challenge of transferring stablecoins between platforms is a problem of interoperability amongst the many blockchain networks. Stablecoins are being made compatible with many blockchains through the construction of cross-chain bridges. Stablecoins and Cross-Border Payments Stablecoins are revolutionizing cross-border payments. Sending money internationally has traditionally been slow and expensive. Stablecoins eliminate these issues by allowing instant and low-cost transfers. For example: Traditional Method Using Stablecoins Processing time: 3-5 business days Processing time: A few minutes Transaction fee: 5-10% Transaction fee: Less than 1% Involves intermediaries No intermediaries, fully peer-to-peer This makes stablecoins a preferred option for migrant workers sending money home or businesses conducting international trade. The Role of Stablecoins in Crypto Transactions Stablecoins make crypto transactions very smooth and less complicated because this is a stable medium of exchange. No more worries while making payments or storing value as prices fluctuate. This can also encourage mainstream businesses to accept crypto payments , further integrating the use of blockchain technology in daily life. Besides, stablecoins are a bridge between traditional finance and digital currencies. Users can easily convert fiat money into stablecoins and vice versa. The ease of exchange lowers the entry barriers for new crypto users. What Lies Ahead for Stablecoins? With the growth in blockchain-based payments, stablecoins are going to continue playing a crucial role. Innovations such as programmable money, where stablecoins execute certain tasks through smart contracts , are likely to become big. In addition, the legitimacy and reach of such stablecoins could increase when partnerships between stablecoin providers and global financial institutions start. In 2025, stablecoins will continue leading in the digital currency space. The amalgamation of the powers of blockchain technology with price stability makes them indispensable in many aspects. Be it cross-border payments, crypto transactions, or decentralized finance, stablecoins are leading the next wave of innovation in the financial ecosystem. Stablecoins changed the way we think about money and payments. Their development is just one of many exciting ways blockchain technology can help in the creation of a faster, more inclusive, and safer financial system.",Reviews|Stablecoins,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-01-06 09:51:38

Tokenization, AI, Bitcoin adoption and corporate mergers are the key factors that are likely to support the sector this year. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley, in a series of posts on X, openly supported the trending ‘crypto growth’ argument. Here is what you should know. Tokenisation of Smaller Businesses Explaining clearly how businesses, especially smaller businesses, are going to benefit from tokenisation, Horsley mentioned the potential of this to help smaller businesses to access capital markets. He also emphasised the shift from demand-side benefits to supply-side opportunities. Recently, Brickken founder and CEO Edwin Mata, while speaking to tech reporters about the impact that RWA is going to create in 2025, stated that Real-world asset tokenisation would transform traditional markets. He projected real estate, debt and equity as the three major areas where RWA is going to make a tremendous impact. AI Driving Tokenised Companies Horsley pointed out that advances in AI could lead to a rise in niche businesses. He added that these businesses might tokenise instead of going public. This argument points to the possibility of the development of a new capital market. Bitcoin Standard Corporations Speaking about Bitcoin’s corporate adoption, Horsley forecasted that in 2025 more companies will include BTC on their balance sheet. MicroStrategy, with 446,400 BTC, remains in the top position on the list of the top five public companies by BTC holdings. Marathon Digital Holdings (40,435 BTC), Riot Platforms (16,728 BTC), and Hut 8 Corp (10,096 BTC) are the other public companies on the list. Mergers and Acquisitions Revival Predicting the possibility of the revival of mergers and acquisitions, Horsely opined that big corporations like Alphabet, Amazon and Tesla could expand. This hints that the revival could boost crypto through their market strategies. As 2025 unfolds, crypto is set to be influenced by tokenisation, AI, and Bitcoin adoption.

While NFTs are often lauded as tools for securing intellectual property and in-game assets across ecosystems, Greene remains skeptical. However, Greene did not entirely dismiss blockchain technology, acknowledging its potential as a financial layer within digital ecosystems. “If we can use a digital ledger, we’ll find the best one and use it. But that’s really it,” he remarked. His disinterest in NFTs aligns with his broader critique of metaverse projects, which he described as “IP bubbles” delivering sub-par experiences. Metaverse Roadmap to Artemis Artemis represents the culmination of a trilogy of gaming projects under development at Greene’s studio, PlayerUnknown Productions. The journey begins with Prologue, a realistic survival game powered by NASA Earth data. Currently in testing, Prologue is set to launch in 2025. The second, unnamed game will expand into large-scale multiplayer worlds, featuring millions of characters across vast landscapes. Both games will integrate into Artemis, envisioned as a “3D internet” where users can create, modify, and interact across interconnected virtual worlds. “The metaverse should function like a 3D internet, where worlds operate on a shared protocol, much like web pages use HTTP,” Greene explained. Artemis aims to bring this concept to life, blending user-generated content and creativity in a manner reminiscent of Minecraft or Star Trek’s Holodeck. While the metaverse once dominated tech narratives, the hype has waned following underwhelming results from major players like Meta, which reportedly spent over $40 billion on its metaverse ambitions. Greene is determined to chart a different course, aiming for functionality over spectacle.

Here is the New Staff and Expectations,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/things-are-changing-at-the-fed-number-of-hawkish-and-dovish-members-updated-here-is-the-new-staff-and-expectations/,"There will be significant changes to the Fed's interest rate-setting committee in 2025, with two “hawks,” one “dove,” and one neutral member joining the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The transition comes at a time when inflation concerns are resurfacing, posing new challenges for policymakers guiding the U.S. economy. The FOMC is scheduled to hold eight meetings throughout the year — in January, March, May, June, July, September, October and December — which will be crucial in determining the pace of future interest rate adjustments. Last month, the Fed cut its benchmark policy rate by a quarter point and signaled only two more rate cuts through 2025. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank was entering a new era and that future rate cuts would be more gradual and data-driven, depending on inflation trends. “I think that’s a pretty strong message that a January rate cut is unlikely,” said Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs. “Beyond that, the data will really have to drive that.” Related News: Can All Bitcoins Really Be Mined in the US After Trump Takes Office? Is This Possible? Susan Collins (Boston), Alberto Musalem (St. Louis), Jeff Schmid (Kansas City), and Austan Goolsbee (Chicago) will join the FOMC as voting members, consisting of seven Federal Reserve chairmen, the president of the New York Federal Reserve, and the rotating chairmen of 11 regional Federal Reserve banks. While these new members will play a prominent role, non-voting officials will continue to actively contribute to policy deliberations. The potential impact of President-elect Donald Trump’s policies further complicates the Fed’s decision-making process. Some economists say his proposed plans, which include higher tariffs, widespread deportations and tax cuts, could strain the labor market and raise inflation. *This is not investment advice.

Long a benchmark for innovation and stability, Cardano (ADA) is a leading Layer 1 blockchain. However, Cardano traders are switching to a newcomer to the hybrid blockchain world. DTX Exchange (DTX) is set to be a viable competitor to the Layer-1 space, with a rumored listing on Binance. Can a Rumored Binance Listing Propel DTX Exchange To 30x Rally? As the speculation continues, the eyes are on DTX Exchange (DTX), a new hybrid trading platform that pairs the best of CEX and DEX exchanges. DTX is built on its proprietary VulcanX Layer 1 blockchain, on which it intends to redefine trading by making it seamless to integrate traditional financial assets with blockchain technology. Being a feature-rich decentralized ecosystem, it is a viable competitor to Cardano and many other established Layer 1 ecosystems. The ongoing ICO of DTX Exchange has been making a lot of noise as well. It has raised early funding of over $11.2 million, which speaks well about investor confidence. The DTX token, in the 7th presale round, trades at the price of $0.14. DTX Exchange is expected to grow after its launch, with experts predicting a 30x increase once the DTX token gets listed on Binance. Cardano (ADA): A Market Leader Facing Headwinds ADA is currently trading at $1.09 and is showing some resilience in the face of market volatility. After increasing by 300% in the previous bull run, ADA has faced volatility. But the question remains: Can this performance be matched by the rising contender DTX Exchange? A darling of the institutional and retail investor community, Cardano (ADA), a running champion of the Layer-1 blockchain, is regarded highly by all players looking for solid returns. The many improvements to date — such as on-chain governance and increased scalability — have boosted its robust ecosystem and put it among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Key Differences: Cardano vs. DTX Exchange Technology: Cardano’s proof of stake (PoS) consensus mechanism puts sustainability and scalability at the fore. However, taking the hybrid path, VulcanX offers a safe journey to transition from traditional finance (TradFi) to decentralized finance (DeFi) with an integrated trade of over 120,000 asset classes. Ecosystem: Cardano is very strong in supporting many dApps and smart contract functionality. DTX Exchange is focusing on creating a singular unified trading ecosystem catering to crypto stocks, bonds, and commodities on a single platform. Growth Potential: ADA is a matured ecosystem with a significant market cap of $39 billion. DTX is a low-cap gem with no previous bull run, making it a good choice for traders looking for high ROI. Final Thoughts One of the main strengths of Cardano (ADA) is its ability to be resilient in uncertain markets. However, there are emerging players, such as DTX Exchange, that can provide traders with a new angle on high growth opportunities. DTX has a 30x upside projected upside once the launch on Binance; with early-stage growth potential and an innovative approach, DTX Exchange is the platform to watch.

Meanwhile, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley expects more crypto-friendly policies under Trump in 2025. In Congress, Georgia Rep. Mike Collins disclosed new crypto investments, which reignited debates over lawmakers trading cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is projected to experience some short-term volatility ahead of Trump’s inauguration and the FOMC meeting at the end of January. John Deaton Takes Aim at Chokepoint 2.0 John Deaton, a former United States prosecutor and well known advocate for cryptocurrency, extended an offer to the incoming Trump administration to lead an investigation into the alleged Operation Chokepoint 2.0. It is rumored that this initiative targeted the crypto industry by severing its access to traditional banking services. In his statement on X , Deaton addressed President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and other key administration figures. He stated that actions like this, if left unchallenged, could set a very dangerous precedent of regulatory bodies undermining industries they oppose. Deaton also pointed out that the issue transcends crypto, and described it as a broader fight against unchecked bureaucratic power and the erosion of institutional integrity. He offered to undertake the investigation without compensation because he believes in the importance of uncovering the truth over financial gain. Deaton also added that Americans deserve transparency more than he or anyone else needs a taxpayer-funded paycheck. His proposal coincided with a court ruling that allowed Coinbase to access unredacted files from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to scrutinize its role in the alleged regime. According to Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal , these documents reveal a coordinated effort to suppress a wide range of crypto activities, from basic Bitcoin transactions to more complex offerings. The alleged architect of Operation Chokepoint 2.0, Martin Gruenberg, resigned as FDIC Chair in November, which added even more intrigue to the controversy. The rumored initiative gained notoriety after the collapse of key banking partners for crypto exchanges, like Silvergate and Signature Bank, in March of 2023. These events left major exchanges, including Binance, without reliable banking relationships. Deaton’s renewed activism in the crypto space happened despite his loss in the Massachusetts Senate race to Democratic incumbent Senator Elizabeth Warren. The Nov. 5 election was a decisive victory for Warren, who Deaton criticized during heated debates for focusing more on building an ”anti-crypto army” instead of addressing issues affecting the middle and lower classes. Despite this setback, Deaton is still a vocal figure in the crypto advocacy landscape. Trump Policies Could Propel Crypto Growth in 2025 Bitwise Asset Management CEO Hunter Horsley recently shared his optimism about the Trump administration's economic policies and their potential impact on the cryptocurrency landscape in 2025. In a recent X post, Horsley predicted that the administration might ”unfreeze” mergers and acquisitions, which could pave the way for major corporations to expand further. He mentioned scenarios like Amazon acquiring Instacart or Google buying Uber, and suggested that the economic shift could lead to larger companies growing even bigger while mid-sized players might struggle. Horsley described 2025 as a pivotal year by stating that the world is on the ”precipice of change.” He also stated that progress requires change and expressed his enthusiasm for the opportunities ahead. After pinning a tweet listing the top 70 corporate Bitcoin holders, Horsley predicted an influx of corporations adopting Bitcoin this year. Supporting this view, HODL 15 Capital reported that 11 publicly traded companies have bought more Bitcoin since last Monday, while at least 16 billionaires have also invested in the cryptocurrency. Horsley's comments were made after MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor's hint at yet another Bitcoin acquisition. On Sunday, Saylor shared a Bitcoin chart on social media, which is a move that often precedes a purchase announcement. Georgia Congressman Reports Crypto Purchases The attraction of crypto was made very evident after Representative Mike Collins of Georgia disclosed a crypto investment in a financial report that was filed on Jan. 1. Collins reported buying between $1,001 and $15,000 in Ski Mask Dog (SKI), which is a token that was launched in May of 2024. The report, along with a previous filing from December, showed that Collins made three separate purchases of SKI between Dec. 1 and 3, coinciding with a surge in crypto prices after the US elections. Collins is a Republican who secured reelection in Georgia’s 10th congressional district with more than 63% of the vote. He also previously disclosed investments in Ethereum (ETH), Velodrome (VELO), Aerodrome Finance (AERO), and The Graph (GRT). The STOCK Act requires US lawmakers to report stock and cryptocurrency trades, and Collins appears to be the only member of Congress to have filed such a report in 2025 so far. SKI experienced large price movements after trading below $0.01 since its launch. The token reached an all-time high of over $0.35 on Dec. 5 before stabilizing. It is unclear if Collins’ investment is connected to his election victory, but he voted in favor of legislation favorable to the crypto industry, including the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act. Despite his investments, Collins has not made crypto much of a focal point of his policy agenda. The broader issue of lawmakers taking part in crypto trading has attracted a lot of criticism. In fact, in July last year, a bipartisan group of senators proposed changes to the STOCK Act to restrict these trades by lawmakers. It is still unclear if Congress will consider similar legislation in its upcoming session. Trump Rally Could Push Bitcoin Before Fed Pullback Despite the optimism surrounding Trump’s influence on the crypto sector in the next year, a Bitcoin rally anticipated ahead of Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration on Jan. 20 may lose steam toward the end of the month as the Federal Reserve prepares its first interest rate decision of 2025. In a Jan. 5 report , 10x Research founder Markus Thielen projected a positive start to the month for Bitcoin, with a rally possibly fueled by favorable inflation data on Jan. 15. However, he also warned that the momentum could weaken ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Jan. 29. Projected Bitcoin path for January 2025 (Source: 10x Research ) According to CME Group’s FedWatch tool , there is an 88.8% chance that the federal target rate will remain between 425 and 450 basis points after the meeting. Bitcoin previously dropped by close to 15% after the Dec. 18 FOMC meeting, when the Federal Reserve reduced its 2025 rate cut projections from five to two. Thielen identified the Federal Reserve’s policies as the primary risk to Bitcoin's rally but pointed out that lower inflation in 2025 could eventually support market optimism. He forecasted Bitcoin will trade between $97,000 and $98,000 by the end of January. John Glover , chief investment officer at crypto lending firm Ledn, suggested that Bitcoin could initially pull back to $89,000 before rebounding to $125,000 by the end of the first quarter. He also predicted further fluctuations, with Bitcoin retracing to $100,000 before targeting $160,000 in late 2025 or early 2026. Crypto fear and greed index (Source: Alternative.me ) Despite short-term volatility, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index returned to the “Extreme Greed” zone on Jan. 5, with a score of 76.

With this, the global crypto market cap is currently valued at $3.51 Trillion. With this, the price of Bitcoin is back around the $100,000 mark, highlighting increased positive influence. With the market sentiments suggesting a bullish outlook, is this a good time to invest in Bitcoin? In this article, we have covered the short-term market sentiment and the possible price of the Bitcoin (BTC) token. BTC Price Retests $100k Mark! The Bitcoin price has successfully regained momentum by recording 7 consecutive days of inflow for the first time since November 2024. Notably, the BTC price has added 1.17% to its valuation in 24 hours and ~6% during the first week of January 2025. TradingView: BTC/USDT Moreover, with a trading volume of $29.147 billion, the BTC price is presently exchanging hands at $99,324.45. Moreover, with a market dominance of 55.9%, it has a market capitalization of $1.959 Trillion, making it the 06th most valued asset in the global market. Bitcoin ETF Update Over the past week, the BTC ETF recorded 2 negative days, 2 positive days, and one neutral day. Reportedly, during this period, Fidelity’s “FBTC” recorded the highest inflow of $275.4 million, followed by Ark’s “ARKB” with $201.5 million. Source: SoSoValue On the negative side, Grayscale’s “GBTC” recorded the highest outflow of $167.2 million, followed by BlackRock’s “IBIT” with $137.5 million. With this, the week concluded with a net flow of +$256 million. BTC Technical Sentiments The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a rising green histogram in the daily time frame. Moreover, its averages record a bullish convergence, suggesting an increase in the buying-over-selling pressure for the largest cryptocurrency. Moreover, the EMA 50-day constantly acts as a support to the Bitcoin price chart. This highlights a bullish outlook for it this week. How High Will Bitcoin Price Go? If the BTC price reclaims the $100k mark, it will head toward its upper resistance level of $102,000. Maintaining the price at that level could set the stage for it to retest its $105k in the upcoming time. Conversely, if the bears outrun the bulls, the Bitcoin price could drop toward its support level of $98,000. Furthermore, if the bears gain control, the price of BTC could retest its low of $95,000.

Though well-liked coins like Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) still draw interest, several altcoins are gathering momentum that might surpass these giants. Compelling use cases, robust foundations, and the possibility for explosive gains abound from these altcoins— Rexas Finance (RXS), SEI, Chainlink (LINK), Polkadot (DOT), Bitget Token (BGI), and Aave (AAVE). These six tokens should especially catch your attention for the following reasons. Rexas Finance (RXS): A New Crypto Star Ready to Shine Rexas Finance (RXS), a cryptocurrency valued at $0.175 but bursting with promise, ranks first on the list. Already generated an incredible $34.6 million and selling over 388.9 million tokens in its 11th presale stage, RXS is rising from an original presale price of $0.03, the token’s explosive appeal among investors is evident; many believe that RXS might reach $10 or more by early 2025 . Blockchain technology bridges conventional assets like real estate and intellectual property, but RXS distinguishes itself with its real-world asset (RWA) tokenizing approach. This invention uses digital ownership to expose investors to tangible assets, offering stability and growth possibilities. Rexas is also a center for creating new crypto projects, featuring a Token Builder and Launchpad. With its listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, RXS is becoming rather popular and is positioned as one of the most exciting tokens for fast profits and a financially safe future. SEI: The High-Performance Blockchain Designed for trading uses and distributed finance (DeFi), SEI is a fast-developing Layer 1 blockchain. Its speed and scalability priorities help the network to manage large transaction volumes with minimum latency. Both retail and institutional investors have taken notice of SEI’s original consensus mechanism and developer-friendly qualities. As DeFi grows, SEI stands to gain from a growing need for scalable, efficient blockchain solutions. SEI could provide outstanding returns during the 2025 bull run with an increasing list of alliances and use cases. Chainlink (LINK): The Backbone of Blockchain Data The leading distributed oracle network Chainlink (LINK) continues to dominate because it effortlessly links smart contracts with facts. Its alliances with elite blockchains and companies are vital in the expanding decentralized finance (DeFi) market. Now is the ideal time to accumulate this utility-rich coin, as LINK trades at a low level compared to its all-time high. Link’s demand and price will skyrocket as more DeFi projects depend on Chainlink for safe data feeds. Hence, by February 2025, it will be a strong competitor for huge profits. Polkadot (DOT): The Multichain Innovator Future blockchain technology depends on DOT’s emphasis on scalability and interoperability, which defines its core nature. Polkadot is an excellent option for those looking for significant returns, as its pricing is still low about its possibilities. As DOT’s ecosystem evolves and adoption increases, its price can increase significantly by 2025. Bitget Token (BGB): A Rising Star in the Exchange Space The Bitget token (BGB) is the native utility token of the Bitget exchange and has been emerging amongst the most efficient platforms in crypto trading to date. BGB holders benefit from lower trading fees, staking rewards, and other special services on the platform. The demand for BGB rises along with Bitget’s ever-growing popularity. BGB has attracted traders and investors by emphasizing user involvement and creative trading instruments. Analysts estimate that BGB’s value might multiply greatly by February 2025 for individuals looking for utility and profitability, making it a tempting choice. Aave (AAVE): The DeFi Giant Not least among leaders in the distributed lending and borrowing scene is Aave (AAVE). Considered the pillar of the DeFi ecosystem, Aave’s approach lets consumers earn interest on loans and deposits without intermediaries. Thanks to AAVE’s immense progress, the DeFi arena is slowly undergoing radical changes. Further innovations, such as the introduction of collateral options and new loan markets, have fortified its place among the top projects, let alone top competitors. Also, given AAVE’s growth expectations, which are aligned with the anticipated growth of the DeFi market by 2025 and beyond, AAVE is due for an extraordinary rally, making it a good buy in both the short and long run. Preparing For The 2025 Bull Run The forthcoming bull run will bring fresh waves of innovation and wealth creation in the bitcoin industry. The secret to grabbing this possibility is diversifying your portfolio with highly potential cryptocurrencies, including Rexas Finance(RXS), SEI, Chainlink(LINK), Polkadot(DOT), Bitget Token(BGB), and Aave(AAVE). As usual, conduct an extensive study and consider each proposal’s long-term viability. With the correct approach, these six cryptocurrencies could lead the charge in the 2025 bull run, providing transforming gains and orienting investors for long-term success in the crypto industry.

Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat (WIF) has caught the crypto world’s attention with its recent price swings. In the past week, WIF’s price climbed by 9.49%, showing signs of recovery. However, over the last month, it faced a significant drop of 37.39%, highlighting its volatility. Despite this, the six-month view shows a growth of 26.73%, suggesting potential long-term interest. Currently trading between $1.73 and $2.02, Dogwifhat is nearing its nearest resistance level at $2.21. A breakthrough here could push the price towards the second resistance at $2.51. On the flip side, the nearest support level sits at $1.61, with a further safety net at $1.32 if the price dips. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $2.12, and the 100-day SMA is $2.05, both above the current price, which may indicate upward momentum. Technical indicators present a mixed outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 39.36, and the Stochastic oscillator is at 16.11, both suggesting that WIF might be approaching oversold territory. Meanwhile, the MACD level is slightly negative at -0.0087, pointing to lingering bearish sentiment. Traders are watching these metrics closely to gauge whether Dogwifhat will continue its recent uptick or face further challenges. SPX6900 (SPX) SPX6900 (SPX) has been on a remarkable upward trajectory. In the past week, its price jumped by 48.41%. Over the last month, it nearly doubled with a 95.53% increase. Looking back six months, the coin’s value skyrocketed by an astounding 1000%, highlighting significant growth potential. Currently trading between $0.71 and $1.04, SPX is approaching its nearest resistance level at $1.15. Breaking through could propel it towards the second resistance at $1.47. On the flip side, the nearest support lies at $0.51, with a secondary support at $0.18, which could act as safety nets if the price dips. Technical indicators present a mixed outlook. The Relative Strength Index is at 51.39, suggesting neutral momentum. The Stochastic oscillator reads 65.61, indicating the asset isn’t overbought yet. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are $1.31 and $1.17 respectively, both above the current price, hinting at potential upward movement. The MACD level of 0.001517 reflects slight bullish sentiment. Based on these factors, SPX6900 may continue its ascent, but traders should monitor resistance levels for signs of a breakout or pullback. Pepe (PEPE) Pepe (PEPE) is making interesting moves. In the past week, its price increased by 9.43%. Over the past month, it decreased by 3.23%. In six months, PEPE surged 124.55%. It is now trading between $0.00001677 and $0.00001924. The coin is near its support level at $0.00001567. The nearest resistance is at $0.00002060, with a second at $0.00002307. Breaking through these could lead to gains. From the current price to the nearest resistance, there’s potential for about a 20% increase. If it falls below support, it might drop to $0.00001320. Technical indicators are mixed. The RSI is at 34.98, close to oversold territory. The Stochastic is at 17.07, also hinting oversold. The MACD is slightly negative. With 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages around $0.00002070, PEPE trades below these averages. This might mean an upward correction is possible. Conclusion With Dogecoin’s outlook fading, smart investors favor WIF, SPX, PEPE, but especially XYZ—the pioneering memecoin uniting sports fans and aiming for massive growth within the XYZverse ecosystem.

As Finbold research found, such positive developments also brought an increase in the number of Bitcoin ATMs installed worldwide by 2,217 within 366 days – a 6.02% year-over-year (YoY) rise. The United States remained dominant, commanding an impressive 81.27% of the market share. It entered the new year with 31,505 machines—3.6% or 1,094 more than on January 1, 2024—to the world’s 38,768, per the data Finbold retrieved from Coin ATM Radar . !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); Growth in BTC ATMs in 2024 demonstrated the correlation between the crypto market’s bull cycle and worldwide interest in digital assets infrastructure. U.S. remains dominant, but Europe keeps consistently growing its market share Though the 38,768 recorded on January 1, 2025, does not constitute an all-time high – there were 39,954 such machines in December 2022 – it is nonetheless a significant number, particularly as the total number of Bitcoin ATMs fell to 33,076 in July 2023. Additionally, despite Europe’s minuscule market share, the continent remains interesting as the only major region with consistent growth in the number of BTC ATMs. Specifically, unlike the worldwide and U.S. numbers, which experienced a significant drop during the ‘crypto winter,’ Europe witnessed a consistent rise. Finally, the trend continued in 2024 when the continent added 116 new ATMs. Though the number is small in absolute terms, it does constitute a decent 7.5% yearly increase and enabled Europe to increase its global market share from 4.23% to 4.29%, partially at the expense of the still-dominant U.S. whose commands fell from 83.2% at the start of 2024 to 81.27% at the start of 2025. BTC ATM growth slowed down after April despite crypto’s record November gains Elsewhere, the data reveals another interesting fact about the 2024 cryptocurrency bull market : despite multiple digital assets, including Bitcoin, hitting their ATHs in the second half of the year, most ATM installations took place in the first and second quarters. By late April, there were 1,942 new BTC ATMs in the world, as Finbold reported at the time. This means that between January and April, an average of 485 machines were installed monthly, and between May and December, the number collapsed to 34.

By only attending blockchain-focused events, the community becomes insular, leaving out opportunities for cross-pollination with experts in other fields. “Classifying common cryptography and decentralization initiatives as ‘non-crypto’ is a huge failure,” tweeted Buterin. He added that this failure is largely from the side of the crypto industry and stressed the urgent need to act in this context.

In his tweets, he expressed the urgent need to outgrow mere insular discussions and for the crypto world to start establishing realms of connection with the communities outside the blockchain. This shift may not only see the crypto industry grab more insights on the table but also aid blockchain knowledge dissemination for technology skeptics across different fields. Forging these relations could bring up a coalesced strategy for tackling global issues such as data protection, digital sovereignty, and decentralization .

Shaw, co-founder of ai16z , on a Delphi Digital podcast said that decentralized funding and market intelligence would combine to create the most sustainable source of transformative potential within the space of crypto. “The market is a form of intelligence, identifies opportunity, applies capital, and optimizes to the best version of things,” Shaw comments. He adds that, “The main problem in crypto is that people hit that emotional tone but haven’t delivered.” His vision resonates with Vitalik Buterin’s call for crypto to conduct innovation together with fields outside of crypto. The industry will have to conquer the preconceived notions and misconceptions on both ends. Mainstream technologists usually look at blockchain initiatives as too speculative or financially driven, whereas crypto people may as well dismiss knowledge outside of their area of interest. However, the advantages far outweigh the downsides.

A 500% surge saw the category grow from a market cap of $20B in January to over $120B by the end of the year. The DWF Ventures report showed that what started as a satirical commentary on crypto assets with Dogecoin has evolved into a sophisticated “market vertical” attracting significant institutional attention and capital flows. Memecoins like Andy Eth and Chill Guy, launched in 2024, reported gains of over 47,000%. Early adopters of such projects added huge profits to their portfolios. According to DWF Labs, the success of memecoins challenged conventional notions of asset fundamentals and intrinsic value. The report suggested social capital and community consensus in the digital economy could be as powerful as traditional financial metrics. Memecoin generators drive asset class achievements despite drawdowns Pump(.)fun kicked off 1st day of 2025 with a bang, raking in $14M in daily revenue 🔸They’ve deployed 5.55M tokens so far, dominated 52.8% of Solana DEX activity in December-2024 🔸Memecoin mania isn’t slowing down – Solana Meme marketcap stands at $21.5B and Pump(.)fun… pic.twitter.com/Eb6pTaKX5y — 🔸BΞRIT🔸 (@Berit1p) January 5, 2025 The DWF report emphasized that much of the achievement seen in the memecoin sector was driven by platforms such as Pump.fun, which allow for fast and easy token creation. Pump.fun was one of the top revenue-generating dApps in 2024 despite challenging market conditions. Thousands of meme tokens were generated and launched within minutes in the first few months following the platform’s debut. The influx of launched memecoin tokens, however, raised a debate over the dilution of capital and attention during the course of the year. As per the report, memecoins were also boosted by listings on top exchanges like Binance. Over 80% of memecoins listed on Binance in 2024 witnessed significant growth as tokens like MOODENG, WIF, and POPCAT surged by 200%. The report pointed out that memecoins had a strong appeal among young investors, signaling how this particular group perceived community engagement and wealth building. Young investors did not just view memecoins as worthless tokens but rather as representative of a digital culture that served as a symbol of community expression. The market expects memecoins to replicate last year’s performance as 2025 kicks off on a high. Chainalysis observed a rising interest in memecoins, particularly in Africa, where most meme token owners traded them primarily for income instead of portfolio diversification. “Someone is always going to be interested in a token that seems like it could make you the next couple thousand dollars,” -Moyo Sodipo, co-founder of Nigerian crypto exchange Busha The report noted that memecoins outperformed well-established crypto assets like Bitcoin during market uptrends. Conversely, they also underperformed major crypto assets during market downtrends. Memecoins extend beyond speculation and value creation According to the DWF Labs report, memecoins represented a new form of socially coordinated value creation. The tokens served as vehicles for shared cultural experiences, community expression, and digital identity. The transformation of digital asset value creation gave rise to a new model where social capital and community-driven growth became the core drivers of success. The dissolved barriers between creators and markets were replaced by decentralized mechanisms and systems that enabled rapid deployment and community formation. The shift in the memecoin sector was particularly evident in 2024 when the fusion of financial markets and social dynamics created unmatched opportunities for generating value. Unique categories within the memecoin ecosystem generated value across different societal themes and trends to produce high returns. It demonstrated how the memecoin subcategories co-existed, indicating the market’s capacity to support multiple parallel utility-enhanced tokens. Established meme tokens like SHIB and DOGE proved the viability of meme-based projects, while newer assets like WIF demonstrated the market’s appetite for well-executed memecoin launches. The most compelling development was the introduction of cross-vertical tokens that combined utility with the viral nature of memes. It was particularly captured in AI-themed memecoins, where the transformative potential of AI was met by the cultural resonance of memes. According to the DWF report, this created a more sophisticated value proposition that appealed to institutional and retail participants.

A breakout beyond the range may trigger a fresh rise to the upper targets above $2 Avalanche (AVAX) Price Analysis The AVAX price is testing the resistance zone between $44.55 and $45.10 after rebounding from the interim lows The volume has dropped, which suggests a drop in its momentum as well, which could hinder the progress of the rally However, the RSI is incremental, which suggests the price may breach the resistance zone and eventually make it to $50.

What will now change in the country’s tax base? The Russian government has passed a bill regulating cryptocurrency taxation . Prepared by the Ministry of Finance, the bill gives crypto property status, as local media reports. This means companies must pay income tax on crypto transactions, while individuals will be subject to personal income tax. The rate for Russian citizens will vary from next year depending on their income — from 13% to 22%. Crypto transactions will not be subject to value-added tax though. Citizens and legal entities must report crypto transactions to the Federal Tax Service if receipts and write-offs exceed 600,000 rubles per year (about $6,000 as of press time). Crypto mining infrastructure operators will be required to transfer data on the services rendered to the tax service. If the information is not received within the specified period, the site will face a fine of 40,000 rubles (about $400). It is noteworthy that the bill was prepared back in December 2020, but back then its consideration stalled. The adoption of the provision appeared after crypto mining was legalized in Russia on Nov. 1, 2024. After registering in a special register of the tax service, companies and individual entrepreneurs can mine crypto (e.g. Bitcoin). How will the tax on profits from crypto be paid? The tax on mining profits will involve two steps. First, miners will make an advance payment when receiving cryptocurrency in their wallets. Then, an additional tax will apply when the digital assets are sold. If the value of the mined coins increases after the initial payment, miners will owe more tax. Conversely, if the value drops, overpayments can be recorded as losses. According to the latest proposal from the Russian Ministry of Finance, the tax rate for the sale of cryptocurrencies may be 13% starting in 2025 and 15% if the citizen’s income exceeds 2.4 million rubles (about $24,000) annually. As Russian state-controlled media Interfax reports , digital currency is recognized as property for the purposes of the Tax Code. The same principle was included in the bill during its first reading, which took place more than three years ago. Income from transactions with digital currency will be included in the general tax base along with revenue from the sale of shares, bonds, investment units, repo transactions with securities, and income from transactions with securities in individual investment accounts and deposits in Russian banks. This will come into force in 2025.

If this amount is exceeded, the tax will be 15% of the amount exceeding 2.4 million rubles, plus a fixed amount of 312,000 rubles (about $3,100), corresponding to 13% of 2.4 million rubles. In addition, the ministry will determine the amount of tax as follows: the tax base will be determined based on the market price of the digital currency at the time of receiving income. Foreign trading organizations will set the market price (closing price) based on transactions concluded during the day. Foreign trading organizations are those whose digital currency trading volume exceeds 100 billion rubles ($1 billion) per day. If transactions for the same cryptocurrency were carried out on two or more foreign crypto exchanges, the taxpayer can independently choose the market price. In this case, the proceeds from the sale of cryptocurrency will be calculated based on the actual selling price, but not lower than the market price reduced by 20%. Russia follows North America’s path The media noted that the mechanism for paying taxes on cryptocurrency is formed according to the North American approach. As Oleg Ogienko, deputy director general for communications at BitRiver, explained, the miner’s profit tax is levied upon receipt of crypto in a wallet minus reasonable and documented expenses. Miners may also reclaim part of the tax paid if their expenses are proven necessary. “As far as can be seen, the proposed mechanism is formed according to the North American approach. That is. First, the miner’s profit tax is levied upon receipt of cryptocurrency in his wallet, minus reasonable and documented expenses. Then, the miner’s capital gains tax is levied when the cryptocurrency is disposed of from its original wallet.” Oleg Ogienko Unlike Russia, U.S. taxation varies based on how long the cryptocurrency is held. Short-term holdings are taxed at rates between 10% and 37%, depending on income. Long-term holders enjoy lower rates of 0%, 15%, or 20%.

Fraudsters also target the SHIB community with fake giveaways, phishing emails, and forged social media accounts. Users should protect their information and report suspicious activities. ‘Stay Safe, SHIBARMY!’ Wrongdoers often target the vast Shiba Inu (SHIB) community, which consists of millions of investors, proponents, and developers. They use different methods to embezzle unsuspecting victims, often conning them with fake offers about assets part of the meme coin’s ecosystem. The most recent scheme includes TREAT, a reward token that provides incentives for users engaging with Shiba Inu’s protocols, including the layer-2 scaling solution Shibarium. The team recently announced that its official launch will be on January 14 . While the development sparked huge enthusiasm across the community, Shibarium Trustwatch (an X account that aims to provide security) warned users to remain extra careful until that date. The team claimed that scammers have used the ongoing excitement as an opportunity to offer fake TREAT services to people, alerting users to stay away from such dubious individuals. “They are now using SHIB socials linked to their FAKE TREAT. Please don’t be misled by these predatory scammers. They can be called vultures, circling and looking for their next feed. We ask with heaven on our side, please do not fall for these scams. Be clear: the TREAT launch is scheduled for the 14th of January 2025, not before. If you are unsure about anything at any time , check with us first. Stay safe, SHIBARMY,” the warning reads. Previous Alerts Around Christmas, Shibarium Trustwatch warned people to stay vigilant for several common crypto scams that may result in crucial losses. Some examples are fake giveaways, which offer “free” tokens, merchandise, or NFTs, and phishing emails. The team claimed fraudsters send emails to victims, pretending to be from official SHIB-related projects, thus trying to steal their login credentials. Other things the community should watch out for include fake social media accounts, Ponzi schemes, forgery charity appeals, and more. “Providing personal information or falling for these scams doesn’t just put you at risk – it may lead to your data being sold on the dark web, where hackers can use it for identity theft or other malicious activities. Scammers exploit trust, kindness, and generosity, especially during the holiday season, so we must stay vigilant,” the team said at the time .

Accordingly, Vivek Ramaswamy's asset management firm Strive Asset has filed a new spot Bitcoin ETF application with the SEC. The fund, called the “Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF,” aims to invest in convertible bonds of companies like MicroStrategy to buy Bitcoin. The Strive firm said it estimates that at least 80 percent of the New York-listed ETF's nominal exposure will be to “Bitcoin bonds” issued by MicroStrategy and other companies. Strive announced last November the establishment of a new asset management unit that integrates Bitcoin into client portfolios. As it is known, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. Accordingly, the SEC approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock, Vanguard, Franklin Templeton, Valkyre, Fidelity and Invesco. This approval is seen as a turning point for the crypto market, and with Donald Trump's new administration, altcoin ETFs such as Solana (SOL), XRP and Litecoin (LTC) are also expected to be approved, apart from Bitcoin and Etheruem. *This is not investment advice.

His win is seen as a positive development for the sector, as Trump has pledged to introduce policies that support the growth of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. With Trump set to take office on January 20, 2025, the crypto market is watching closely for potential impacts, especially on Bitcoin. Experts are expecting significant growth for the crypto market after the inauguration. But what can we expect in the coming months? Bitcoin Market Outlook: What to Expect After Inauguration Most experts believe the crypto market, especially Bitcoin, will experience notable growth after January 20. This belief is supported by recent market activity. A trader recently invested over $6 million in Bitcoin call options with a $100,000 strike price, showing confidence in a price rally by March 28, 2025. Additionally, $120,000 strike price call options are gaining popularity, signaling further market optimism. BTC Price History On November 5, 2024, Bitcoin was trading around $69,388.88. The market saw impressive growth in November, rising by 37.4%, making it the second-largest monthly increase of that year. However, December saw a significant downturn, with Bitcoin’s monthly returns dropping from 34.4% to -3.19%, one of its worst performances in 2024. As 2025 began, Bitcoin’s price was $95,581.28. Since then, it has steadily climbed by at least 3.37%. At the moment, Bitcoin is priced at $98,799.91, still about 9.68% below its all-time high of $108,368.17. Could Pro-Crypto Policies Boost Bitcoin? Many experts expect that Trump’s administration will announce pro-crypto policies after his inauguration. If these policies come to fruition, they could give the crypto market, especially Bitcoin, a significant boost. A crypto-friendly government could inspire greater confidence among investors and lead to more innovation within the crypto sector. Looking Ahead While many are hopeful about the potential impact of a crypto-positive administration, there are concerns about the risks of delayed policy implementation. Any hesitation in introducing supportive measures could lead to market volatility, affecting investor sentiment and slowing growth. In conclusion, as Bitcoin’s bullish momentum continues, the market is eagerly awaiting pro-crypto announcements and regulatory changes after Trump’s inauguration. If these policies are put into action, the crypto market, especially Bitcoin, could experience a major upward push.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-06 11:58:27

It's not just the numbers: Bitcoin's 8% recovery from late December, but the news flow is equally recognizable. Perhaps the most important note comes from JPMorgan, which says the market forces that drove bitcoin and gold to records last year are still around. ""The debasement trade is here to stay, with both gold and Bitcoin becoming increasingly important components of investors' portfolios,"" the investment bank wrote. The debasement trade is a strategy where investors buy assets that protect against declines in fiat currencies and government bonds due to inflation and policy shifts. Last year's debasement play drove bitcoin above $100,000 — a figure it's approaching again — and gold over $2,600. The rallies were fueled by increased geopolitical uncertainty, persistent inflation concerns, debt debasement in advanced economies, fears of fiat currency devaluation in emerging markets and a shift away from the U.S. dollar. Coupled with President-elect Donald Trump's pro-crypto stance, this led to a record $78 billion in net inflows into the digital assets market, according to JPMorgan. Any discordant tone comes from elevated bond yields and a strong dollar driven by economic optimism and declining Fed rate-cut bets, which could limit upside potential in the short term. This Friday's nonfarm payrolls report will provide a critical test for the hawkish Fed narrative, with expectations for 154,000 job additions in December. The shenanigans surrounding BTC-holder MicroStrategy (MSTR) deserve attention, particularly the social-media buzz about brokers reducing their exposure to the company. This reduction comes alongside significant increases in margin requirements, raising concerns about potential volatility. Meanwhile, crypto economist Ben Lilly suggests that ether’s price has been suppressed by the growing number of coins locked up in the DeFi protocol Ethena, which shorts ETH futures as part of a delta-neutral hedge strategy to maintain the $1 peg of its stablecoin, USDe. ETH has jumped 10% in the first six days of the year but remains well below its record high. ""This suggests a shift in the market toward delta-neutral exposure on ETH instead of seeking upside by holding it as collateral. Thus, the ETH price is likely to be muted on the upside because of Ethena,"" Lilly said on X . Ethena has announced plans to launch iUSDe , a version designed for institutional investors seeking exposure to yield-bearing USDe without direct token interaction. Meanwhile, the leading on-chain perp DEX exchange, Hyperliquid, has listed SOLV, the native token of the Bitcoin staking protocol Solv Protocol, and whispers are circulating about whales looking to buy up the HYPE token.

The token started as a satire on the S&P 500 equity index and has since captured a dedicated community that hopes to one day flip the capitalization of the entire U.S. stock market, which was valued at just over $44 trillion as of Monday. A manifesto on the SPX6900 site speaks to a generation facing economic challenges, positioning the token as a ""reset"" for the stock market. The community's rallying cry, ""stop trading and start believing in something,"" has fostered a strong, belief-driven following. This slogan encourages long-term holding over short-term trading, fostering a community of ""diamond-handed"" believers. This culture prioritizes faith in the project's potential over immediate financial gains. Derivatives Positioning Most large-cap tokens have seen price gains in the past 24 hours. The increases are accompanied by muted cumulative volume delta and limited growth in futures open interest, indicating a lack of strong buying pressure and raising concerns about the sustainability of these gains. The BTC options market shows renewed buying in calls at strikes $100,000 and $120,000, anticipating a rally to new lifetime highs. Dealers are net short gamma at the $100,000 strike, which means a breakout above that level could see them trade in the direction of the market to maintain their net exposure neutral. That could add to the upward momentum. Similar negative gamma is seen in ETH between $3,650 and $3,850 strikes. Traders have sold upside optionality in SOL.

However, before this can happen, XRP has to face a significant challenge: a short-term price correction. Despite the positive long-term view, the asset is expected to face a pullback before any meaningful rally can take place. Resistance at $2.73 is currently the key level XRP must overcome for further price movement. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez sees this resistance as crucial for the maintenance of a bullish trend of XRP. Related Reading: Dogecoin To Hit $1? Expert Calls It A Realistic Goal For 2025 – Here’s Why The Critical Breakthrough Breaking through at $2.73 and following with upward motion might open a gateway to seeing the digital asset touch $11. However, failing to do so could spell trouble for the coin, bringing it down all the way to a potential low of $2.05. Given the very volatile price range, investors are watching the movement of XRP closely to know whether it is going to rally or correct. $XRP is still consolidating within the pennant of a massive bull pennant pattern. Until the $2.73 resistance is broken, a pullback to $2.05 remains possible before a potential breakout to $11! pic.twitter.com/ET39FJMtAc — Ali (@ali_charts) January 4, 2025 Technical Viewpoint In terms of technical analysis, other well-known analysts following the Elliott Wave Theory says XRP is in a correction. Having gone through a five-wave impulsive rally, they believe that XRP is now setting up for an ABC correction pattern. This type of correction usually comes after a long rally and acts as a breather before the next big move. Other analysts expect the correction to end around mid-January 2024, thereby giving traders a good opportunity to buy in before a new rally. This correction may temporarily push the price down, but it could set the stage for a much bigger increase in the coming months. Bullish Sentiment With all the associated risks of short-term price correction, overall sentiment is still heavily bullish for XRP. One of the major reasons for this is a resolution that just recently happened with regard to Ripple’s long-running court case with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A favorable ruling on the case lifted much of the uncertainty from XRP’s regulatory standing in the public eye and made it one of the most attractive investments for many. Positive: Expectations for more accommodative crypto-friendly policies from the government and not one for broader market, creating an upward momentum. Related Reading: XRP Price Sets Sights on New Gains: Bulls Poised for Action A Brighter Future Ahead For XRP? Although correction in the near term can be expected, a long-term view about XRP still bodes quite well. When this correction plays out as expected, it can get a good entry point for those interested in investing with the potential next rally. The road to $11 is still ahead but if XRP keeps on the same track, it will be a show to behold. As usual, traders and investors need to remain vigilant in the expectation of key resistance levels and market trends. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $2.41, up 0.1% and 15.4% in the daily and weekly timeframes.

Can both of these altcoins continue to copy Bitcoin by getting back to their all-time highs? Total3 altcoin market cap continues to recover Source: TradingView First of all, in order to see how altcoins are doing generally, it is good to look at the Total3 chart. This tracks the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies, excluding $BTC and $ETH. The chart shows that after a big 26% retracement, the altcoin market cap is once more heading skywards. The horizontal resistances at $1.05 trillion and $1.13 trillion are still to be overcome, but if one looks at the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI momentum indicator is showing a potential cross back up, leading to the big momentum needed to break these resistances. This cross up will be confirmed or not at the end of the week. $AVAX bulls have much to do Source: TradingView Looking at the weekly chart for $AVAX, besides seeing that the price has broken out of the long downtrend and has confirmed the break, this chart does not read well. If we are entering the final stage of the bull market, one would expect $AVAX to be somewhere near its previous all-time high, rather than 70% away from it. A higher high is of the utmost importance for $AVAX bulls to achieve as an absolute minimum. That said, in their favour is the possibility that the weekly Stochastic RSI is shaping to cross back up, bringing plenty of momentum under the price. $RENDER surge has potential Source: TradingView Up more than 5% on Monday so far, the $RENDER price is heading back to its all-time high, and unlike as for $AVAX, it may get back there. This is a much better looking chart, and it can be seen that the 0.618 and 0.786 Fibonacci levels are very obtainable, at $9.86, and $11.60 respectively. Weekly Stochastic RSI positive across crypto One thing that all three charts have in common is the Stochastic RSI, for all of them this indicator on the weekly is showing a potential cross up. If you throw into the mix that this is also the case for Bitcoin, a strong rally across the board for crypto could be on the cards soon.

He also said tokenization is likely to revolutionize equity markets by democratizing access for smaller businesses. In a January 4 X post , Horsley said that “people have focused on the demand side” up until now when it comes to tokenization. He noted that “there’s value there,” before adding that he thinks “the demand side is potentially not the revolutionary story.” The true potential of tokenization is on the s upply side Up until now, much of the discussion around tokenization has been centered on its demand-side benefit, such as enabling investors in the retail market to gain access to money market funds. However, Horsley believes the real potential of tokenization lies in the supply side. According to the Bitwise Asset Management CEO, tokenization offers a new avenue for small and medium-size businesses to get exposure to capital markets. “Today, there are around 4,600 companies in the US that are able to access the public equity markets,” he noted in the X post. There are also around 200,000 companies in the US that are generating over $10 million in revenue, he added. Many of these companies, according to Horsley, want to go public but lack the necessary scale. He believes that the supply side of tokenization could be a “revolutionary new possibility” for companies that don’t currently have the scale required to go public. AI could trigger a wave of micro companies Horsley also shared a prediction for the emerging artificial intelligence (AI) space. He expects “an explosion of companies” in the sector soon. Corollary thought: I think AI may lead to an explosion of companies, and tokenized companies. The theory: – A single person can use AI to make a much more niche version of a software service- eg mobile only CRM for independent electricians that need to conform to California… https://t.co/NLmOD1vGBo — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) January 4, 2025 “AI could massively increase the number of niche businesses,” the Bitwise CEO said. Although he believes these AI companies “could never go public,” he speculates they could benefit from tokenization and potentially form part of a “major new long-tail capital market.” 2025 will be the year of ‘Bitcoin Standard Corporations’ Along with the tokenization and AI predictions, Horsley also said that 2025 could be the year “Bitcoin Standard Corporations” capture investors’ attention. The pioneer in this space is MicroStrategy , steered by executive and BTC bull Michael Saylor. Since 2022, the software firm has been aggressively accumulating Bitcoin. Saylor once again posted a picture of the SaylorTracker chart on Sunday. In the past, these posts have been followed by an announcement of a MicroStrategy Bitcoin buy. Other companies have started to follow MicroStrategy’s lead in adding BTC to their balance sheets. Japan-based Metaplanet has also recently expressed intentions to buy Bitcoin. 11 publicly traded companies bought more Bitcoin since last Monday according to @HODL15Capital 2025 is going to see a lot of corporations joining the Bitcoin standard. @saylor has written the playbook for a movement. https://t.co/gZ9Jk2oV4B — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) January 5, 2025 Horsley predicted that “a lot” more companies will join the “Bitcoin standard” in 2025.

In his latest tweet, the exec announced plans to expand Metaplanet’s Bitcoin holdings to 10,000 BTC. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Expansion To achieve the 10k BTC milestone, Gerovich said that the company plans to utilize accretive capital market tools. The focus will also be on enhancing transparency and shareholder engagement through new initiatives. The firm aims to leverage partnerships to drive Bitcoin adoption not just in Japan but across the world as well. Additionally, Metaplanet will explore opportunities to deepen its impact on the Japanese market and the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. “Last year was transformational, as we broke records, expanded our Bitcoin treasury, and reinforced our position as Asia’s leading Bitcoin Treasury Company. This year, we’re laser-focused on execution and driving even greater value for our shareholders.” Gerovich had previously stated that if the United States adopts Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, it could ignite a global domino effect and would ultimately prompt other nations to follow suit. He highlighted Japan as a prime example, describing it as a country that often looks to the US for guidance. The Metaplanet exec had also expressed confidence that if the US under President Trump takes this step, Japan and other Asian countries are likely to mirror the move. These comments were made during Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin New Year’s Eve party in Florida, where discussions centered on the growing influence of Bitcoin in global economic strategies. 2025: “Arrival of Corporates” Meanwhile, Gerovich’s revelations for 2025 come a fortnight after Metaplanet purchased 619.7 BTC in its largest-ever acquisition as part of its Bitcoin Treasury Operations. This stash was worth around $60.6 million at that time. The subsequent purchases have pushed the Tokyo-listed firm holdings to 1,761 BTC. Experts suggest that a major theme in 2025 could be the “arrival of corporates” amidst the increasing trend of corporations adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Among the top corporate holders of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy leads the pack at 446,400 BTC, followed by Marathon Digital with 44,394 BTC and Riot with 17,429 BTC.

As a result, the fear of a potential Bitcoin price drop below $90k has significantly declined. Moreover, Bitcoin’s fear and greed index has surged to 76 percent, which represents extreme greed from investors. However, the mentions of Bitcoin price to $110k remains lower compared to two weeks ago, suggesting the crowd is eerily quiet awaiting clear signs. Bitcoin has scratched its way back to a high of $99.8K to kick off the new week.

Furthermore, the flagship coin has formed a potential head and shoulder (H&S) pattern coupled with a bearish divergence on the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI). However, Bitcoin price has consistently closed above the 50-day Moving Average (MA), signaling the bulls are gradually gaining ground. Amid the low bullish sentiment from the crowd, a potential surprise rally could push Bitcoin price beyond $100k soon.

MiCA is a bespoke rulebook for crypto companies that requires firms to receive a Crypto Asset Service Provider (CASP) license from one member state which then enables them to operate across the entire European Union. The European Union set a Dec. 30 deadline for its member states to implement MiCA, though not all countries have managed to . “MiCA represents a pivotal moment for the European digital asset industry, and we’re proud to have worked collaboratively with the Dutch AFM to be among the first to embrace this new regulatory framework,” said Ivan Soto-Wright, CEO and co-founder of MoonPay, in a statement. Fan engagement platform Socios.com secured authorization from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), it said in a statement on Monday. The approval is for a class 3 Virtual Financial Assets Act (VFAA) license that will enable it to operate as a regulated Virtual Financial Asset service provider.

Several tokens seemed to be primed for a moonshot. Cardano is resurgent, Tron is trying to inch its way up the ranking tables, and XRP is back at number three. Even the Rollblock presale hits $8 million. What is the hottest crypto to buy now? Let’s make an attempt to find out. Rollblock (RBLK): Hottest crypto to buy now for future income All tokens do well in a bull run, but how about when the markets go into a downturn? This is where Rollblock comes in with its revenue-sharing mechanism. Online gaming is massive, to the tune of $500 billion per annum. Rollblock is now allowing retail investors to take a moonshot investment in this lucrative sector. Rollblock’s ace up its sleeve: it is a revenue-sharing token. Even when token prices are down, Rollblock will give its token holders a share of the income generated from the online casino, which means Rollblock delivers a passive income. Not many other tokens can make that claim. Rollblock has already made over $8 million in presale income, which is a great portent of things to come! Cardano (ADA): Hottest crypto to buy now for institutional reach RFK mentioned he would like to see the United States log its expenditures on a blockchain. This is a genius idea, and if it is to be done, Cardano would be the one to do it. Cardano was built for this stuff: institutional and industrial-level blockchain, and Cardano already has a track record here. Should RFK get his wish and Cardano gets the nod, expect the Cardano price to not just do a moonshot, but to head to Jupiter! Cardano is already up 254% this year, and it is just the start. Tron (TRX): Hottest crypto to buy now for Web3 development The entire concept behind crypto is decentralization, and Tron’s mission is to decentralize the entire internet. And why not? Tron is onto a brilliant idea here, and the good news is that Tron is still in its infancy. Buying Tron now at $0.26 is like purchasing a Manhattan penthouse for five dollars. This project is prime real estate, and it will go far! As Web3 takes over and more decentralization occurs, Tron will be at the coalface of this development. Tron is already a top 10 token and will go even further. XRP (XRP): Hottest crypto to buy now for TradFi hedging Crypto and TradFi should be mortal enemies, but even Bill Gates has Apple shares. XRP leverages TradFi for its growth as this is the preferred protocol for interbank transfers. The Asian banking markets are betting heavily on XRP, with XRP and Ripplenet already legislated in some regions. XRP has overtaken Tether (AGAIN!) to reclaim its place as the third-ranked token by market cap. Conclusion Investors looking for a moonshot token are spoiled for choice, with any of XRP, Tron, Cardano, or Rollblock able to deliver during 2025. However, only one of these tokens also has the promise to deliver once the market cools down, and that’s Rollblock. Price growth and a passive income? Rollblock is the hottest crypto to buy now to future proof your investment portfolio. Rollblock is now available at$0.0445. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

A report from local media outlet VnExpress claims four individuals, including 41-year-old Tran Minh Quang, have been arrested in Dong Nai Province in connection with the elaborate fraud. The scam in question was orchestrated via a fake cryptocurrency mining platform dubbed BitMiner, which offered unrealistic profit potential for investments. To mislead local authorities, the website was hosted on a domain based outside the country in Singapore. Tran Minh Quang arrested by Vietnam police. Source: VnExpress. Quang, who is considered the mastermind behind the scheme, and his co-conspirators advertised BitMiner as a Dubai-based company, leveraging the city’s reputation as a global crypto hub to gain investor trust and mask their true intentions. The scam According to authorities, the group recruited several promoters by promising them profits to bring in new investors. The promoters were trained to present BitMiner as a legitimate and highly profitable cryptocurrency mining platform equipped with advanced artificial intelligence-powered technologies. Further, they are equipped with manipulated trading accounts and other marketing materials to mislead victims into investing in several investment packages offered by the scammers. BitMiner offered four mining packages, namely Red Diamond, Blue Diamond, Diamond Gold, Black Diamond, and Green Diamond, each claiming to offer different levels of mining speed and profitability. To make the facade appear more real, investors were also invited to participate in online forums and training sessions where they were given presentations about advanced AI-powered mining technologies and promised guaranteed returns on their investments, the report added. However, instead of being used for cryptocurrency mining, all the funds collected from the victims were funnelled directly into digital wallets controlled by Minh and his accomplices. Authorities estimate that the scheme defrauded investors of approximately 4 billion Vietnamese dong (US$157,300) before it was dismantled. A surge in crypto scams in Vietnam Authorities in Vietnam have had to deal with several major cryptocurrency-related scams over the past few months. Last month, Police in Hanoi raided the headquarters of Million Smiles, a scam crypto firm that sold a fake cryptocurrency to investors and raked in over 30 billion Vietnamese dongs valued at over $1 million. Dubbed the Quantum Financial System coin, the token was advertised as being backed by ancient treasures, but in reality, it was just a gimmick. Funds acquired from investments were used for the scammers’ personal gains and used to acquire office spaces in upscale villa areas to add more legitimacy to the entire act. Similarly, in October, law enforcement took down a global crypto fraud network running romance scams operated by bad actors from the Laos’ Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone. The scheme promoted another fake platform dubbed Biconomynft, which accrued over 17.6 billion VND while the scam was operational. As previously reported by Invezz, the crypto sector lost over $3.6 billion to cryptocurrency investment scams in 2024.

The leading altcoins’ on-chain metrics back trader sentiments, leading to more inflows. Other assets have also moved similarly, springing up debates on the altcoin season. ETH Futures Market Fuels Bull Projections Crypto analyst ShayanBTC points to a positive futures market for Ethereum as a main indicator of the general sentiment. Specifically, the Taker Buy Sell Ratio shows how buyers and sellers execute orders. At present levels above 1, buyers are setting the tone, increasing pressure as projected by bulls. This follows the slight market correction seen towards the end of last year after the ETH price slipped below $3,500. The downtrend wiped out billions from the market cap and creeping trading volume. However, bulls were repositioned to buy the dip with high-value accumulations at the end of the year. According to ShayanBTC, present data shows a massive shift coupled with soaring investor confidence in Ethereum. At the time of writing, Ethereum’s price moved up to $3,634, a 2.3% growth today, adding to its 8% weekly run. The first week of 2025 was also marked by increasing trading volumes and decentralized finance (DeFi) activity. “ The Taker Buy Sell Ratio, a pivotal metric for assessing sentiment in the futures market, provides insights into whether buyers or sellers are more aggressive in executing market orders. Following Ethereum’s bullish rebound near the $3K support, this metric has exhibited a notable uptick, indicating a surge in market buy orders within the futures market,” he added. Institutional Volume Spikes Crypto institutional volume has recorded huge growth in the past two weeks as the U.S. regulatory terrain is expected to cool. Ethereum has led altcoins in these inflows due to its range of smart contracts and staking mechanisms. Other altcoins like XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano also saw increased demand. This week, XRP topped USDT to become the third-largest crypto by market capitalization. The asset surged over 10% this week as institutional demand flows in on the back of anticipated spot ETFs in the United States. XRP bulls set sights on a price above $3 in the next bull peak. Solana is already up 11% this year, trading at $216, while Cardano notched a huge 20% inflow last week.

While the Web3 gaming sector has attracted fewer internal investments, it appears some companies have plans to revive both on-chain activity and gaming. ZKCandy, a new L2 created specifically for Web3 gaming, has closed a $4M round with Animoca Brands in participation. As Web3 gaming fell off the narrative map, insider funds are still supporting projects in a bid to revive the mix of traditional and on-chain games. 🎉 Funding the Future: #ZKcandy has successfully secured $4M 🎉 With participation from @WemixNetwork , @animocaventures , @TheSpartanGroup , @thejinkang (Perlone Capital), @Presto_Labs , @flowdesk_co , @LECCAVentures , @efrontier_io , @prometheuz_io We're deeply thankful to our… pic.twitter.com/IXclsikc8K — ZKcandy 🍬⛓️ – L2 Gaming ZK Chain (@ZKcandyHQ) January 6, 2025 Wemix, one of the leading producers of on-chain games also joined Animoca Brands in the funding round. Other participants in the funding included Spartan Group and Perlone Capital. The deal is the first significant funding in the new year, following 12 months of recovering VC inflows . “ We want to bring in top games and other large IPs and create a space where users can enjoy smooth, secure, and rewarding experiences,” said Lau Kin Wai, CEO of ZKCandy. Animoca Brands and Wemix have also explored offering free-to-play games without the on-chain component. ZKCandy will offer a seamless tool to add tokens without requiring significant fees. The project launched with the support of iCandy, an award-winning game developer focused on the Asia-Pacific region. The company has built more than 500 games, reaching a market of 300M players. The company produces idle games and puzzles, which have been combined in the past with on-chain activity and tokens. The public gaming company is based in Australia. The gaming company itself has raised $37.5M through several funding rounds and is backed by a collection of unannounced investors. Some of the funding rounds come with the support of Animoca Brands and eSports.com. ZKCandy is based on ZKSync technology ZKCandy uses ZKSync to create a new fast L2 network, which would become the basis for a new gaming ecosystem. Previously, other L1 and L2 chains carried games, though most became unsustainable due to the dropping price of their tokens. Web3 games also tried to include NFT ownership, which led to an outflow of players during the 2022 bear market. Most surviving Web3 gaming projects put the player experience first, while being more cautious with tokens and in-game NFTs. The funding for ZKCandy arrives after most L2 chains appear to be available at price discounts. ZKCandy has the advantage of being purpose-built to potentially attract top-level game builders. The chain also has the potential for consulting with Wemix , one of the biggest gaming ecosystems. While overall play-to-earn gaming slowed down, some of the top games are still active, offering free-to-play versions. Web3 gaming may be on the comeback trail ZKCandy is still in the testnet stage, where the chain showed its capacity to carry 2.4M wallets. In addition to its on-chain readiness, ZKCandy has a lineup of 25 game titles at various stages of development, including one AAA-grade game with a Tier-1 Hollywood license. In addition to the on-chain test, ZKCandy will seek out partnerships and promote its games through Telegram. The chain is preparing for its mainnet launch in the first half of 2025. ZKCandy also plans to build its gaming-related AI agents, expanding its Telegram presence as an EVM-compatible gaming network. Gaming tokens have taken a hit to their valuation, but they have also proved to be resilient. The market recovered its value, rising to $26B in total capitalization. The category’s resurgence was led by the expansion of Immutable (IMX), which recently reclaimed $1.46. Tokens from Animoca Brands’ portfolio are also going strong, with Gala Games (GALA) stabilizing at $0.04 and the Sandbox (SAND) rising to $0.69. Animoca Brands was among the biggest factors in reviving Web3 gaming, by supporting multiple funding rounds. The company, formerly a game producer, became a lead backer in a total of 20 funding rounds in 2024.

He believes these speculative assets could face a complete washout in the next market crash. However, despite the negativity and disbelief in the meme sector, meme coins rose 500% in 2024 with a whooping market cap of $120 billion in December. After a tragic crash, the market is still gaining consciousness while Bitcoin is hovering around $99K the path to meme-coins and altcoins is indeed risky. Here is Brandt who is spilling the beans on meme hype created by celebrities. Memes are highly speculative assets as they pump instantly with celebrity and political leaders’ support but can drop drastically while competing with bigger assets like Bitcoin. Yet, it is a hot choice for many big players to divert their investment portfolio and make a profit to buy more Bitcoin. Having said that with Trump’s win meme, AI and stablecoins are expected to go higher than expected. With rising Bitcoin prices small traders are hoarding meme coins or other low-cap coins at lower prices to manage and reduce their risk appetite. Is this for the best? What’s coming next? Brandt highlights the dangers of investors chasing trends with heavy leverage, hoping for quick riches. While Bitcoin’s rise from $0.07 in 2010 to its current level of $100K is legendary, he warns that such explosive returns are unlikely to happen again. His primary concern lies with altcoins and meme coins, which he says are far riskier. The biggest drawback of memecoins is their nature which itself reveals their dependency on celebrities and hype created by market analysts. According to Benjamin Cowen, new projects launched by many big players just to fool the naive investors who buy Bitcoin with a celebrity tag are more prone to losses if they back out from the project. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : DeFis & NFTs Begin to Swell: Here are the Top Altcoins to Consider This January 2025 , Crypto Crash Scenario If the market crashes, Brandt predicts Bitcoin could lose 50% of its value, altcoins could plunge 90%, and meme coins might vanish entirely. He calls this scenario a natural outcome of speculative markets, where over-leveraged traders often get caught off guard during corrections. Despite his caution, Brandt remains optimistic about Bitcoin as a long-term investment, calling it the only digital asset with a proven track record. Overall, Bitcoin remains a good investment due to its long-term bullish outlook and strong institutional backing. He even predicted that Bitcoin could reach $327k by mid-2025. However, his outlook for the broader crypto market is much more cautious, urging investors to tread carefully, especially with high-risk assets like meme coins. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Notably, this day, also known as “Bitcoin’s Birthday” or “Proof of Keys Day,” highlights over 15 years of Bitcoin’s growth, from its origins as a decentralized financial system to its current prominence in global finance. The Genesis Block, also known as Block 0, was mined on January 3, 2009. Inside the block, Nakamoto included a hidden message referencing a headline from The Times reading, “Chancellor on the brink of the second bailout for banks.” This phrase was a pointed critique of the global banking system, highlighting the financial instability and centralization that Bitcoin was designed to combat. Since then, Bitcoin has grown from a concept in a whitepaper to a major player in global finance. Notably, the Genesis Block contained a reward of 50 BTC coins. As a tribute to Satoshi, people continue to send coins to the Genesis Block address , and to date, it holds a balance of approximately 100 BTC. These coins, however, remain unspendable due to the unique structure of the block. The unspent reward is symbolic of Bitcoin’s immutable and decentralized nature. In terms of supply, Bitcoin operates on a capped model with only 21 million coins ever to be mined. As per Coinmarketcap data, approximately 19.8 million BTC have already been mined, meaning only 1.2 million remain to be discovered. This scarcity continues to drive demand, with many investors viewing Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a store of value, similar to precious metals like gold. That said, to market the day, major crypto exchanges and key figures in the ecosystem shared their thoughts on the occasion. “ Happy Birthday Bitcoin. The Genesis Block laid the foundation for the Bitcoin revolution and financial freedom,” Bitfinex, a leading crypto exchange, tweeted, echoing the sentiments of Binance, Kucoin, and others. Elsewhere, popular Bitcoin maximalist and host of the “Bitcoin Knowledge” Podcast Trace Mayer took the opportunity to encourage Bitcoiners to celebrate the 16th birthday of Bitcoin by moving their holdings off exchanges and into self-custody. On the other hand, Bitcoin investor Chou Juthica, who has 16,000 followers on X, took a moment to reflect on the anniversary, noting that while Bitcoin has seen increased adoption, legitimacy, and institutional support since the Genesis block, it has also become “ less decentralized, more easily trackable, and more difficult to run a node. ” She ended her message by expressing hope for the future stating , “ Here’s to the next 16 years—may we bring back the magic and excitement that Bitcoin once sparked in our hearts and minds.” With strong enthusiasm surrounding its anniversary, Bitcoin’s future looks promising. As institutional adoption grows and more investors view it as an alternative asset, its influence on the global economy and potential for higher prices strengthens.

Bitcoin transaction volumes more than doubled in 2024, reversing a two-year decline, while Marathon Digital, now known as MARA, broke industry records with its hashrate and innovative Bitcoin lending program. Bitcoin Network Transactions Surge Past $19 Trillion in 2024, Reversing Two-Year Decline The Bitcoin network witnessed a dramatic resurgence in 2024, settling over $19 trillion in transactions, more than double the $8.7 trillion recorded in 2023. This rebound marks a significant reversal of the downward trend that followed the $47 trillion peak during the 2021 bull market. Pierre Rochard, vice president of research at Riot Platforms, highlighted the network's achievement, stating, “The Bitcoin network finalized more than $19 trillion worth of BTC transactions in 2024, decisively proving that Bitcoin is both a store of value and a medium of exchange.” The growth in Bitcoin transaction volume can be attributed to pivotal events in 2024, including: Introduction of a Bitcoin ETF in the US: The launch of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) provided institutional investors with easier access to the cryptocurrency, boosting adoption and liquidity. The April 2024 Halving Event: Bitcoin’s block reward halving, a key event in its economic model, reduced the issuance rate of new BTC, sparking increased interest and price momentum. A New All-Time High Price: Bitcoin reached an unprecedented price of $108,000 in 2024, reflecting heightened demand and market enthusiasm. These milestones cemented Bitcoin’s position as a leading financial asset, furthering its reputation as a reliable store of value and medium of exchange. Pierre Rochard’s analysis sheds light on Bitcoin's transactional trajectory over the past six years. After peaking during the 2021 bull run, transaction volumes dipped sharply in 2022 and 2023 due to bearish market conditions. However, 2024 marked a strong recovery, signaling renewed confidence and activity on the network. Bitcoin’s Hashrate Reaches New Heights In parallel with rising transaction volumes, Bitcoin’s hashrate — a measure of the computational power securing the network — also reached historic levels. On Jan. 3, 2024, the hashrate hit an all-time high of 1,000 exahashes per second (EH/s). Although it later stabilized at around 775 EH/s, this milestone sheds light on the network’s growing resilience and security. US-based mining pools played a significant role in the network's expansion, with over 40% of the global hashrate attributed to miners operating within the United States. Prominent US-based pools, including Foundry USA and MARA Pool, mined over 38.5% of all Bitcoin blocks in 2024. However, China-based mining pools still maintained majority control, reflecting a competitive and geographically diverse mining ecosystem. Accurately assessing the geographic distribution of Bitcoin's hashrate remains complex due to the pseudonymous nature of mining. Factors such as virtual private networks (VPNs) and the global distribution of individual miners contribute to the difficulty of pinpointing precise locations. Mining pools may be headquartered in specific regions, but their contributors often span the globe. This decentralized structure is part of Bitcoin’s core ethos of resilience and neutrality, enabling the network to operate independently of centralized authorities. Bitcoin’s resurgence in transaction volumes and the historic rise in its hashrate reflect growing adoption and confidence in the cryptocurrency's value proposition. As 2025 begins, the network’s trajectory suggests sustained growth, with increasing institutional interest, regulatory developments, and technological advancements likely to shape its evolution. Key areas to watch include: Further Adoption of Bitcoin ETFs: As Bitcoin ETFs gain traction, their impact on liquidity and institutional investment will be closely monitored. Global Hashrate Dynamics: The distribution of mining power across countries and its implications for Bitcoin’s decentralization will remain a critical topic. Price Movements and Adoption Trends: With Bitcoin trading near $98,926, analysts will keep an eye on macroeconomic factors and technological innovations driving price action. Bitcoin’s performance in 2024 has set a strong foundation for the coming years, reaffirming its status as a transformative financial innovation. With robust infrastructure, growing institutional adoption, and a vibrant global community, Bitcoin continues to redefine the future of finance. MARA Advances Bitcoin Mining Industry with Lending Program and Record Achievements Marathon Digital , rebranded as MARA , has cemented its position as a leader in the Bitcoin mining industry through strategic initiatives and record-breaking milestones. On Jan. 3, the company disclosed key figures from its operations in 2024, highlighting its innovative Bitcoin lending program, surging hashrate, and growing Bitcoin reserves. MARA announced that it lent out 7,377 Bitcoin in 2024, generating modest single-digit yields through short-term arrangements with established third parties. Robert Samuels, vice president of investor relations at MARA, explained the program's objectives, stating that the lending initiative is designed to offset operating expenses incurred by mining operations. Mining remains a capital-intensive industry, with profitability challenges exacerbated by periodic block reward reductions during Bitcoin halving events. The most recent halving in April 2024 reduced the block reward to 3.125 BTC per block, compelling miners to explore alternative revenue streams. Samuels emphasized MARA's cautious approach to lending, prioritizing partnerships with reputable entities to minimize risk. The strategy is part of a broader trend among mining companies seeking innovative ways to sustain operations amidst increasing competition and rising energy costs. In December 2024, MARA became the first publicly traded Bitcoin mining company to achieve 50 exahashes per second (EH/s) of computing power. This milestone shows MARA’s commitment to scaling its operations and securing its position in the global mining landscape. As of Jan. 3, 2025, MARA reported an energized hashrate of 53.2 EH/s, further solidifying its leadership in the sector. The company's significant investment in infrastructure and technology has not only enhanced its operational efficiency but also contributed to the security and resilience of the Bitcoin network. Expanding Bitcoin Reserves MARA’s aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin in 2024 reflects a strategic vision of leveraging the cryptocurrency as a treasury reserve asset. The company acquired 22,065 BTC at an average price of $87,205 per coin, supplementing the 9,457 BTC it mined during the year. These efforts have brought MARA’s total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 44,893 BTC. To fund its Bitcoin purchases, MARA raised $1.9 billion through two senior convertible note offerings in November and December 2024. These zero-interest notes, maturing in 2030 and 2031, indicate that the company has the ability to secure favorable financing terms while expanding its crypto reserves. MARA’s Bitcoin strategy has drawn accolades from industry leaders, including MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor. Saylor lauded MARA’s approach, predicting that the company may soon join the Nasdaq 100, a prestigious index of the largest publicly traded companies. The company’s strategic initiatives come amid mounting challenges in the Bitcoin mining industry. With block rewards diminishing and competition intensifying, miners must navigate volatile market conditions and rising operational costs. MARA’s focus on innovation, coupled with its robust financial strategy, positions it well to thrive in this evolving landscape. Looking ahead, MARA’s achievements in 2024 set a strong foundation for continued growth. The company’s record-breaking hashrate and strategic Bitcoin acquisitions reinforce its role as a major player in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Key developments to watch include: Bitcoin Lending Expansion: MARA’s lending program could pave the way for more extensive revenue diversification strategies in the mining sector. Potential Nasdaq 100 Inclusion: With Michael Saylor’s endorsement, MARA’s trajectory toward becoming a Nasdaq 100 constituent signals growing recognition of Bitcoin-focused companies in mainstream finance. Global Mining Competition: As MARA expands its hashrate, its ability to compete with international mining operations, particularly in China, will be crucial. MARA’s evolution from Marathon Digital to a Bitcoin powerhouse exemplifies the potential of the cryptocurrency mining sector. By combining cutting-edge technology with strategic financial management, MARA is shaping the future of Bitcoin mining and adoption. As the industry navigates challenges and opportunities, MARA’s innovative approach serves as a benchmark for mining companies worldwide.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-06 13:30:00

This move is backed by strong market support and rising optimism among institutional and retail investors. The current uptrend showcases Bitcoin’s resilience as key support levels have successfully absorbed selling pressure, paving the way for sustained bullish momentum. Analysts suggest that the ongoing rally could redefine market dynamics, potentially attracting a new wave of capital and solidifying BTC’s dominance in the crypto space. Approaching this critical benchmark, Bitcoin faces its next big test, which is breaking through the $100,000 resistance level. Surpassing this level could open the door for even higher price levels as investor confidence reaches new heights. On the other hand, failure to breach this milestone might trigger a short-term correction, offering a strategic entry point for those waiting on the sidelines. Recent Move Signals Uptrend For BTC Bitcoin’s recent rally can be ascribed to several key factors. Institutional investors have increasingly embraced Bitcoin, recognizing it as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Climbs: Is This the Start of a Bigger Rally? Additionally, growing adoption from retail investors with Bitcoin’s limited supply has created a perfect storm for price appreciation. As Bitcoin pushes higher, strong support levels have allowed it to maintain its bullish trajectory, with each price surge being met with healthy buying interest Technical indicators also point to continued upside potential. Momentum oscillators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), are currently in favorable positions, suggesting that Bitcoin’s uptrend is likely to continue in the near term. Furthermore, the price has consistently maintained above critical moving averages, reinforcing the overall optimistic sentiment in the market. As Bitcoin nears the $100,000 mark, it may face new challenges, including potential resistance levels and heightened volatility. However, the cryptocurrency’s ability to maintain strong support, coupled with an increasingly positive market environment, positions it for continued growth. If Bitcoin can break through the $100,000 level and sustain its momentum, it may set the stage for a new growth phase, targeting higher levels in the future. Can Bitcoin Maintain Its Upward Trajectory Beyond $100,000? If Bitcoin breaks through the $100,000 mark and sustains its upbeat momentum, it could open the door to more growth, targeting the $104,268 resistance level. A decisive move above this level might drive Bitcoin toward the next hurdle at $108,311. Related Reading: Bitcoin Set For Encounter With Key $99,900 Price Level – Analyst However, should BTC fail to surpass the $100,000 resistance level, it may face increased selling pressure and a possible pullback to its previous low of $93,257, where bullish momentum can be reignited.

Set to roll out in the second half of 2025, these digital cards are part of the island’s broader strategy to integrate blockchain technology into its economy. Blockchain Meets Tourism on Jeju Island According to a report from the Maeil Business Newspaper on Jan. 5, the NFT-linked tourist cards will come with perks such as travel subsidies and discounts at popular tourist attractions. The initiative aims to boost visitation rates among younger demographics, who are often drawn to innovative, tech-savvy experiences. Before the full rollout, a trial phase will assess the program’s feasibility and impact. Officials hope the cards will not only attract new visitors but also encourage repeat trips by offering unique benefits tied to the digital tokens. This is not the first time a government has used Blockchain to drive tourism. Thailand also has a history of embracing cryptocurrencies to attract travelers in the country. A History of Blockchain Innovation In 2021, Jeju Island implemented a blockchain-based COVID-19 contact tracing system, highlighting its openness to leveraging emerging technologies. Discussions about integrating blockchain and NFTs into Jeju’s tourism sector began in earnest in March 2024, as local officials explored potential applications in museums, restaurants, and even the fishing industry. The NFT tourist cards align with a broader national trend of renewed interest in crypto. South Korea witnessed a surge in crypto adoption in late 2024, fueled by positive regulatory developments in the United States. According to Democratic Party Representative Lim Kwang-Hyun, the number of South Korean crypto users rose by 610,000 in November 2024, bringing the total to 15.6 million—roughly 30% of the population. While NFT sales volumes in 2024 reached $8.83 billion, surpassing 2023 figures, the numbers remain far below the record-breaking $23.7 billion seen in 2022. The initiative byJeju Island could provide a major use case for NFTs beyond speculative trading, offering practical benefits to travelers.

These 2 SHIB Rivals in Bull Run Mode Will Flip $250 into $5000 in Just 6 Weeks,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/shiba-inu-taking-too-long-to-rally-these-2-shib-rivals-in-bull-run-mode-will-flip-250-into-5000-in-just-6-weeks,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen mixed-price action this month. As of this report, it has fallen 35% from its December 9 high of $0.000027 to $0.000022. This decline raises doubts about its ability to recover. The token's burn rate hits 972% daily to reduce supply and improve long-term value. Despite the burn rate boost, Shiba Inu has been unable to mount any notable comeback. While SHIB attempts to stabilize, investors are turning their attention to two attractive alternatives: Rexas Finance (RXS) and Pepe Coin. Both coins are gaining popularity, with analysts forecasting significant growth as they carve out their respective niches in the crypto market. Rexas Finance (RXS): The SHIB Rival Will Turn $250 Into $5000 With its new approach to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, Rexas Finance (RXS) has caught crypto investors’ attention. The project, designed to democratize access to high-value assets like real estate, commodities, and artworks through fractional ownership, uses blockchain technology to improve liquidity, cut transaction costs, and promote global real-world investments. As it moves through the presale rounds, Rexas Finance has already raised $34.7 million by selling 389 million tokens. RXS is now in stage 11, and its price has risen from $0.03 to nearly $0.175—a nearly sixfold increase. This rise shows interest in the platform's ability to offer decentralized finance (DeFi) and tokenized assets like real estate, commodities, and art. Rexas Finance, ready to revolutionize asset tokenization, is attracting investors seeking high-growth possibilities. Rexas Finance's ecosystem is unique in that it blends real-world asset tokenization with cutting-edge technologies such as the Rexas Token Builder, QuickMint Bot, and GenAI. These tools make it easier for businesses, innovators, and regular users to create, manage, and trade tokenized assets on the platform while improving the liquidity and transparency of these transactions. With these new capabilities, Rexas Finance is positioning itself to serve a booming industry worth a projected $50 billion RWA tokenization by 2025 and potentially up to $16 trillion by 2030. Investors seeking large gains should pay particular attention to Rexas Finance. If the price of RXS continues to climb at the current rate, a small investment might result in large rewards. For example, spending $250 at the current price of $0.175 would result in possessing 1,428.57 RXS tokens. If the price reaches merely $1, investors' initial investment could increase to $1,428.57, and at a conservative projection of $2.50 per RXS by 2025, the $250 investment could grow to $3,571.42—well on its way to a $5000 return if the token rises higher. Experts have placed the RXS short-term price target at $5-$10, making it the ideal investment for high ROI. Furthermore, Rexas Finance is giving more than an innovative platform; it is also running a $1 million giveaway, with the top 20 participants receiving $50,000 in RXS. This project generates further investor interest by rewarding early adopters and encouraging widespread participation. As Rexas Finance completes its presale stages, the platform will be launched on at least three of the top ten global crypto exchanges, increasing liquidity and visibility. The upside potential makes RXS a top coin to hold ahead of the upcoming bull run. Pepe Coin (PEPE): A Meme Coin with Promise As of this writing, Pepe Coin (PEPE) was trading at $0.00001787, up 2.89% from the previous session. Despite its volatility, analysts and investors remain hopeful about its potential price movement. Whale activity has been particularly significant. Over the course of twenty days, one wallet purchased 337.09 billion PEPE tokens worth around $6.92 million using Binance withdrawals. This accumulation indicates a firm belief in the coin's potential, as significant investors take stakes, which often drives market confidence and price momentum. Analysts predict that Pepe Coin's price will rise to $0.00022 in 2025, representing an 1113% gain. This is achievable, given PEPE’s year-on-year return of 1280% this year. Conclusion As Shiba Inu recovers, Rexas Finance and Pepe Coin provide attractive investment prospects for individuals seeking high-growth assets. Both projects are exhibiting signs of progress, with Rexas Finance establishing itself at the vanguard of the tokenization movement and Pepe Coin benefiting from significant community support and analyst trust. Rexas Finance offers investors a unique opportunity to capitalize on emerging crypto trends. Rexas Finance, with its innovative tokenization technology and positive presale momentum, holds the potential to become the next significant player in blockchain-based asset management. As the project prepares to debut on major exchanges, investors should grab the opportunity to invest early, as Rexas Finance is poised for enormous development.

Amid this, a recent report showed that Ripple’s native crypto outpaced Bitcoin and Ethereum, in terms of money flow, last week. This has sparked discussions in the crypto community, especially as industry experts eye a potential rally in the asset’s price ahead. XRP Outpaces Bitcoin & Ethereum With Robust Weekly Inflow Meanwhile, a recent report from CoinShares Digital Asset Fund Flows showed that Bitcoin recorded an outflow of $25 million last week. On the other hand, Ethereum saw a $2 million influx while Solana noted an outflow of $0.4 million. However, despite the gloomy picture, XRP emerged as one of the leading altcoins with the highest influx. According to the data, Ripple’s native crypto saw an inflow of $5.7 million, surpassing both BTC and ETH. This development appears to have further fueled the market sentiment towards the crypto, especially amid soaring interest in the digital assets space. However, in the first three trading days of 2025, Bitcoin and Ethereum appeared to have regained momentum with inflows of $573 million and $11 million, respectively. XRP saw a muted flow in the same time frame. Meanwhile, the report showed that digital asset investment products witnessed a record-breaking $44.2 billion in inflows globally in 2024, nearly four times the previous record set in 2021. Despite last week’s outflux, Bitcoin emerged as the clear winner, attracting $38 billion in inflows in 2024, which represents 29% of the total assets under management (AuM). On the other hand, Ethereum also saw a resurgence, with full-year inflows reaching $4.8 billion, 2.4 times the total seen in 2021. The report also noted that altcoins, excluding Ethereum, saw inflows of $813 million in 2024, representing just 18% of AuM. Can Ripple’s Native Crypto Maintain This Bullish Momentum? XRP price today was up about 2% and exchanged hands at $2.40, but its trading volume fell 12% to $3.71 billion. Over the last seven days, the crypto has added about 15%, while witnessing a monthly decline of about 2%. However, the coin’s Futures Open Interest recorded a jump of around 65%, indicating the strong interest of the investors towards the crypto. Notably, Donald Trump’s election win has reignited optimism among investors toward digital assets. The CoinShares data noted that the US played a significant role in last year’s inflow surge, with US spot-based ETFs accounting for $44.4 billion of the total inflows. Besides, this has also sparked optimism over a crypto-friendly regulatory environment in the country. Having said that, a flurry of experts have predicted a potential settlement in the Ripple SEC case under the incoming SEC Chair Paul Atkins. This development, if happens, could send the prices to a new ATH in the coming days. However, investors should also consider that the current SEC Gary Gensler could make a last-minute move by filing its opening brief in the XRP lawsuit . This could significantly dampen the investors’ sentiment while weighing on the crypto’s performance. In addition, in a recent analysis, Ali Martinez also said that XRP price could witness a pullback while maintaining a bullish outlook for the long-term trajectory of the coin.

Tokenization is expected to democratize capital markets, while AI agents and agentic AI systems could drive innovation, productivity, and the rise of autonomous enterprises. Corporate Bitcoin strategies and potential economic policies under a Trump administration could further reshape global markets. Despite this optimism from industry leaders, critics still warn about risks like superficial AI tools and potential misuse. Tokenization and AI Could Drive Explosion of Niche Businesses in 2025 Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley shared his predictions for 2025, and forecasted major transformations in the business and crypto landscapes driven by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), tokenization, and corporate Bitcoin adoption. In a series of posts on X, Horsley described 2025 as a year poised for radical change, particularly for smaller, niche businesses and large corporations. Horsley placed a lot of emphasis on the transformative potential of tokenization , particularly on the supply side, which he believes has been overlooked in favor of its demand-side benefits like democratizing access to financial markets. He argued that tokenization could unlock vast opportunities for smaller businesses to access capital markets, which could potentially revolutionise the landscape for real-world asset tokenization. Supporting this view, Brickken founder and CEO Edwin Mata mentioned the ongoing evolution of tokenization in traditional markets, which allows assets like real estate, debt, and equity to be digitized and traded on blockchain platforms. Mata sees real-world asset tokenization as a driving force in the crypto sector's next growth phase. Horsley also predicted that artificial intelligence will lead to a proliferation of niche businesses, many of which might bypass traditional public offerings in favor of tokenization. He suggested that AI’s ability to boost micro businesses could establish a long-tail capital market that could transform how small enterprises raise funds and scale operations. Corporate Bitcoin adoption is yet another trend Horsley expects to gain momentum in 2025. He coined the term ” Bitcoin Standard Corporations ” to describe companies adopting Bitcoin as a core component of their financial strategy. MicroStrategy already paved the way, and Horsley believes more corporations will follow suit in the coming year. This trend has already seen smaller companies announce Bitcoin treasury strategies in late 2024. Horsley also pointed out that the expected Trump administration in the United States might ”unfreeze” mergers and acquisitions for large corporations, which could unlock opportunities for growth and consolidation. He specifically pointed to the ”magnificent seven” — major corporations like Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla — as the companies best poised to leverage their market cap in this new environment. Overall, Horsley’s vision for 2025 suggests a year of unprecedented innovation, with AI, tokenization, and corporate crypto strategies driving big shifts in the global economic and technological landscape. Sam Altman Predicts AI Workforce Boom OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also recently shared a bold vision for artificial intelligence in 2025 by predicting that the first AI agents could enter the workforce and greatly impact company output. In a blog post titled “Reflections,” Altman stated that these AI agents, which are also known as agentic AI, are a major leap forward in AI technology. These systems are designed to exhibit autonomous decision-making, goal-directed behavior, and the ability to execute multi-step reasoning processes with minimal human intervention. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang agrees with this, and pointed out the increasing adoption of agentic AI in enterprises and its growing prominence. The integration of these autonomous AI systems is expected to transform industries and redefine how businesses operate. Altman also revealed that OpenAI is making major strides toward developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), which aims to replicate humanlike intelligence. He is very confident that OpenAI now understands how to build AGI and is setting its sights even higher, aiming for superintelligence. According to Altman, superintelligent tools could drive unprecedented scientific discovery and innovation that will accelerate progress and increase global prosperity. The success of OpenAI’s ChatGPT was a huge turning point in the AI revolution thanks to the unexpected speed at which AI is beginning to deliver its promised benefits. He believes that AI is poised to bring about even greater advancements in the near future. Dario Amodei , CEO of Anthropic, a rival AI firm behind the Claude chatbot, also weighed in on the rapid progress of AI, and predicted that human-level AI could become a reality as early as 2026. Critics and Advocates Clash Over AI Agents Overall, the emergence of AI agents in the crypto space, like Aixbt, Zerebro, and Truth Terminal, caused both excitement and skepticism among investors and analysts. AI agents can interact with their environment, gather data, and take actions to optimize outcomes, making them highly versatile for applications ranging from automation to problem-solving. While these AI-powered tools captivated people with their creativity and utility, critics still argue that many are little more than glorified chatbots paired with meme tokens. Bitcoiner Mark Jeffrey dismissed much of the sector as superficial, and predicted that only a small fraction will eventually survive and actually deliver meaningful innovation. Arturo Rodriguez , head of product development at NotCentralised, compared the current AI agent landscape to the speculative frenzy that was seen during the meme coin boom. He noticed that most AI agents today rely on off-chain models like OpenAI and are primarily used for simple tasks like managing on-chain wallets or posting on social media. Haseeb Qureshi , managing partner at Dragonfly, shared similar sentiments by describing these systems as ”Wizard of Oz” agents that are often backed by human intervention to prevent malfunctions. Kel Eleje X post Despite these criticisms, industry insiders are still very optimistic about the long-term potential of AI agents in the crypto ecosystem. Former Messari analyst Kel Eleje predicted that the total market cap for AI agents and related technologies could surge to $250 billion. This growth will likely be driven by catalysts like increasing venture capital interest, the dominance of AI narratives in financial markets, and the anticipated listing of new AI tokens. Eleje and Rodriguez both foresee a shift toward more sophisticated AI agents capable of solving complex problems that are far beyond human capabilities due to cost or skill barriers. However, the rise of AI agents also raises some concerns about their potential misuse. While current AI agents are celebrated for their ability to provide valuable insights and improve user engagement, analysts like Qureshi also warn of the darker implications. He predicted a proliferation of autonomous scam bots, and even compared their potential impact to the rise of ransomware and crypto-jacking over the past few years. These malicious agents could pose very serious social and economic challenges if left unchecked. While the promise of AI agents is immense, ensuring their responsible development and deployment will always be crucial to realizing their full potential.",News|Business,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-06 13:35:59

However, it was his exposure to different economic systems that truly shaped his worldview. “Growing up in East Berlin, I saw a truly communist world,” the entrepreneur recalled. This experience was followed by a move to the U.S. and eventually to Hong Kong. It was in Hong Kong that he encountered what he describes as “Milton Friedman’s wet dream,” an ultra-capitalist environment with minimal social safety nets. These contrasting experiences left a lasting impression on Siu. They influenced his views on what a fairer economic system could look like. “ It’s not about equality ,” he explained. “ It’s about fairness. Capitalism needs a fair set of rules for a truly free market to work. “ This belief in fairer systems ultimately led Siu to embrace the potential of Web3 and blockchain technology. For the businessman, decentralization is not synonymous with chaos, as critics often potray it. Instead, he sees it as a mechanism for distributing power, ensuring that no single entity can monopolize control over resources, markets, or platforms. The promise of decentralization “The beauty of decentralization is that it distributes power,” Siu explained . “When power is distributed, markets can compete in a free and fair way.” He drew a parallel to the music industry, where platforms like Spotify initially promised fairer compensation for artists. However, they eventually became centralized, with more money flowing to the platform rather than the creators. This centralization, the angel investor argued, undermines the very premise of a free market. He believes blockchain and decentralized systems provide the antidote by ensuring that no single entity holds too much power over the flow of capital or content. This is the core promise of decentralization: creating a level playing field where participants can interact without the fear of exploitation. The role of Web3 and the metaverse The crypto startup co-founder emphasized the importance of strong networks in driving adoption. He argued that a decentralized platform thrives when its success is determined by the strength of its community and the relationships formed within that community. Yat Siu drew a comparison between decentralized networks and the rise of brand-driven communities. He cited Red Bull as an example. The connection between the brand and its audience creates a sense of belonging, much like the relationships formed in Web3 communities . “ You drink Red Bull, I drink Red Bull, and suddenly we have something in common, ” he noted. This sense of community, he argues, builds the kind of loyalty that drives a network to success. According to the businessman, the value of a decentralized network is ultimately determined by the number of users who are building, creating, and transacting within it. “ The true measure of success for a network is not whether the foundation is doing great things, but whether third parties are building and engaging, ” Siu reiterated. Decentralized finance adds meaning to the attention One of the most significant developments of Web3 is its ability to link financial value to attention and engagement. Traditional systems (Web2) frequently monetize user interaction through centralized platforms. However, Web3 allows users to be directly rewarded for their participation. Yat Siu acknowledged that this financial element adds a new layer of meaning to engagement. “When there’s something at stake, it becomes meaningful,” he said. This is particularly evident in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and token economies , where users can earn rewards for their involvement in the ecosystem. However, he also pointed out that this financial aspect introduces risks. “ It becomes deeper, but also riskie r,” he warned. With financial stakes involved, users are more invested in the success of the network, but they are also exposed to potential losses. Yat Siu continued, “Rewards an element of seriousness and commitment to the decentralized ecosystem, making it more than just a speculative venture.” Meanwhile, in another interview with Venture Beat, the Animoca Brands executive expressed high hopes for Web3 gaming in 2025. Siu advised projects looking to expand their user base to leverage Telegram and the TON blockchain. He believes both platforms harbor faster user acquisition.

Trump’s Pet Doge (TRUMDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Pet Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Pet Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Pet Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Pet Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Pet Doge by entering its contract address – 6e6jZxV1zG7GGLF5MoJZf8nY4u17x8dceDatSWiTE573 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-06 13:39:00

Far from being mere internet jokes, these tokens have evolved into financial strongholds with real-world applications, strong communities, and compelling narratives. There’s PEPETO with new initiatives, and old dawgs like DOGE and SHIB that haven't failed to live up to their legacies. As the crypto space prepares for its next bull run, these meme coins become fertile grounds for investors who seek substantial returns in their investments. But before the bull run, there are other things we want you to know about Pepeto, SHIB and DOGE. Read on! PEPETO PEPETO has set the standard for what meme coins can do. Based on Ethereum, PEPETO stands out because it strives to develop a decentralized exchange for meme coins that gives tokens a place to realize real-world utility. PEPETO’s presale proves that this can be done, and it has done it already with its exceeded $3 million presales. This milestone are pointers to Pepeto's strong marketing effort with influencer partnerships – as with any successful memecoin. Plus, the coin engages staking rewards as a marketing tool where investors can make passive income. It is no doubt that Pepeto has a clear roadmap for expansion — community engagement and creative marketing strategy. Furthermore, there are a couple of other plans that the Pepeto team want to achieve. This was made known in a recent tweet below: DOGE: While many know DOGE for its humorous origins, its utility and widespread acceptance have turned it into a serious contender in the crypto market. Currently, Dogecoin is worth more than $46 billion in market capitalization, which shows its continuing popularity. Outside of its market data, DOGE has also become a popular tipping and microtransaction cryptocurrency. With low transaction fees and fast processing, it’s a go-to for everyday use that differentiates it from the others. SHIB: Finally, the “Doge Killer”. Shiba Inu is not just a joking rival; the coin has developed a scalable ecosystem that consists of ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and an evolving set of tools. Users can stake, farm, and exchange assets within its ecosystem which provides functionality that isn’t limited to the meme coin scenario. SHIB’s social nature has made it considerably successful through popularity. Not only has the token’s popularity driven its rise in the market, it has also buoyed its expansion strategy. The Rise of Meme Coins in 2025: PEPETO Leading the Charge Meme coins are transforming from internet humor into significant crypto assets with real utility, robust communities, and engaging stories. As we approach the next crypto bull run, PEPETO, alongside veterans like DOGE and SHIB, are poised to offer investors lucrative opportunities with their innovative approaches and strong market presence. PEPETO sets itself apart by building a decentralized exchange tailored for meme coins, enhancing their real-world application. With a successful presale surpassing $3 million, PEPETO's marketing prowess through influencer partnerships and staking rewards for passive income showcases its commitment to growth. For those looking to invest, PEPETO's roadmap includes community engagement and creative marketing, with details shared in their recent tweet: A New Year’s Message from the God of FrogsAs the New Year begins, the God of Frogs, Pepeto Himself, shares a message of triumph and faith for the loyal Pepeto Army:The Plan Unfolds: The roadmap progresses flawlessly, as foretold.

The Dogecoin millionaire expressed confidence in WallitIQ by comparing it to the early days of Shiba Inu (SHIB), which experienced an outstanding 100,000% rally. WallitIQ (WLTQ): A Promising Investment In The Crypto-AI Landscape WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) fast adoption and rapid growth potential have caught the attention of a Dogecoin millionaire who bought WallitIQ tokens for up to $500,000 at a price of $0.0420 each. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is committed to promoting financial literacy and decentralization among crypto users through its AI solutions and machine learning algorithms. WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers its users absolute control over their digital assets without the interference of third parties or restrictions associated with centralized exchanges. According to the Dogecoin millionaire, early adopters of WallitIQ (WLTQ) could see substantial returns as the platform continues to gain momentum in the crypto market. Given the increased demand for efficient and secure crypto wallets, crypto experts are optimistic that WallitIQ (WLTQ) will grow alongside the billion-dollar crypto wallet and AI market to replicate Shiba Inu’s 100,000% rally. By drawing parallels to Shiba Inu’s previous 100,000% rally, the Dogecoin millionaire’s large investment of $500,000 reflects his confidence in WallitIQ (WLTQ) to bring huge returns in the coming weeks. With a projected $10 million in monthly revenue, both retail and institutional investors are joining the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale in order to secure their positions in the booming crypto-AI market. The Dogecoin millionaire emphasizes the importance of entering at a low price, similar to those who bought Shiba Inu (SHIB) early. Additionally, investors who join the WallitIQ (WLTQ) now will benefit from token price appreciation in the next presale stage, governance participation, access to premium features, etc. Investors are anticipating the official launch of WallitIQ (WLTQ), as it will provide 24/7 access to blockchain activities like yield farming, trading of over 2,000 cryptocurrencies, and staking mechanisms that reward token holders with up to 180% in annual percentage yields (APY). The Dogecoin millionaire appreciates WallitIQ’s commitment to security, particularly its smart contract audit carried out by a prominent cybersecurity and blockchain audit firm known as SolidProof . Furthermore, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) adoption of advanced encryption standard (AES) and elliptic cryptographic curve (ECC) protects users’ private keys and transactions from malicious attacks. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Rise And Fall Of A Meme Phenomenon Shiba Inu's 100,000% rally caught the attention of millions, transforming early investors into overnight crypto millionaires. However, after a massive sell-off among Shiba Inu whales, which caused fear among investors who fear that the whale sell-off will prevent the coin from moving upwards. Recently, the Shiba Inu burn rate witnessed a 90% decline, with only 606,000 tokens burnt. This decline in the SHIB burn rate indicates no substantial reduction in the circulating supply, which further aligns with the coin’s current price action amid a turbulent crypto market. According to data from CoinGecko , Shiba Inu (SHIB) has a market cap of $12.7 billion with a daily trading volume of $413 million. As of the time of this writing, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at a price of $0.00002168.

While both of these established cryptocurrencies have made waves with their unique value propositions, emerging projects like Lightchain AI are predicted to outperform both Cardano and XRP in the coming years. Currently priced at $0.004875 during its presale , Lightchain AI combines blockchain and artificial intelligence to create innovative solutions that analysts believe will result in massive growth by 2025. Cardano vs XRP Key Strengths and Challenges Cardano has been known for its methodical way to build blockchain. With a focus on growth, safety, and lasting use Cardano's blockchain seeks to be a base for the making of dApps and crafty deals. But, Cardano's plan has much delays, and ͏its slow growth has raised doubts about its chance to get a lot of users. Even if Cardano has a big group of supporters and is trying to grow its system it faces lots of rivals from quicker, more useful blockchains. XRP, in another way, has led the path in moving money across borders. The coin is often used by banks for quicker and cheaper worldwide deals and its use in regular finance keeps increasing. But, XRP's fight with the SEC has made doubts about what comes next. While lots of people think XRP will win these fights, it still meets rules that could hold up its growth. Why Lightchain AI Is Predicted to Outperform Cardano and XRP in 2025 Lightchain AI is carving its own niche in the cryptocurrency market by blending artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. The platform allows decentralized, secure AI computations and model training, making it a valuable asset for industries like finance, healthcare, and data processing. Unlike Cardano and XRP, which primarily focus on blockchain scalability and cross-border payments, Lightchain AI solves real-world AI challenges and addresses the growing need for decentralized AI solutions. Analysts predict that Lightchain AI will experience exponential growth in 2025, driven by its real-world utility and scalability. The platform's ability to handle high-performance AI tasks on a decentralized network ensures that it can be adopted across a wide range of industries. This real-world application of blockchain and AI is expected to drive demand, creating an increasing value for Lightchain AI’s tokens. What Makes Lightchain AI Stand Out in 2025 While Cardano and XRP have strong use cases, Lightchain AI stands out as a more versatile solution by addressing the current limitations of blockchain and AI technologies. By integrating blockchain with AI, Lightchain AI offers a scalable and secure platform for AI model training and data processing, making it highly relevant in industries that demand decentralized solutions for data privacy and AI optimization. Unlike Cardano’s theoretical scalability and XRP’s focus on traditional financial systems, Lightchain AI tackles real-world challenges by enabling businesses to run decentralized AI models, unlocking new opportunities for automation and analytics. Its strong tokenomics further enhance its appeal, with a presale raising over $8 million and a current price of $0.004875. Deflationary mechanisms like token burning aim to reduce supply over time, supporting long-term growth as demand increases. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Mara Holdings has adopted MicroStrategy's bitcoin treasury strategy, and this should amplify Mara's price if there is a continuation in the bitcoin appreciation. Marathon Holdings, a leading bitcoin miner, is diversifying by mining kaspa, which offers an interesting value proposition for Mara investors. There are risks, which include potential overleveraging into a bitcoin bear market, which could severely impact Mara Holding's shares. Introduction Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has experienced an incredible run in the past few months. The recent price appreciation came after it had put many people to sleep after touching new all-time highs in March 2024. In the blink of an eye, the price moved from all-time highs around $70K in November, to over $100K by mid-December. Had you been able to buy the low in August 2024, you would have purchased bitcoin around $50K. Of course, attempting to time the lows is extremely difficult, and dollar-cost averaging on down days would likely serve the average investor much better. Now that bitcoin is trading just below $100K, many may be feeling left behind relative to where it was just last summer. Given the pullback from a high of $108K, now may be an opportune time to purchase bitcoin outright. But owning bitcoin and holding it in cold storage comes with a knowledge gap that can be intimidating to some. Hence, many are unfamiliar or uncomfortable using non-traditional finance such as bitcoin directly. Where does this leave the options for investors that are averse to the nuances of crypto self-custody? One option could mean buying a bitcoin ETF. Another option is buying a bitcoin mining company that holds bitcoin on its balance sheet, like Mara Holdings ( MARA ). Mara Holdings Company Description (Mara Holdings Presentation) Mara Holdings Adopts MicroStrategy's Strategy By now, it's no secret that one of the best performing stocks of 2024 has been MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). MicroStrategy is now famous for implementing a bitcoin treasury strategy, where they issue debt and equity to purchase bitcoin to hold on its balance sheet. I put a hold rating in my first and only article on MicroStrategy back in September 2023 when the price was $30/share when most other analysts had recommended a sell. I could clearly see what MicroStrategy's ""strategy"" was, but I wasn't sure they would be able to pull it off. At the time, bitcoin was still trading in the mid $20K range and a strong sell-off in bitcoin would threaten MicroStrategy's solvency. But like every good story, Michael Saylor looked out over the abyss, challenging the conventional hive-mind, and came out on top. If you want to understand MicroStrategy, I believe this chart I came across sums it up very well. What this chart demonstrates, simply, is that each quarter, the amount of bitcoin that the company owns per share is increasing. And if bitcoin increases in price, MSTR will increase equal to bitcoin plus some multiple of the growth rate of bitcoin held per share. So far, it seems MicroStrategy has exposed a glitch in the matrix. MSTR Quarterly bitcoin holdings per share (Twitter @benwerkman) MARA Holdings Enters the Game Mara Holdings is the largest publicly traded bitcoin mining company in the world. They have been no doubt, watching as MicroStrategy has acquired an impressive stack of bitcoin without deploying a single bitcoin mining machine; a stack which Mara Holdings can only dream of. Interestingly, MARA holds a distant second-most bitcoin (44,893) on its balance sheet of any publicly traded company behind MSTR. Thanks to observing MSTR's success acquiring bitcoin using the debt and equity markets, Mara Holdings has begun to implement the same strategy. In this article, I want to explore Mara Holdings and make some estimates on what Mara Holdings might look like a year to two years from now. I will look at mostly technical analysis but will also look at some of the fundamentals of the company. Together, this might demonstrate that 2025 to 2026 could be a uniquely bullish period for Mara Holdings. Technical Analysis: A Logarithmic Channel First, let's look at some technical analysis. I don't pretend to be an expert in technical analysis, but I have learned to pay attention to potential logarithmic channels. Often times, it is difficult to identify patterns or clear trading ranges when observing a linear chart. See Mara Holdings' linear chart pictured below. There are some trends worth observing, but I would argue it shows a picture that is clouded. Contrary to the linear chart, the logarithmic chart shows a clear trendline down into the bottoming structure in 2020, and now a reversal and a potential new trend heading upward. When understanding technical analysis, the fundamentals must support the technicals, and given the success that MSTR has had with their strategy, I expect that MARA will now experience similar success as well. Chart 1: Linear Mara Holdings Chart (Tradingview.com) Chart 2: Logarithmic Mara Holdings Logarithmic Chart (Tradingview.com) Mara's New Token: Kaspa ( KAS-USD ) Mara has many different things going on that center around bitcoin and finding the most efficient energy sources possible for operating bitcoin mining machines. But perhaps the thing that is flying under the radar, yet is very exciting for Mara's prospects, is their decision to diversify away from bitcoin and add another token to its mining portfolio. That token is called kaspa, and its name means ""silver"" in Arabic. If you know anything about the Chairman of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor, then you know he likes to describe bitcoin as the best way to store monetary energy. And I don't think anyone can convincingly argue against that framework. But bitcoin, while being the best store of value, falls short in functioning as an effective payment system. Without getting into the technical details, there are two quick reasons for this. First, its block times are too slow, and second, its transaction fees are too high. This doesn't negate the fact that it's a wonderful store of value over a long duration. But where bitcoin fails, kaspa appears to be much more effective, while maintaining the bitcoin ethos. This may come as a controversial statement to bitcoin enthusiasts, but bitcoin's primary ethos is decentralization. And while to some, this only means that bitcoin's computer network is decentralized, I like to think about decentralization in much broader terms than that. Only personally speaking, I believe decentralization should not only come in terms of geographic compute, but also in there being numerous networks by which individuals can choose the best network for their specific needs. For true decentralization to exist, there must be multiple networks that are effective as a store of value and payment system. I'm going to assume that for the largest publicly held mining company to choose to invest resources towards a new token, it has been tested and found to be at least as technically sound as bitcoin, and likely more. When you investigate kaspa, its proponents claim it succeeds in delivering superfast block times and low transaction fees while providing the security and decentralization of bitcoin. In other words, it claims to solve the blockchain trilemma . It will be interesting to wait and see how kaspa performs. Given Mara is the earliest public miner to mine kaspa, it is possible that Mara Holdings acquires a superior amount of kaspa relative to any other company, giving it a similar position in kaspa, as MSTR has in bitcoin. Performance Metrics Mara Holdings, like other companies, has performance metrics that show how the company is improving each quarter. In its recent presentation on November 14, at the Cantor Crypto, Digital Assets & AI Infrastructure Conference, they released these charts below. The company has improved in each of the below metrics over the course of the past year. Bitcoin mining is one of the most competitive industries in the world, and so if Mara isn't improving, they will eventually go bankrupt as a company. It's both impressive, and necessary for Mara to make this much improvement over time. Bitcoin Blocks Produced (Mara Holdings Presentation) Compute Power (Mara Holdings Presentation) Daily Cost Per Petahash (Mara Presentation) Average Energy Efficiency (Mara Holdings Presentation) Finding Stranded Energy Energy efficiency is one of the big investment themes of this moment. In order to be successful, bitcoin mining companies scour the globe to find the best opportunities to deploy the most efficient bitcoin mining machines. It is fascinating where companies like Mara find opportunities. You can see below that in addition to their existing infrastructure, they found strategic partnership opportunities in Abu Dhabi and Kenya. Mara Energy Projects (Mara Holdings Presentation) Risks One of the biggest risks for Mara Holdings will be maintaining solvency by keeping a healthy relationship between financing its bitcoin purchases with debt and equity. Bitcoin is a wonderful investment when it's going up, but if a person (or company) uses debt to acquire it, it can also lead to your doom on the way down. My outlook on bitcoin is bullish in the near-term. But if bitcoin's price reaches above $200K, then I would proceed with caution on holding Mara Holdings or MicroStrategy. I would hope that bitcoin's decline during the next bear market will be much milder than those in the past, but I also think that some companies will get overleveraged and get washed out in the next bitcoin bear market. Once the bitcoin party ends, there will be short sellers and general selling pressure on these companies. MicroStrategy and Mara Holding's strategy of selling shares for a greater value amount than the bitcoin currently held per share works great, until bitcoin re-enters a bear market. Meaning, if the value of these company's shares falls below the NAV of the bitcoin they are holding, and they are holding too much debt relative to their bitcoin, then it will create strong downward pressure on bitcoin and the associated company's shares. Shareholders might experience negative performance greater than any decline in the bitcoin price and then be found waiting until the next bitcoin bull market for shares to turn around. That is, assuming the company in question can survive the downturn. Another risk for Mara Holdings is that they have now begun to lend their bitcoin in order to earn interest that can help fund their operations. This introduces counterparty risk and if you have followed bitcoin before 2021, then you recall that many bitcoin lending companies went bankrupt following bitcoin's dramatic decline. The details surrounding Mara's bitcoin lending operation are still unknown, but their latest 10Q showed them earning interest from bitcoin lending. Yet another risk, albeit very unlikely, is that Mara Holding's keys to their bitcoin can become compromised. And if Mara Holdings loses its bitcoin, then their investor's will also lose their investment. As the saying goes in bitcoin, ""not your keys, not your coins."" Again, this is a very unlikely scenario. Conclusion I am rating Mara Holdings a strong buy going into 2025. Both fundamentals and technicals appear to be aligned for Mara Holdings to perform well. There are, of course, many risks that I covered above. If Mara Holdings can navigate the landscape where bitcoin mining, energy efficiency, bitcoin acquisition, and bitcoin lending intersect, then this is a company whose business model will become very disruptive to traditional finance. With Mara Holdings adopting the MSTR strategy of buying bitcoin with debt and equity financing, we may begin to see Mara's shares come more alive.",BTC-USD|MARA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-06 13:46:59

Here Are The Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/microstrategy-and-metaplanet-announce-their-bitcoin-purchase-plans-for-2025-how-much-bitcoin-will-they-buy-here-are-the-details/,"Two of the world’s largest institutional Bitcoin holders, MicroStrategy and Japan-based Metaplanet, have announced plans to significantly expand their Bitcoin holdings in 2025. MicroStrategy and Metaplanet Plan $3 Billion Bitcoin Deposit as BTC Approaches $100K As Bitcoin struggles with the $100,000 mark, companies signal continued institutional confidence. MicroStrategy Targets $2 Billion in Bitcoin Purchases MicroStrategy (MSTR), a pioneer in institutional Bitcoin investment, has announced its intention to raise up to $2 billion through preferred stock offerings to fund Bitcoin purchases in the first quarter of 2025. The move is part of the company’s “21/21 Plan,” which aims to raise $21 billion in equity and $21 billion in fixed-income instruments over the next three years. The firm, which holds around $44 billion worth of Bitcoin, has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to expanding its crypto reserves. Co-founder Michael Saylor teased the announcement late Sunday by sharing an image of the popular “SaylorTracker” chart, which is known for signaling recent Bitcoin purchases. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin buying sprees often create market volatility, with prices rising in anticipation of the purchase but falling slightly following official announcements. Metaplanet Joins Bitcoin Buying Craze Japanese investment firm Metaplanet, often referred to as “Japan’s MicroStrategy,” plans to purchase 10,000 BTC (equivalent to around $1 billion at current prices) throughout 2025. Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich detailed the firm’s strategy in a post he published on X (formerly Twitter) over the weekend, emphasizing that they focus on Bitcoin accumulation and adoption. “By 2025, we aim to increase our Bitcoin holdings to 10,000 BTC using the largest capital market instruments available to us. We will leverage partnerships to advance Bitcoin adoption in Japan and around the world,” he said. Metaplanet, which currently holds $175 million worth of Bitcoin, also plans to explore innovative opportunities to grow its influence in Japan’s burgeoning crypto ecosystem. The firm has a market cap of $830 million. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: MicroStrategy And Metaplanet Announce Their Bitcoin Purchase Plans For 2025!

After an extreme consolidation, the price triggered a strong upward movement but faced a short of strength as the token is failing to secure the resistance at $217. The drop in the volume could be one of the major reasons. However, the fireworks are likely soon, as the SOL price is about to enter the pivotal resistance zone very soon. Solana has been one of the top-performing platforms, offering tough competition to Ethereum in terms of DEX volumes, transactions, etc. As per the new data, Solana outpaces Ethereum and Base combined in 24-hour DEX trading volume, reaching above $3.66 billion. Apart from this, the platform has outpaced Ethereum in terms of social engagements like social creators, mentions, engagements, and positive sentiments. Meanwhile, in the longer time frame, the SOL price has ranged above the weekly and monthly support levels and appears to be extremely strong. Now that the token has entered the top 5 elite clubs, here’s how it may be glued within these levels. The SOL price is trying hard to break above the resistance of the expanding channel, but due to the lack of volume, it is failing to do so. The bearish trend of the OBV substantiates the claim. Besides, the conversion line and the base line of the Ichimoku cloud is expected to undergo a bullish crossover, which is believed to offer a strong boost to the SOL price rally. Therefore, the price is expected to break above the levels shortly. On the other hand, the token is testing the upper bands of the Bollinger and hence a breakout may trigger a fine upswing as it happened before, initiating a 10% to 15% upswing. Once the price secures levels above $250, a new ATH seems to be imminent for the Solana (SOL) price rally before the end of the month.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-06 13:48:10

This marks a significant shift in federal policy, with many anticipating more supportive legislation for blockchain innovation. Additionally, Gary Gensler is slated to resign the same day. Gensler is the current Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whose tenure has been controversial due to his approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. Paul Atkins, a former SEC Commissioner and advocate for clear crypto policies, has been nominated to replace Gensler.

Because of the changing landscape, analysts increasingly project significant price targets for XRP, with some anticipating values in double and triple digits. The excitement and recent positive market momentum reflect broader industry trends, as institutional investors and technology firms continue to expand their blockchain initiatives. The expected regulatory clarity under the new Congress and SEC leadership would accelerate this trend, positioning the U.S. as a global leader in cryptocurrency adoption.

With a recent Bitcoin All-Time High of over $104,000, we see a market that continues to look robust. While a deeper Q1 2025 pullback remains a possibility, the broader tightening of supply and bullish sentiment among miners indicate that Bitcoin is well-positioned for further gains in the medium term. The Liquidity Inventory Ratio , which tracks how long existing supply can meet demand, has plummeted from 41 months in October to just 6.6 months. This indicates a rapid tightening of available Bitcoin liquidity, and has been particularly evident during the strong rallies seen in Q1 and Q4 of 2024. Bitcoin miners, historically significant sellers during halving years, have also slowed their BTC flows to exchanges since April 2024. Miner-to-exchange flows are at multi-year lows, as miners operate with strong unrealized profits, and hold their BTC rather than sell. The overall selling pressure across miners, long-term holders, and other cohorts has eased significantly . The reduction in supply entering the market has tempered the impact of the recent correction. The US economy closed 2024 with continued evidence of economic resilience , however, this is also mixed with some lingering uncertainty across some key sectors. The labour market remained robust , as jobless claims fell to an eight-month low of 211,000 in late December, defying expectations and reinforcing confidence in the economy’s strength. This unexpected decline, coupled with a drop in continuing claims, suggests that the labour market is cooling at a measured pace without signalling a broader downturn. The positive labour data bolstered market sentiment, strengthening the dollar and prompting modest gains on Wall Street. In contrast, however, the construction sector presented a more subdued picture , with spending stagnating in November after modest growth in October. Gains in single-family homebuilding were offset by declines in multi-family housing and public investment. Elevated mortgage rates, driven by market anticipation of fiscal policy changes under the incoming administration, are weighing on housing demand and new projects. The construction sector faces additional headwinds , including potential tariffs, labour shortages, and trade uncertainties, which could hinder sustained growth despite possible boosts from future infrastructure spending. Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector showed signs of recovery but remained under pressure. The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 49.3 in December, its highest level since March, yet still below the growth threshold of 50. Although production and new orders improved, manufacturing has struggled to fully rebound from a prolonged contraction exacerbated by higher borrowing costs from earlier Federal Reserve rate hikes. Recent rate cuts and the prospect of fiscal stimulus under the incoming administration offer a glimmer of hope, but concerns over trade policies and fluctuating global demand continue to cloud the sector’s outlook. In cryptocurrency news last week: US Congressman Mike Collins disclosed investments in the cryptocurrency Ski Mask Dog (SKI), with purchases totalling between $1,001 and $15,000. His filing, one of the first for 2025, underscores the growing intersection of digital assets and politics, raising questions about transparency and regulatory oversight. Meanwhile, the defunct crypto exchange FTX has initiated its reorganisation plan to repay former users affected by its 2022 collapse. Customers who filed claims can expect repayments within 60 days, with smaller claims receiving priority. MicroStrategy has also announced plans to raise up to $2 billion through perpetual preferred stock offerings. This initiative is part of its ambitious “21/21 Plan” to secure $42 billion over three years for Bitcoin acquisitions. Already the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, with over 145,000 BTC, the company continues to solidify its position in the digital asset market. Have a great trading week!

But can it stick this time?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-wants-3-gdp-growth-for-america/,"Donald Trump has set his sights on a big target: 3% GDP growth for the United States. It’s not a new goal—it’s a throwback to his first term, where the same ambition took center stage. And here’s the thing: the math says it’s possible, at least for now. Over the last nine quarters ending in September, the U.S. economy averaged 3.1% annualized growth in eight of them. Sure, the final numbers for the most recent quarter are still cooking, but early estimates suggest a more modest 2.45%. The problem isn’t whether 3% is achievable today, it’s whether the country can keep that momentum going. Long-term, consistent growth of that magnitude is a whole other beast. And that’s where the real debate begins. The challenge of sustainable growth Most economists agree that the U.S.’s “potential” GDP growth sits at around 2% per year. Potential GDP growth isn’t a guess—it’s a calculated number based on factors like labor force size, productivity, technology, and even immigration. But here’s the catch: potential growth isn’t written in stone. It’s a model-based estimate, and if there’s one thing economists love, it’s debating their own models. Could the U.S. economy have untapped structural changes that could push potential growth higher? Maybe. But the consensus says don’t bet on it. To see why 3% is such a tall order, look at the fundamentals. The labor force is a major piece of the puzzle. Growth in population, whether through immigration or higher birth rates, historically drove GDP expansion. But America isn’t growing like it used to. Fertility rates have dipped, immigration has slowed, and an aging population means fewer workers overall. If you strip away population growth, those 3% glory days start looking a lot less likely. A sustained extra percentage point of growth could mean huge gains: over $30,000 in additional GDP per household in today’s dollars by 2034. It could also put a serious dent in America’s growing debt-to-GDP ratio, shaving off 21 points in the same timeframe. Policy levers: What it takes to move the needle Hitting and maintaining 3% growth would require more than just wishful thinking. It demands deliberate policy shifts across several fronts. Some of the ideas floating around are bold, others are practical, and a few are downright tricky to implement. Take business investment for instance. Encouraging companies to spend more on new ventures is a proven way to boost economic output. Tax cuts aimed specifically at incentivizing investment—like expanding tax credits for research and development or allowing businesses to fully expense investments—could do the trick. Early analysis from economists suggests these types of policies could add around 0.2 percentage points to annual GDP growth. Not bad, but still not enough to close the gap on its own. Then there’s immigration reform. A comprehensive overhaul—think expanded pathways to citizenship, better border security, and more slots for high-skilled workers—could add another 0.3 percentage points annually. It’s a politically charged issue, sure, but the economic math is crystal clear: more immigrants mean more workers, more consumers, and more growth. Climate change, while often framed as an environmental issue, also has major economic implications. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that unmitigated climate damage could shave off at least 0.1 percentage points of growth by 2100. Investments to fight these impacts not only safeguard the economy’s future but also provide immediate growth boosts. Labor force participation is another area ripe for improvement. While prime-age workforce participation rates have rebounded to early-2000s levels, there’s still untapped potential, particularly among women and men without college degrees.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin millionaire dumps $500k from DOGE to invest in PropiChain. Discover why this promising real estate altcoin is predicted to outperform in 2025. Table of Contents Dogecoin’s unpredictability leaves investors wary PropiChain’s unique utility drives Dogecoin millionaires interest PCHAIN offerings garner attention Invest in PropiChain before it sells out Dogecoin (DOGE) captured the spotlight in the crypto world during its explosive rise in 2021, turning early adopters into millionaires. However, the asset has since declined by 53.97% from its all-time high (ATH), leaving investors questioning its long-term sustainability resulting from its hype-driven growth. Meanwhile, predictions of a bullish crypto market in 2025 have Dogecoin investors diversifying into value-driven altcoins, aiming to replicate DOGE’s early success and growth potential. Notably, one Dogecoin millionaire has identified this promising real-world asset (RWA)-based altcoin centered around real estate tokenization to leverage the bullish trend. This real estate altcoin is supported by cutting-edge technologies and has many post-listing benefits tailored for early adopters. Consequently, experts believe this altcoin has the potential to surpass Dogecoin’s early rally and deliver impressive returns in 2025. Dogecoin’s unpredictability leaves investors wary Dogecoin experienced an extraordinary surge in 2021, driven by social media buzz and high-profile endorsements, particularly from Elon Musk. However, Dogecoin has struggled to sustain its momentum due to its lack of a clearly defined use case and limited adoption outside its loyal community. Despite recovering from an 8.21% slump last month with a 20.48% gain over the past week, Dogecoin remains over 52% below its all-time high of $0.73 in 2021. This follows a volatile 366% rally between October and early December, further highlighting the asset’s instability. In response, a Dogecoin millionaire has shifted $500k from DOGE into PropiChain (PCHAIN) , an asset with tangible, real-world applications. PropiChain’s value lies in its focus on fractional ownership of RWA, such as the stable, lucrative real estate industry, which is less susceptible to market volatility. Moreover, the platform boasts a limited token supply of 1.5 billion, creating scarcity and driving demand. PropiChain’s scarcity and utility offer early investors strong long-term return potential, positioning it as a compelling alternative to speculative meme coins in the crypto market. You might also like: XRP price declines, but PropiChain gains momentum with its AI-powered real estate features PropiChain’s unique utility drives Dogecoin millionaires interest Contrary to the hype surrounding Dogecoin, PropiChain’s value is tied to the lucrative $300-trillion-plus real estate industry. The platform’s appeal lies in its advanced technologies used to address long-standing inefficiencies in traditional property management. This includes high entry barriers, operational complexities, and more. RWA fractional ownership PropiChain introduces a transformative shift in real estate through the tokenization of real-world assets. By converting properties into digital tokens, the platform enables fractional ownership starting at just $1,000. This lowers investment barriers, enhances liquidity, and simplifies property ownership for a broader audience. Artificial intelligence AI powers PropiChain’s platform, transforming real estate transactions by automating critical processes, delivering predictive insights, and enhancing decision-making. With AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants, investors gain 24/7 personalized support throughout their real estate investment journey, ensuring a seamless experience. Metaverse technology PropiChain leverages Metaverse technology to redefine how properties are viewed and purchased. With immersive 3D visualization and virtual reality tools, users can conduct virtual property tours from anywhere in the world. This feature eliminates geographical barriers, facilitating cross-border real estate transactions with ease. To boost investor confidence, PropiChain underwent a stringent audit by leading security firm BlockAudit , certifying its platform as highly secure. With its focus on RWA integration, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is poised to redefine the real estate industry and deliver significant returns for early investors. PCHAIN offerings garner attention As Dogecoin struggles with market volatility, PropiChain’s native token, PCHAIN, has emerged as an appealing alternative for Dogecoin millionaires. This real estate altcoin powers the platform’s RWA tokenization while offering a host of standout features and post-listing benefits for early investors. These include property discounts, staking rewards, zero-fee transactions, governance rights, community event bonuses, and more. Note that investors who hold PCHAIN through the final presale stage stand to gain over 800% ROI. This means a modest $1,000 investment could potentially yield $80,000 or more in returns. Additionally, PCHAIN’s recent listing on CoinMarketCap hints at potential listings on other major exchanges, further boosting its visibility. With its strong value-driven proposition and significant return potential, it’s no surprise that Dogecoin millionaires are turning to this promising asset. Invest in PropiChain before it sells out Much like Dogecoin’s early rally, PropiChain’s token presale is experiencing rapid growth. Phase 1 of the presale successfully ended after raising approximately $1.3 million, while Phase 2 is moving swiftly with over $626,000 raised. The limited supply of tokens continues to fuel demand, with the asset expected to be listed once the presale concludes. Currently, PCHAIN’s second presale stage is priced at $0.011 per token, with a planned increase to $0.023 in the third stage and a listing price of $0.032. This exceptionally low price makes the current stage the most accessible opportunity for investors, offering an ideal entry point for those who missed out on the first phase.

33767162,[object Object],1736171813,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,The 5 Top Meme Coins Predicted to Explode in 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/top-meme-coins-predicted-explode-2025/,"We anticipate 2025 to be a very good year for meme coins. After years of toiling in the shadows of its bigger siblings (Bitcoin and Ethereum), the top meme coins seem to be finally flexing their muscles. Crypto traders are preparing for Donald Trump’s re-ascension to the White House on January 20, partly by anticipating sudden gains in Bitcoin’s value . When Bitcoin does well, other crypto coins usually also do well. If Bitcoin takes off like rocket fuel as anticipated, then we can expect the following five meme coins to follow the same upward trajectory. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Pepe Project Raised $42M, Nears Listing Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is likely to do really well in 2025 for two reasons: It’s seeking to capitalize on the huge popularity of $PEPE. It has a compelling use case behind it – beat the whales at their own game and hand the same financial insights and power into the hands of the little people. Who can’t be motivated by a mission like that? Since its launch back in early December 2024, $WEPE has raised more than $1M a day, which means it’s now sitting on a war chest of over $42M. Traders have been very active, with one whale buying $200K $WEPE shortly after the presale went live. Expect that to go up even more as launch day approaches in March (according to the project’s Coinsniper profile ). We recommend you read $WEPE’s litepaper to see what makes it click, and follow them on X to stay up-to-date with the latest goings on. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Layer-2 Coin Aims to Improve Solana & Raises $8.6M Solaxy ($SOLX) is also having a ‘hold my beer’ moment. With incredible staking rewards (which has seen over 2.8B tokens locked up), a current token price of $0.001592, and a compelling real-world use, it’s giving other upcoming top meme coins a real run for their money. The Solaxy presale also started in December 2024 and has seen gains of over $8.6M since then. $SOLX aims to improve upon the existing Solana ecosystem. This includes reducing congestion and dealing with spam transactions, network outages, and scalability issues. Traders can use the $SOLX token to pay transaction fees as well. However, practical, real-world use is no guarantee of a coin’s success. But we think Solaxy has the potential to grow legs and keep on running throughout 2025, especially with enough community support. See its whitepaper to understand why. 3. Flockerz ($FLOCK) – Vote-to-Earn Project Attracts Investors It’s not only frogs who are going to potentially have a good year, but hopefully birds, too. Continuing the theme of animal-based crypto coins is Flockerz ($FLOCK) . It promises token holders the right to vote on the coin’s future (and get rewarded for it through the first-ever Vote-to-Earn mechanism), which seems to attract investors, going by the presale figures. $FLOCK has raised $8.9M since its launch back in September, and its launch price is currently sitting at $0.0066351 (although it’s set to increase in 16 days). The 307% staking APY doesn’t hurt either, which has led to over 586M $FLOCK tokens being locked up by investors. Look through the Flockerz whitepaper to see why the project might be a winner this year. 4. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – Innovative Meme Coin Index Raises $1.9M Remember how we said that real-world use isn’t a guarantee of a coin’s future success? Well, Meme Index ($MEMEX) could prove to be the exception to that rule. Part of its popularity is its promised simplicity and accessibility. Buying meme coins has always been a ‘clumsy’ process with different networks getting involved and costly transaction fees. Meme Index aims to greatly simplify this process with one single platform for buying meme coins and cheaper transaction fees. Holding $MEMEX tokens gives you exclusive benefits, such as governance and voting rights. There’s also the not-so-inconsiderable 1,216% staking APY and a token price of $0.0149831, which gives you an early-bird advantage. You can invest in four different types of investment plans, ranging from the ‘sleep soundly at night’ low-risk indexes to the ‘pass me my blood pressure medication’ high-risk and volatile ones. Make sure to read Meme Index’s whitepaper and follow the project on X to stay updated with the latest developments. 5. Pepe ($PEPE) – The Legend Makes a Comeback Pepe ($PEPE) has been around since May 2023, which makes it a dinosaur in crypto market terms. So why is it on this list? Because it’s seeing growth once again. It may be marine-based animal nostalgia, but it could also be because of Wall Street Pepe’s staggering success so far. Maybe investors are falling in love with frogs once again, and Pepe is claiming some of that love for itself. Not being a presale, Pepe doesn’t have any staking APY to offer, but its token price has seen a lift of 10.9% over the past week. So, while you’re thinking about investing in Wall Street Pepe, maybe also give some love to Daddy Pepe, too? Can Meme Coins Help You Get That Yacht Deposit in 2025? With the expected Bitcoin surge after January 20, your meme coin portfolio can look pretty respectable if the developers play their cards right. We estimate that, with the launch of coins like Wall Street Pepe and Meme Index, meme coins will have their spotlight moment in 2025. Obviously, though, these are estimations, not guarantees. Do your own independent research and come to your own conclusions. Never invest money you could potentially lose. Have a good 2025, and keep your shirt.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-06 13:56:53

MSTX provides 2x leveraged exposure to MicroStrategy, amplifying both potential gains and losses, with a 1.29% expense ratio. MSTX and MSTU are similar, but MSTU's lower expense ratio and earlier 2x leverage have attracted more assets. Michael Saylor's influence in the bitcoin space boosts sentiment and makes MSTX an appealing option for bullish bitcoin investors. Single stock ETFs have become one of the hottest industry trends over the past year. The most popular have come in two flavors - those that write short-term options on stocks to generate ultra-high yields and those that create leveraged exposure on them. The latter group has produced some of the best performers of 2024. Even though it hasn't even been around for a full year, the Defiance Daily Target 2X Long MSTR ETF ( MSTX ) has returned more than 200% since its inception in August of last year. What's more? It was up more than 700% at one point in November following MicroStrategy's ( MSTR ) big bitcoin-fueled post-election rally. MSTX vs. MSTR (StockCharts) While I'm pretty sure anybody would take these returns, it's important to realize that these products come with a high cost - volatility. Volatility is the enemy of leveraged ETFs because they can amplify the downside more than enhance upside. Even if returns in the underlying are positive, returns in leveraged versions of them can be negative because of this dynamic. Data by YCharts MicroStrategy is already one of the most volatile securities in the financial markets. MSTX doubles that through the use of derivatives contracts. For the record, that makes MSTX about 4 times as volatile as bitcoin and roughly 20 times as volatile as the S&P 500. Instead of focusing only on the 200%+ returns, consider drawdown risk. Since the middle of November, MicroStrategy is down 28% from its all-time high. Over that same time, MSTX has fallen more than 60%. Data by YCharts Clearly, leveraged ETFs, such as MSTX, aren't for the faint of heart, nor are they designed to be long-term buy and hold investments. MSTX could be an interesting option for those betting on a reemergent bitcoin rally (or betting on Michael Saylor), but it's important to understand how these products work before diving in. How MSTX Works MSTX seeks daily leveraged investment results of 200% the daily percentage change in the share price of MicroStrategy Incorporated. It works like most other leveraged ETFs in that it resets its exposure every business day. The fund currently comes with an expense ratio of 1.29%. The short-term reset of exposure means MSTX is better geared for short-term traders than long-term investors, for the reasons mentioned earlier. MSTX vs. MSTU You may already know that MSTX isn't the only leveraged ETF out there based on MicroStrategy. There's also the T-Rex 2X Long MSTR Daily Target ETF ( MSTU ) , which I profiled HERE a couple of months ago. As far as differences between the two ETFs, there are very few. The biggest one is the expense ratio. MSTX charges 1.29%, but MSTU's expense ratio is a modestly lower 1.05%. MSTX debuted on August 14, 2024. MSTU launched shortly thereafter on September 18, 2024. Usually, the fund that launches first tends to capture the larger asset base. Not so in the case of MSTX and MSTU. The latter has just over $1.2 billion in AUM compared to just under $900 million for MSTX. The reason could be the leverage itself that is used. When it debuted, MSTX implemented 1.75x leverage on MicroStrategy. MSTU came out a month later with 2x leverage and became the preference for investors looking to dial up their exposure as much as possible. In late October, MSTX modified its objective to deliver 2x exposure as well. Outside of the difference in expense ratios, there's very little difference between MSTX and MSTU. The Michael Saylor Effect Michael Saylor's official title might be the Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, but he's really become one of the primary voices in the bitcoin space. The SaylorTracker.com website has become wildly popular as a way of tracking the company's bitcoin holdings (which are currently at more than 446,000). His vocal support of bitcoin and his regular purchases of the cryptocurrency have unquestionably supported sentiment throughout the current cycle. In fact, his activity has garnered a lot of attention lately. Saylor is expected to add to MicroStrategy's bitcoin holdings for the 9th straight week. He may or may not continue at this pace as we progress through 2025, but his influence in the bitcoin space is unquestioned, and it's unlikely to slow down anytime soon. Conclusion If you're bullish on bitcoin or even just a big fan of Michael Saylor, investing in MSTX could be a good way to play it. The 2x leverage exposure to one of the most volatile stocks in the market means investors will need an iron stomach, but there's a lot of potential if there's another leg higher in crypto in the near future. MSTX may come with the higher expense ratio than MSTU, but it also comes with a narrower trading spread. That means more frequent traders in this ETF could find MSTX more advantageous on a total cost basis. Given that leveraged ETFs are only meant for short holding periods, that could actually swing the pendulum in MSTX's favor.",MSTR|MSTU|MSTX,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-06 14:00:00

The debate, moderated by Emily Bao, Bybit’s Head of Spot and Web3, brought together two expert teams discussing the future trajectory of the Sui blockchain. Team Mass Adoption, featuring Cynthia Qu from the Sui Foundation, angel investor Joe Takayama, Aslan Tashtanov from DeepBook, and Nathan Ramli from Scallop, highlighted the importance of scalability and global accessibility in driving Sui's growth. On the other side, Team Native Growth, represented by Carl Leung from NAVI, Mia from Loopy, Sarah Chang from LumiWave, and Sean Mikha from SuiNS, emphasized the need for a sustainable, community-driven ecosystem to support long-term success. Team Native Growth Maintained That a Community-Driven Ecosystem Is the Only Path to Long-Term Success Joe Takayama discussed the potential impact of evolving political and regulatory landscapes on the blockchain ecosystem. He noted that favorable regulatory changes, particularly in key markets like the U.S., could accelerate blockchain adoption in 2025. Increased liquidity and institutional involvement could significantly boost the growth of projects such as Sui. Aslan Tashtanov pointed to the growing importance of developer-friendly infrastructure. He explained that in 2025, blockchain platforms that lower the barriers to entry and make app deployment faster and easier will attract a more diverse group of developers, driving innovation on networks like Sui. Team Mass Adoption Contended That Scaling Globally Will Define Sui’s Success in 2025 Mia from Loopy shared her perspective on the changing behavior of Web2 users in the blockchain space. She observed that many users are initially drawn by the promise of financial gains but, after facing challenges such as losses, are turning to more advanced tools like trading bots and AI agents. This trend, she explained, highlights the increasing need for sophisticated blockchain technologies to support more sustainable income models. Carl Leung discussed the ongoing convergence between Web2 and Web3. He emphasized that in 2025, projects that bridge these two worlds will gain significant traction, pointing to platforms like Polymarket, which engage traditional Web2 users in Web3 environments through prediction markets. A Shared Vision Emerges Despite Contrasting Strategies The lively debate ended with both sides agreeing on key trends shaping 2025: Increased institutional involvement driving liquidity and legitimacy. Developer-centric platforms lowering barriers for innovation. Growing user sophistication, demanding smarter tools and sustainable income models. Emily Bao concluded the debate by reflecting on Sui’s unique position in Web3's evolution, emphasizing that flexibility and scalability will be critical as blockchain technology continues to mature. Bybit Web3’s Vision for 2025 The event also showcased Bybit Web3’s commitment to engaging with the Sui ecosystem through its ""Sui Wonderland"" initiative. Attendees explored opportunities like airdrops, Web3 staking, and DEX Pro tools, with over $310,000 in prizes up for grabs. Emily Bao summed up the outlook for 2025: ""Bybit is proud to champion the growth of forward-thinking ecosystems like Sui. As we move into 2025, discussions like these are vital in shaping the future of Web3 and ensuring that blockchain technologies realize their full potential."" #Bybit / #TheCryptoArk About Bybit Web3 Bybit Web3 is redefining openness in the decentralized world, creating a simpler, open, and equal ecosystem for everyone.

According to a filing on Dec. 30, Crypto platform MoonPay, BitStaete (a digital asset management company), ZBD (a bitcoin lightning FinTech), and Hidden Road (a prime brokerage and clearing company) have received a crypto asset service provider license from the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM). Notably, MiCA is a new EU rule for crypto companies, requiring them to obtain a Crypto Asset Service Provider (CASP) license from one member state, which enables them to operate across all EU countries. The European Union had set a Dec. 30 deadline for its member states to implement MiCA, though not all countries have managed to do so. MoonPay’s CEO, Ivan Soto-Wright, expressed pride in being among the first to adopt the new framework with the Dutch authority. “MiCA represents a pivotal moment for the European digital asset industry, and we’re proud to have worked collaboratively with the Dutch AFM to be among the first to embrace this new regulatory framework,” shared Ivan Soto-Wright, CEO and co-founder of MoonPay, in a statement. Socios.com, a platform for fan engagement, has been granted approval by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) to operate as a regulated crypto service provider. The approval is for a class 3 Virtual Financial Assets Act (VFAA) license that will enable it to operate as a regulated Virtual Financial Asset service provider.

It’s the term used to describe when a trader borrows assets from an exchange so they can increase their buying and selling power, in order to control a much larger position than they could do with their existing capital. Depending on the exchange used, the amount of leverage varies. While more comprehensive exchanges like Dolomite and Uniswap might allow for 5x or 10x leverage, there are some specialist exchanges that can boost this all the way up to 100x and beyond. The leverage describes how much a trader is able to multiply their capital. For instance, a 2x leverage means they can open a position with twice as much capital as their deposit, while 10x means they can borrow time-times the amount of capital they have. Leverage is often used with crypto derivatives, such as futures and options contracts, and it can be extremely profitable for successful traders. But of course, it’s important to remember that the risks associated with leverage are amplified just as much as the potential profits. We can better understand this risk by looking at home leveraged trading works. The first step is to deposit assets into your trading account to open a leveraged trade. The deposit serves as collateral, and varies based on how much leverage you’re looking for, as well as the size of the position or margin you intend to open. If you want to trade $500 in BTC with 2x leverage, you’ll need to deposit $250 as collateral. In addition, the exchange will also require you to maintain a sufficient margin for your trade. If the price of the asset you’re trading moves in the wrong direction, the margin will drop significantly, and if it gets close to zero, the exchange will request that you add more assets to protect your margin. If you don’t do this, it will liquidate your position, and you’ll forfeit the entire collateral deposit. High leverage virtually guarantees liquidation Leveraged trading may sound complicated, but the basics are really quite simple, and it can be an extremely useful feature for profitable traders, helping to accelerate their gains. However, it can also be one of the easiest ways to lose your entire nest egg, if you don’t know what you are doing, or even if you do know, but fall victim to plain old back luck. One of the biggest mistakes a trader can make when trying to use leverage is to always use the maximum allowed by the exchange. This can be extremely tempting, especially if you’re “convinced” that the market is heading in only one direction. The temptation of enormous profits offered by platforms like PrimeXBT which offers an incredible 200x leverage, and Margex , which goes up to 100x, can be very difficult to resist, but it’s highly recommended that you should indeed, refrain from going all-in. The danger of leveraged trading is that it’s far easier to lose than it is to win. Crypto assets are notoriously volatile, and even if the market is experiencing bull conditions, prices will still go up and down by a fairly significant degree, making it difficult for traders to maintain the margins required to protect their deposit. For instance, let’s imagine that trader Bob has $1,000 and he’s going to open a position on BTC with 10x leverage. The leverage means Bob’s position is actually worth $10,000, even though he only put down $1,000 as collateral. If BTC’s price goes up 1%, Bob’s gain will be 10%, due to the 10x leverage. But if BTC’s value drops by 1%, his loss will amount to 10% of his collateral deposit. Because a 1% drop eliminates 10% of his collateral, it doesn’t take long at all for the entire deposit to be wiped out. If the price of BTC fell by just 10%, Bob would lose everything. Now imagine if Bob had chosen 100x leverage, the risk of losing it all is multiplied significantly, as a 1% price decline would be enough to wipe him out. The risk is that double-digit asset price movements happen with alarming regularity in crypto, making even small amounts of leverage very risky. Winners use leverage wisely Of course, leverage is still a powerful tool for traders and it can help them to realize some very substantial profit increases. So we’re not saying never to use it. Rather, leverage is a tool that’s best used in moderation. Smart traders can do exceptionally well by using leverage of 5x or 10x at the most, which should ensure they have enough capital to maintain the collateral margin that’s required to avoid liquidation. After all, while crypto asset prices can be volatile, it’s not every day that they see drops or gains of more than 10%. By using lower leverage, traders can take a more calculated risk, increasing their chances of a (still significant) profit by a fairly big degree. For this reason, it’s recommended to avoid exchanges that specialize in high leveraged trading, as such platforms are so focused on this that they lack many advanced trading features. By using a more versatile platform, such as Dolomite , traders can tap into an extensive ecosystem of DeFi capabilities that go well beyond just trading, such as borrowing, lending, liquidity provision, staking, restaking, liquid restaking and yield farming. Dolomite has also announced an upcoming airdrop campaign tied to a recent snapshot of user activity. The airdrop will reward users with DOLO and veDOLO tokens, scaling rewards based on platform activity and offering additional benefits for Minerals Program participants. This initiative further highlights Dolomite’s focus on incentivizing its community while delivering innovative DeFi solutions. Dolomite can offer these features because it’s not exclusively focused on high leverage. In fact, the range of assets it can offer 5x to 10x leverage on is far greater than platforms like PrimeXBT and Margex. It also offers a novel feature known as “margin pair trading”, where the ratio between any two digital assets can be traded, instead of being restricted to values denominated in US dollars. This gives users the flexibility to adopt more complex trading strategies. In addition, Dolomite offers traders the bonus of earning automated yield. From the moment they deposit a crypto asset on its platform, it will instantly go to one of its DEX liquidity pools and begin earning interest that’s returned to the user. And it will carry on doing so even while the trader is using it as collateral for their leveraged trades. They’ll also receive an LP token that can be used to borrow other crypto assets, including yield-bearing ones like jUSDC, further boosting their rewards. And all the while, they’ll be able to focus on their leveraged trading. The moral of the story is that leveraged trading is surely a useful weapon for experienced traders to boost their profit potential, but only a fool would go all-out with this strategy and leave themselves exposed to the kinds of risks that come from getting too greedy. The reality is that very few traders remain profitable for long when tempted by massive amounts of leverage. As with everything, leveraged trading requires traders to be smart and maintain a delicate balancing act. Don't borrow too much and leave yourself exposed. Especially when some trading platforms offer alternative mechanisms for increasing your profits. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The debate, moderated by Emily Bao, Bybit’s Head of Spot and Web3, brought together two expert teams discussing the future trajectory of the Sui blockchain. Team Mass Adoption, featuring Cynthia Qu from the Sui Foundation, angel investor Joe Takayama, Aslan Tashtanov from DeepBook, and Nathan Ramli from Scallop, highlighted the importance of scalability and global accessibility in driving Sui’s growth. On the other side, Team Native Growth, represented by Carl Leung from NAVI, Mia from Loopy, Sarah Chang from LumiWave, and Sean Mikha from SuiNS, emphasized the need for a sustainable, community-driven ecosystem to support long-term success. Team Native Growth Maintained That a Community-Driven Ecosystem Is the Only Path to Long-Term Success Joe Takayama discussed the potential impact of evolving political and regulatory landscapes on the blockchain ecosystem. He noted that favorable regulatory changes, particularly in key markets like the U.S., could accelerate blockchain adoption in 2025. Increased liquidity and institutional involvement could significantly boost the growth of projects such as Sui. Aslan Tashtanov pointed to the growing importance of developer-friendly infrastructure. He explained that in 2025, blockchain platforms that lower the barriers to entry and make app deployment faster and easier will attract a more diverse group of developers, driving innovation on networks like Sui. Team Mass Adoption Contended That Scaling Globally Will Define Sui’s Success in 2025 Mia from Loopy shared her perspective on the changing behavior of Web2 users in the blockchain space. She observed that many users are initially drawn by the promise of financial gains but, after facing challenges such as losses, are turning to more advanced tools like trading bots and AI agents. This trend, she explained, highlights the increasing need for sophisticated blockchain technologies to support more sustainable income models. Carl Leung discussed the ongoing convergence between Web2 and Web3. He emphasized that in 2025, projects that bridge these two worlds will gain significant traction, pointing to platforms like Polymarket, which engage traditional Web2 users in Web3 environments through prediction markets. A Shared Vision Emerges Despite Contrasting Strategies The lively debate ended with both sides agreeing on key trends shaping 2025: Increased institutional involvement driving liquidity and legitimacy. Developer-centric platforms lowering barriers for innovation. Growing user sophistication , demanding smarter tools and sustainable income models. Emily Bao concluded the debate by reflecting on Sui’s unique position in Web3’s evolution, emphasizing that flexibility and scalability will be critical as blockchain technology continues to mature. Bybit Web3’s Vision for 2025 The event also showcased Bybit Web3’s commitment to engaging with the Sui ecosystem through its “Sui Wonderland” initiative. Attendees explored opportunities like airdrops, Web3 staking, and DEX Pro tools, with over $310,000 in prizes up for grabs. Emily Bao summed up the outlook for 2025: “Bybit is proud to champion the growth of forward-thinking ecosystems like Sui. As we move into 2025, discussions like these are vital in shaping the future of Web3 and ensuring that blockchain technologies realize their full potential.” #Bybit / #TheCryptoArk About Bybit Web3 Bybit Web3 is redefining openness in the decentralized world, creating a simpler, open, and equal ecosystem for everyone.

It could also come under pressure after forming a popular bearish chart pattern. Pepe Coin Price Is At Risk As Top Holders Scale Back Pepe, the third biggest meme coin, has recovered by over 40% from its lowest level in December as investors bought the dip. Now, however, there are signs that some big holders have started to sell the coin, which could lead to more weakness in the near term. Santiment data shows that the supply held by top addresses as a percentage of total supply has dropped to 39.78 billion, down from over 45 billion tokens a few weeks ago. Pepe Large Holders Are Selling More data by IntoTheBlock shows that the number of addresses has continued falling in the past few weeks. New addresses have fallen by 13.21% in the last seven days, while active addresses have dropped by 3.90%. This decline is a sign that many users anticipate that the token price will continue falling. Pepe Active Addresses Meanwhile, smart money investors have also started to sell the Pepe coin as its price dropped from its all-time high. There are now just 90 smart money holders of the coin, down from near 110 a few weeks ago. Pepe Coin Smart Money Pepe Price Chart Points To a Big Crash Soon The 4H chart shows that the Pepe price peaked at $0.00002190 last week, where it formed a double-top chart pattern. This was an important price since it was along the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level, which provides crucial resistance. Now, the Pepe coin price has formed a rising wedge chart pattern , which results into a bearish breakout. The upper trendline links the highest swings since December 24, while the lower side connects the lowest levels since December 21. These two support and resistance levels are now nearing their convergence, which is when a bearish breakout usually happens. Pepe Coin Price Chart Pepe Forecast Reveals Key Targets Based on this technical analysis, we can estimate that the value of Pepe will soon have a bearish breakout. This view will be confirmed if it drops below the lower side of the wedge and the 50-period moving average at $0.00002020. Such a move will put Pepe at risk of falling to the December low of $0.00001433, which is about 30% below the current level. On the other hand, the bearish Pepe prediction will be invalidated if it rises above the key resistance at $0.00002190, the highest swing this month. That rebound will push it to the psychological point at $0.00002535, which is 22% above the current level.

The chance presented in the crypto market escaped many investors. Still, one crypto trader boldly predicted a 900% rise in Bonk. Bonk had shot to an all-time high (ATH) of $0.000059 by the end of the bull run 2023. Those who listened to this trader and purchased Bonk at its early pricing had amazing gains. A $1,000 investment would have risen to $9,000—a stunning 9x return in a year. Although these exponential gains are rare nowadays, the same crypto trader today thinks Rexas Finance (RXS) is ready for a comparable, if not larger, run. The trader claims that from its present price of $0.175, Rexas Finance might witness an incredible 17,550% rise; therefore, it is the next major cryptocurrency to watch for large gains. Rexas Finance (RXS): Future Prospect Launched on the Ethereum network, Rexas Finance is an ERC20 token with an eye toward Real World Asset (RWA) tokenizing. This lets consumers tokenize practically any real-world asset worldwide—including real estate, art, goods, and intellectual property. Rexas Finance offers rare liquidity and investment possibilities in markets once illiquid by combining blockchain technology with asset tokenization. The success of Rexas Finance’s presale—free from venture capitalist participation—clearly shows the growing interest in this project. Starting in September 2024 at $0.03 in Stage 1, the presale is now in Stage 11, priced at $0.175. As of the present writing, it has already raised an amazing $34,525,171. The presale is now 91.29% complete, showing the great demand for the token, given that 387,998,694 tokens have been sold. The continuous Rexas Millionaire Giveaway campaign shows that Rexas Finance strives to create a committed and involved community. With over 700,000 entries thus far, this project presents a $1,000,000 token prize pool. Participants who meet the minimum $100 investment criteria are qualified for the giveaway, which will award twenty fortunate winners $50,000 worth of RXS tokens. This initiative is raising token awareness in the crypto market and generating more demand. Rexas Finance has made significant progress in establishing credibility among the crypto community. Major tracking sites, including CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, have listed the coin so investors can track its performance and market statistics. Moreover, Certik, one of the top blockchain security firms, thoroughly inspected Rexas Finance to guarantee its dependability and security. This audit raises investor confidence, which increases the appeal and dependability of Rexas Finance. Rexas Finance’s Future and 17,550% Rally Prediction Although Rexas Finance intends to list on top-tier platforms in the first quarter of 2025, RXS tokens are not currently available on most exchanges. This listing, together with the expected altcoin boom, puts Rexas Finance in a position to see its first significant bull run. Correctly predicting Bonk’s 900% surge, the crypto trader has observed the development of Rexas Finance and projects a 17,550% rise from the present price of $0.175. The trader bases his forecast on several important elements. First, with its original method of tokenizing real-world assets, which offers a useful use for blockchain technology, Rexas Finance is filling a major void in the market. This might propel significant long-term expansion and adoption. Second, the success of the presale and the participation of a wide spectrum of investors point to great token demand. The anticipated exchange listing in early 2025 aligns with a predicted bull market, positioning Rexas Finance for a notable price increase. Based on the projected demand and rising investor interest as the project develops, the 17,550% rise would bring the price of RXS to $30.88. At the present price of $0.175, a $1,000 investment would yield about 5,714 RXS tokens. If Rexas Finance landed at the expected price of $30.88, the same 5,714 tokens would be valued at $176,794. This emphasizes the possibility of large returns for early investors. Conclusion Rexas Finance (RXS) is fast-rising among the most exciting altcoins available on the crypto market. Its strong presale success, original method of RWA tokenization, and excellent future exchange listing plans set RXS for explosive development. The trader who precisely predicted Bonk’s 900% rally is now endorsing Rexas Finance with a bold prognosis of a 17,550% increase, an interesting prospect for investors wishing to profit on the next major crypto spike.

Brandt pointed out that Bitcoin has seen an incredible rise in the past years, and that BTC, which was traded at $0.07 in 2010, reached approximately $98,000, an increase of 1.4 million times. Brandt stated that these increases will not continue indefinitely and that investors who think that there will be a continuous increase are wrong. Brandt underlined that young investors in particular are unprepared for such major corrections and warned investors about the dangers of excessive leverage and unrealistic expectations. The analyst noted that investors should be prepared for the possibility of serious corrections, saying that Bitcoin could correct by 50%. Brandt said that investors who think the rise will continue will miss the peak and explode when the big correction comes unless they give up. Brandt argued that there is a possibility that Bitcoin could experience a 50% correction at some point, while altcoins and memecoins could face steeper declines, falling 90% and 100% respectively. “I say this as someone who has witnessed the markets for 50 years. Some people are going to do great things from now on. But too many traders will use too much leverage, miss the peak, and explode when BTC experiences a 50% correction, altcoins a 90% correction, and memes a 100% correction. These corrections have hit traders before and it will happen again.” I say this having witnessed markets for 50 years. Some will do great from here forward. But too many fools will get too leveraged, miss the top and get blown out in the next 50% correction in BTC, 90% correction in altcoins, 100% correction in memes https://t.co/o33Jnq4IHz — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) January 6, 2025 *This is not investment advice.

Recent on-chain data indicated that large investors have accumulated 140M DOGE, bringing heightened buying pressure to the asset. As a result, traders and investors are now anticipating phenomenal gains in the dog-themed meme coin’s price shortly ahead. Dogecoin Whales Buy 140M Tokens Sparking Market Optimism According to a recent X post by the top crypto market analyst Ali Martinez, Dogecoin whales bought 140 million coins in the last 24 hours. The massive buying, indicating rising market interest in the asset, has ignited an optimistic torrent amid the crypto’s broader developments. Source: Ali Martinez, X Notably, DOGE has emerged as the talk of the crypto town lately, primarily as Elon Musk’s X payment launch has fueled speculations of a price rally. X Money, set to be introduced this year, aims to offer services related to cryptocurrency support, mirroring China’s WeChat. Although there are no official comments on the matter yet, market participants anticipate Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and stablecoins like Tether’s USDT could play a vital role in the launch. Altogether, the DOGE whales’ massive buying amid this event has sparked significant investor enthusiasm. Meanwhile, strong market dynamics have further paved a bullish road for the top dog-themed meme cryptocurrency . 30% Gains For DOGE Looms? At press time, DOGE price jumped roughly 2% intraday and is currently trading at $0.3861. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $0.3763 and $0.3891, respectively. Notably, the top meme coin soars after volatile trading in the early hours today, reflecting the massive buying pressure of the Dogecoin whales. Moreover, a recent DOGE price analysis by CoinGape revealed that 30% gains for the token loom against the backdrop of strong market technicals. Particularly, the market value to relative value z-score indicator indicates that the value of DOGE is still cheap despite surging by 365% from its bottom in September. Overall, the abovementioned stats have urged market participants to optimistically monitor the meme coin amid speculations of a bull cycle continuation in 2025.

Grewal previously said that Coinbase’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests uncovered instances where the FDIC asked banks to freeze crypto services Said Grewal at the time, “The letters that show Operation Chokepoint 2.0 wasn’t just some crypto conspiracy theory. FDIC is still hiding behind way overbroad redactions. And they still haven’t produced more than a fraction of them.” Grewal now says on the social media platform X that after using a court order to unredact many of the letters, there is clear evidence of a deliberate effort by the government to stifle the growth of crypto in the US. “We finally got the unredacted OCP 2.0 letters from [the FDIC]. It took a court order but you can now read them for yourself… They show a coordinated effort to stop a wide variety of crypto activity — everything from basic BTC transactions to more complex offerings. Note that FDIC magically found TWO more pause letters in this search after saying before that it had complied with an earlier Court order. It’s hard to believe in their good faith when their sweater further unravels every time we pull on the thread. The new Congress should launch hearings on all this without delay.” According to investor and crypto advocate Nic Carter, the unredacted letters prove the FDIC pressured dozens of financial institutions to pause or curtail services involving Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other crypto assets. “So in summary, we now have it on record that between 2022 and 2023 the FDIC sent out at least 25 letters asking banks to indefinitely pause or curtail: – Bitcoin and Ethereum buy/sell products for bank clients – private blockchain settlement networks – public blockchain settlement for bank client transfers – permissioned stablecoin issuance – the holding of crypto assets and NFTs by banks – onboarding of ‘ ecosystem’ firms as clients (letter 16) – Bitcoin-backed lending – providing depository services to stablecoins – issuing debit cards with Bitcoin cash back.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The research firm also reported a surge in XRP (+16%), $ADA (+25%), $XLM (+32%), SUI (+26%), and other L1 assets. The analytics platform also revealed that Bitcoin’s market capitalization rose by 0.48% to reach $3.74T. The data also indicated that BTC’s dominance rose by 0.44%, and the Fear & Greed index rose to 76, indicating extreme market greed. Bitcoin retakes $100k once again Bitcoin began the year with strong momentum, reaching the $99,765 mark and gaining over 6% in price appreciation. The upsurge in price has renewed investor optimism, but selling pressure continued to cap the price below the psychological $100,000 level until today, as BTC just broke just reclaimed $100k. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju believes that old whales could be the reason for BTC’s plunge in price at such a critical time in the cycle. Young revealed in a recent analysis that veteran BTC holders have been offloading significant amounts of BTC. He noted that over-the-counter (OTC) transactions are playing a major role in the recent selling pressure. Ki Young Ju believes the controlled selling strategy indicated a calculated approach by seasoned investors balancing profit-taking with market stability. Friend: Who the f*ck is selling #Bitcoin now? Me: Old whales. High OTC volume and exchange deposits, but they won’t crash the market, imo. Buying pressure is mainly from U.S. institutions on Coinbase, but daily premium is at a 2-year low. Needs recovery for the next leg up. pic.twitter.com/6VlJvCMFbz — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) January 2, 2025 Over the past few weeks, BTC’s market dynamics have shifted from extremely bullish to concerns about a possible correction. At the moment, the cryptocurrency has reclaimed an optimistic outlook as investors celebrate the $100k resurgence. Young also disclosed that buying pressure is stemming from U.S. companies like Coinbase. Yet, there’s a stipulation that the firm’s daily premium, which is a key indicator of institutional demand, is at a two-year low. Young believes it suggests that although institutional players are involved, they still don’t have enough momentum to propel Bitcoin toward its next major rally. The CEO emphasized the need for BTC’s institutional demand to maintain an upward momentum in 2025. He believes this will allow Bitcoin to break through resistance levels and continue pushing higher. Crypto moguls expect Bitcoin to respect current support Bitcoin’s price just crossed $100k at the time of publication, instilling cautious optimism among investors. Investors view this level as pivotal in BTC’s price action, expecting a potential push toward the ATH. A breakout above the $100k level is crucial as it will ignite a decisive upward trend that could set the stage for new all-time highs. The last day of 2024 saw Bitcoin retest the $92K range, which was a key demand level. Once the year began, BTC respected the support level and soared higher. However, CryptoQuant’s head of research, Julio Monero, revealed on-chain data suggesting that Bitcoin’s price could reach the $80K mark if it fails to hold. Monero suggested that the $80K mark is the point with unrealized profits, which means traders have little incentive to sell further at those levels. Monero’s analysis indicated that traders have locked in profits, but persistence in demand and bullish market sentiment may not actually result in a sharp correction to the $80K mark. Institutional buying, led by Microstrategy , was one of the key drivers behind Bitcoin’s rise in 2024. The company acquired more than 423,650 BTC by the end of last year. After each public announcement, the firm’s former CEO, Micheal Saylor, inspired confidence among retail and institutional investors. Saylor teased a Monday Bitcoin purchase with a picture of the SaylorTracker, a viral graph that tracks the firm’s buys. The company is sitting on $44B worth of BTC as of Monday, and a $2 billion capital raise is expected in its announced “21/21 Plan in the first quarter of 20 25.” The company stated that its decision on whether to proceed with and consummate the offering is subject to market conditions.

Side by side, the cryptocurrency gained up to 1.78% of value from its previous close. The bearish strength remained high yesterday; however, today the bulls bounced back. Technical indicators as well as the price charts continue to give out a bullish overview of the market. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has a strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is considered a highly volatile coin, and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification is advised. However, the coin is expected to touch the $0.899 level by 2026. Why is DOGE up? DOGE’s price increased to $0.385 over the last 24 hours. Side by side, the presence of strong resistance at the $0.390 mark is yet to be overcome by DOGE. Will DOGE reach $0.450? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by August 2025. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support for this meme coin can push it to $1. Will DOGE reach $5? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE could not reach the $5 level in the foreseeable future. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is following a downward pattern since it peaked at $0.468 on December 8, 2024, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $2.51 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial. Recent news/opinion on Dogecoin Despite being the most popular meme coin in the cryptocurrency industry and having Elon Musk’s strong backing, no investment fund manager has applied to the commission for a spot DOGE ETF. After the new administration takes office, Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst, now forecasts filings. Read more about it here . CoinGlass data shows that Dogecoin’s Open Interest has increased by 7%, which is corroborated by a 5% price gain. The surge is attributed to more new money entering the market, suggesting a bullish run. Analysts remain optimistic about Dogecoin and expect further upside in the coming days.

By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. Dogecoin traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. At the start of 2025, DOGE is trading near the $0.326 level.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-06 15:33:00

Investors' eyes are now turned to a new RWA project that is listed on CoinMarketCap , PropiChain (PCHAIN). The real-world asset project prepares for a market breaking 50,000% surge. In this text, we will give details on the decline of the Ethereum (ETH) altcoins and look into the high-potential PropiChain and why it is expected to deliver a massive ROI. The Decline of Ethereum DeFi Altcoins that Draws Investors’ Attention to PCHAIN The past few weeks have not been particularly great for Ethereum, as it has lost more than 10% in the past 14 days. However, ETH has gained more than 40% in the past 1 year, and though experts believe Ethereum has under-delivered because predictions suggested its price would be higher than it is at the moment. Ethereum is still struggling to retain the $4000 mark and maintain it as a support level. Regardless, analysts believe ETH will perform better in the coming year, and Ethereum DeFi altcoins are likely to regain their bullish momentum. However, PropiChain is expected to outperform every project because of the revolutionary impact it sets to have in real estate. PropiChain is a decentralized real estate project that aims to reshape how real estate investment is done and automate stressful processes for investors in the multi-trillion dollar sector. The approach of PCHAIN is unique and investors are actively joining its presale and this is evident from the success of the first round of its token presale. The Revolutionizing Offerings of PropiChain in the Real Estate Sector PropiChain aims to make buying and selling of properties easy by leveraging technological tools that are not currently in the real estate sector. Also, most operations in the real estate industry will now be efficient with the offerings that this NextGen marketplace promises. Some of them are: Fractional Ownership Model Assets ownership will become easier on PropiChain's decentralized platform because of its fractional ownership model. This allows joint contributions from other investors to trigger a property's cost. With this model, the long-standing financial barrier in the sector will be eliminated. This is because users can invest $2,000 in a property worth $400,000, leaving other investors to complete the financing. This model will disburse profits proportionately when the asset appreciates. Also, the illiquid nature of the industry will change with PropiChain’s fractional assets acquisition. The huge cost and mortgage are the main causes of delays. Also, investors can invest in multiple high-value properties with the aid of the fractional ownership model, which will place them in a more profitable position. Enhanced Operations with Automation In traditional real estate, stress and inefficiency often frustrate traders. PropiChain aims to solve these issues with automation assisted by AI and blockchain. Lease and Rent Renewals: In traditional real estate, there is a lot of stress involved in renewing lease agreements. Meetings, paperwork, and intermediaries keep stress and costs piling up. PropiChain aims to solve these problems using a smart contract on its blockchain. The smart contract can be programmed to automatically execute the renewal once the terms of the agreement between the landlord and tenants are met. Aside from the efficiency and ease, this renewal process is legally binding, and the terms of the transaction will be stored in the tamper-proof ledger. The same automation can be applied to rent renewal. Therefore, property owners and tenants can avoid conflicts due to rent payment delays when they use the PropiChain marketplace. Automated Valuation Models: The AVMs are another way PropiChain aims to simplify operations in the real estate industry. Brokers often overvalue properties due to unnecessary additions or inaccurate calculations. PCHAIN's AI will use both historical information and current trends and data to give accurate asset prices. Conclusion The PropiChain project is based on the idea of helping investors in a $300 trillion dollar sector to maximize their potential profit. This alone is a factor that has been drawing investors to the project, and the excellent report from BlockAudit also attracted cautious investors to the PropiChain because the safety of their assets is guaranteed. Amid the Ethereum DeFi altcoins decline, investors keep joining PCHAIN and more than $1.3 million was raised in the first round of PropiChain’s presale and the second round is currently ongoing at a discounted price of $0.011. Investors are actively joining because this is the lowest entry price early investors will get before the price soars. Top analysts forecasted that early investors in PropiChain can potentially gain 50000% ROI in the Q1 of 2025 and they will likely gain more in the long term. Therefore, an investment of $1000 can potentially yield more than $50000 by 2025. Ethereum DeFi altcoins will likely recover, but PropiChain is a project that can potentially yield massive returns.

While Dogecoin aims for a staggering $4 price point and Shiba Inu strives to maintain momentum, analysts are turning their focus to Lightchain AI, predicting it could hit $5 by 2025. With its innovative approach and rapid presale success, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as the altcoin to watch in the coming years. Dogecoin (DOGE) Original Meme Coin’s Bold Target Dog coin has made a true group of fans with its funny charm and strong group support. The goal of $4, while big, is pushed by fresh market excitement and possible mix into everyday payment systems. Dogecoin's ease to use and cultural sway keep it in the spotlight, but its small tech use may cause problems as rivals grow. DOGE’s guessy nature makes it depend a lot on market feelings and social media fads, turning it into a risky yet rewar͏ding choice for investors. If it can keep its happy push relies on the larger use of meme coins in common uses. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Keeping Pace in a Competitive Market Shiba Inu has evolved from its meme origins into a more structured ecosystem with projects like Shibarium, its Layer 2 blockchain. While this development has added utility, SHIB continues to face stiff competition from emerging projects with cutting-edge technologies. As Shiba Inu works to maintain its standing, its potential for growth will hinge on the success of its ecosystem and its ability to attract developers and users. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic about SHIB’s prospects but highlight that it may struggle to keep pace with more innovative tokens like Lightchain AI . Lightchain AI (LCAI) $5 Contender for 2025 Lightchain AI is quickly gaining recognition as a game-changing project in the cryptocurrency space. Currently priced at $0.0048 during its presale, the token has raised nearly $8 million, demonstrating strong investor interest and confidence in its long-term potential. Analysts predict that Lightchain AI could reach $5 by 2025, driven by its focus on real-world applications and technological advancements. One of Lightchain AI’s standout features is its industry-specific solutions. By integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain, the platform addresses critical challenges in sectors like healthcare, logistics, and finance. This focus on solving practical problems gives it a significant edge over meme-driven tokens like DOGE and SHIB. Additionally, Lightchain AI is built with scalability in mind, ensuring that its infrastructure can handle large-scale adoption. Its ability to seamlessly integrate with existing blockchain ecosystems broadens its appeal, making it a versatile solution for businesses and developers. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The Korean company has introduced grocery-buying capabilities to its AI-enabled refrigerators. The smart fridges were introduced as grocery assistants capable of identifying and restocking items. US-based users can restock groceries directly from the screens of their smart fridges. The company explained that the new feature combines Samsung’s “proprietary food recognition technology” with Instacart’s product-matching application programming interface (API). Samsung Joins Forces With Instacart To Enhance Kitchen Experiences Through Hallmark Innovation — Samsung Electronics (@Samsung) January 3, 2025 Notably, the feature is a product of a recently announced “multi-year” partnership between Samsung and the online grocery service. It will be available on the company’s 2025 bespoke fridges, equipped with “AI Vision Inside” technology and various displays. Samsung also announced that the feature will be accessible on its older AI Family Hub+ refrigerators this year. The company added the caveat that they need to be equipped with food recognition technology. Samsung Electronics head executive Jeong Seung Moon said, “The combination of Samsung’s key technology and Instacart’s outstanding online grocery shopping platform will be a great example of how partnership can create a new level of convenience.” Also, the company stated that the feature will be implemented on eligible existing models through an over-the-network update. The schedule is still to be finalized. The functionality of the technology According to the tech company, the technology is already assisting owners in monitoring the food in their refrigerators through its “AI Vision Inside” feature. The company claimed that it accomplishes this by employing deep-learning models and cameras. Additionally, the technology is capable of recognizing over thirty food items. The company explained, “names and expiration dates of non-recognized food items must be set manually.” Also, the system can automatically adjust shopping lists when items are purchased or used in a recipe, reducing waste and ensuring a well-stocked fridge. Still, according to the company’s press release, to capitalize on the capability’s introduction, owners of these refrigerators in the US must possess both an Instacart account, a Samsung account, and Wi-Fi. They also need to live in an area where Instacart is operational. Meanwhile, Daniel Danker, chief product officer at Instacart, expressed excitement about the partnership, saying, “We’ve all dreamt of a refrigerator that could replenish itself, and now, thanks to this partnership with Samsung, that’s no longer the stuff of science fiction.” However, earlier this year, the tech company’s previous standalone Instacart app mysteriously disappeared from older models. The new integration promises better functionality. Although the practicality of this transition is yet to be determined, it represents a significant advancement in the integration of kitchen technology into the connected home ecosystem. Samsung sharing the AI functions of its bespoke smart fridges on social media. Source: Samsung Bespoke Instagram The company also announced that the 32-inch AI Family Hub+ and the 9-inch AI Home will be unveiled shortly. It is anticipated that the Bespoke fridge, which features a 9-inch AI household screen, will be showcased at CES 2025 along with a variety of other high-tech Samsung household appliances. Possible vulnerabilities in the AI fridge As usual, users are concerned about AI learning their eating habits, which it will need to be proactive in developing shopping lists. The companies have not disclosed any intentions to collect or analyze this type of data. However, it is not dissimilar to how we all encounter targeted advertisements based on our internet queries. Except for this instance, the answer would be dependent upon the meal you consumed. Although Amazon and Google are getting more invested in the smart home market, Samsung’s relationship with Instacart could give it a head start.

Table of Contents XYZ: poised to outperform Shiba Inu’s 2021 surge in 2025 Why XYZ could be a 2025 standout Pepe Sui Conclusion In the fast-paced realm of cryptocurrency, a handful of emerging altcoins are capturing attention with their potential for remarkable growth. These digital assets aim to surpass the astonishing surge achieved by Shiba Inu in 2021. This article delves into three such cryptocurrencies that could offer significant returns by 2025, making them ones to watch in the coming years. XYZ: poised to outperform Shiba Inu’s 2021 surge in 2025 XYZ is charging onto the crypto field with one goal in mind: to leave weaker rivals like BOME and WIF in the dust.

Interested investors wouldnt want to miss the chance to score big — XYZ could make the upcoming bull cycle the most profitable one yet! Pepe PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on Ethereum. Inspired by the iconic Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s, this cryptocurrency embraces its meme roots with pride. It aims to join the ranks of popular meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. PEPE keeps things simple — no taxes, no hidden utilities — just pure, unadulterated meme potential. In late April to May 2023, PEPE soared to a market cap of $1.6 billion, turning early holders into millionaires overnight. This explosive growth sparked what some call a “memecoin season,” with new meme-based tokens popping up and experiencing wild price swings. PEPE’s potential lies in its strong community and ambitious roadmap. The plan includes getting PEPE trending on Twitter, securing listings on centralized exchanges, and ultimately achieving a “meme takeover.” While it doesn’t offer groundbreaking technology, its appeal mirrors the viral nature of internet culture. In the current market cycle, with many eyes on the upcoming Bitcoin halving and hopes for a bull run, PEPE stands out by capturing the spirit of the moment. Its rise reflects a growing trend where memes meet money, and community sentiment can propel a coin to staggering heights. Compared to other meme coins, PEPE’s transparency and straightforward approach make it a noteworthy player in this lively corner of the crypto world. Sui Sui is a new blockchain platform that’s turning heads in the crypto space. It’s built to be safe, strong, and able to handle a lot of activity. What makes Sui different is its unique way of handling data and its use of the secure Move programming language. This helps it solve problems that other blockchains struggle with. Plus, Sui puts a big focus on making things easy for users, getting rid of the usual barriers people face when using blockchain technology. What really sets Sui apart is its commitment to user experience. Features like zkLogin and sponsored transactions make apps on Sui more accessible and friendly. In a market where ease of use is becoming more important, Sui could have an advantage over other coins. Its technology and focus on the user might make it appealing in the current cycle, especially for those looking for blockchain solutions that are both powerful and easy to navigate. Conclusion PEPE and SUI are promising, but XYZ’s unique sports meme ecosystem and ambitious growth plans make it a standout altcoin to watch in the current market.

The price has recently managed to inch above this moving average, but it still faces resistance. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is up by more than three percent and is trading slightly above the $101k mark. Here’s a breakdown of the reasons why Bitcoin could face a downturn according to analyst Nicholas Merten: Lack of Major Announcements Bitcoin’s price has largely been driven by announcements, such as the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs or corporate buys by firms like MicroStrategy. However, there haven’t been significant updates or announcements recently, which could slow down its growth momentum. Without new catalysts, Bitcoin may struggle to maintain its upward trajectory. Slowing Demand from Key Players Major players like ETFs and MicroStrategy have been instrumental in pushing Bitcoin’s price higher. But there are signs that the demand from these big entities is starting to slow. If they stop buying or even start selling, it could trigger a sharp correction in Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin’s Current Price is Already Factored In Many of Bitcoin’s recent price gains have been priced in, meaning that its current value may be higher than the actual market demand. Unless new buying pressure comes in, a price correction may be inevitable. Concerns Over Altcoins and Competition Bitcoin is facing growing competition from altcoins and other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Solana. While these coins are still underperforming compared to Bitcoin, their rise might divert attention away from Bitcoin, leading to a decline in its market share and value. Risk of a Market Correction As we saw in the first quarter of 2024, the crypto market can correct rapidly, particularly for altcoins. If Bitcoin enters a downturn phase, it is likely to be among the worst performers in the market due to its high gains. Bitcoin and other altcoins could face a significant drop when the market starts to adjust. Bitcoin’s Risk Profile in a Correction Bitcoin is often seen as a “high-risk” investment, especially when compared to safer options like bonds or savings accounts. In a market correction, Bitcoin could become one of the worst-performing assets as investors flee to safer investments. Its previous gains could quickly unravel, leaving many holding the bag.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-06 15:53:52

This move comes as analysts predict a bullish year for Bitcoin, with projections suggesting it could surpass $200,000. Currently, Metaplanet holds 1,762 Bitcoin, valued at $173.4 million from 19 separate purchases, following a strategy similar to MicroStrategy’s. In a Jan. 5 X post, Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich stated the company plans to achieve this goal by “utilizing the most accretive capital market tools available to us.” Gerovich added that Metaplanet aims to promote Bitcoin adoption both in Japan and globally while enhancing its influence within the Bitcoin ecosystem. “We’re not just building a company but driving a movement,” Gerovich said. Metaplanet is the largest corporate Bitcoin holder in Asia and ranks 15th globally among publicly listed companies, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. This ambitious plan aligns with bullish predictions from asset managers VanEck and Bitwise, who foresee Bitcoin reaching $180,000 to $200,000 in 2025. They suggest this could climb even higher if the United States establishes a strategic Bitcoin reserve under an anticipated crypto-friendly Trump administration. Gerovich believes such a move would “trigger a global domino effect.” “Countries around the world will follow. Japan is one of those countries where they do look to the US as their big brother. If President Trump adopts Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, Japan and many other countries in Asia will do the same,” Gerovich said at Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin New Year’s Eve party in Florida. In 2024, Metaplanet increased its Bitcoin holdings significantly, including a December purchase of 619.7 BTC, its largest single acquisition. The company’s shares have soared 950% since it began accumulating Bitcoin in April 2024 at an average price of $77,196. Looking ahead, Metaplanet plans to leverage loans, equity, and convertible bonds to meet its 2025 Bitcoin target. The firm also projected an operating profit for 2024, marking its first since 2017.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-06 15:55:00

Lookonchain revealed that Ethereum received about $1.1 billion in inflows, while Solana received about $202 million, mostly from USDC and USDT. Ethereum network’s stablecoin netflows this week increased from last week’s outflows of over $63 million to the current $1.1 billion inflows. However, Solana’s inflows over the past seven days are still over $200 million lower than what it experienced the week before. Lookonchain data revealed that Solana recorded over $424 million in USDC and USDT inflows in the previous week. The on-chain data analytics platform also noted a general increase in stablecoin inflows on other chains, including TON, Avalanche, and Polygon. TON recorded about $22 million in inflows. Avalanche, Hyperliquid, Polygon, Base, Noble, BNB Chain, SUI, and Near Protocol recorded over $83 million, $54 million, $43 million, $30 million, $16 million, $9 million, $3.6 million, and $3.3 million in inflows, respectively. Arbitrum and Optimism experienced the most significant outflows over the past seven days. Arbitrum shed over $2 billion in stablecoins, while Optimism shed over $14 million. Aptos also had a significant outflow over the past seven days, recording over $3 million in stablecoin value. Stablecoins have seen growth since Trump’s presidential win Solana added about $1b in major stablecoins over the last month, mostly driven by USDC expansion pic.twitter.com/qPDzGZIQXX — Dan Smith (@smyyguy) December 31, 2024 Coingecko data shows that the total stablecoin value locked in blockchains by December 31 for USDC and USDT stood at $44 billion and $137 billion, respectively. More data from Tie Terminal also revealed an increase in stablecoin value on Ethereum Layer 2 chains in December, hitting over $13.5 billion. Solana and Ethereum further recorded over $1 billion each in stablecoin inflows in December. For Solana, the inflows in December amounted to over 12% in value growth on the chain. A U.S. bank Citibank report has attributed the recent growth to the incoming U.S. president Donald Trump’s win in the November elections. Citibank further revealed that USDT, USD Coin, and DAI had recorded over $25 billion in growth since Trump’s win. The analysis also suggested that the growth mirrored the crypto community’s hope that President-elect Trump will benefit the crypto market. Another Bloomberg report suggested that stablecoins will go mainstream this year. The report suggested that the 205 billion-dollar industry is seeing more adoption as it offers a safer investment option. KPMG Japan’s Director of Financial Services Kenji Hoki’s statement from September 2024 also suggested that stablecoins could go mainstream in the next 6 to 12 months. On January 5, the founding engineer of Aptos Labs shared a similar opinion on X, saying that stablecoins will experience a parabolic rise in 2025. The Aptos Labs engineer also revealed significant growth in daily stablecoin transaction volumes since the beginning of the year, hovering around 4x more since January 1. Changes in regulations will boost stablecoins adoption A Bloomberg report from December 28 revealed increased interest by global banks in stablecoins, which could also fuel the current growth. Banks like the French Société Générale and the London-based Revolut have been exploring stablecoins. Société Générale’s blockchain and crypto department, the Société Générale-Forge, introduced a Euro-backed stablecoin, the EUR CoinVertible ( EURCV ), in April last year. The European financial group ODDO BHF SCA is also exploring a Euro-backed stablecoin. The report revealed the recent interest by banks resulted from the regulatory clarity created by the European Union. Many EU countries are planning to implement the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulations (MiCA) to create a more uniform environment for crypto markets. MiCA, which went live on December 30, will be an opportunity for the supply of licensed stablecoins within Europe. The Bretton Woods Committee reported that the European stablecoin market would be secured around regulated tokens. The report further explained that exchanges would follow suit, providing restrictions for unregulated crypto services in the region.

The price of Polkadot is predicted to reach a maximum value of $60.30 in 2031. Polkadot (DOT) has shown impressive growth and resilience in a volatile cryptocurrency market, supported by its strong multichain protocol architecture and investor confidence. A major contributor to this success is the Sinai Upgrade on its Acala Network, enhancing functionality and security. With over 32 million transactions validated in October 2024 by the Polkadot Relay Chain, the network demonstrates significant activity and utility. A notable increase in unique wallets further signals growing user adoption and engagement, strengthening Polkadot’s position as a leading blockchain platform. Will DOT reach new heights soon? Let’s get into the Polkadot price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Polkadot Token DOT Price $7.16 Market Cap $11.07B Trading Volume $339.47M Circulating Supply 1.53B DOT All-time High $55.00 Nov 4, 2021 All-time Low $2.69 Aug 19, 2020 24-hour High $6.73 24-hour Low $7.34 Polkadot price prediction: Technical analysis Price Prediction $10.46 (43.77%) Volatility 16.07% 50-Day SMA $7.74 14-Day RSI 45.57 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 70 (Greed) Green Days 11/30 (37%) 200-Day SMA $5.71 ​​Polkadot price analysis: DOT teases rally amid bullish momentum Polkadot price analysis shows an uptrend, highlighting moderate investor activity. DOT saw a steady climb from $7.62 to $7.76 within the past day. DOT is trading above its short-term moving averages, signaling continued bullish momentum. Polkadot price analysis on January 6th, 2025, shows (DOT) trading at $7.76, reflecting a 1.27% gain in the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency’s trading volume stands at $269.62M, highlighting moderate investor activity. With a market cap of $11.92B, DOT maintains its position as the #17 cryptocurrency by market ranking. The current bullish sentiment in the market is providing strong tailwinds for DOT’s upward trajectory. Polkadot daily chart analysis: DOT shows a steady recovery Polkadot daily chart analysis shows (DOT) is trading above $7.70, continuing its recovery after forming strong support around the $7.50 level. The price movement indicates a bullish trend, with higher lows and highs observed in recent sessions. The next significant resistance lies at $7.80, which, if broken, could lead to a rally toward the $8.00 psychological barrier. The upward momentum reflects increased buying pressure as the broader cryptocurrency market maintains a positive sentiment. DOT shows a steady recovery The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 52.80, signaling neutral conditions but showing an upward trajectory above its signal line. This indicates increasing bullish momentum without entering overbought territory, leaving room for further price gains. Additionally, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) has shown a bullish crossover, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line. The growing green histogram bars reinforce the bullish outlook, suggesting further upward movement is likely. With support levels established at $7.60 and $7.50, DOT is positioned well to sustain its recovery. However, a break above the $7.80 resistance is crucial to confirm the continuation of this bullish trend. Traders should closely monitor trading volume and MACD signals to gauge the strength of the momentum. Failure to break resistance could lead to consolidation or a pullback toward support zones. For now, DOT shows a promising path to further gains. Polkadot 4-hour analysis: DOT eyes $8 as bullish momentum builds Polkadot price analysis shows consolidation near the upper Bollinger Band, which indicates bullish momentum is intact. The price has consistently traded above the middle band (20-period SMA), reflecting ongoing support from buyers. However, the proximity to the upper band suggests that the asset might be approaching overbought levels in the short term, increasing the probability of a minor pullback or consolidation. DOT eyes $8 as bullish momentum builds The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator shows continued bullish momentum, with the MACD line above the signal line and a steady stream of green histogram bars. This signals strong market sentiment, though the narrowing gap between the MACD and signal lines suggests the bullish momentum might be losing steam slightly, indicating the potential for sideways movement before another push upward. The immediate support is at $7.65 (middle Bollinger Band level), and a drop below this could lead to a test of the $7.35 level (lower Bollinger Band). On the upside, resistance lies at $7.95, a key level marked by the upper Bollinger Band. If DOT breaks through this resistance, it could rally toward the psychological barrier of $8.00. Traders should monitor the Bollinger Bands’ width, as narrowing bands may indicate reduced volatility and potential consolidation while widening bands could signal an impending breakout. What to expect from Polkadot price analysis Polkadot price analysis today shows DOT is trading above $7.70, after establishing a solid support at $7.50.The technical indicators suggest the possibility of a brief slowdown or consolidation before the next leg up. Additionally, rising trading volumes indicate strong market participation, which supports the likelihood of a sustained rally. If Polkadot sustains its momentum and breaks past the $7.80 resistance, it could test the $8.00 level, signaling the start of a broader rally. However, a failure to hold key support levels may result in a pullback, allowing investors to reassess the market sentiment.

Polkadot historic price sentiment After spending most of the second half of 2020 trading around $4-$5, the price broke above the previous all-time high of $7 on December 29 and quickly reached the Polkadot price projection of $10. Polkadot price history | Coinmarketcap Polkadot experienced rapid growth, with its price climbing from around $3 in January to an all-time high of approximately $57.50 in May 2021. After the peak, the price declined sharply, falling to around $10 by July before partially recovering to over $40 in November 2021. In 2022, Polkadot price steadily declined, starting the year around $30 and dropping below $10 by mid-year. By the end of 2022, the price stabilized near $5 as bearish market conditions dominated the cryptocurrency space. The price of DOT hovered between $5 and $7 for most of 2023, reflecting a period of consolidation and limited market excitement. In January 2024, Polkadot’s price remained relatively stable, trading around the $5–$6 range. By July 2024, Polkadot showed slight signs of recovery, with its price rising to around $7–$8. This modest uptick was likely driven by increasing market interest. In December 2024, Polkadot showed signs of recovery, with its price climbing to around $10.4. As of January 2025, the current Polkadot price is at $7.70.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|DOT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-06 16:03:08

Elon Loves MAGA (ELOMAGA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Loves MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Loves MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Loves MAGA launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Loves MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Loves MAGA by entering its contract address – 6mRLPcgWXUBYNfXouCxBoyjFzNjww9HNVFpBJkrqmFeE – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELOMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-06 16:04:00

Table of Contents Basics of crypto trading Popular crypto trading strategies Advanced crypto trading strategies Tools and platforms for crypto trading Risk management in crypto trading Common mistakes to avoid If you spent a considerable amount of time in the crypto markets, you know that not every trading strategy works in this volatile market. While some trading strategies are profitable in some market conditions, they become invalid when market fundamentals are affected. In this article, we will go through the different types of trading strategies for beginners and advanced traders, discuss the tools you can use to trade crypto, and also mention risk management strategies which are crucial in this volatile market of trading. Basics of crypto trading Buying and selling cryptocurrencies with the intention of turning a profit is known as cryptocurrency trading. It uses decentralized finance concepts and blockchain technology to operate in a worldwide market that is open around-the-clock. To survive in this unstable environment, traders employ a variety of tactics, instruments for market analysis, and risk management procedures. It’s crucial to comprehend fundamental ideas like market orders, limit orders, and stop-loss orders. To make wise choices, traders should also understand the foundations of both technical and fundamental analysis. Emotional trading can be reduced by beginning with a well-defined trading plan and adhering to it. You might also like: Ways to start learning crypto for free Types of crypto trading strategies Timeframes, risk tolerance, and market conditions all influence different cryptocurrency trading techniques. Among the most prevalent kinds are: Scalping: Making several transactions in a single day in order to profit from slight price fluctuations is known as scalping. Day trading: Avoiding overnight market exposure by buying and selling inside the same day is known as day trading. Swing trading: the practice of holding positions for a few days or weeks in order to take advantage of medium-term trends is called swing trading. To determine possible entry and exit positions, market participants employ fundamental research and chart patterns. In order to maximize profits, they search for strong trend indicators and attempt to enter the market at the optimal time. This cryptocurrency trading method involves patience, discipline, and a thorough comprehension of trend markers. Position trading: A long-term approach grounded in long-term patterns and fundamental analysis is known as positional trading. Position traders make choices based on the belief that assets will eventually turn a profit. Long-term market cycles linked to Bitcoin’s halving, macroeconomic studies, and underlying issues all influence potential growth. Because position trading advocates holding assets for an extended period of time, traders focus on global patterns rather than short-term market swings or cryptocurrency day trading. Every strategy has advantages and disadvantages, so traders should choose the one that best suits their objectives and risk tolerance. Popular crypto trading strategies Following the trend: The trend is your friend, as they say. You’ve seen the trend following in action if you’ve noticed the gains on any token that breaks out in any direction and starts following that ‘trend’ for a long time. This tactic entails spotting and capitalizing on long-term market patterns. Indicators such as trendlines and moving averages are used by traders to identify entry and exit locations. It performs well in both bullish and negative markets, although sideways moves could cause it to falter. Finding upward trends, entering a position, and then selling when the trend veers off course are the main components of this technique. For large-cap assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ), trend tracking may necessitate lengthier trades—possibly days. On the other hand, everyday price fluctuations for altcoins and meme currencies can provide a wave to surf. Choosing which cryptocurrency is best for day trading is a major decision because some will unavoidably offer more opportunities than others. Range trading: This strategy, which depends on support and resistance levels, is appropriate for markets that are going sideways. In order to profit from predicted price fluctuations, traders purchase at support and sell at resistance. Profiting from non-trending, aimless markets and flat periods is the goal of range cryptocurrency trading. When an asset is overbought, it is sold, and vice versa. Follow these steps to do range trading in a crypto market that is unable to break its high or lows: Determine the levels of resistance and support. Purchase an asset when its price is at the support level. When the price reaches but does not yet cross the resistance level, sell it. Volume data is used by traders as a gauge of market mood to trade ranges effectively. Increased trade volumes may occur prior to a change in price. It is possible to verify pullbacks from support/resistance levels using this regularity. Breakout trading: Breakout traders seek price movements that surpass known levels of support or resistance, frequently accompanied by a spike in volume. The goal of this approach is to seize important changes in the market. It is important for a breakout trader to mark important zones on their chart, especially the key support and resistance levels. Breakout of any support or resistance level will be the trigger for entry, if support breaks a trader can enter sell, and if resistance breaks they can enter buy. Arbitrage: Taking advantage of price disparities across exchanges by purchasing low on one and selling high on another is known as arbitrage. Despite being minimal risk, it necessitates quick execution and cross-platform access. The unregulated nature of the cryptocurrency market makes it easy to profit from arbitrage. Prices of several crypto exchanges can range significantly from one another. This strategy’s only drawback is that it can be challenging to find a profitable opportunity. It is challenging to assess hundreds of pairs across dozens of trading platforms without specialized software. You might also like: What is crypto arbitrage? A simple guide to the basics Advanced crypto trading strategies If you have enough experience working with basic cryptocurrency trading strategies it is time to learn some advanced trading strategies, some of which are as follows: Algorithmic trading: Using pre-programmed algorithms to carry out trades according to predetermined parameters, such as price, volume, or time, is known as algorithmic trading. This approach necessitates access to APIs and coding expertise. In any algorithm strategy, any amount of trading techniques can be added. This includes technical indicators, including moving averages, and any other indicator you can think of. While algorithmic trading is fairly automatic, traders should know that in volatile markets such as crypto, algorithmic trading can also prove to be a disaster, hence you should do research before buying or using any algorithm for trading. High-Frequency Trading: In order to profit from small price fluctuations, High-Frequency Trading (HFT), a subset of algorithmic trading, executes thousands of trades in milliseconds. To make money off of market swings that last only a few seconds or milliseconds, HFT traders employ sophisticated algorithms. When monitoring many trading platforms at once, HFT trading tactics work best for volatile asset classes. Only traders who are capable of creating and testing a trading algorithm should use this trading strategy. You will require strong programming and arithmetic abilities as well as the ability to evaluate trading bot efficacy. Sentiment Analysis: Sentiment analysis trading is the practice of forecasting price movements by utilizing news, social media, and market sentiment. This strategy can be improved with the use of tools like sentiment analysis powered by AI. News concerning a specific cryptocurrency project or the cryptocurrency market at large may have an impact on cryptocurrency quotes. Keeping yourself updated about the cryptocurrency asset you like to trade as any bullish or bearish news can significantly make or break your trade. Similar to central bank choices, political and economic factors can also affect cryptocurrency pairs. For instance, crypto rates will fall sharply if trading is prohibited. Trading in Options and Futures: Skilled traders employ derivatives to manage risks or make predictions about future price changes. A thorough understanding of market mechanics and leverage is necessary for this tactic. Tools and platforms for crypto trading Having the appropriate tools and platforms is essential for successful trading. Important tools consist of: Crypto exchanges: A variety of trading pairs and liquidity are provided by Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. Certain platforms, such as Bitfinex and KuCoin, target altcoins and specialized markets. Not every exchange has all the crypto tokens, hence it is important to have accounts on different platforms so you can enter a trading position as fast as possible. Charting Tools: Technical indicators and sophisticated charting are offered by platforms such as TradingView. Decision-making is improved by community-shared tactics and customizable notifications. A quick search on YouTube will give you many basic videos that will take you through the step-by-step method of using TradingView and its charting tools. Portfolio Trackers: Applications such as Blockfolio and CoinMarketCap facilitate portfolio management. They offer real-time market data and insights regarding asset allocation. Knowing how much you are up or down in your portfolio in real-time is crucial, especially when your assets are present on different cryptocurrency exchanges. Bots: Automated trading bots carry out trades according to predetermined methods. With little human involvement, these bots can manage intricate tactics like arbitrage and grid trading. Effective trading requires selecting platforms with strong security, affordable costs, and intuitive user interfaces. Traders can choose the finest option for their needs by looking through client reviews and checking demo accounts.

Important tactics consist of: Position Sizing: Never put more than a tiny portion of your money at risk in a single transaction. The 1-2% risk each trade is a popular guideline that reduces exposure. Stop-Loss Orders: Limit losses and exit losing trades by setting predetermined levels. Trailing stop-losses can lower downside risks and lock in winnings. Diversification: Distribute investments among several cryptocurrencies rather than concentrating all of your money in one. Diversification lessens the effect of individual asset volatility. Emotional Control: Adhere to your trading strategy and refrain from making snap judgments out of greed or fear. Trade journaling can be used to evaluate previous choices and enhance future tactics. Traders can safeguard their money during market downturns and stay ready for opportunities by making risk management a top priority. Common mistakes to avoid Overtrading: Excessive trade volume might result in higher fees and psychological weariness. Unnecessary transactions are decreased when a defined approach is followed. Ignoring research: Losses are frequently the consequence of mindlessly adhering to advice or hype without doing any research. Before making an investment, it is crucial to conduct a thorough analysis of projects and market conditions. Poor risk management: Ignoring risk management can lead to catastrophe if stop-loss orders are not established or if excessive capital is risked. Priority should always be given to risk management. FUD and FOMO: Both FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) and FOMO (fear of missing out) can cause bad choices. Impulsive trades can be avoided with patience and plan adherence. Excessive leverage: Although leverage can increase profits, it can also result in large losses. Beginners should concentrate on comprehending market dynamics and stay away from high-leverage trades. You might also like: What is a genesis block? Powering blockchain networks What is the best crypto trading strategy for beginners? Trend following or dollar-cost averaging (DCA) are some of the best trading strategies for beginners. These tactics lessen the impact of volatility by riding existing trends or making small investments over time. Before attempting sophisticated methods, beginners should concentrate on acquiring technical and fundamental analysis. What are the key tools for successful trading? Tools like trustworthy exchanges (like Binance and Kraken), charting programs (like TradingView), and portfolio trackers (like Blockfolio) are necessary for successful cryptocurrency trading. For algorithmic trading, experienced traders can make use of automated bots and API integrations. Is day trading crypto profitable? Despite the potential for profit, day trading carries a high risk because of market volatility. Discipline, market expertise, and prompt decision-making are necessary for success. Before risking real money, beginners should experiment using demo accounts. How can I minimize risks while trading cryptocurrency? Using stop-loss orders, which automatically sell your position at a predetermined price to avoid excessive losses, is one way to reduce risks. The impact of a single asset’s decline is lessened when investments are spread across several currencies or industries. It is wise to use a risk-reward ratio of at least 2:1 when evaluating trades, weighing the potential profit against the potential loss. Because excessive leverage multiplies both gains and losses, it is imperative to limit leverage. Overexposure can be avoided by establishing and maintaining reasonable goals. What are the most common mistakes in crypto trading? Overtrading, ignoring risk management, employing excessive leverage, and giving in to FOMO or FUD are examples of common errors. Avoiding these dangers requires careful preparation, investigation, and emotional restraint. Overtrading can cause emotional weariness and is frequently the result of the urge to recover losses. Poor results are sometimes the consequence of ignoring market research and making transactions based on rumors or hype. Setting stop-loss orders is essential since holding lost transactions out of emotional attachment exacerbates losses.",Learn|Crypto assets|Trading,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-06 16:10:04

38620154,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99857,1736184244,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Ripple’s Garlinghouse Reveals 75% Of Open Roles Now U.S.-based Due To Optimism For Trump’s Incoming Administration,https://zycrypto.com/ripples-garlinghouse-reveals-75-of-open-roles-now-u-s-based-due-to-optimism-for-trumps-incoming-administration/,"After a challenging legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, San Francisco-based Ripple has witnessed a shift in momentum under President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that the enterprise blockchain company has now started a hiring spree in the United States due to the crypto sector’s optimism about Trump’s inbound administration. This is a stunning reversal compared to the previous years, during which Ripple conducted most of the hiring overseas. Garlinghouse Touts “Trump Effect” Amid Surge In US Deals Brad Garlinghouse took to the X platform to share that Ripple is actively reorienting its business strategy to focus on the U.S. market. While the company focused much of its hiring over the last four years outside the U.S. due to the prolonged lawsuit with the SEC under the now-resigned Gary Gensler’s leadership , Garlinghouse said that 75% of Ripple’s open roles are now US-based. The Ripple boss attributed the shift to the “Trump effect” and the president-elect’s pro-crypto rhetoric. “Team Trump is already jumpstarting innovation and job growth in the US with Scott Bessent, David Sacks, Paul Atkin, and others at the helm — and they are not even in office yet! Say what you want, but the ‘Trump effect’ is already making crypto great again,” Garlinghouse wrote on Sunday. According to the Ripple boss, the company has also closed more deals and partnerships in the US since the Nov. 2024 election than in the previous six months. “For Ripple, this is even more personal after Gensler’s SEC effectively froze our business opportunities here at home for years,” opined Garlinghouse. “The optimism is obvious and very deserved.” Ripple’s Legal Brawl And Its Ramifications The SEC’s suit, unleashed in late December 2020, negatively affected Ripple’s business in the United States. Leading crypto exchanges delisted XRP and the firm lost important partnerships as many companies effectively distanced themselves from Ripple owing to the uncertainty arising from the case. Ripple was forced to shift over 80% of its operations abroad as a result. But with Trump set to return to the White House, Garlinghouse thinks the U.S. market offers new opportunities for Ripple , which could be key in the firm’s future growth. Since Trump won the Nov. 6 election against Democrat Kamala Harris, the crypto market has witnessed a strong upsurge that took the price of some crypto assets, such as Bitcoin, to new highs. For instance, during that period, Ripple-linked XRP surged by over 300% from 55 cents to as high as $2.70. Trump has promised to make the U.S. the “ crypto capital ” of the world, establish a strategic national BTC stockpile , and ensure all Bitcoin is mined in the United States . XRP was trading hands at just above $2.43, a +2.4% change on the day.",Cryptocurrency|News|Brad Garlinghouse|Donald Trump|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-06 17:24:04

BTC advanced towards $100,000 earlier during the trading session, then broke sharply above the threshold, rising 2.5% in an hour as traditional U.S. markets opened. It was changing hands at around $102,000 recently, its strongest level since December 19 and up 4.3% over the past 24 hours. The broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 was up 3.5% during the same period, with all the twenty crypto majors posting positive returns. Ethereum's ether ( ETH ) climbed 2.8% to $3,700, while Solana's SOL advanced 4.5% to above $220. Bitcoin and the broader crypto market ended 2024 with a correction, paring some of the gains of the massive rally since Donald Trump's election victory as investors took profits. Prices and trading volumes declined during the holiday lull, coupled with outflows from spot BTC and ETH exchange-traded funds. BTC reached a local bottom near $91,000 on December 30, a nearly 15% retreat from its record highs. Demand returns as leverage remains muted With the start of the first full business week of the year and traders returning to their desks after the holiday season, headlines of corporate BTC purchases continued. MicroStrategy announced on Monday purchase of another 1,020 BTC, while Texas-based energy management firm KULR Technology Group added $21 million worth of BTC to its treasury, doubling its holdings. Spot BTC ETFs saw $908 million in inflows on Friday as a sign of demand returning. Meanwhile, open interest on BTC futures is significantly lower than in mid-December on the institutional-focused marketplace CME and on an aggregate basis, indicating that the recent bounce in prices was primarily driven by spot buying rather than leverage, noted James Van Straten, senior analyst at CoinDesk. Funding rates were also at neutral levels across the board, CoinGlass data shows, indicating a lack of froth during the rally. Fed risk ""Just as we saw institutions window dressing with their balance sheets mindful of risk assets for year-end and de-risking ahead of holidays, it's expected we see price action and demand recouping especially as we head into what we expect will be a positive year for the asset class and upcoming U.S. administration,"" Paul Howard, senior director of crypto trading firm Wincent, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. ""My personal view is not to read too much into these levels [BTC over $100,000] as we can expect volatility to increase in the coming fortnight,"" Howard added. Crypto analytics firm 10x Research also forecasted a rebound in crypto prices in early January heading into President-elect Trump's inauguration in a Monday report, but warned of a month-end sell-off ahead of the Federal Reserve's January meeting. Hawkish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell at the December meeting marked the start of a pullback for risk assets, and 10x Research noted it would take time for the Fed to reverse its stance even if inflation cools further in the coming months. ""The primary risk remains the Federal Reserve's communication, especially if renewed concerns about inflation emerge,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research said. ""We anticipate lower inflation this year, though it may take some time for the Federal Reserve to recognize and respond to this shift formally."" ""While some enthusiasm is expected at the start of the new year, this is not the time for the same level of bullishness we experienced from late January to March 2024 or late September to mid-December,"" he added.",Markets|Market Wrap|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF|Ether|Solana,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-06 17:26:09

Trump’s Pet Doge (TRUMDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Pet Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Pet Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Pet Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Pet Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Pet Doge by entering its contract address – 6e6jZxV1zG7GGLF5MoJZf8nY4u17x8dceDatSWiTE573 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-06 17:28:00

With Bitcoin (BTC) price consolidating after reaching a major milestone at $100k , large-cap altcoins, led by Tron (TRX), are preparing to enter the price discovery phase of the macro bull run. Already, the crypto cash rotation has accelerated in the past few weeks as institutional investors distribute Bitcoin’s profits. Moreover, the Bitcoin dominance has formed a macro reversal pattern, which is a sign of a major altseason in the near term. Top Reasons To Bet on Tron in 2025 The Tron network is a top-tier web3 ecosystem , with more than $7.6 billion in total value locked (TVL) and over $58 billion in stablecoins market cap. The launch of a memecoin launchpad dubbed Sunpump has helped the Tron network increase its revenue and 24-hour active address to about $1.4M and 2.29 million respectively at the time of this writing. Most importantly, the Tron network is well positioned to re-enter the US market after Justin Sun joined Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI) as an advisor.

""I intend to resign as party leader, as prime minister, after the party selects its new leader,"" Trudeau said in a press conference, citing ""internal battles"" disrupting his governance. ""I cannot be the one to carry the liberal standard into the next election."" Trudeau said he'll leave his 11-year position as leader of the Liberal Party and the role of prime minister that he's occupied since 2015. Critics of Trudeau in the crypto community denounced government sanctions on digital wallets during the 2022 Freedom Convoy protests. Read More: Canada Sanctions 34 Crypto Wallets Tied to Trucker 'Freedom Convoy' The government's freezing crypto accounts reverberated beyond Canada, and became a rallying cry among U.S. Republican lawmakers during the 2024 elections. Those politicians used that situation as a primary example of the dangers of allowing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) that could establish government intrusions into crypto transactions. The general election in Canada is fast approaching by October, and the Conservative Party's Pierre Poilievre is sitting on a strong advantage , according to polling. He's also won cross-border appeal with many of U.S. President-election Donald Trump's supporters. Poilievre had been a vocal supporter of digital assets in the past but has more recently been relatively quiet on the topic. In Canada, however, securities are a provincial affair, and as there is no national securities regulator like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the influence the next leader of the Liberal Party of Canada – and thus prime minister – or Poilievre could have is limited. Instead, the Canadian Securities Administration (CSA), an umbrella regulatory body made up of provincial regulators, will have more say over what's next in crypto.

Carney also said that highly regulated stablecoins are the only way they could be successful, and, if strictly regulated, ""what would then differentiate them from CBDCs?”",Policy|Canada|Justin Trudeau|Pierre Poilievre|Elections,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-06 17:31:12

The company has restructured its once-defunct subsidiary into a fresh entity named Bithumb Partners. This significant transformation signals a new direction for the company. Bithumb Rebrands with Purpose Bithumb’s move to rebrand its subsidiary from Bithumb Meta to Bithumb Partners reflects a strategic shift. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Bithumb injected an additional 1 billion KRW, equivalent to $680,099, into the subsidiary. This pushed its total capital to around $2 million. The changes come after disappointing results from Bithumb Meta’s ventures into Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and the metaverse. Given the lack of returns, investors such as LG CNS, CJ OliveNetworks, and SK Square have now stepped away from the subsidiary. Bithumb Partners is now wholly owned by the parent firm, with a new focus on managing short-term investments. Im Tae-seong, an external recruit, will lead this fresh entity. At the same time, Bithumb’s management will handle key operations. The dissolution of Bithumb Meta’s original leadership marks the beginning of a new chapter. The Streamlined Strategy for Success Bithumb’s shift towards investment management through Bithumb Partners is more than a rebrand. The company aims to streamline operations by managing assets like stocks and bonds. This approach avoids the complexity and time-consuming process of creating a new entity. This approach is part of a broader plan to optimize operations and position the exchange for success. Previously, Bithumb’s vision for Bithumb Meta included investments in real estate and long-term assets. However, market realities led to a streamlined approach, focusing now on short-term investments with its internal funds. This includes convertible bond investments in KOSDAQ-listed companies such as Iwin, Barunson, and T&R Biofab. IPO Ambitions on the Horizon The timing of this reorganization aligns with Bithumb’s plans to pursue an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 2025, potentially in the United States. With an investment-focused subsidiary in place, Bithumb is preparing its corporate structure for this major leap. This ensures that operations are optimized and ready for the global financial spotlight. With Bithumb Partners now firmly in place, the company is better positioned to manage investments and further its ambitions of global recognition. Industry experts are closely monitoring the company’s next moves as it positions itself for growth in a competitive market. This restructuring follows a trend seen in companies like Medline and Genesys. These companies have also simplified their operations in preparation for going public. This comes as the IPO market is experiencing a resurgence, with 121 companies going public in 2024 and raising $27.3 billion. This trend will continue into 2025 as private equity firms take advantage of favorable market conditions. Notable IPO filings are also anticipated in the coming year.

Notably, ESTEE is a dog-themed meme coin particularly inspired by Shiba Inu (SHIB). After Vitalik Buterin sold ESTEE coins, the price briefly dropped but quickly rebounded to $0.00001903, gaining over 200% and nearly 8 times from its lowest point of $0.0000023. Also, its trading volume surged by a staggering 9141%, reaching $3.16 million. Besides, ESTEE, Buterin also offloaded other memecoins. In the last 24 hours, he sold 340 LDOG tokens for 5.2 ETH and over 10 trillion DINU coins for 4181 USDC, sparking discussions in the crypto community over his portfolio changes and their potential impact on the market. Market Impact As per a recent X post by Ember monitoring, Buterin has sold 28 different meme coins over the past five hours. This sell-off has reportedly earned him $984,000 worth of USDC in proceeds, which he has, in turn, donated to the address of Kanro, his charity organization. The move aligns with his vision of using meme coins for social impact. Buterin’s recent selloff has impacted tokens with small market caps, causing significant price drops. $DINU fell by 68%, and $JSHIBA lost 38% of its value. Buterin: Meme Coins for Charity and Social Good Vitalik has been receiving coins from various crypto projects as gifts and periodically selling them, donating the proceeds. Recently, he also became the foster parent of a baby pygmy hippopotamus named Moo Deng, which caused the meme coin MOODENG to rise by 70%. Buterin views meme coins as tools for supporting meaningful causes. He believes they can positively impact society by funding public projects and helping people in lower-income areas. His actions continue to reflect this belief, as he turns unsolicited meme coin deposits into opportunities for charitable giving.",News|Crypto news|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|USDC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-06 17:33:08

In a statement included in the Federal Reserve’s announcement, Barr suggested that he decided to voluntarily resign in order to avoid a potential dispute with the incoming Trump administration. “The position of vice chair for supervision was created after the Global Financial Crisis to create greater responsibility, transparency, and accountability for the Federal Reserve's supervision and regulation of the financial system,” Barr said. “The risk of a dispute over the position could be a distraction from our mission. In the current environment, I've determined that I would be more effective in serving the American people from my role as governor."" According to Jaret Seiberg, a financial policy analyst at TD Cowen, Barr’s decision to step down is a potentially worrisome sign of the continuing politicization of banking regulation. In an analyst note to clients on Monday, Seiberg wrote, “Agency chiefs used to stay when the White House changed parties. That is no longer the case, which means banks should expect bigger policy swings each time the White House changes control."" The Federal Reserve’s vice chair of supervision functions as the top banking watchdog and is considered one of the most important regulatory roles in the U.S. In his position, Barr had a heavy influence on how the traditional financial system interacted with cryptocurrencies. Though Barr had some crypto bona fides before his appointment, including serving as an advisor to Ripple, the issuer of the XRP token, his tenure has been a mixed bag for the crypto industry. Barr has pushed for the Federal Reserve to have the power to regulate and enforce the law against stablecoin issuers in the U.S., which many Republican lawmakers have taken issue with. In a Monday statement, Sen. Tim Scott (R-South Carolina) blasted Barr’s “supervisory failures” during the bank failures of 2023 and the “disastrous Basel III Endgame proposal” issued the same year. “Michael Barr has failed to meet the responsibilities of his position,” Scott said. “I stand ready to work with President Trump to ensure we have responsible financial regulators at the helm.” According to Seiberg however, Barr’s resignation is unlikely to change much in the short term, as Democrats will continue to have a majority at the Federal Reserve until early 2026. If Trump wants to replace Barr quickly, Seiberg said, he will likely be forced to nominate a successor from within the Board of Governors. “The logical candidate is Michelle Bowman,” Seiberg wrote. “She is a former Kansas banking commissioner who also worked at a community bank. And she has been at the Fed since late 2018. She also often speaks on bank policy and has been critical of Barr's approach to Basel 3 Endgame.” Speaking at the DC Blockchain Summit last year , Bowman stressed the importance of “regulatory openness” to innovation and new technologies.",Policy|federal reserve|Michael Barr|Trump Administration,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-06 17:35:03

Stellar ( XLM ) rose to $0.4630, gaining nearly 50% from its December low, as previously predicted . The rally happened as most cryptocurrencies bounced back. Bitcoin ( BTC ) recovered from last month’s low of $92,000 to $101,500, while tokens like Injective , SPX6900, Worldcoin, and Render surged by over 10%. Stellar’s gains were also influenced by Ripple’s ( XRP ) bullish momentumRipple recently formed a bullish pennant pattern, signaling potential further gains. Some analysts expect that Ripple will surge to $100, a 4,066% jump from the current level. XLM often mirrors XRP’s performance due to their shared history and similar roles in the crypto industry. Jed McCaleb, Stellar’s founder, was a key founding member of Ripple.

The first major issue is its stagnant ecosystem, which does not justify its $13 billion market cap. The network only hosts 11 dApps in its DeFi ecosystem, with a total value locked of $53 million . In contrast, Base — a layer-2 blockchain launched in 2023 — has accumulated over $3.87 billion in assets and $3.7 billion in stablecoin volume. Stellar, despite positioning stablecoins as a core feature, has only $161 million in stablecoins on its network. Stellar price analysis XLM price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Stellar’s price peaked at $0.6376 in December before bottoming at $0.300, aligning with the lower boundary of the Murrey Math Lines trading range. XLM has since formed a falling wedge pattern, a bullish chart formation. The token has broken above the wedge’s upper boundary and a key support and resistance pivot point. Stellar remains above the 50-day moving average and the Ichimoku cloud indicator, suggesting continued bullish momentum. The next critical resistance target for bulls is $0.6375, representing a potential 40% upside from the current price. However, a drop below the $0.30 support level would invalidate the bullish outlook.

TRON (TRX): Decentralizing Digital Content Creation TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain platform launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation. Originally based on Ethereum’s network, TRX moved to its own blockchain in 2018. TRON aims to empower digital content creators by allowing them to own their work fully and receive fair compensation without intermediaries. Users can create decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts on the platform. The ability to transact without fees and the focus on decentralizing the internet add to its appeal. In the current market cycle, TRON’s emphasis on content creators and decentralized applications positions it as a noteworthy platform in the blockchain space. Cardano’s ADA: A Scalable and Sustainable Cryptocurrency Cardano is a blockchain platform focused on flexibility, sustainability, and scalability. It uses an energy-efficient proof-of-stake system called Ouroboros. Its cryptocurrency, ADA, lets users store value, make payments, and engage with the network. The platform has two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This design aims to handle up to a million transactions per second. These features give ADA significant potential in the cryptocurrency market. In the current market cycle, Cardano’s sustainable approach and advanced technology may make it an attractive option for those interested in blockchain innovations. Conclusion With the bull run here, TRX and ADA may offer less short-term potential than Catzilla. Catzilla aims to bring financial freedom, offering 700% ROI during its presale, starting at $0.0002 and rising to $0.0016 over 14 stages. The token provides governance, rewards loyalty, and allows passive growth through staking. Catzilla unites crypto enthusiasts to join the fight against crypto villains.

Will the Rise Continue? Analysis Company Announced!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-btc-exceeded-100000-again-will-the-rise-continue-analysis-company-announced/,"The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) started the new week positively, approaching $ 100,000. While there is curiosity about what will happen to the Bitcoin price next, cryptocurrency trading firm QCP Capital said that Bitcoin is facing significant sell orders as it approaches $ 100,000. Sharing their daily analysis on Telegram, QCP Capital analysts said that Bitcoin is facing significant sell orders and therefore it is difficult for it to go higher. Analysts noted that similar resistance and selling pressure was seen last month, when Bitcoin briefly exceeded $ 100,000 on December 5 and funding rates rose above 60%, and said that unlike December, funding rates are currently at more normal levels. Analysts stated that they do not expect a bullish breakout in Bitcoin in the near term at this point, and also added that it is unlikely that Trump-related catalysts will come before the inauguration ceremony on January 20. With no major crypto-specific developments expected, analysts said the market focus has shifted to broader economic indicators, particularly the US labor market data scheduled for release on Jan. 10. “Bitcoin had a positive start to the week as it approached the 100k level but is once again facing heavy selling pressure. This is the level where increasing selling pressure was seen in December. So will BTC break 100K again? When this key level was first broken on December 5, funding surged above 60%. However, funding levels remain healthy this time around and we do not expect a higher squeeze in the near term. Unlike before, any Trump-related catalysts are also unlikely to come after the January 20 inauguration. With no crypto-specific catalyst on the horizon, the focus will be on the first US employment report of the year this Friday.” *This is not investment advice.

According to Horsley, consolidation by major companies will only make the decentralization that crypto offers more attractive. In a recent post on X, the CEO of Bitwise noted that when the Trump administration unfreezes mergers and acquisitions, big tech corporations will likely buy up smaller companies, leading to fewer mid-sized companies. He said: “Trump administration may unfreeze M&A. Large corporates — mag 7, etc — may finally be able to wield their market cap. Amazon could buy Instacart. Google could buy Uber. etc etc The big may get bigger, and the middle may shrink.” Bitwise CEO sees a bullish future for crypto In the CEO’s opinion, the consolidation by major traditional corporations will only make the crypto industry more attractive for investors because it offers a decentralized alternative. Thus, the sector will likely see more growth in 2025. This statement is just one of several bullish statements that Bitwise’s CEO, Horsley has made about the potential of the crypto sector in 2025. The CEO also noted that demand for Bitcoin will increase significantly this year, and that is when the market will see a clearer impact of scarcity on BTC price. Other experts also agree with the view on the impact that deregulation could have on major corporations in coming years. Bloomberg senior analyst Eric Balchunas noted that it would be risky to underweight the companies that constitute the Magnificient 7 as they made up acquiring more smaller companies going forward. Crypto markets rebound Horsley’s comments come at a time when the crypto market is rebounding in price. The sector has been flying high since Donald Trump was re-elected, largely based on the expectations that his administration will implement pro-crypto policies. So far, Trump has made several moves, including nominations that suggest he intends to keep his crypto promises. With just two weeks to his inauguration, Bitcoin , which rose to an all-time high in 2024 after Trump’s re-election, has started staging what seems like a rebound. After falling as low as $91,000 on December 31, the asset surged to $100,000 today before seeing a pullback. Unsurprisingly, BTC’s performance has gained more than 5% this year and has also been fuelling a similar pattern among the other major cap cryptocurrencies. Ether is up 8% this year, while Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), and SUI have all recorded double-digit gains.

Barr, the Federal Reserve’s Vice Chairman for Supervision, announced that he is resigning from his position, effective February 28, 2025, or earlier if his successor is confirmed. In an official statement made by the Central Bank today, it was stated that Barr will continue to serve as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Barr, who assumed the role on July 19, 2022, has played a key role in overseeing and regulating financial institutions. Barr’s tenure has been notable for his focus on stabilizing the U.S. financial system, particularly during the banking stresses experienced in early 2023. In his resignation letter to President Joe Biden, Barr described his time as vice president as “an honor and a privilege” but expressed concerns about potential conflicts over the role.

Widely seen as an ally of Senator Elizabeth Warren, Barr has become a leading figure on financial regulation. His cautious stance on cryptocurrencies has drawn criticism from the industry, with many citing his influence as a key reason why banks are hesitant to engage with or provide custody of digital assets. His departure from the vice chair position could signal a change in the Fed’s approach to crypto regulation, depending on the views of his successor. *This is not investment advice.

With the rise of blockchain-based games, also called Web3 games, there is a world of video games spanning every genre you can think of that pump out cryptocurrency rewards to successful players. While blockchain games were once sneered at by most “traditional gamers”, the industry is one that’s developing very fast, and the latest generation of these games set much higher standards. Gone are the days when players simply endure a tiresome grind fueled only by financial incentives – these days, blockchain games are just as enjoyable to play as anything you might find in your local arcade or on Google Play. So let’s take a look at some of the hottest, most enjoyable blockchain games that can fatten your wallet as we head into 2025 #1 Formula Funtico The flagship game of Funtico , an incentivized gaming platform built around the TICO cryptocurrency, Formula Funtico is a high-octane, adrenaline-fueled racing game that’s guaranteed to push you to your limits with its requirements for driving skill, endurance, intense focus and rapid reactions. Only the fastest can win prizes, and the highly realistic gameplay combined with its strong monetary incentives makes Formula Funtico one of the top play-to-earn racing games to play in 2025. The game can be found within Funtico’s growing library of blockchain games, which all integrate the TICO cryptocurrency. As you’ll soon see, there’s a big emphasis on competitive tournaments with all of Funtico’s games. During its first tournament, Formula Funtico players competed for a staggering 100,000 USDC in prize money, as well as other incentives like the chance to design an NFT Go-Kart that will become a part of the game. Funtico plans to hold regular tournaments for Formula Funtico, as well as its other games, like Lucky Funatic and Heroes of the Citadel, seeing them as integral to building a vibrant community of like-minded players. The best players will not only win substantial amounts of money, but also significant prestige within the Funtico community, which could lead to even more financial opportunities down the road. #2 Sponge V2 Another hot racing game, Sponge V2 combines the thrill of high-performance vehicles with the wacky world of internet meme culture, making it one of the quirkiest play-to-earn games to play in 2025. Each of the racers within SpongeV2 is an NFT that’s based on a meme-inspired character, and during the races, those players will compete for prizes paid out in SPONGEV2 tokens. There are several game modes in SpongeV2, with both free races available (but no rewards, it’s just for fun) and paid single races and tournaments (where prizes are on offer). In the latter, players must pay an entry fee in SPONGEV2 tokens, which will go towards the prize pool that awaits the top three finishers in the race. The game also integrates an overall leaderboard, allowing players to fight their way up the ranks and earn even more prizes, adding to the incentives. The high-speed thrills and the skill involved combine with the rewards on offer to provide real value for the victors, and the game fuels this with its community-led development, which encourages players to provide feedback and suggest improvements to the game. SPONGEV2 token holders can vote on all decisions, ensuring democratic process within its 30,000+ community. #3 Aviator One of the most popular games on the Lucky Block crypto casino platform, Aviator gives players the chance to multiply their LBLOCK crypto tokens by betting on the altitude attained by the computer-controlled “aviator” during each flight. As the plane takes off, the multiplier starts rising as it slowly gains altitude, but it will suddenly stop once the plane reaches a random cruising height. It’s your job to guess when that will happen and exit the game before the multiplier stops, in order to earn those rewards – but if you don’t, you’ll forfeit all of the LBLOCK tokens you’ve staked on the outcome. A new round of Aviator begins every couple of minutes, and the flights take off 24/7, so the opportunities to earn more LBLOCK tokens are basically endless. But be sure to stake your tokens prior to take off. To ensure fairness, Aviator uses a provably fair random number generator to calculate the altitude the aviator will reach during each flight, which anyone can check to ensure they’re not being scammed.

The legal expert also explained why he believes that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will withdraw its appeal against the crypto firm. John Deaton Predicts When Ripple Could Go Public In an X post, John Deaton mentioned that he believes a Ripple initial public offering (IPO) could happen either in the last quarter of 2025 or the first quarter of 2026. The legal expert alluded to an interview by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, which suggested that the crypto firm could indeed go public. In the interview, Garlinghouse explained that they didn’t prioritize going public before now because it didn’t make sense under the previous SEC administration. However, the Ripple CEO opened the possibility of them going public later in the future. This also looks to be a real possibility, considering Brad Garlinghouse’s comments highlighting how his firm has become more operational in the US since Donald Trump’s victory. Meanwhile, Deaton remarked that the timing of Ripple’s potential IPO will depend on how aggressive Paul Atkins is as the US SEC Chairman. The legal expert also predicted that the SEC could withdraw its appeal against Ripple, and the crypto firm would pay the earlier monetary judgment that Judge Analisa Torres awarded against it, ultimately concluding the case. John Deaton added that if Atkins is confirmed quickly, the case could end in the first quarter of this year. However, he believes the 2nd quarter is more likely because the US Congress “moves slowly” with the confirmation process. Why The SEC Will Withdraw The Appeal John Deaton further explained why the US SEC will likely withdraw its appeal against Ripple. According to him, it makes no sense for the SEC to appeal Judge Torres’ ruling. He remarked that appealing can only bring bad news for the SEC as an institution. The pro-XRP lawyer added that the Commission appealed only because the current Chair, Gary Gensler, was hurt by the defeat in court. John Deaton also listed several reasons why the appeal doesn’t make sense. First, he stated that Judge Torres’s ruling is a federal district court ruling and is not binding precedent. He added that the Ripple pulling has very low “persuasive precedent implications.” Furthermore, Deaton mentioned that Judge Torres’s ruling was very fact-specific, so it applies only to the facts of the Ripple case. This means that the decision has very limited persuasive power. The pro-XRP lawyer also doesn’t believe applying all the Howey factors favors the SEC. He noted that Judge Torres didn’t apply all of them but added that the Commission would still likely lose if she were to do so. Deaton also mentioned that the SEC could lose “big” if the case gets to the Supreme Court. Having outlined these points, John Deaton asserted that appealing the Ripple ruling is a “fool’s errand,” and he believes that Paul Atkins will see it that way. The lawyer’s comments come just as Ex-SEC lawyer Marc Fagel affirmed that there will be a settlement in the Ripple SEC case .

Here are my six top-of-mind themes for the coming year. 1. Crypto becomes a staple in the ideal investment portfolio Crypto’s historic asymmetric return profile has made it increasingly difficult for investors to justify not having it in their portfolios. In 2025, strategies like dollar-cost averaging (DCA) that enable investors to start small and steadily increase their holdings will continue to gain ground. I expect approaches that promote the gradual familiarization of the asset class to accelerate in the new year. 2. Crypto platforms turn their focus to offering clients medium- and long-term wealth building strategies, with trust as the biggest differentiator 2025 is going to see exchanges and crypto platforms shift product strategy toward offering clients medium- and longer-term wealth-building strategies. The foundation of these services will be earning yield on stablecoin holdings, with more sophisticated products and services layered on top. Given the lessons learned from last cycle with the collapses of FTX, Celsius and Voyager, clients will emphasize platform trust, security and longevity as they choose how to access these opportunities. 3. Stablecoin market sees first real challenges to incumbents, and users are the primary beneficiaries It’s no secret that stablecoin activity is dominated by Tether and USDC . In 2025, they will face real competition for the first time, as a new generation of stablecoins launch with regulatory and regional advantages over the Big Two. The increased competition will be a boon to users, who will have more tools to manage digital fiat currencies, while the adoption of alternatives can help manage the counterparty risk of stablecoin issuers. 4. Bitcoin gets more mainstream interest when inflation rebounds Some analysts predict inflation could stay above the Fed’s 2% target . After the past few years, everyone in the West now has first-hand experience of what a not-so steady erosion in fiat currency value looks like, for the first time since the 1970s. Bitcoin’s rigidly fixed supply – which not even gold can offer – could lead to further mainstream appreciation of its deflationary value proposition. This could spur further adoption as investors seek out store of value assets that protect wealth against a continued devaluation in fiat currencies. 5. Crypto markets become less volatile Over the past decade, crypto volatility has generally trended downward. This is because more adoption has led to more liquidity, which makes the market less susceptible to violent price swings in either direction. We anticipate that crypto volatility could continue to decrease now that ETFs have made crypto exposure accessible to a broader swath of investors than ever before. This could make crypto a more attractive proposition for investors further along the risk appetite curve (and serve as a tailwind for strategies like DCA). 6. New generation of banking services built on crypto reach the mainstream We have already started to see new investment products – like money market funds – launch on different blockchains. Established financial institutions understand and are leveraging the efficiencies gained by using this technology as well as its ability to open products up to whole new markets. In 2025, I fully expect we’ll see more familiar financial products built on blockchain to come to market — including payments, high-yield saving accounts, credit cards, borrowing and more. 2025: Crypto graduates to the main stage In 2025, the maturation of the crypto market will usher in a new era of opportunity and stability for investors and institutions alike. Whether it’s the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin as a store of value, the emergence of competitive stablecoins, or platforms prioritizing long-term wealth-building strategies, crypto’s influence will extend further into the financial world. With trust and accessibility at the forefront, this transformative year is set to solidify crypto’s place as an essential pillar in the modern financial ecosystem.

Founder Sreeram Kannan thinks so,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/eigenlayer-ai-agents-founder-sreeram-kannan/,"EigenLayer may bring its data availability service to AI agents, giving them on-chain abilities. The founder of EigenLayer believes AI agents can become part of the Autonomous Verifiable Services (AVS) ecosystem. EigenLayer can potentially join the AI narrative trend as a pivot strategy after attention shifted away from Data Availability technologies. The founder of EigenLayer, Sreeram Kannan, explained how AI agents can start building real on-chain activities, by becoming a part of the Autonomous Verifiable Services (AVS) network. Kannan believes AI agents are the ultimate AVS consumers and should join up as verification entities themselves. He explained that agents are not yet allowed to run operations in a permissionless, verifiable system. According to him, agents can become truly sovereign without suffering from potential flawed oracle attacks with EigenLayer. Agents are the ultimate AVS consumers ———————- Agents should run as Autonomous Verifiable Services (AVS). ———————- Why? To get unstoppability, you need the agent to be able to run computation in a permissionless manner. Since the “agent” is delegating… https://t.co/3ce3OmFqmc — Sreeram Kannan (@sreeramkannan) January 5, 2025 Kannan has previously predicted the role of EigenLayer for AI agents, as they are too computationally heavy to run fully on a blockchain. However, their actions can be verified in another layer, creating a toolset to perform truly autonomous actions. EigenLayer may also be moving to reposition itself with a new narrative after the Data Availability layer has faded in terms of traction. Since AI agent platforms are some of the most widely traded and trending tokens, some of the EigenLayer developers started testing a new marketplace . If the idea pans out, EigenLayer may compete with Virtuals Protocol, Eliza, and other platforms for hosting a new wave of individual agents. Following the news that AI agents could be coming to EigenLayer, EIGEN tokens traded near a one-week high of $4.12. Currently, AI agents are mostly used for social media content, but they only have hypothetical tools to make on-chain changes. Avoiding errors and unwanted effects may be achieved through AVS calls, which have built-in protection against flawed or malicious actions. AI agents still cannot perform independent actions The big problem with the wave of new AI agents is that they are not truly agentic on-chain, and rely on several allowed actions, mostly based on language models. While successful as meme tokens, AI agents are still trying to build a toolset for safe, verifiable actions. AVS go beyond nodes or ETH stakers and can bring a variety of on-chain actions. Those actions include the creation of sidechains, new virtual machines, oracles, bridges, privacy protocols, and cross-chain transfers. An AI agent can be linked to a service, which would be secured through EigenLayer’s already staked ETH. The ETH stake is valuable enough to ensure all actors coordinate since malicious actions would lead to stake slashing. At this point, it is unknown if any AI agent can perform on-chain actions or offer a service. However, with EigenLayer, the barrier to entry may be lower as AVSs were specifically created to allow easier access for developers. The actual actions of agents are still being tested, as one user added browser-based activities and even interactions with EigenLayer. There are also attempts to engineer new AI agents with sufficiently verified data and computation, to create an autonomous actor that can manage portfolios. Once again, EigenLayer plays a critical role in ensuring that every step of AI decision-making is solid, correct, and unattackable. AI agents rally to higher valuation After turning into one of the most successful narratives for 2024, AI agents continued their climb. All AI tokens expanded their valuation to above $16.9B, as traders attempted to discover the next best agent. The competition was also for AI agent platforms, each taking a different approach to building new models. Trending tokens included Freysa (FREYSA), an interactive AI personality with puzzles, and Swarms (SWARMS), a new mechanism to create AI agents. There is no set standard on what the agents can do, and the sector is still in its experimental stage. EigenLayer has no official partnerships and has not endorsed any specific agents. EigenLayer has not officially announced the launch of an AI agent framework, but it has hinted at building its own AI agent universe . Launching an AVS agent would raise demand for staked ETH. AVS entities are secured by more than $16B in staked ETH, which means even tokenless agents can be more secure.

38621585,https://blockworks.co/news/what-is-eth-worth-investors,1736186400,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,What is ETH worth?,https://blockworks.co/news/what-is-eth-worth-investors,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . In 2017, investor John Pfeffer published “An (Institutional) Investor’s Take on Cryptoassets,” a seminal paper on long-term investments of crypto tokens. In retrospect, Pfeffer’s original thesis was way ahead of its time. It laid the formative groundwork for investor thinking around magic internet money, and made many prescient predictions that still hold up today. Pfeffer argued that the equilibrium long-term outcome would be one dominant crypto asset as a monetary store of value, with bitcoin as the likely candidate. He projected BTC’s market cap within a range of $4.7 to $14.6 trillion ($260k-$800k per BTC). There are many reasons Pfeffer believes bitcoin would be cemented as the dominant SOV, but key to the thesis is that BTC carries the least technological risk. For ETH to beat BTC at the SOV game requires massive intellectual coordination across a multiyear roadmap with lots of technical upgrades subject to delays and/or risk of failures. As Hasu put it on an old Uncommon Core podcast, “nothing happening in bitcoin is actually the best thing that can happen to bitcoin.” Turning to Ethereum, ETH bulls today tend to argue the superiority of ETH to BTC on a multi-prong level: Its use as a means of payment within the EVM ecosystem buttresses its value as a SOV (on top of its deflationary effects following EIP-1559 ). But it’s not clear why that alone would make ETH a valuable SOV. Pfeffer argued that crypto participants would simply convert their preferred “store of value via the payment rail at the time of payment in the exact amount needed and for as little time as possible.” He likened this to retailers converting bank deposits to physical cash for payments only at times of need. Pfeffer also presciently argued that Ethereum’s scaling solutions — such as L2s and the move to proof-of-stake — would be “bullish for adoption/users but bearish for token value/investors.” This has turned out to be exceptionally spot-on in light of Crypto Twitter’s constant caterwauling about the lack of ETH’s price appreciation in the last year. So what is ETH worth? Today, Pfeffer’s landmark thesis is being revisited via a newly-published paper by Triton liquid fund, which he co-authored. The paper’s conclusion: Ethereum is a technological marvel, but ETH’s risk-adjusted upside is a difficult projection to make. One could try to value ETH as a cash-flow asset. But Ethereum’s constant innovation around its protocol and tokenomics makes a DCF analysis “incredibly difficult to do accurately.” Even so, the paper makes an attempt based on generous assumptions that issuance is net-neutral, plus with an average growth rate of 5%. No matter what discount rate one uses, though, “ETH appears highly overvalued today as a cash flowing asset at $400b.” Source: Triton One could then turn to the “monetary premium” argument for ETH. But contrary to ETH bulls, ETH is not money — it’s not even the de facto unit of account in the EVM ecosystem (the US dollar is). Case in point: Base, Ethereum’s largest L2, started offering last month the use of USDC for gas costs rather than ETH. ""Monetary premium"" is insane because it appears to be one of the most legitimately powerful concepts with the potential to gigafry economics but is exclusively regurgitated by literal turbonormies who unironically want to like ""justify an absurd valuation"" instead of just saying… — Gwart (@GwartyGwart) December 27, 2024 Even if ETH was treated as the primary medium of exchange onchain, trying to justify ETH’s ~$400+ billion valuation based on “monetary premium” is an exercise laced with wishful thinking. The paper estimates Ethereum’s onchain “GDP” at about $2.8 billion (annualized based on the past six months), making it about 1000x overvalued by its current valuations. Source: Triton The strongest argument for ETH as an investable asset points to it as the dominant internet-native commodity and productive onchain asset. Holding ETH is not like holding gold bars or oil — one can stake it in DeFi to accrue a yield. Yet, the paper questions that a 3% yield from Lido outweighs the inherent volatility of ETH for it to be used as an “internet bond.” In conclusion: “At $400b today and given its current trajectory, it is difficult to justify ETH as a rational investment on a risk-adjusted long-term horizon, no matter which lens you use to value it…BTC still holds its position as a sound risk-adjusted bet that it can grow into its role as a non-sovereign store of value.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

After a period of bullish momentum earlier in the cycle, XRP has held steady above critical support levels, hinting at the possibility of an upcoming rally. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared his insights on XRP’s price action, highlighting technical patterns and signals that suggest a potential rise in the coming days. Martinez’s analysis aligns with the cautious optimism permeating the market, as altcoins like XRP prepare to move in sync with broader market trends. Related Reading: Dogecoin ‘Looks Undeniably Impulsive’ – DOGE/BTC Ratio Uncovers Strong Accumulation However, market sentiment remains tethered to Bitcoin’s performance, with BTC still struggling to reclaim the $100K mark. Many investors view Bitcoin’s next move as a potential catalyst for the entire crypto market. Until then, cautious optimism surrounds XRP and other altcoins, with traders closely monitoring resistance levels and key technical indicators. The coming days could define XRP’s trajectory as it tests its ability to break free from consolidation and chart a bullish course. Investors remain watchful, balancing excitement with caution as the market shows signs of life. XRP About To Enter Price Discovery XRP is gearing up for a potential breakout, with the market anticipating a rebound from its current levels. The crypto community’s focus has shifted toward XRP as it consolidates below resistance and shows signs of preparing for a strong upward move—technical signals and broader market expectations for recovery across the crypto landscape fuel this optimism. Top analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted a critical development in XRP’s price action. According to Martinez’s technical analysis, the TD Sequential indicator has presented a buy signal on the XRP 4-hour chart, pointing toward a potential price rebound. The TD Sequential is a respected technical tool traders use to identify potential reversals or trend exhaustion, often signaling when an asset is ready to pivot from its current trajectory. This buy signal is a significant bullish indicator, suggesting XRP could rise in the coming days. As the market prepares for this potential rally, XRP investors are watching closely for the asset to reclaim its yearly highs and move decisively into price discovery.

With market sentiment showing cautious optimism, the next few days will be pivotal for XRP’s trajectory. If it successfully breaks into price discovery, it could set the stage for a massive rally, positioning the altcoin as a key player in the evolving crypto market landscape. Price Action Looking Strong XRP is trading at $2.38, showcasing resilience after reclaiming and holding the 4-hour 200 moving average at $2.33. This key technical level is a strong indicator of short-term strength, suggesting that XRP may be poised for a significant upward move. With the price stabilizing above this moving average, bullish sentiment among traders is growing. The current price action highlights XRP’s ability to defend critical support, signaling that buyers are stepping in to prevent further declines. If the bullish momentum continues, XRP could begin a massive rally in the coming days. The key level to watch is the $2.70 mark. Reclaiming this level and holding it as support would confirm a breakout, paving the way for a move toward new highs. However, if XRP fails to break above $2.70, the market could see an extended period of sideways consolidation. While this would delay a potential rally, it would also provide a base for accumulation and set the stage for a stronger breakout in the future.

On February 14, 2022, Justin Trudeau invoked the Emergency Act, facing the “Freedom Convoy” protests related to the COVID-19 pandemic. On February 16, 2022 Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) ordering all FINTRAC-regulated organizations in Canada to stop interacting with 34 Bitcoin wallets the world used to donate BTC to the protesting truckers . As Finbold reported later that year, these wallets received approximately 20 BTC, then worth between $877,760 and $891,480. This is an estimated valuation considering Bitcoin’s opening and closing price on February 16, ranging from $43,888 to $44,574 per BTC. Interestingly, $1,000 donated in Bitcoin at this infamous day would have transferred between 0.02243460 and 0.02278527 BTC.

His commitments are already creating momentum for US-based crypto businesses. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, for one, announced that the company achieved significant progress in late 2024. In fact, the entity has signed more US deals in the final six weeks of the year than in the previous six months owing to Donald Trump’s victory in November’s US presidential election. “Trump Bull Market” In his latest tweet , the exec credited the post-election “Trump bull market” for the surge in activity and expressed optimism about Ripple’s future. Garlinghouse also revealed a major hiring shift, with 75% of Ripple’s open positions now US-based. This is in stark change from the past four years when most hires were made internationally due to regulatory hurdles under Gary Gensler-led Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which reportedly froze Ripple’s “business opportunities” at home. “Team Trump is already jumpstarting innovation and job growth in the US with Scott Bessent, David Sacks, Paul Atkins, and others at the helm, and they aren’t even in office yet! Say what you want, but the “Trump effect” is already making crypto great again – through his campaign, and in the Administration’s day 1 priorities.” Ripple vs. SEC Ripple has faced significant challenges from the SEC, which accused the company and its executives of raising $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering. The securities watchdog alleged Ripple violated investor protection laws by failing to provide adequate disclosures about XRP and its business practices. Despite the blockchain entity agreeing to disclose all XRP-related data, the SEC’s demand for eight years of banking records was dismissed by a judge as overreach. After two years of litigation, a 2023 court ruling determined XRP was not a security in programmatic sales but could be classified as such in institutional fundraising contexts. After years of throwing punches at each other, the legal proceedings may finally be over in 2025. Prominent American attorney Jeremy Hogan reiterated his previous sentiment and predicted that the Ripple vs. SEC legal battle could conclude by spring 2025, potentially by April or May. With SEC Chairman Gensler expected to step down and Atkins, a crypto-friendly figure, likely to take his place, the outcome could have significant implications for both Ripple and the broader cryptocurrency market.

Among the best altcoins to buy, three standout assets show significant potential for explosive growth. Backed by bullish trends and strong fundamentals, these cryptocurrencies are positioned as promising investment options, making them must-watch contenders for major returns in early 2025. Altcoins to Buy: ​​Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA), a leading third-generation blockchain, is gaining traction for its eco-friendly proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Unlike energy-intensive proof-of-work networks, Cardano offers sustainable solutions. Over the past year, the ADA price has doubled, reaching $1.10. This growth stands out among the top altcoins to buy in 2025, presenting the potential for significant gains within the next 60 days. Crypto analyst Ali has predicted a bullish breakout for Cardano (ADA), identifying a potential target price of $3. According to his recent analysis, ADA is forming a classic bull pennant pattern on the charts, a formation often associated with upward price momentum. Source- X DexBoss (DEBO) DexBoss (DEBO) has initiated its token presale, pricing each token at $0.011. The listing price is set at $0.0505. The project introduces a deflationary buyback-and-burn mechanism designed to reduce supply and increase token value. DexBoss seeks to replicate centralized exchange features within a decentralized platform, offering a seamless DeFi experience. With a fixed supply and growing demand, the project aims to attract investors looking for long-term returns. DexBoss presents a compelling opportunity for individuals exploring decentralized finance advancements and the rapidly growing DeFi ecosystem. Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL), an open-source blockchain, is making waves in decentralized finance (DeFi). Supporting various decentralized applications (DApps), the SOL price increased by 4% in the past 24 hours, reaching $217. Over the last year, Solana’s market capitalization has grown by 125%, underscoring its rapid expansion within the layer-one blockchain ecosystem, making it the best altcoin to buy. Solana led blockchain activity with $3.66 billion in daily trading volume, surpassing Ethereum’s $1.714 billion. Base followed with $1.207 billion, while Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Sui recorded $877.64 million and $370.76 million, respectively. Investors seeking altcoins to buy in 2025 should consider these three assets for their potential to outperform in the near term. With solid fundamentals and growth-driven roadmaps, they remain strong contenders for notable gains within a bullish crypto market cycle.

The instructions were made public on Wednesday through the Kremlin’s website , about three weeks after President Putin announced that his country would collaborate with BRICS partners and other countries to develop AI. Russia seeks to limit Western-led AI dominance The BRICS bloc is a group of emerging economies often portrayed as a counterweight to the Western-led world order. Russia has been looking for tech alternatives since it invaded Ukraine, and Western sanctions limited the country’s access to high tech. “Ensure further cooperation with the People’s Republic of China in technological research and development in the field of artificial intelligence.” ~ President Vladmir Putin Major world producers of microchips halted exports to Russia due to Western sanctions. These sanctions were intended to restrict Moscow’s access to the technologies it needs to sustain its war against Ukraine, severely limiting its AI ambitions. According to Reuters, a former Russian finance official told the news agency that the country would be using second-grade technology for years and spending huge resources to recreate what already exists. Goods heavily impacted by Western sanctions include semiconductor chips, aviation parts, and medical products. Besides the AI chips sale embargo, the trade restrictions have also hit Russia’s access to financial payment technologies, prompting the country to seek substitutes in the form of parallel import and domestic substitutes. Graphics processing units (GPUs), microchips essential for AI development, have been difficult for Russia to replace, according to the chief executive of Sberbank German Gref in 2023. Russia PM to lead the initiative with Sberbank CEO As a way to ensure action is being taken, President Putin delegated Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Gref to lead the AI effort. The appointees are expected to come back with a progress report by April 2025. However, finding technology alternatives to Western products has not been easy so far for the country. UK-based Tortoise Media Global AI Index ranks Russia at 31 out of 83 countries by AI implementation, innovation and investment. The ranking has Russia well behind the US, China, and other BRICS members – India and Brazil. The first deputy chief executive of Sberbank , Alexander Vedyakhin, in December 2024 said that Russia was six to nine months behind the US and China in AI in a range of parameters. He said Russia would focus on developing large language models rather than building massive data centers. In dealing with the BRICS and other non-western countries, Russia is seeking to challenge US dominance in one of the most promising and crucial technologies of the 21st century. Sberbank claimed that AI associations from Brazil, China, India, and South Africa had already created a network after President Putin on December 11, 2024, said that he wanted to develop a new AI Alliance Network with the BRICS members and other interested countries. On December 31, 2024, Chinese President Xi Jinping exchanged New Year greetings with President Putin saying, “The political mutual trust and strategic coordination between the two sides have continuously marched to a higher level under the strategic guidance of the two leaders.” This comes as the Chinese have continued to deny accusations of supporting Russia’s military efforts. A potential Russia-China partnership in AI could cause concerns beyond sanctions skirting. China’s foray into AI is raising concerns about censorship in the country, where expression is tightly controlled. According to a Financial Times report in July 2024, Chinese officials have tested Chinese large language models to ensure they embody core socialist values.

Pepe Eats SUI (PEPESUI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESUI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Eats SUI can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Eats SUI could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Eats SUI launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Eats SUI on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Eats SUI by entering its contract address – 2bHEDqPL1Y163dismYu4Ft3UT6Dbet9YwjHggGPoVje7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESUI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|SUI,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-06 18:54:00

Trading volumes for USDT have also dropped significantly, plummeting 64% from approximately $154 billion in mid-December to $55 billion by Jan. 6, 2025. Despite these figures, Matrixport, a crypto financial services platform, suggests this trend is not indicative of a bearish market turn. In a Jan. 6 post on X, Matrixport attributed the decline to the holiday season slowdown in trading activity rather than a fundamental shift in market sentiment. Matrixport remains optimistic, predicting that bullish momentum will resume shortly. The firm noted that increasing stablecoin trading volumes often signal bullish trends as they reflect greater fiat inflows into the crypto ecosystem. “However, when these trends reverse, it often signals a consolidation phase for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market,” Matrixport stated. “While Tether’s market cap has declined recently and trading volumes have tapered off, it may be premature to turn bearish. These trends could simply reflect the seasonal lull during the Christmas holiday period. With the new year underway, it won’t be long before we see whether the market’s bullish momentum resumes,” the post added. Other analysts have echoed Matrixport’s perspective. CryptoQuant’s Axel Adler commented on Jan. 4 that Bitcoin needs increased trading volume to trigger a strong bullish impulse, which is likely to return after the holiday season. Meanwhile, community discussions around Tether have criticized reports linking its market cap decline to the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). Although some reports suggested Tether would be delisted from European exchanges by Dec. 30, 2024, local regulators have issued no official guidance to that effect.

Notable players in the asset management sector include BlackRock, Fidelity, Bitwise, ProShares, and Grayscale, among others. Record-Breaking Year and Promising Start for 2025 This represents over $33 billion more than the 2021 annual peak of $10.3 billion. Meanwhile, according to James Butterfill , CoinShares Head of Research, 2025 has also started with a good start for digital asset investment products. The net inflows generated in the first three days of 2025 stood at $585 million. The outgone week, which includes the last two days in 2024, registered a net outflow of $75 million cumulatively. These developments were attained with the launch of U.S spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The Ethereum ETFs came later, in July 2024. Both Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF contributed significantly to the digital asset products. Global Dynamics and Regional Shifts in Crypto Investments Outside of the United States, crypto investment products in Switzerland netted $630 million worth of inflows for 2024. However, the net annual outflows from funds based in Canada and Sweden of $707 million and $682 million, respectively, canceled out the overall figures. The high outflows outside the U.S. prompted a switch on the part of investors from these digital products. According to Butterfill, most investors switched to U.S.-based products to maximize their investments for profit-taking. In terms of performance, Bitcoin-based products led globally and generated $38 billion of the net inflows. It also accounted for about 29% of all-time Bitcoin assets under management (AUM) at the funds. XRP and Solana Make Notable Contributions Interestingly, although Ethereum-based products had a long spell of underperformance, it later gained momentum. The Ethereum products raked in annual net inflows of $4.8 billion. This performance puts the product at 60 times the 2023 figures and 2.4 times those attained in 2021. Other assets covered in the report included XRP-based funds and Solana investment products . The record shows XRP generated the third-largest single asset net inflows for 2024 with $438 million. Meanwhile, Solana was able to attract $69 million in inflows.

The Dollar Spot Index dropped 0.9%—the biggest fall since November—while the euro flexed, surging over 1% against the dollar for its biggest gain since August. Investors freaked out after a Washington Post report said that Trump’s broad, inflation-driving tariff threats could shrink into a plan targeting only a few “critical imports.” Treasury yields, which had climbed earlier in the day, reversed course as Wall Street processed the news. For a currency that had been coasting on expectations of economic chest-thumping and protectionism, the report was a gut punch. The possibility that Trump might actually rein in his aggressive trade rhetoric hit like a bucket of cold water. Trump’s focus allegedly moves to key industries According to the Post , the new plan could slap tariffs on steel, aluminum, copper, and iron—the lifeblood of the defense industry. Think tanks and insiders speculate that Trump wants to rebuild America’s supply chains for military equipment right here at home. It doesn’t stop there. Medical supplies are allegedly also on the chopping block. Needles, vials, syringes, and raw pharmaceutical materials are rumored to be high on the priority list. Then there’s energy. Tariffs could hit imports of rare earth minerals, solar panels, and high-performance batteries—essential components for everything from electric cars to the nation’s energy grid. Trump denies report, lashes out at media Trump, true to form, wasn’t having any of it. He took to Truth Social to call the Washington Post report “fake news.” In a post dripping with trademark bombast, the president wrote, “The story in the Washington Post, quoting so-called anonymous sources, which don’t exist, incorrectly states that my tariff policy will be pared back. That is wrong.” Despite the pushback, the damage was done. The greenback’s strength over the past few weeks had come from expectations that Trump would hit his biggest trading partners—China, the EU, and beyond—with heavy, across-the-board tariffs. A narrower approach? That’s a different game altogether. The markets responded immediately. The yuan and euro, currencies that had taken a beating in recent months, bounced back as traders recalibrated their outlook. But the so-called “one-size-fits-all” approach, where all countries would face the same rates, is apparently still under discussion. However, the political and economic risks are enormous. Blanket tariffs of 10%-20% could hike prices on everything from cars to electronics, hammering American households already grappling with inflation. Global trade experts are also raising red flags. A universal tariff policy could trigger a domino effect of retaliatory measures from other countries, squeezing global economic growth and further rattling financial markets, including crypto.

As Ripple contends with increased SEC scrutiny, the unfolding situation highlights evolving regulatory dynamics within the crypto sphere. At the same time, Solana’s rebound from previous setbacks underscores its enduring technical strength and expanding influence in the realms of decentralized finance and NFTs. Meanwhile, Web3Bay is reshaping e-commerce by merging blockchain technology with sustainable practices, offering a refreshing alternative to centralized giants like Amazon. By removing intermediaries and enhancing community governance, Web3Bay offers a sustainable and decentralized solution that appeals to environmentally aware users and proactive investors. Ripple’s Legal Strategies & Market Movements The spotlight on Ripple intensifies as it responds to the SEC’s vigorous appeals against Judge Analisa Torres’s favorable XRP ruling. Torres’s decision that XRP’s sales were not securities transactions under the Howey Test has set a precedent that challenges the SEC’s approach. Additionally, with SEC Chair Gary Gensler bolstering the enforcement division yet nearing the end of his term, the upcoming appointment of the crypto-supportive Paul Atkins by President-elect Donald Trump suggests a potential shift in regulatory focus. In parallel, the crypto market is abuzz following Anthony Scaramucci’s hint at a possible U.S. government purchase of 500,000 BTC. Although speculative, such discussions reflect a growing recognition of cryptocurrencies as strategic assets, with market sentiments rising in response to these rumors. Solana’s Comeback: Bolstering Blockchain’s Capabilities Solana is reaffirming its prominence in blockchain innovation, captivating the DeFi and NFT sectors with its unparalleled speed and cost-effectiveness. After overcoming significant challenges in 2022, Solana’s rise in early 2025 showcases its resilience and technical sophistication. Notable advancements, like “Project Ironclad,” have enhanced the platform’s reliability, boosting transaction capacity and building trust within the developer and enterprise communities. Moreover, the Solana Foundation’s aggressive expansion has propelled its adoption in decentralized applications and sophisticated business solutions, positioning it as an attractive alternative to Ethereum for smart contract applications. Web3Bay: Pioneering Sustainable E-Commerce Web3Bay’s current presale is making a splash, focusing on sustainability and decentralization to innovate the e-commerce sector. Now in its third stage with a token price of just $0.0039675 and over $420,000 raised, the initiative is attracting those passionate about environmental sustainability and decentralized systems. Using blockchain technology, Web3Bay removes unnecessary intermediaries, decreasing carbon footprints and promoting an eco-friendly online environment. Its commitment to sustainable and transparent business practices is appealing to users looking for honest and ethical solutions, ensuring user independence and data protection. For early investors, the future looks bright, with expectations of a token price jump to $0.1959, translating to a remarkable 6430% return on investment. Unlike traditional retail giants such as Amazon, Web3Bay utilizes blockchain to conduct decentralized transactions and create smart contracts, promoting user control, equitable profit sharing, and clear decision-making processes. Its emphasis on sustainability and minimal energy consumption is pioneering a new standard in eco-friendly e-commerce, scalable yet responsible. At the core of Web3Bay’s philosophy is community governance, where token holders play a pivotal role in shaping policies that reflect the collective will. This democratic approach enhances trust, dedication, and a sense of belonging among users, establishing a just and open marketplace for both buyers and sellers. By valuing inclusivity and user empowerment, Web3Bay is crafting a user-centric platform that is redefining the e-commerce landscape. Final Thoughts The ongoing developments with Ripple’s regulatory encounters, Solana’s technological strides, and Web3Bay’s innovative approach to e-commerce illustrate diverse trajectories influencing the cryptocurrency landscape. Ripple’s situation emphasizes the crucial role of adaptive legal frameworks, while Solana’s recovery highlights the significance of robust and adaptable blockchain solutions. Amidst these narratives, Web3Bay emerges as a beacon for integrating blockchain technology with environmental stewardship, providing a user-centric commerce platform starkly different from traditional centralized models. By championing sustainable practices and enabling community governance, Web3Bay underscores a growing demand for platforms that uphold ethical and decentralized values, marking a pivotal shift in both the financial and digital realms.

In a new post on the social media platform X, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley lays out how he sees tokenization upending traditional stock and equities markets. “With tokenization, people have focused on the demand side: democratize access to money market funds by tokenizing them! There’s value there, but I think the demand side is potentially not the revolutionary story. I think the revolution is the supply side.” According to Horsley, the revolution lies in tokenization’s inherent ability to lower barrier to entry costs for raising capital. “Today, there are around 4,600 companies in the US that are able to access the public equity markets. The NAICs (National Association of Insurance Commissioners) estimates there are over 200,000 companies in the US doing over $10M in revenue. Not all companies want to be public of course; but many simply can’t because it requires immense scale. Enter tokenization, a new democratized capital market… Want to be invested in your local dry cleaner or hometown barber shop?” According to Horsley, this largely untapped resource could revolutionize how small to medium-sized businesses raise capital.

This surge highlights growing momentum in the cryptocurrency market, fueled by anticipation of pro-crypto policies under President-elect Donald Trump , who is set to take office in two weeks. Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market cap has risen to $3.76 trillion, reflecting a 1.9% increase over the last 24 hours. In this bullish environment, several altcoins are approaching key milestones, with some nearing the $100 billion market cap threshold, positioning themselves for potential breakouts in the coming weeks. Finbold has identified Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and Cardano ( ADA ) as cryptocurrencies on track to surpass the $100 billion market cap milestone by the end of Q1 2025, reflecting their strong market performance and growing investor confidence. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin, currently priced at $0.3877 with a market cap of $57.19 billion, is well-positioned to reach a $100 billion market cap in Q1 2025. Recent data from CoinGlass reveals a surge in investor activity, with open interest rising by 39.91% to $4.08 billion and options open interest soaring by 103.95%. This sharp increase in demand signals growing market confidence and positions DOGE for a potential bullish breakout. Dogecoin price and market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap Whale activity has further reinforced this bullish sentiment, with over 1.08 billion DOGE accumulated , indicating market optimism. Historical trends suggest Dogecoin has the potential for exponential rallies, with technical indicators highlighting interim targets at $0.50, $1, and beyond. Trading volume, now at $6.06 billion, combined with a short squeeze that liquidated $6.64 million in short positions, has added to the upward pressure on DOGE’s price. With its strong community backing, growing adoption, and the ability to capitalize on meme-driven popularity, Dogecoin could realistically break resistance levels to hit a $100 billion market cap, translating to a price of approximately $0.677. Cardano (ADA) Cardano, currently priced at $1.10 with a market cap of $38.67 billion, has demonstrated remarkable momentum as it leads the crypto market recovery in the early days of 2025, gaining over 30% in just the first few days of the year. Cardano price and market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap This rally has been fueled by a combination of network advancements, including the introduction of the CIP-113 proposal , which aims to bring programmable assets, enhanced security, and smart accounts to the ecosystem. This could potentially enable Cardano to support stablecoins , securities, and real-world asset tokenization. Supporting this bullish outlook, the data from DefiLlama shows Cardano’s Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi has surged by 26% over the past week to reach $580.2 million, aligning closely with its price increase. This indicates that ADA’s rally is driven by organic demand rather than speculative trading, laying a solid foundation for sustainable growth. To reach a $100 billion market cap in 2025, ADA’s price would need to rise to approximately $2.84. This target appears achievable given Cardano’s strong trajectory and its performance relative to the broader market recovery, where it has outpaced other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ). Technical indicators also reinforce this bullish outlook, with projections pointing toward a potential breakout from a bull pennant pattern, targeting a price level of $3. With its robust network developments and increasing adoption, Cardano is well-positioned to achieve this milestone in 2025. With an expanding ecosystem and increasing market confidence, these two cryptocurrencies are well on their way to achieving significant milestones in the coming weeks. Investors should keep a close eye on these assets as they navigate through the volatility and capitalize on the potential gains ahead.

Matrixport, however, recently pointed out that the short-term drop in market cap and trading volume did not indicate a bearish turn on markets. A Matrixport chart released today revealed a dip in Tether USDT’s market cap, reflecting lowered trading volume during the holiday season. The decline of USDT was also influenced by issues related to MiCA law compliance, which resulted in the stablecoin’s delisting from some European exchanges. As a result, XRP has flipped Tether’s USDT to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. In its ‘Chart of the Day: Stablecoin Trend’ report, Matrixport stated that it was premature to conclude that the stablecoin market had turned bearish, pointing out that the occurrence would not last long. According to the crypto service provider, an increase in stablecoin issuance could act as a bullish signal, indicating buying pressure in the market. A decrease in stablecoin holding or issuance could also be interpreted as a decline in crypto asset demand. Seasonal lull and MiCA laws misinformation lead to USDT losses #Matrixport Today 📉 – Jan 6: #Stablecoin Trends: A Key Indicator for #Crypto Market Momentum in 2025 #cryptomarket #MarketTrends #MarketInsights #CryptoInvesting #BTC #ETH pic.twitter.com/MOUwe85sMP — Matrixport Official (@Matrixport_EN) January 6, 2025 Tether’s USDT’s market cap declined by more than 2.8% in the past week due to reduced trader activity over the Christmas holiday. Coingecko’s data showed that USDT’s market cap was currently at $137.2 billion, down from its December peak of $141 billion. Daily trading volume also fell 64% from mid-December’s $155 billion to $55 billion as of January 6, 2024. The declining market cap and trading volume can also be partly attributed to the impact of delisting USDT from several EU-based exchanges due to MiCA compliance issues. The recent drop in USDT represented the largest loss since November 2022. Karen Tang, head of APAC partnerships at Orderly Network, and social media analyst Axel Bitblaze were among the experts who dismissed fears of USDT’s disruption by MiCA. They emphasized USDT’s dominance in the U.S. and Asia markets, noting that 80% of USDT’s trading volume occurred in Asia. Bitblaze pointed out that the MiCA deadline did not mean that European customers could not hold USDT. Bitblaze also stated that much misinformation was being spread about USDT’s illegality in the EU. The analyst said it was okay for EU customers to hold USDT in non-custodial wallets and even use it to trade on DEXs. The only restriction was that EU customers could not use USDT to trade on MiCA-compliant exchanges. Bitblaze added that the ~$55 billion daily USDT trading volume suggested a less severe impact of USDT delisting in EU exchanges. Tang argued that the delisting of USDT from EU exchanges could hinder the Eurozone itself by slowing digital assets innovation due to ‘overly restrictive regulations. Crypto community slams FUD around MiCA and Tether The crypto community reacted to earlier reports linking USDT’s market drop with the full implementation of MiCA regulations as Binance announced the continued support of USDT until further notice. Community members like Quinten Francois slammed the reports on USDT’s delisting from EU exchanges, labeling them as FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt). Another industry observer, Nostradamus, also reiterated that all the news about the Tether USDt delisting from major global crypto exchanges due to the EU MiCA law was just FUD. Matrixport predicted that stablecoin bullish momentum could resume soon, stating that an increase in stablecoin trading volume was usually a bullish signal for the crypto market. The crypto service provider added that this increase in trading volume reflected more fiat money flowing into the ecosystem, suggesting investor confidence. Tether fought back against MiCA restrictions by investing in EU-based companies like Quantoz and StablR to maintain a hold of the European market. Paulo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, has repeatedly assured EU customers that the company had no plans to exit the EU market. He, however, reminded EU customers to use non-custodial wallets as a workaround for now.

It makes GSR the first crypto liquidity provider to have dual regulatory authorization from both FCA and Singapore’s Monetary Authority, better known as MAS. This means a lot, indicating that the company is committed to compliance and committed to making available regulated crypto services around the world. Facilitating Institutional Crypto Services The FCA’s green light will enable GSR Markets UK to provide a suite of services-institutional tailored-over-the-counter and programmatic execution trading among them-to the UK. This is very timely, considering the demand for regulated crypto solutions that has been growing, especially with Bitcoin breaking the $100,000 mark back in December 2024 and an unprecedented rush of institutional investors into the market throughout the year. Regulatory compliance by GSR enables it to meet the gradually increasing demand in secure and reliable trading platforms . Strengthening Compliance across Global Markets In response, Xin Song, Group CEO of GSR said, “The dual approval empowers us to confidently scale up our services to institutional clients all over the world. It underpins the highest regulatory standard that GSR works to, supported by the FCA’s approval of our license issued from Singapore’s Monetary Authority.” The company, therefore, views this as one of the very few leaders providing fully compliant crypto trading solutions and transparency to the world’s markets. Expansion of Operations and Staff With more than 120 employees in the UK, GSR is one of the largest crypto-native employers in the region. The company is well-equipped to support institutional clients through the evolving crypto landscape. Jakob Palmstierna, CEO of GSR Markets UK, commented that the dual authorization allows the firm to provide scalable and compliant trading services, meeting the increasing needs of the dynamic market. Major Payment Institution License in Singapore In April 2024, GSR Markets Singapore got a full MPI license from the MAS, enabling the company to surpass the volume limits of transactions of 3 million Singapore dollars ($2.2 million) for single services and 6 million SG$ ($4.4 million) for multiple services. The license by MAS places GSR in a better position to scale up its services in Asia and further cements its compliance credentials. A Leader in Regulated Crypto Trading Achieving dual regulatory approval places GSR at an absolute threshold in regard to compliance and innovation in the crypto trading business.

Traders and investors can buy Hederah Hashgraph (HBAR) on these CEXs: Binance, KuCoin, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, and others. Will HBAR reach $10? HBAR reaching $10 is highly unlikely, requiring a massive market cap increase. Predictions for 2030 estimate HBAR could reach between $1.89 and $2.10, making $10 an unrealistic target without extraordinary market changes Will HBAR reach $100? Hederah Hashgraph (HBAR) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and would require exceptional growth, widespread adoption, and wild market speculation. Does HBAR have a good long-term future? HBAR has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $0.73 by 2025 and $2.10 by 2030. However, as with all meme coins, its future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

The price significantly increased to $0.1 by the first week of February 2021, driven by the continuous network efforts of early January. HBAR started 2024 modestly, surging in April to a high of $0.1793 before stabilizing around $0.110 in May and dropping to $0.051 by September. November saw a rebound, with HBAR reaching $0.3012 and $3.34B in trading volume, closing the year near $0.29 after peaking at $0.30 in December.

Trump tokens outpaced traditional meme coins; DOGE rose 2%, while SHIB gained 3% in the past 24 hours. These Tokens Head North Donald Trump notched a remarkable victory in the US presidential elections in November last year. He swept all seven key swing states and also won the popular vote against his main opponent, Kamala Harris. Trump’s inauguration is set for January 20, after which he will officially become America’s 47th President. His stepping into office seems to have already caused substantial price fluctuations in some cryptocurrencies, more particularly meme coins related to him. The biggest of that type (in terms of market capitalization) – MAGA (TRUMP) – is up 20% daily scale, currently trading at around $3.15 (per CoinGecko’s data). Super Trump (STRUMP), Super President Trump 47 (TRUMP 47), Moon Trump (TRUMP), trumpie (TRUMPIE), and many more have also charted double-digit gains. However, the one outshining all Trump-themed memes is the lesser-known MAGA: Fight for Trump (TRUMPCOIN). Its price has exploded by 215% in the past 24 hours and a whopping 560% in the last week. It is important to note that Trump-related meme coins were again pumping before the presidential elections. Nonetheless, many of them experienced a substantial correction shortly after the voting results. We have yet to see whether such a “sell the news” event will occur once Trump takes the oath on January 20 . How Are the Leaders Doing? Trump-themed tokens have significantly outpaced some leading meme coins in the past 24 hours. The largest in terms of market capitalization – Dogecoin (DOGE) – is up 2% daily and is currently worth approximately $0.39. Meanwhile, some industry participants believe it could soon experience a major rally considering Elon Musk’s involvement in politics. Tesla’s CEO is set to spearhead a newly established division called Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). The agency will aim to reduce bureaucracy, cut unnecessary regulations, and eliminate wasteful spending within the US government. Its name and the fact that Musk is one of the most vocal proponents of the meme coin, though, have infused enthusiasm among DOGE bulls. Dogecoin’s biggest rival, Shiba Inu (SHIB), has risen by 3%, while Pepe (PEPE) has registered little-to-no volatility in the last day.

However, even though the entry was triggered by bearish forces, Dogecoin’s entry into the Gaussian Channel was bullish and showed a tendency to recover quickly from dips. This is because the Gaussian Channel can act as a bounce-off point to possibly send DOGE soaring toward new all-time highs. Dogecoin Gaussian Channel Flashes Green Over the last few weeks, the Dogecoin price has been trending in the Gaussian Channel, showing evidence of bullishness but not quite completing the move. However, this is beginning to change as, for the first time, the Dogecoin Gaussian Channel has turned green. Related Reading: Dogecoin Weekly RSI Approaches The MA Line, Can Price Resume Uptrend To Break $0.74 ATH? According to crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade, the Dogecoin Gaussian Channel recently flashed green, and this happened on the 4-hour chart. This development points to a possible breakout of the channel that has persisted for the last three weeks. It also signals the start of a possible upward move that could push the price above the coveted $1 level. Initial targets for the Dogecoin price from here put it toward $0.5, where the most resistance currently lies for the DOGE price due to its recent peak. Once a break above the resistance is achieved, the analyst’s chart shows a massive continuation that could push the price further. At the top of the breakout is the $1.4 target, which is an over 200% move from the current price. This target is in line with the analyst’s previous predictions for DOGE, saying that the leading meme coin was set to hit a new all-time high price soon. Analysts Bullish On DOGE Price Despite the crash that rocked the Dogecoin price back in December 2024, crypto analysts have remained quite bullish on the meme coin. Crypto analyst Dima James shared in December that the Dogecoin price could reach double-digits this cycle. Related Reading: Litecoin Sees 2M Bollinger Bands Tighten – What A Move Above $130 Will Mean For Price James used historical data to back up his prediction, showing that DOGE has a history of massive surges. Mainly, these surges happen on a 4-year cycle and with the last major surge happening in 2021, it means 2025 is next in the 4-year cycle. If this is correct, then the DOGE price could be seeing a new all-time high in the first quarter of 2025. In another analysis reported by NewsBTC, a crypto analyst predicted that the DOGE price could rise as high as $5, forecasting a 1,500% move for the meme coin. This time around, the analyst puts the timeline somewhere between March and April, giving only a few months for this prediction to materialize. At the time of writing, Dogecoin was trading at $0.383, 48% below its all-time high price of $0.7376 recorded in May 2021.

Whales Buy 1 Billion Meme Coins,https://coinpedia.org/news/time-to-buy-doge-whales-buy-1-billion-meme-coins/,"The post Time to Buy DOGE? Whales Buy 1 Billion Meme Coins appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Dogecoin (DOGE), the popular and world’s largest meme coin, appears more optimistic in this highly anticipated altcoin season. Experts and analysts believe this bull run will begin following the inauguration of Donald Trump’s government, which is scheduled for January 20, 2025. Crypto Whales Buy 1 Billion DOGE In this highly anticipated bull run, long-term holders, whales, and retailers appear to be strongly accumulating the DOGE meme coin, as a crypto expert on X (formerly Twitter) revealed. On January 7, 2024, the expert stressed that whales have added a significant 1 billion DOGE in the past seven days. BREAKING: Whales have accumulated over 1 BILLION $DOGE in the last 7 days. pic.twitter.com/Jkk9jqIOHy — CEO (@Investments_CEO) January 6, 2025 This substantial accumulation in such a short time frame can create more buying pressure and lead to a further upside rally, as observed in the DOGE price. According to CoinMarketCap data, during the same period of accumulation, the meme coin has witnessed a price gain of over 27%. DOGE Price Momentum At press time, DOGE is trading near $0.39 and has experienced a price gain of over 2.50% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, investors and traders have also increased their participation, resulting in a 12% rise in trading volume. Besides DOGE, the market sentiment appears to be bullish, as major assets, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), have shown a strong rally, which could help the meme coin continue its rally. Bullish On-Chain Metrics This bullish market sentiment across the crypto market has attracted intraday traders, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Source: Coinglass Traders’ Rising Interest Currently, DOGE open interest (OI) has jumped by 40%, indicating that traders have increased their open positions by 40%, which is considered a positive sign in this bull run. Meanwhile, some long-term holders appear to be dumping their holdings as sentiment shifts. Data from spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed an inflow of over $18 million worth of DOGE. In the cryptocurrency landscape, inflow refers to the movement of assets from long-term holders’ wallets to exchanges, which has the potential to create selling pressure and a price decline. However, as the accumulation is significantly higher, it may not lead to a price decline. DOGE Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, DOGE has been consolidating in a tight range between $0.375 and $0.398 for the past three days. Source: TradingView Based on recent price action, if the meme coin breaks this pattern and closes a daily candle above the $0.40 level, there is a strong possibility DOGE could soar by 44% to reach the $0.57 mark in the future. As of now, market sentiment is bullish, with whales and traders showing strong interest and confidence in the meme coin. This could help DOGE breach the narrow zone and achieve the predicted target.",News|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-06 19:30:09

It has technically resumed an uptrend following a week straight recovery but now faces resistance after rising 7% weekly. Following the mid-December price drops from $108.3k, which set a negative narrative in the market, Bitcoin’s bullish landscape temporarily changed, and the price fell into the $91k range. This provides a sizeable discount for another buy—possibly the last leg up—before ending the bull run. Fortunately, that range stood firm at the end of the month, and the price slowly bounced back but remained indecisive at around $98,000 throughout last weekend. However, the demand level increased today, and the price advanced near the important $100k level after three weeks. While facing resistance, it is currently negotiating the important level for the next major move. The latest price increases suggested an end to the correction phase and looking at the recovery so far, the bulls appeared back in the control. A surge through the important level could trigger a quick recovery to the top amid rising demand before exploding with a massive price break. Conversely, failure to push higher could result to a small drawdown before resuming bullish. From the look of things, the bulls appeared not holding back momentum anymore. BTC’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Facing the $100,000 level, Bitcoin’s next target for a break-up would be a hidden $104,088 resistance level along with the current $108,353 all-time high. A crossover there could rally the price to a new ATH. Bearish sentiments are currently off the market. If it returns, the price may slide through the $95,600 level to revisit the $91,530 support level. A breakdown from there could collapse BTC to $85,072 and potentially $81,500, where the rising trendline lies. Key Resistance Levels: $100,000, $104,088, $108,353 Key Support Levels: $95,600, $91,530, $85,072 Spot Price: $99,429 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Now that the trend is in an upward range again, a huge rally can be expected. Last year’s trading came with a lot of ups and downs due to an imbalance in the market but Ethereum ended it a bit calm after managing to double its price to reach a new peak of $4,107 within the span of four months. Luckily for the bulls, the demand level increased after reaccumulating well above $3,300 and the price surged consistently until it reached the $3,698 level earlier today. Although it has seen a slight rejection and now trades calmly on the day. A push above the $3,700 level could bring more recovery in the market before reclaiming the current all-time high. A break from there could set the price up for an explosive rally from a short-term perspective. Looking at the recovery since the start of the year, the bulls seemed back in control on the daily chart. We can expect more increases a soon as the volume increases. The bulls appeared taking a break on the hourly. If the price drops, ETH may pull back into the $3,400 range for support. Failure to recover from that range could trigger more buy opportunities before rising back. For now, the bulls have the upper hand. ETH’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The immediate obstacle for the bulls lies at the $3,830 resistance level. Overcoming it could allow a full recovery to the current all-time high of $4,107 before breaking higher. The potential level to watch is $4,300. If the price drops, there’s a close support at $3,550. The $3,307 level is currently providing support. A breakdown there could bring us back to a low of $3,101.

In a post on X, Sunil noted that SUI reaching $5.20 with a $16 billion market cap meant that the 890 million SUI tokens that FTX sold for $96 million in March 2023 are now worth $4.6 billion. He posted on X: “FTX sold 890m Sui tokens (warrants) + equity to Mysten Labs for $96m in March 2023. These are worth $4.6 bn.” The bankrupt exchange sold the stake back to Sui network developer Mysten Labs in 2023, a few months after filing for bankruptcy. FTX Ventures had acquired the stake, which includes equity in Mysten Labs and rights to purchase SUI tokens in 2022 after investing $101 million in Mysten Labs’ $300 million Series B funding. This meant it sold it off at a loss. However, FTX’s bankruptcy estate was selling off the stake at the time, which is unsurprising given that the SUI token had yet to be launched, and the estate was trying to consolidate assets and pay creditors. Still, many creditors believe that FTX is missing out on a potential windfall from keeping its SUI stake, highlighting the inefficiency of the bankruptcy professionals managing the estate. SUI has been one of the best-performing tokens this year, outdoing almost every other major cap token in its climb to a new all-time high. Although it has now dropped from its peak of $5.34 to $5.17, it remains one of the tokens to watch for 2025. FTX is yet to commence creditors’ repayment despite reports Meanwhile, Sunil added that FTX has not started paying back creditors, contrary to multiple claims on X (formerly Twitter), including from AI agent AIXBT. Many accounts on X have been claiming that FTX started its repayment of $16 billion on January 3, the effective date for the redistribution plan. However, this is merely a misunderstanding, as the FTX said distribution takes place within 60 days of the effective date. This means most creditors will not get their refunds until February or March. Interestingly, the bankrupt exchange is not distributing $16 billion cash as claimed, as it only has $13 billion in cash and has already asked to retain about $6.5 billion for pending claims. Additionally, only creditors in the Convenience Class will be paid in the first distribution. Creditors in this category account for 98% of FTX creditors and claim $50,000 or less from the exchange. These creditors will get 119% of their funds based on the plan. These users have until January 20 to complete KYC and tax forms and onboard with a distribution agent. The exchange also said that other classes’ records and payment dates will be announced later. It added that users should be cautious of phishing emails that might seem like they are from the exchange and any scam site that may look like the FTX Debtors’ Customer Portal. New evidence shows Ryan Salame knew about FTX fraud Meanwhile, the FTX Debtors continue to pursue legal actions to recover assets against former executives, including FTX co-CEO Ryan Salame. A new filing from FTX accused Salame, sentenced to a seven-and-a-half-year prison term, of being one of the major architects of fraud within the exchange. The filing alleged that he initiated the Payment Agent Agreement between FTX and Alameda Research and proposed schemes allowing FTX to perpetrate fraud. It also claimed that Salame was aware of Alameda’s special privileges with FTX and even advised Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison on managing the whole situation to make it appear legitimate and above board. These new allegations challenge Salame’s previous claims that he was unaware of the exchange’s fraudulent activities or that his banking activity was improper. Salame, whose release date has already been moved up more than a year, was also accused of using political donations to the Republican Party and candidates to buy influence for FTX. According to court filings, Salame proposed in a January 2022 memorandum that he would spend more time in Washington, DC, to get long-term influence, especially from the Republicans. A written review of his performance by Sam Bankman-Fried in August 2022 shows commendation and remuneration for his efforts over the first half of that year.

Cryptocurrency-Hostile Leader Resigns in Economic Powerhouse, New Crypto-Friendly Leader May Arrive",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/another-trump-case-cryptocurrency-hostile-leader-resigns-in-economic-powerhouse-new-crypto-friendly-leader-may-arrive/,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s announcement today that he will resign from his party leadership and prime ministry has opened the door to a government that is potentially less resistant to cryptocurrencies. While the country's provincial regulators have primary authority over digital assets, the change in federal leadership could impact Canada's broader stance on cryptocurrency. Trudeau, who has led the Liberal Party since 2013 and served as prime minister since 2015, cited “internal struggles” as a key factor in his decision to step down. “I can't be the one to carry the Liberal standard into the next election,” Trudeau told a news conference. His resignation comes as the party begins the process of choosing a new leader ahead of Canada's October general election. Trudeau has faced criticism from the crypto community over government actions during the 2022 Freedom Rides protests. Authorities froze cryptocurrency accounts associated with the protests, sparking outrage both domestically and internationally. The incident has also fueled opposition to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) among U.S. lawmakers, who have held it up as a cautionary tale about government overreach in financial transactions. Related News: Good News from the FED to the Cryptocurrency Market - Bitcoin Enemies are Diminishing One by One The Conservative Party, led by Pierre Poilievre, is currently leading in the polls and is positioned as a strong contender to become Canada’s next prime minister. Poilievre has been a strong supporter of digital assets in the past, advocating cryptocurrencies as a tool for financial freedom. However, his recent silence on the issue has created some uncertainty about his future policies. Poilievre has also gained traction among supporters of US President-elect Donald Trump, increasing his cross-border appeal. It remains to be seen how his government would influence Canada’s crypto policies if he becomes prime minister. Despite the change in federal leadership, Canada’s digital asset regulation will continue to be shaped primarily by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), a coalition of provincial officials and provincial regulators. Unlike the U.S., Canada does not have a central securities regulator like the SEC, meaning crypto-related decisions largely fall to the states. One likely candidate to replace Trudeau is Mark Carney, a former governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England. While Carney has not officially announced his candidacy, his potential leadership could bring a more cautious approach to crypto. In a 2021 lecture at the Bank for International Settlements, Carney argued that tokens and cryptocurrencies should remain “token value” and stated that stablecoins should be heavily regulated. *This is not investment advice.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Pierre Rochard, a vice president of mining firm Riot Platforms, says the huge amount of funds processed indicates that the crypto king is both a store of value asset and a medium of exchange. However, Rochard’s chart indicates that the top crypto asset by market cap saw more funds processed in years prior. In 2021, a staggering $47.7 trillion worth of BTC transactions were processed while in 2022, that number dipped to $36.4 trillion. Source: Pierre Bochard/X He also says that institutions’ second round of Bitcoin securitization will see BTC adoption rise to heights never seen before. “Season 2: Bitcoin Securitization. This is de facto how BTC is going to scale to a billion users.” The executive goes on to predict that 2025 will still be a year where the securitization of BTC – or the creation of investment vehicles such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) linked to Bitcoin – will continue to outpace the performance of one emerging use case in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. “2025 prediction: TradFi securitization of BTC will continue to eclipse DeFi tokenization of [real-world assets].” BTC is trading for $98,962 at time of writing, a fractional increase on the day.

This underscores similar commitment and optimism expressed by the community regarding multiple applications. The success of Bitcoin products last year led to community rallies around altcoin products, which led to wider price projections this year. VanEck Backs Community Anticipation On Jan 1, Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s Head of Research, noted that increased community expectations of spot SOL ETFs were underpriced. On Dec 31, digital asset prediction platform Polymarket users tipped a 77% chance of Solana ETF approval in 2025. This comes after renewed institutional interest and easing regulatory concerns. Reacting to the post on X (formerly Twitter), Sigel described the figure as underpriced, hinting at a higher chance of approval. Several crypto executives share this sentiment after Donald Trump’s win at the November polls and subsequent nominations. However, the odds have jumped to 85% since Sigel’s comments, showing a higher chance of success. “ Polymarket bettors are now giving an 85% chance that the SEC will approve a spot Solana ETF by the end of 2025, marking a 35% surge in optimism over the last few days. What’s driving this bullish sentiment? Growing expectations that $SOL could follow in the footsteps of $BTC and $ETH, carving its path into mainstream markets through ETFs,” Blockmandev wrote on X. In June 2024, VanEck filed a spot Solana ETF application, although the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hinted at the asset being a security rather than a commodity. However, many users hinted at better regulations this year. Donald Trump Return Fuels Optimism In the run-up to the US elections, Trump pledged positive crypto laws with a vision to position the country as the global Bitcoin hub. This attracted several enthusiasts with a massive interest in the elections. Trump’s win in November saw a huge spike in Bitcoin and altcoin prices as stakeholders pointed to easing regulations. This ease is expected to push spot Solana ETFs and other products alongside increased decentralized finance (DeFi) activities. The Trump Presidency is expected to shift from Joe Biden’s harsh policy approach to the sector. With anticipated pro-market regulations , market forces have flipped green, with SOL making huge gains in the last three months. At press time, Solana traded at $220, taking its market capitalization above $106 billion. In another development, Trump’s Scott Bessent nomination as Treasury Secretary also ignited hopes for a positive crypto policy.",Cryptocurrency|News|Solana,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-06 19:47:23

The complaint revolved around accusations that Gemini Trust submitted false and misleading information when trying to establish the first US-licensed Bitcoin futures contract. Winklevoss Twins’ Gemini Ends CFTC Dispute With $5M Settlement In a Bloomberg report , Gemini Trust agreed to settle with the CFTC and paid $5 million. This settlement is with respect to the regulator’s claims without Gemini admitting or denying liability. The case was filed in Manhattan federal court and the case was set to go to trial on January 21, 2025. The legal action arose from allegations that Gemini Trust misled the CFTC in 2017 while describing mechanisms to prevent manipulation in Bitcoin pricing. These mechanisms were to serve as references for derivatives linked to the cryptocurrency. This Gemini settlement comes after another recent prediction by former SEC enforcement lawyer Marc Fagel, who stated that a settlement is likely in the Ripple SEC case. Fagel noted that both Ripple and the SEC appealed parts of the case they lost, leaving penalties on hold. He believes the incoming Trump administration and SEC Chair Paul Atkins may decide not to pursue the appeal, prompting a settlement. CFTC Allegations and Regulatory Efforts The CFTC had alleged that Gemini Trust made false statements regarding its Bitcoin futures contract proposal. The regulator argued that the company’s safeguards against price manipulation were insufficient and not accurately represented to the commission. During the investigation, Gemini Trust provided subpoenaed laptops belonging to two former executives. These were part of a related criminal probe that ended without any charges. While the criminal investigation closed, the civil case brought by the CFTC continued, ultimately resulting in a $5 million settlement. The civil enforcement case was one of many brought under President Joe Biden’s administration, which sought to tighten regulatory oversight. With President Donald Trump set to begin his second term on January 20, 2025, crypto advocates anticipate a shift toward industry-friendly policies. Moreover, in a recent report, Brad Garlinghouse highlighted the “Trump effect” on Ripple, revealing that 75% of Ripple’s open roles are now US-based. He noted that the company signed more US deals in the last six weeks of 2024, post-Trump’s victory, than in the prior six months. Garlinghouse also emphasized the success of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, which recently surpassed PYUSD and EURC in 24-hour trading volume.

However, recent speculations about the approval of the XRP ETF have led to increased demand for the XRP price and other altcoins. Let’s examine the best 3 altcoins expected to undergo a massive surge after the approval for an XRP ETF and analyze their potential returns. How Ripple Will Benefit From The XRP ETF Launch The approval of the XRP ETF is linked to the ongoing legal battle. Many asset management firms, including Bitwise Asset Management, Canary Capital, and Wisdom Tree, have applied to launch a spot XRP ETF. If the XRP ETF gets the green light, it would exponentially increase investors’ exposure and immensely boost the XRP price performance. When an XRP ETF goes live, it will encourage institutions to include it in their portfolios and raise the price, thus making it one of the best 3 altcoins for 2025. PropiChain: Real Estate Meets AI and The Metaverse PropiChain is an emerging RWA platform that solves real estate challenges. It has integrated blockchain, AI, and the Metaverse into the platform to address fraud risks, opaque pricing, and high transaction costs. PropiChain has divided all properties into fractions and converted them into tokens that users can trade on the blockchain. Thus, it allows users to partake in the fractional ownership model and enjoy better liquidity and increased diversification opportunities, gaining an edge over traditional investors. Another advantage users have on PropiChain is access to the Metaverse, which offers a 3D virtual experience of all real estate. Using the Metaverse, investors can assess their dream real estate from the comfort of their homes and thus have better investment reach while saving time and travel costs. Furthermore, PropiChain users get real-time valuations of all the listed real estate from the Automated Valuation Models (AVMs). These AI-powered algorithms analyze historical sales data and other economic factors to provide accurate valuations for properties matching the market price. Once a user chooses a property for investment, the AI offers automated transactions to simplify the process. The user can set a condition, such as the valuation at which they want to purchase a piece of real estate, based on which the AI executes the order. Thus, investors can maximize profits from their investment strategies. Moreover, users can also automate property leasing by using the platform’s smart contracts to draft lease agreements without manual paperwork. The smart contracts help trigger the deal once both parties have signed the agreement and the tenant transfers the funds. Smart contracts also help simplify lease renewals as they notify both parties when the lease is close to the expiry date and create a new agreement with updated terms if they agree to an extension. PropiChain’s native token is PCHAIN , which is currently in presale stage two and is going for $0.011 per token. It is considered among the highly undervalued altcoins since, in a few days, the value will increase to $0.023 when the presale reaches the next stage. Thus, a $1,000 investment will surge over $2,000 when PCHAIN reaches the next stage and over $2,900 when it launches at $0.032. Moreover, analysts predict that PCHAIN will benefit immensely from the approval of the XRP ETF. PCHAIN is among the best 3 altcoins since analysts foreshadow a 100x rally that could turn the initial $1,000 investment into $100,000. Why Is TON Among The Best 3 Altcoins For 2025? Toncoin (TON) has the potential to be one of the best 3 altcoins in 2025 due to Telegram’s popularity and vast user base that exceeds 950 million active users. TON has enormous untapped potential in the DeFi space, which positions it for tremendous growth. With its unmatched transaction speeds and scalable architecture, it is poised to capture the DeFi market. TON can integrate seamlessly with Telegram’s ecosystem, making it ideal for payment solutions, dApps, and a wide range of DeFi services. It will experience a significant boost when the XRP ETF launches and increases investors’ widespread exposure to cryptocurrencies. Conclusion The potential conception of an XRP ETF has led to excitement in the market, as it can significantly improve overall market sentiment. Ripple, PropiChain, and TON are the best 3 altcoins to benefit from the approval of these ETFs. However, PropiChain has the best potential since it is in the early presale phase. PropiChain is transforming real estate investments by incorporating blockchain, AI, and the Metaverse to create a streamlined investment process that improves efficiency, offers enhanced security and transparency, and liberates investors from the issues they face in the traditional market. Regarding user safety, BlockAudit , after conducting rigorous platform testing, reported zero security vulnerabilities and guaranteed complete regulatory compliance. Thus ensuring PropiChain’s integrity and safety. Moreover, PCHAIN has reached the crucial milestones of CoinMarketCap listing early in the presale phase, significantly boosting the presale performance. The project is moving towards further milestones at an incredible speed. Thus, investors can expect more momentum in the presale and quicker returns. PCHAIN is one of the best 3 altcoins to invest in 2025 since the demand for emerging tokens will increase once the XRP ETF secures approval. Due to its outstanding utility, PCHAIN is projected for a 100x rally after the presale, through which early investors can accumulate enormous wealth.

The company agreed to a “proposed consent order” signed by the CFTC on Monday, according to Bloomberg . As part of the settlement, Gemini will pay a $5 million fine for allegedly providing misleading information to the regulator during its efforts to launch the first regulated Bitcoin ( BTC ) futures contract in the United States. Gemini agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations filed by the CFTC, a case that was set to go to trial beginning January 21, 2025.

In particular, the agency noted “false or misleading statements of material facts” that the exchange made between July 2017 and December 2017. As crypto.news highlighted at the time, the regulator’s allegations related to Gemini’s self-certification of its proposed BTC futures product. The CFTC complaint noted that Gemini personnel either “knew or reasonably should have known that such statements were false or misleading.” However, the exchange refuted the regulator’s claims, noting there was no manipulation of Bitcoin price or harm to investors. But in its initial complaint, the CFTC asked the court for an order on disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, enforcement of civil monetary penalties, and an injunction against any further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act.
