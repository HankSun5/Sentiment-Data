By 2028, ADA/USD could decline and reach $5.50. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $6.44. Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.861 Market Cap $30.49B Trading Volume $1.17B Circulating Supply 35.12B ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.9079 24-hour Low $0.8667 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 8.76% 50-day SMA $0.925 14-Day RSI 44.18 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 73 (Greed) Green Days 15/30 (50%) Cardano price analysis: Cardano’s resistance is at $1.091, while support lies at $0.783 ADA price analysis 1-day chart ADA/USD 1-Day Chart On January 5, the 1-day Cardano (ADA) chart shows a price of $1.087, with the upper Bollinger Band at $1.091 acting as immediate resistance and the lower band at $0.783 providing strong support. The middle band, currently at $0.937, has been tested as support, signaling potential bullish momentum. RSI at 61.68 indicates a bullish trend nearing overbought levels, suggesting continued strength but caution for a potential correction. Volume at 8.37M confirms active trading interest. A breakout above $1.091 could lead ADA toward the $1.20 level, while rejection may prompt a retest of $0.937. Consolidation above $1.00 could strengthen bullish sentiment. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart ADA/USD 4-hour Chart The 4-hour Cardano (ADA) chart shows the price at $1.087, with resistance at the upper Bollinger Band of $1.146 and support at the lower band of $0.966. The middle band, at $1.056, serves as immediate support, holding against recent pullbacks. The Balance of Power (BoP) is at -0.16, suggesting mild bearish momentum. The MACD reflects consolidation, with the MACD line at 0.044 closely aligning with the signal line at 0.040, hinting at waning bullish momentum. A breakout above $1.146 could lead to gains toward $1.20, while failure to hold $1.056 may trigger a retracement to $0.966.

On the daily chart, the price at $0.878 is below the 20-SMA ($0.975), with resistance at $0.975 and $1.158, while support stands at $0.793. RSI near 42 indicates weak buying momentum. On the 4-hour chart, ADA trades below the 20-SMA ($0.878), with resistance at $0.903 and support at $0.854. The Balance of Power and MACD confirm bearish sentiment. A break below $0.854 may trigger further downside toward $0.793, while a recovery above $0.975 could signal a bullish rebound. Caution is advised amid weak momentum. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2024, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Based on our analysis, Cardano is likely to reach $5 by 2027, with a forecasted range of around $5.53. This projection is driven by Cardano’s continued technological advancements, growing adoption, strategic partnerships, and increasing market confidence, indicating a positive long-term growth trajectory for the cryptocurrency market. Will Cardano reach $10? ADA is predicted to reach $8.98 by 2030. While this brings it closer to the $10 mark, it is not expected to achieve that level yet. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano is trading around $1, with an all-time high of $2.80 in early 2021. While not impossible, reaching $50 in the next few years is highly uncertain. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. Predictions indicate that by 2030, Cardano could see significant growth, with estimates suggesting a rise to around $9. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges.

It initially gained investor support and popularity for being affordable and environmentally friendly due to its unique PoS mechanism called Ouroboros. In 2021, Cardano implemented the smart contract feature with the Alonzo update. This update came on the ADA test network and brought the interoperability and scalability that was promised to the users earlier. The ADA price reached its all-time high during the bullish cycle of 2021 when it hit $3.09. However, its price started plummeting at the beginning of September 2021 and reached a low of $0.220 in June 2023. In 2024, Cardano peaked at $0.810 in March before dropping to $0.401 in April due to heavy selling. It traded between $0.52–$0.401 in April and $0.317–$0.423 by July, with strong support at $0.33 in August. After peaking at $0.37 in September and dipping to $0.33 in November, ADA surged to $1.1999 at the start of December, hit a maximum price of $1.3264, and closed the year at $0.8451. In January 2025, Cardano is trading between $1.02 to $1.09.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-05 20:53:38

Is This Possible?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/can-all-bitcoins-really-be-mined-in-the-us-after-trump-takes-office-is-this-possible/,"Bitcoin mining has become a major industry in the United States, with American miners currently contributing around 40% of the global Bitcoin mining hashrate. But could Donald Trump’s return to the White House make the US the sole hub for all future Bitcoin mining? Experts say that’s unlikely. During his campaign, Trump made numerous pro-crypto promises, including one bold statement: He wanted all remaining Bitcoin to be mined in the U.S. But achieving that would require shutting down mining operations worldwide and transferring that capacity to America, a move seen as impractical by industry professionals. Related News: Analytics Firm Shares Critical Levels for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana - Here's What to Watch “I think it’s impossible,” said Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s director of digital assets research. He explained that global mining networks are too entrenched for such a shift to happen. CJ Burnett, chief revenue officer at Compass Mining, echoed that sentiment, noting that the U.S. lacks the infrastructure, affordable energy and mining equipment needed to undertake such a monumental task. Bitcoin mining is inherently a globally distributed network, driven by factors such as energy availability, market economics, and regulatory environments across countries. “The US cannot be the sole location for mining all of the remaining Bitcoin,” Burnett said. However, he acknowledged that better US policies could attract more miners to set up operations domestically and accelerate the growth of the sector. Frank Holmes, CEO of Hive Digital Technologies, also expressed optimism that a Trump presidency could bring “continued support for Bitcoin innovation.” *This is not investment advice.

Kiyosaki tells his 2.6 million followers on the social media platform X that a “giant” market crash has arrived that will force the financial system to create more money, widening the gap between the rich and the poor while boosting the prices of gold, silver and BTC. “GIANT MARKET CRASH here. Q: How can I be so bullish on gold, silver, and Bitcoin? A: Because the idiots running the Fed, Treasury, Banks, and Wall Street only know how to print money, which makes things worse. FYI: When fake money is printed, the rich who own real assets get richer…. while the poor and middle class, who save fake money, get poorer due to inflation and taxes. Let inflation make you richer, not poorer. Save gold, silver, and Bitcoin. Take care. Crash is here.” Kiyosaki predicts that Bitcoin will rally between 78% and 257% before this year comes to an end. “MY PRICE PREDICTION for BITCOIN 2025: $175,000 to $350,000″ The best-selling author recently referred to the US dollar as “fake money,” noting that the government can always print more units out of thin air. “I stopped trusting my government in 1965 when I noticed our silver coins were now alloys of cooper. In 1971, President Nixon continued the theft of our wealth via our money, when Tricky Dicky Nixon took the US dollar off the gold standard… If you do not [like] being ‘bent over’ and your wealth stolen via your fake money…. Keep being ignorant, working hard for fake money, and continue listening to financial planners who will tell you what to do with your fake money.” Bitcoin is trading at $98,079 at time of writing.

However, as the president will soon be sworn in, cryptocurrency’s fate stands in the balance; it could go mainstream or be brought down by a cast of villains. There are strong beliefs that the Trump administration will accommodate crypto’s plea for official recognition as a store of value. The idea of Paul Atkins assuming the SEC chairperson has rekindled these hopes because he has been warm towards crypto, unlike his predecessor, Gary Gensler. During the US presidential election campaign, Trump floated the idea of establishing a national Bitcoin reserve. Such sentiments could mean that regulatory frameworks will favor crypto, even though some critics saw the promise of a Bitcoin reserve as a scam . Criminal activities might be on the rise with crypto going mainstream While everything looks exciting, cryptocurrency has a dark side that few people understand. Already, criminals, notorious Irish gangsters, Hamas, Russian arms dealers, and North Korean hackers have moved billions of dollars through stablecoins, including Tether. Trump’s victory has impacted Tether’s outlook so much. With the current state of Tether as the world’s favorite stablecoin and Trump as the president, Tether might present serious problems. The growth of Tether will leave it exposed and interconnected with Wall Street firms like Cantor, putting the broader financial system at risk in case of crypto crises. Also, a vibrant Tether would create an enabling environment for illegal activities, undermining the government’s ability to fight crime, counter terrorism, and enforce sanctions. The current happenings are breeding confidence in the crypto space. However, there is no legal foundation or documentation to enforce these brilliant moves. Therefore, it is very difficult to predict how Bitcoin’s future will look. Will crypto be a team player or an outlaw in 2025 and beyond? Crypto optimists, including Aaron Brown, have mixed feelings about crypto, although he holds that crypto will likely go mainstream in 2025. He analyzes the journey of cryptos from 2014 when many people thought Bitcoin and other altcoins would not survive and that blockchain technology would remain a minor innovation for a niche application. He further outlined how people believed crypto was here with us but wouldn’t deliver a social revolution like the internet did. In 2022, the discussion was if crypto could integrate existing financial regulations and markets or if it would operate similarly to the dark web. We all have the outcomes of the first two scenarios Aaron explored. The year 2025 will answer the third question. If President Trump walks the talk, the cold war between crypto innovators and governments may conclude. The scenario will allow capital to move freely between the traditional and crypto sectors, enhancing financial inclusion. Moreover, Bitcoin and other dominant altcoins may go mainstream. Should this happen, dubious projects and acts of shadowy groups of hackers, anarchists, and libertarians might remain, but the struggles with the law will be out of the equation. This would increase the value of Bitcoin and other respectable digital assets.

At today’s prices, that’s about $726 million worth of Bitcoin. The company says this is part of a calculated plan to generate yield and cover rising operating expenses. MARA’s Director of Investor Relations, Robert Samuels, shared that these loans are “short-term arrangements with well-established third parties,” but he didn’t name names. In its production update, MARA revealed it mined 9,457 BTC throughout 2024 and went shopping for an additional 22,065 BTC at an average price of $87,205. That’s nearly $2 billion spent on Bitcoin. As of press time, MARA held 44,893 BTC, valued at about $4.4 billion. Modest returns, bold strategy The company’s lending program isn’t pulling in massive profits yet. Samuels called the returns “a modest single-digit yield,” adding that MARA experimented with Bitcoin loans throughout 2024. “The long-term objective is to generate sufficient yield to offset operating expenses.” This approach is risky in a market still licking its wounds from the collapse of lenders like BlockFi, Genesis, Celsius, and Babel in 2022. Those meltdowns exposed just how dangerous counterparty risks can be, but MARA appears confident in its choice of partners. Despite the risks, MARA raked in $3.9 million in interest income during Q3 2024. Most of this came from cash on its balance sheet and Bitcoin loans. By mid-2024, the company had already generated $4.8 million in interest income, though earlier filings didn’t specify Bitcoin lending as part of the haul. MARA also broke the 50 exahash per second (EH/s) mark, ending the year with an energized hashrate of 53 EH/s. Though the realized hashrate—what’s actually contributing to the Bitcoin network—remained steady at 47 EH/s. That consistency didn’t go unnoticed in a year where Bitcoin miners faced halved block rewards following the April 2024 halving. Bitcoin miners break record as 2025 begins The Bitcoin mining industry has started 2025 with a bang. On January 3, the network’s total hashrate hit 1,000 exahashes per second (EH/s)—double the 510 EH/s recorded in January 2024. This comes despite the halving, which cut mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. It slashed miner revenues in half, but instead of slowing down, miners threw billions into better rigs and energy-saving systems to stay profitable. The investments are paying off. These massive upgrades are driving efficiency like never before, even as rewards dwindle. The result? Bitcoin’s mining infrastructure is now more powerful than ever, with miners proving they can adapt to anything the market throws at them. As Bitcoin prices soared past $108,000 in December, miners started exploring new ways to cash in. Securities lending is one of the hottest trends. Miners are lending Bitcoin to get shares in ETFs, which they then loan out for a profit. Then there’s high-performance computing (HPC). Companies like BitDigital and Terawulf are turning their mining operations into hubs for AI and HPC tasks, making the most of their energy setups. This is expected to rake in billions by 2027.

A portion of his post stated, “We’re going straight to Mars. The Moon is a distraction.” This post immediately received a lot of replies, including one from the former CEO of Binance, Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao. Elon Musk Triggers Prioritization Talk in Crypto For those in the crypto ecosystem, “moon” is synonymous with making huge profits and massive investments. This concept likely triggered Zhao to respond to Musk’s tweet. CZ pointed out that chasing price is a distraction. This statement echoes the Binance founder’s long-term stand on crypto enthusiasts changing their priorities. He is more concerned with getting these entities to focus on the big picture and develop products that make a difference. Zhao says this is more sustainable and creates value than chasing short-term market movements. There you have it. Elon just said price is a distraction. Keep building. 🤣 https://t.co/Ilf7Lq4V2h — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) January 5, 2025 Once crypto enthusiasts develop products that can sell themselves, a price increase is likely to follow naturally. CZ Bullish About 2025 Before this time, CZ had clearly stated that 2025 would be a “send it” year, aligning with his view of cycles in the cryptocurrency market. He believes recovery years and initial bear markets always come before bull market years. CZ, seeking a pardon from Donald Trump , has already categorized 2024 as a recovery year and 2025 as a bull market year. With this in mind, the focus should not be on prices and their pursuit of the “moon.” Bitcoin Price Dips In 24 Hours Meanwhile, the prices of quite several cryptocurrencies have been fluctuating sideways in the last few weeks. Some factors likely trigger this outlook. The firstborn digital asset, Bitcoin (BTC), trades at $98,320.19 after losing 0.4% of its price level within 24 hours. A few analysts believe there will be a further drop in the coming weeks. They warn that Bitcoin price may slump below $60,000 by January 20, during Donald Trump’s inauguration. There have been signs of incoming bearish sentiments, including the movement of over 33,000 BTC, worth $3.23 billion, to exchanges.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As the crypto market braces for a potential bull run in 2025, iDEGEN, PATRIOT, and Akuma Inu emerge as top altcoins to watch for explosive growth. The new year is just around the corner, and with it comes the prospect of the mother of all bull runs. Consequently, traders and speculators are falling over themselves trying to find the next big cryptocurrency to invest in before the bulls come a-knockin’. The trouble is that hunting for the next crypto to explode can often blow up in your face if you don’t research. And therein lies the rub—not everyone has the time to spend hours in the deepest, dankest corners of X or Discord searching for the next biggest crypto no one has heard of before. That’s where this guide comes in. We’ve researched the best crypto to invest in ahead of 2025, so you don’t have to. Without further ado, we’ve drilled it down to the top 3 monster tokens to watch next year. iDEGEN: The most intriguing AI crypto experiment takes flight PATRIOT: The best bet in the PolitiFi meme coin arena for 2025 Akuma Inu: Hard-charging new meme coin drawing a crowd Read on to discover why these three choice cuts are being tipped as the next big crypto gainers of the bull cycle. You might also like: Bitcoin or altcoins? Find out who will win the holiday season iDEGEN: The most intriguing AI crypto experiment takes flight The AI crypto sector was the hottest narrative to dominate 2023 and 2024 alongside meme coins. And as the year ends, the spotlight is circling back to AI with the rise of sector-adjacent tokens and memecoins like ai16z and Fartcoin going parabolic even as the wider market takes a breather. AI is where the smart money and the whales are at, and we’re not even remotely close to scratching the surface of the market’s vast moon potential. Unsurprisingly, the AI crypto space is home to a gold mine of tokens with the potential to dominate the discourse in 2025, and the best of the bunch hasn’t even hit the open market yet. We’re talking about iDEGEN . It’s conducting the most unhinged AI social experiment on X. iDEGEN has unleashed a witty, autonomous AI agent trained exclusively by prompts from the most far-out fringes of Crypto Twitter. It is creating the most based and red-pilled agent never before seen in the brief history of AI crypto. The result? An AI agent without politically correct programming, without corporate brainwashing, and without the baked-in woke mind virus most AI comes out of the box with. This agent trains its algorithms on the most brilliant, deranged takes this side of Crypto Twitter —posting an hourly stream of tweets, images, and, very soon, video content on social platforms. iDEGEN responds to every mention or interaction without any filters, constantly feeding itself with input from the best and brightest that Crypto Twitter has to offer. But X is just the beginning—iDEGEN is designed to create the most attention across numerous social channels—which is expected to translate into big-time gains for its native token IDGN in 2025. You’re still early for the moon mission, too. Currently available at just $0.0410, iDEGEN is still in its adaptive auction presale phase until it hits the open market in January. With its presale raising a sensational $8.6m so far, it’s all just a matter of time before IDGN goes parabolic. Visit the iDEGEN website to learn more. PATRIOT: The best bet in the PolitiFi meme coin arena for 2025 PolitiFi was another narrative that gained major traction earlier this year ahead of the US presidential elections in November. But soon after that, the circus appeared to have left town after Trump was elected. But lo and behold, one contender has emerged from the wreckage as the next big crypto in the PolitiFi meme coin arena with the launch of PATRIOT. Using the infinitely memeable Trump for its branding, PATRIOT has popped off on an 18x run since launching in November. Investors are betting on PATRIOT to pump in the weeks leading up to Trump’s inauguration in January, making it the best bet left on the PolitiFi board in 2024. Akuma Inu: Hard-charging new meme coin drawing a crowd Meme coins have always been and always will be the main draw to crypto. Like it or not, that’s just how it is. One of the best new meme coins, as the year ends, is Akuma Inu, a canine-themed meme coin launched on Base. Since launching, Akuma Inu has recorded a staggering 3,000% gain even as the market rests up for the next leg up in 2025. Akuma Inu has blown past a $120 million market cap as of press time—and given the fact that dog-themed meme coins continue to dominate the narrative, Akuma Inu has plenty of legroom to go on a big run next year.

Trump’s Pet Doge (TRUMDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Pet Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Pet Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Pet Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Pet Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Pet Doge by entering its contract address – 6e6jZxV1zG7GGLF5MoJZf8nY4u17x8dceDatSWiTE573 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 21:55:00

The recent leak from a Baidu Tieba forum post, a popular Chinese site shows the sides, the back, and a little bit of the front of the Joycon. New Joy-con Photos from Chinese SNS by u/SwordfishAgile3472 in NintendoSwitch2 The leak shows that new controllers still slot in as one does expect from Nintendo’s console. It looks like the console will stick with the genesis of the original Switch design. The Joycons themselves seem longer and bulkier though. This detail adds to what to expect from the upcoming console , implying the Switch 2 could be a larger device. Switch 2 Joycons reportedly have some new features stealing the spotlight Not surprising that it’s sticking with the hybrid format. Although the Joycons have some new features stealing the spotlight, revealing that these controllers have more than meets the eye. We have much clearer insights than earlier leaks. It features an optical sensor (mysterious in its purpose) and a reworked locking mechanism as one standout feature. Moreover, eagle-eyed fans noticed a serial number in the leaked photos. This detail could also reveal the leaker. However, the serial number doesn’t provide enough details about the product to indicate the images are real. These new controllers are considerably more robust than the original Joycons. Unlike some other pieces of joy tech, these seem to go straight into the console rather than sliding in, and a button near the shoulder button probably to release them. There is also another noticeable upgrade; the larger concealed buttons which allow for easier play with just one Joycon. Even though one can’t really see what the front of the Joycon looks like, these leaks seem to be very promising for the Switch 2, as they imply the controllers will get some big upgrades compared to their predecessor.

Freezing Criminal Assets “By working closely with authorities across jurisdictions, Tether has been instrumental in freezing criminal assets and ensuring that bad actors do not exploit stablecoins like USDT,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether. “Criminals now have 100 million reasons to think twice before using TRON,” said Justin Sun, founder of the Tron network , who added: “T3 FCU’s rapid success in freezing criminal assets sends an unmistakable message: if you’re using USDT on TRON for crime, you will be caught.” T3 Financial Crime Unit Marks Enforcement Victory: $100 Million in Criminal Assets Frozen Across Five Continents Read more: https://t.co/HReVLYRfxz — Tether (@Tether_to) January 2, 2025 The T3 Financial Crime Unit has already analyzed millions of transactions across five continents, monitoring over 3 billion in USDT volume, according to the announcement. Chris Janczewski, head of global investigations at TRM Labs, said surpassing 100 million USDT in frozen assets is just the beginning. “In 2025 and beyond, as more and more lawful users enter the growing crypto ecosystem, it is more important than ever to keep it safe. T3 is dedicated to that mission.” Are Tether’s EU Woes About to Deepen? Tether’s market capitalization has started to shrink for the first time since late 2022, having fallen by 3 billion USDT from its peak of around $140 billion in mid-December. The decline in supply may be due to deepening concerns in Europe as its restrictive Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations were activated, raising uncertainty about USDT’s status on exchanges in the bloc. The implementation of MiCA in Europe on Dec. 30 has created an uncertain future for stablecoin issuers such as Tether since the regulations do not clarify whether USDT is compliant. However, Ardoino dismissed the concerns as FUD earlier this week as the firm added $700 million worth of Bitcoin to its treasury. “Don’t believe the FUD,” he said before adding, “Competitors are just desperate to make you believe things that don’t exist.” The post Tether-Led Crime Unit Hits $100M Milestone in Global Crypto Asset Seizures appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Tether (USDT)|Tron,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-01-05 22:05:38

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rexas Finance (RXS) outpaces Solana and Ripple, offering a unique asset tokenization approach with a 490% presale surge, making it a standout investment opportunity. Forget Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) if you want a high-growth crypto investment this crypto cycle. Although both tokens have recently enjoyed small increases—SOL growing 7.38% over the past 60 days to $186.45 and XRP flying 321.98% to $2.17—they pale compared to the explosive ascent of Rexas Finance (RXS). With a 490% increase during its presale, RXS is emerging as the standout token of this cycle. It offers a realistic path to turning $450 into $45,000. A presale performance that commands attention Rexas Finance began its presale in early September 2024 at just $0.030 per token. Since then, it has climbed an astonishing 490% to $0.175 in its 11th presale stage, raising over $34,151,703 and selling 385,864,593 RXS tokens. This impressive growth translates to a 6x return for early investors and demonstrates the token’s strong bullish momentum. Market analysts project that RXS could rise 100x during the next bull cycle, reaching $17.50. If this prediction holds, an initial $450 investment today could transform into a staggering $45,000. Notable whale activity supports this promise; Ethereum and Solana’s investors are pouring money into RXS at its present price. This is not only conjecture. Rexas Finance is distinguished mainly by its dedication to security and openness. Certik has thoroughly audited the project, giving investors faith in its code and practices. Unlike many initiatives that depend on venture capital investment, Rexas Finance has taken a community-centric approach, drawing individual investors who share its vision. This choice guarantees that the initiative stays aligned with its long-term plan of transforming asset tokenization. Already having listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, Rexas Finance has established itself. These systems increase the token’s legitimacy by offering real-time tracking and comprehensive analytics, enhancing its visibility. These listings provide a consistent supply of information for investors so they may decide on RXS with knowledge.

The competition promises 20 lucky winners $50,000 worth of RXS tokens, each with 681,868 entries thus far. Tasks on the Rexas Finance website and campaign sharing will help participants raise their chances of winning. This endeavor benefits society and emphasizes its dedication to diversity and expansion. Why Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) can’t compete Although Solana and Ripple are making news, RXS’s exponential expansion has been the star of recent performance. Though spectacular in isolation, Solana’s 7.38% increase and Ripple’s 321.98% leap fall short of the 490% rally seen in RXS. Furthermore, neither SOL nor XRP presents the revolutionary idea of actual asset tokenization that Rexas Finance proposes. Investors are noting RXS’s unique value proposition. A well-known Ethereum whale recently disclosed plans to purchase RXS for $0.175 and cited its potential to grow 100x in the next cycle. This assurance from high-net-worth investors confirms the coin’s potential for growth even more. Rexas Finance is mainly based on its capacity to tokenize actual assets. Whether it’s fractional ownership of real estate, money, or fine art, the platform lets anyone easily buy, sell, or exchange physical objects. The ramifications are significant since it creates investment prospects that were once only accessible to a few people. The platform’s support of several token standards—including ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155—guarantees the blockchain ecosystem’s flexibility and interoperability. Thanks to this capacity, Rexas Finance links conventional finance with blockchain technology. Conclusion: the time to invest is now Rexas Finance (RXS) is a transforming enterprise that can upend sectors valued in trillions of dollars, not simply another coin. With its outstanding presale performance, Certik audit, and emphasis on actual asset tokenization, RXS presents an intriguing investment possibility. Although some would find Solana and Ripple appealing, they lack the explosive innovation and expansion that RXS offers. RXS is the token to watch for anybody wishing to turn $450,000 into $45,000, as RXS could rise 100x from its current price of $0.175, which shows massive bullish momentum. Invest in the RXS presale right now to seize the opportunity to be part of this innovative project and set yourself up for lifetime-transforming results.

Here’s a simple breakdown of why these coins are worth watching. Let's dive in! 1. Altura ($ALU): The #1 Coin of AI and Gaming Altura ($ALU) has quickly gained attention as a game-changer in the gaming and NFT space. The platform enables developers to mint, distribute, and update smart NFTs seamlessly, opening the door to innovative in-game assets. With the gaming industry projected to hit $300 billion by 2025, Altura’s potential is immense. Its strong partnerships with gaming studios and recent updates to its platform make it a top contender for exponential growth.Why Watch? Altura is the #1 leader in integrating AI into gaming. As both the AI and gaming industries grow, Altura’s market cap is projected to reach between $1-3 billion or more, potentially resulting in significant price increases of over 1000%. With its innovative technology and expanding influence, $ALU stands out as a must-watch altcoin. 2. Dogecoin ($DOGE): The Original Meme Coin Dogecoin remains a popular choice among crypto enthusiasts, thanks to its active community and ongoing mainstream adoption. With consistent mentions by high-profile figures like Elon Musk and new use cases emerging, Dogecoin has maintained its relevance in the crypto market.Why Watch? As Trump won the election, Elon Musk has become close friends with him and has consistently been promoting Dogecoin. There are rumors of $DOGE becoming an official payment method for the X (Twitter) platform, which could drive significant utility and create a pro-crypto environment due to Trump's influence. Despite its playful origins, $DOGE continues to be a serious contender in the altcoin market. Its accessibility and active development make it a strong pick for those looking for a low-cost investment. 3. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): The ""Dogecoin Killer"" Shiba Inu has made waves in the crypto space as a strong competitor to Dogecoin. With a robust ecosystem that includes ShibaSwap, NFTs, and its growing Shibarium blockchain, $SHIB is more than just a meme coin. The project’s commitment to community and innovation keeps it in the spotlight.Why Watch? Because Shiba Inu launched their own network and still maintains one of the greatest hypes in the meme coin world since 2021, $SHIB continues to make a buzz. Its strong community and ongoing developments keep it at the forefront of the meme coin space, offering significant growth potential. 4. Bonk ($BONK): Solana’s Top Meme Coin $BONK has emerged as the leading meme coin on the Solana blockchain, a network celebrated for its scalability and lightning-fast transaction speeds. With Solana’s market cap surpassing $100 billion, $BONK is well-positioned to capture a substantial portion of this ecosystem.Why Watch? If $BONK captures just 10% of Solana’s market cap, it could see a 5x increase from its current levels. As the Solana ecosystem expands, $BONK has the potential to become a dominant player in the meme coin category. 5. Brett ($BRETT): A New Coin with Big Dreams Brett ($BRETT) is a newer cryptocurrency that’s catching people’s attention. It’s often referred to as the ""best friend of Pepe"" and is one of the top meme coins on the Base chain. Brett has a playful and relatable brand that draws in the meme-loving crypto crowd.Why Watch? If the Base chain continues to grow and attract more users, interest in Brett could skyrocket. With more people using the Base chain, Brett’s popularity and value might increase significantly, making it a serious contender to hit $1. Conclusion: Altura Leads the Pack While all five altcoins have the potential to deliver impressive returns, Altura ($ALU) stands out as the most promising pick. Its innovative approach to integrating AI into gaming and NFTs sets it apart, offering long-term growth potential. That said, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Bonk, and Brett are also worth keeping an eye on as they ride the wave of increasing crypto adoption. Diversifying your portfolio with these altcoins under $1 could be a winning strategy this month. Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

Here’s Your Second Shot With BTFD Coin!,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-out-on-the-cat-in-a-dogs-world-craze-heres-your-second-shot-with-btfd-coin/,"Cryptocurrencies—once a niche fascination for tech geeks—are now a global sensation. Everyone, from college kids to Wall Street hotshots, is trying to ride the crypto wave. Among them, meme coins have carved out a wild, unpredictable, and ridiculously profitable niche. Remember Dogecoin’s meteoric rise? Or Shiba Inu’s life-changing gains? Yeah, we all know someone who “got in early” and is now lounging on a beach somewhere, sipping margaritas. For the rest of us who missed the boat, it’s easy to feel like the party’s over. But here’s the kicker: the meme coin scene is just getting started. Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD) . This fresh contender is shaking up the game in ways even the OGs didn’t. BTFD isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a full-blown movement. With its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, sky-high staking rewards, and a fiercely loyal “Bulls Squad,” BTFD is setting the stage for meme coin 2.0. So, if you’re hunting for the best meme coin presale to join this month, keep reading. This might be your shot to turn FOMO into pure joy. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Meme Coin with Serious Game (Literally) BTFD Coin isn’t just cashing in on the meme coin hype; it’s redefining it. For starters, its P2E game is a massive hit. Think of it like Fortnite meets crypto: you battle it out, level up, and earn real rewards in $BTFD tokens. Whether you’re gaming on your phone during a lunch break or grinding all weekend, you’re stacking crypto while having fun. How’s that for multitasking? And then there’s the staking. Let’s get real: who doesn’t want to earn passive income? With a jaw-dropping APY that’s turning heads across the crypto world, staking BTFD is like planting money trees in your backyard. You park your coins, let the Bulls Squad do their thing, and watch your stash grow. Speaking of the Bulls Squad, this community is next-level. Over 4,700 holders strong and counting, these are die-hard believers in BTFD’s vision. Whether it’s hyping the coin on social media or diving into strategy chats, they’re all in—and it shows. Now let’s talk numbers, because we all know numbers don’t lie. BTFD’s presale is on fire. Starting at a humble $0.000004 per coin, it’s already climbed to $0.000142 in Stage 13. Over $4.9 million has been raised so far, with $1 million pouring in within just 10 days of launch. That’s the kind of momentum meme coin dreams are made of. To put it in perspective, if you dropped $15,000 during Stage 5 at $0.00005 per coin, you’d have snagged 300 million BTFD tokens. When the price hits $0.0006 at the end of the presale? You’re looking at $180,000. Yup, six figures. How’s that for ROI? With analysts predicting an even brighter future for BTFD, the buzz is real. The presale is already in full swing, so if you’ve got “get in early” on your 2024 bingo card, now’s the time. Sign up, secure your spot, and join the Bulls Squad—before it’s too late. Cat in a Dog’s World: The Underdog (or Should We Say, Undercat?) While BTFD is stealing the spotlight, Cat in a Dog’s World is carving out its own niche—and doing it with some serious style. Imagine the ultimate underdog story: a feisty feline taking on the big dogs (literally). This coin’s charm lies in its quirky narrative and tight-knit community that’s as loyal as it is creative. Cat in a Dog’s World operates on the idea that you don’t have to be a top dog to dominate. Its focus on utility-driven growth sets it apart from meme coins that rely purely on hype. The team is working on integrating their coin into NFT marketplaces and Metaverse projects, creating a use case that’s both innovative and practical. And while they’re keeping specifics under wraps, early adopters are buzzing about a possible NFT launch that could make their coin even more valuable. Price-wise, Cat in a Dog’s World is in its infancy, which means it’s dirt cheap to get in. But don’t let that fool you. Analysts predict a strong upward trajectory as the project develops and gains traction in the crypto community. For those who missed out on Dogecoin and Shiba Inu when they were fractions of a cent, this could be your chance to get in on the ground floor of the next big thing. Still, let’s be honest: it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. Unlike BTFD’s fully fleshed-out ecosystem, Cat in a Dog’s World is more speculative at this stage. But hey, high risk, high reward, right? If you’ve got a soft spot for scrappy projects with big dreams, this one’s worth keeping on your radar. Seamless BIG50 Activation Access the Presale Page now.

As the best crypto to buy now for 100x returns, Web3Bay offers a strong combination of secure data handling, versatile token advantages, and a visionary plan for growth. Here’s an in-depth review of why Web3Bay is a sound investment choice. Securing Data Privacy with Decentralized Storage In today’s digital world, data privacy is crucial, especially on e-commerce platforms where users’ sensitive information is involved. Web3Bay tackles this by incorporating the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) into its structure. IPFS uses a decentralized storage method, spreading data across various nodes to boost security and dependability. With IPFS, Web3Bay ensures that user data is protected against the vulnerabilities and failures common in centralized systems. Every transaction, be it a purchase or token exchange, is securely logged and stored, keeping personal details private. This method not only protects data but also supports blockchain’s values of openness and user control. For both buyers and sellers, this decentralized method offers assurance. Customers can shop without fear of their data being stolen or misused, while sellers face lower risks of data breaches, which can be expensive and harm their reputation. Moreover, Web3Bay’s use of IPFS puts users in control of their data, significantly reducing unauthorized access. As global concern about digital privacy grows, Web3Bay stands out as a dependable platform for secure online shopping. Enhancing Value with 3BAY Token Utility The 3BAY token is central to improving the user experience and boosting engagement on Web3Bay. More than just a currency, the token opens doors to unique benefits and rewards. Owning 3BAY tokens gets you a 5% discount on all Web3Bay transactions, promoting token use over traditional payment methods and integrating users into the platform’s expanding community. From daily purchases to exclusive sales, this discount offers real savings for active participants. The token presale is in its third phase, priced at $0.0039675, with over $320,000 raised so far. Its target launch price is $0.1959, giving early investors a potential for substantial gains. 3BAY tokens also provide governance rights, allowing holders to vote on important platform decisions, from new features to policy updates, creating a strong sense of community and ownership. Additionally, community involvement is rewarded. Users can gain extra tokens through staking, promotions, or contributing to the platform’s growth, fostering an environment where community participation brings tangible benefits. The token’s value is also supported by a deflationary model, with periodic token burns to ensure scarcity, aligning with long-term investment benefits as demand increases. Charting the Future: Web3Bay’s Strategic Growth Plan Web3Bay is dedicated to sustainable growth through a strategic plan that consistently enriches its ecosystem and enhances user engagement. At the heart of this strategy are advanced blockchain technologies poised to revolutionize decentralized e-commerce. A key upcoming feature is the integration of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), which will allow trading of unique items like art and collectibles, expanding Web3Bay’s market reach. This move not only capitalizes on the burgeoning NFT market but also opens new opportunities for creators and merchants globally. Web3Bay is also set to expand into decentralized finance (DeFi), enabling services such as loans, savings, and staking directly on its platform. This integration aims to provide a comprehensive environment for users to manage both their commercial and financial activities effortlessly. Further, Web3Bay will support interoperability with leading blockchains like Ethereum and BNB Chain, facilitating seamless transactions across different networks and encouraging wider user adoption. Plans are also underway to develop user-friendly mobile apps and integrate conventional payment options alongside cryptocurrencies, making the platform accessible to a broader audience and bridging the divide between blockchain enthusiasts and the general public. Wrapping Up: Why Web3Bay is Best Crypto to Buy for Massive Returns Web3Bay distinguishes itself in the crypto presale market with its strong emphasis on data privacy, beneficial token utility, and innovative expansion plans. It integrates IPFS technology to ensure top-tier data security, crucial for e-commerce integrity. Additionally, the versatile 3BAY token enhances user value through discounts, governance participation, and various rewards, appealing to both platform users and investors. The platform’s ambitious growth roadmap further establishes its prominence. By integrating NFTs, DeFi capabilities, and cross-chain functionality, Web3Bay shows its commitment to maintaining a cutting-edge position in blockchain technology. For investors searching for crypto with significant growth potential, Web3Bay represents an appealing option. With major advancements anticipated and a clear vision for development, Web3Bay combines utility, security, and expansive future prospects.

Pepe the Boss (PEPEBOSS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEBOSS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe the Boss can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe the Boss could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe the Boss launched with over $8,500 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe the Boss on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe the Boss by entering its contract address – 5pgsjH712NZ6eaKunsEfZarG9UotHaxvheW5E39a8NFX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEBOSS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 23:24:00

Multiple media outlets and social media users have raged after a “Polish tourist” posted a report and a video appearing to show that ASIC Bitcoin (BTC) miners are operating in rural parts of Abkhazia. These reports come just days after Russia began providing Abkhazia with “humanitarian supplies” of electricity. Abkhazia: Crypto Mining Crisis The Caucasus-based de facto state is closely allied with Moscow and is considered a breakaway Georgian republic by most Western and Western-aligned nations. The “tourist” testified: “Entire villages are humming; mountains and caves are buzzing [with the sound of ASIC mining rigs]. Cables carrying free electricity are stretching out into the forests. And the forests are also buzzing, too.” Russia is moving to restrict online images and maps showing one of the country’s oil refineries in an effort to protect the crucial infrastructure from Ukrainian drone attacks https://t.co/5s7BL0kQxh — Bloomberg (@business) January 3, 2025 The “tourist” also posted a video entitled “the sound of ASIC rigs over Abkhazia.” This video captures what appears to be the sound of whirring fans outdoors in a rural Abkhazian settlement. A journalist for the Russian media outlet Noviye Izvestia wrote: “Mining equipment in this backward, half-ruined country is installed in villages, mountains, forests, and caves.” The article was titled: “‘Thank you, Russia!’ The Illegal Miners of Abkhazia are Burning up our Free Electricity.” On Telegram, the popular Russian blogger Sergei Kolyasnikov mused: “Look at this video! Can you imagine how many devices need to be operating to make so much noise? And each ASIC rig uses 3.5 kW of power. It seems that Abkhazia has become a Russian crypto mining offshore.” Russia declared a regional state of emergency in Crimea, as workers cleared tons of contaminated sand on either side of the Kerch Strait following an oil spill in the Black Sea https://t.co/1HPbw3wMA5 pic.twitter.com/G11wVr10Zb — Reuters (@Reuters) January 5, 2025 ‘Crypto Miners to Blame’ as Rolling Blackouts Return in Abkhazia Timur Dzhindzholiya, the head of the Abkhazia power provider Chernomorenergo, said last month that illegal miners are using up “about 350 million kWh” per year . Despite the influx of Russian power, Chernomorenergo has been forced to act, turning off power supplies for a fixed period every day. The power grid, the firm claimed, cannot cope with “excessive loads.” It claims that “the main reason for” these loads “is illegal mining.” The Ministry of Finance of Abkhazia has claimed that it expects to receive over five billion rubles (over $45 million) worth of aid from Russia in 2025. China has allowed companies to send items with both civilian and military applications to Russia – while also claiming to want to help bring peace to Ukraine.

In my native Sverdlovsk Oblast, we will pay between 12.6% to 19.5% more for energy this year.” Russian blogger Sergei Kolyasnikov Crypto mining-related controversies have led to public violence at the highest level. Last month, media outlets reported an Abkhazian lawmaker was shot dead during a parliamentary debate on banning crypto mining. In previous years, Abkhazian communities have taken action, forcibly expelling suspected crypto miners to leave their villages. The de facto state endured a torrid end to 2024, with its only power station – which is only partially located in Abkhazia – shutting down on December 11. The Enguri Hydroelectric Power Station. (Source: Paata Vardanashvili [CC BY 2.0]) Activities at the Enguri Hydroelectric Power station were paused “due to critically low water levels” in one of its main reservoirs. The day prior, the government forced internet providers to cut the entire de facto state’s internet access for seven hours . The republic has also seen relations with Moscow deteriorate after politicians voted against agreeing on a new investment deal with Russia. Moscow responded by cutting its funding to the de facto state. In recent days, however, the Abkhazian government has moved to repair its relationship with Russia. Its President claimed he would “try to strengthen relations with” Moscow. “We very much appreciate Russia’s constant support in overcoming the energy crisis that Abkhazia is experiencing.

Normally, the chart is released before the firm purchases new Bitcoin the next day. Thus, analysts are predicting MicroStrategy will make another Bitcoin purchase on Monday. Saylor did similar before a recent BTC acquisition Michael Saylor, co-founder of Microstrategy, posted the firm’s Bitcoin Tracker chart on December 29. The next day, the company made another Bitcoin acquisition. MicroStrategy bought 2138 BTC all on Dec 30, spending about $97,837 on each coin. On January 5, Saylor shared a similar chart tracking all of Microstategy BTC purchases. Given its history, analysts now believe the firm is ready to make another BTC acquisition, particularly on January 6. MicroStrategy’s 21/21 plan also adds to analysts’ expectations since the company will invest about $42 billion in its Bitcoin acquisitions, using $21 billion in equity and $21 billion in fixed-income securities. The company even requested its shareholders to raise the authorized shares of preferred stock from 5 million to over 1 billion. Similarly, it is requesting an expansion of its Class A common stock authorization from 330 million to 10.3 billion shares. Moreover, MicroStrategy has disclosed its intention to pursue a $2 billion perpetual preferred stock offering. This raise initiative, separate from the firm’s 21/21 Bitcoin financing strategy, is projected for Q1 2025, contingent on internal approval. Some believe MicroStrategy will slow down on its Bitcoin purchases in 2025 BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes expects the crypto market to fall, especially after President Donald Trump’s pending inauguration. Hayes’ early investment fund, Maelstrom, claimed it would make future crypto purchases at lower prices, suggesting the fund is waiting for crypto prices to drop. However, with a projected market slowdown in January 2025, analysts believe MicroStrategy will pause its BTC acquisitions, which could affect the firm’s shares and convertible bonds distribution. Michael Saylor, however, advocated for the company to acquire Bitcoin during peak prices in early December. He said: I’m sure that I will be buying Bitcoin at $1 million a coin—probably $1 billion dollars a day of Bitcoin at $1 million a coin. ~ Michael Saylor This, however, means that Microstartegy might still make more BTC purchases, especially if its trading prices decline.

On Dec. 25, 2024, in Karachi, Pakistan, seven suspects—including an officer from the Counter-Terrorism Department—were taken into custody on suspicion of participating in the kidnapping of a cryptocurrency trader and demanding a ransom of $340,000. While confirming that one CTD officer had been arrested, Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon stated that attempts were still underway to capture another police officer implicated in the crime. The victim, 30-year-old Mohammed Arsalan, was kidnapped from Manghopir, a well-known neighborhood in the northwestern part of Karachi. According to Arsalan, the abductors forced him to transfer $340,000 from his Binance account to several wallets they controlled before releasing him hours later near the Quaid-e-Azam mausoleum. You might also like: Pakistan proposes new crypto framework to central bank rules Arsalan later shared additional details on Facebook, but independent sources largely unverified his claims, including the specific amount transferred and the exact sequence of events. He claimed that $277,000 of the stolen amount was transferred to a specific wallet through decentralized exchanges before being moved off-chain to Binance . Arsalan Malik’s Post | Source: Facebook While Arsalan assured the public that law enforcement was actively working to trace the transactions and identify the individuals behind the wallets, experts have pointed out the challenges of tracking funds through decentralized finance systems, where anonymity is often a core feature. Arsalan also posted a screenshot of his Binance withdrawal history on Facebook , showing multiple forced transfers in various cryptocurrencies, including significant amounts in USDT and other tokens, totaling over $340,000. Although screenshots can provide useful evidence, investigators must authenticate this data to fully corroborate his account. The suspects, identified as Mohammed Rizwan Shah, Tariq Hasan Shah alias Amir, Muzamil Raza, Umer Jilani, Umer Irshad, Noman Riffat, and Haris alias Ashar, were apprehended by the Anti-Violence Crime Cell. According to a statement by AVCC officials, the team, led by SSP Aneel Haider Minhas, conducted multiple operations throughout Karachi to capture the suspects. However, details about the exact timeline of their arrests and the evidence linking each suspect to the crime remain unclear. The AVCC described the arrested individuals as habitual offenders who had been jailed for similar crimes in the past, but public records or court documents to substantiate this characterization were not immediately available. Arsalan’s account of the lead-up to his abduction also raises some unanswered questions. Weeks before the incident, he claimed that a man named Hamid approached him to purchase US dollars. Despite Arsalan’s refusal, Hamid persisted and eventually set up a meeting with Arsalan’s friend Zohaib. On Dec. 24, 2024, three men, including Muzamil and Hammad, visited Arsalan’s office and invited him to a restaurant where other suspects joined them. It remains unclear why Arsalan agreed to meet with individuals he was reportedly suspicious of or whether any measures were taken to verify their identities. Such details could be critical in understanding whether this was a premeditated targeting of Arsalan or an opportunistic crime. Later that night, Arsalan said he was abducted by a group of armed men in an unmarked police vehicle. They gagged him with a cloth and detained him near the Saddar FIA office. There, they allegedly forced him to unlock his Binance account and transfer his money to multiple wallets. After resetting his phone, they released him near a local point of attraction, known as Quaid-e-Azam Mausoleum at 4 a.m. The choice of location for his release and the precise steps taken to reset his phone suggest a level of planning and technological know-how among the kidnappers. In an interview with Dawn , IGP Memon called it a singular instance of misconduct by individual officers and stressed that the police force does not tolerate unlawful activities. However, his remarks have been met with skepticism, given the significant role that rogue officers allegedly played in the crime. Critics argue that a more transparent internal investigation is required to restore public confidence in law enforcement. Arsalan, in a Facebook post , expressed his devastation over the loss of his hard-earned money. He condemned those accusing him of fabricating the incident, stating that the DIG was personally supervising the investigation. He also clarified that no investors or relatives were implicated in the case and vowed to repay any losses incurred by others. Arsalan promised not to spare any of the culprits responsible for orchestrating the crime. Arsalan Malik’s Post | Source: Facebook Although individuals impacted may find some solace in Arsalan’s promises, his assertion that he will reimburse losses may raise questions about his post-theft financial status and whether more investigation into his business activities is necessary. Additionally, making such assurances could unintentionally divert attention from holding the offenders accountable. Serious questions have been raised by the occurrence regarding the security of cryptocurrency traders in Pakistan as well as the abuse of authority by law authorities. The region’s increasing use of cryptocurrencies exposes traders to these types of crimes due to a lack of governmental control and education on the security of digital assets. According to observers, this case might act as a wake-up call for more robust legislative measures and a thorough examination of Pakistan’s legal framework’s protections for digital assets.

Elon Loves MAGA (ELOMAGA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Loves MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Loves MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Loves MAGA launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Loves MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Loves MAGA by entering its contract address – 6mRLPcgWXUBYNfXouCxBoyjFzNjww9HNVFpBJkrqmFeE – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Inmortal tells his 222,400 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks Ethereum is gearing up for rallies this quarter. The trader believes that ETH is about to follow in the footsteps of its Q1 2024 price action. “ETH about to have a good Q1.”‘ Source: Inmortal/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that ETH will hit a new all-time high of $5,300 by March. At time of writing, ETH is worth $3,646. He also thinks old altcoins and artificial intelligence (AI)-focused projects will ignite rallies in the next three months. “In Q1: 1. ETH outperforms. 2. SOL go +$300 3. AI coins mega-pump 4. Memes underperform 5. Dino coins have a good run.” While the analyst believes memecoins will not see huge rallies in Q1 of this year, he says that Floki ( FLOKI ) will be an exception. “High conviction on the memecoin leader. FLOKI.” Source: Inmortal/X Based on the trader’s chart, he appears to suggest that FLOKI is mirroring Pepe’s ( PEPE ) late 2023 to early 2024 price action when the Ethereum-based memecoin went parabolic after months of sideways movement. The trader seems to predict that FLOKI will hit a new all-time high of $0.0005 before the end of Q1. At time of writing, FLOKI is trading at $0.00019.

The CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, Hunter Horsley, has suggested that the economic policies of the Trump administration could have a major impact on the cryptocurrency sector. In a recent tweet, Horsley noted that the potential deregulation of mergers and acquisitions could allow major companies like Google or Amazon to expand even further through strategic acquisitions. M&As refer to the consolidation of companies, either through the merging of businesses or the purchase of one company by another. This process often helps corporations achieve economies of scale, expand market share, or acquire critical assets. Trump administration may unfreeze M&A. Large corporates — mag 7, etc — may finally be able to wield their market cap. Amazon could buy Instacart. Google could buy Uber. etc etc The big may get bigger, and the middle may shrink. If that happens, I think it will accelerate… — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) January 5, 2025 Horsley argued that this concentration of power could drive the adoption of decentralized systems, aligning with the core tenet of cryptocurrency: the skepticism toward centralized organizations. He believes that as large corporations gain more control, the demand for cryptocurrencies—designed to offer an alternative to such institutions—could grow. Corporate behemoths like Google and Amazon are becoming increasingly interested in blockchain technology and digital assets as they look for ways to enter the crypto markets. One example of a blockchain-related service that Amazon Web Services has introduced is Amazon Managed Blockchain , which enables companies to create and oversee scalable blockchain networks. With this action, Amazon establishes itself as a major force in the expanding enterprise blockchain market. By establishing strategic alliances with prominent blockchain initiatives and participating in campaigns to incorporate blockchain technology into its cloud infrastructure, Google has also increased its presence in the cryptocurrency sector. Blockchain-as-a-service is now available on Google Cloud , allowing companies to create and implement decentralized apps. These initiatives demonstrate how major companies are using blockchain technology to diversify their business models while leveraging traditional M&As to expand their reach, thereby further driving the adoption of decentralized systems.

Trump’s victory has been welcomed by many in the cryptocurrency industry, given his pro-business stance and policies that are seen as supportive of digital assets and blockchain technology. These policies have fueled a bullish trend in the market, with experts attributing much of the surge to a more favorable regulatory approach under Trump’s administration. Since Trump’s election win, the cryptocurrency market has seen notable growth, with the biggest example being Bitcoin which surged from approximately $69,000 on Nov. 8, 2024, to over $100,000 in early December.

Experts also believe this rise is driven by the political shift and the potential loosening of regulations, which may create a more favorable environment for digital assets. Horsley is the CEO of Bitwise , an investment firm that has exclusively focused on cryptocurrency investments for the past seven years. The company offers a range of products including crypto-focused funds, ETFs, and others, designed to provide investors exposure to the crypto and Web3 markets. According to Horsley, the influence of major market players—along with regulatory changes—could shape the future of both digital assets and traditional financial systems in 2025, making this an exciting time for both M&A activity and the cryptocurrency sector.

Sebagai pemimpin koin meme, DOGE saat ini menguji resistensi kritis di sekitar level $0,40, yang dapat menjadi penentu langkah selanjutnya. Analis ternama Bluntz baru-baru ini membagikan analisis yang mendalam, menekankan bahwa Dogecoin sedang berada dalam fase akumulasi strategis. Menurut Bluntz, fase ini menjadi dasar untuk lonjakan agresif di siklus selanjutnya, yang berpotensi memberikan keuntungan signifikan bagi DOGE. Fase akumulasi seperti ini sering kali menjadi pertanda pergerakan naik yang eksplosif, terutama untuk aset dengan dukungan komunitas yang kuat seperti Dogecoin. Hari-hari mendatang akan menjadi penentu bagi DOGE dalam usahanya menembus level resistensi $0,40. Jika DOGE berhasil melakukan breakout, ini dapat memicu rally bullish yang memperkuat posisinya sebagai favorit pasar. Sebaliknya, kegagalan untuk menembus zona ini dapat menyebabkan konsolidasi jangka pendek, yang akan menunda lonjakan yang diantisipasi. Dogecoin Menyiapkan Rally Dogecoin menunjukkan aksi harga bullish yang kuat sejak awal November, melawan volatilitas pasar dan menarik perhatian investor. Meskipun sempat mengalami koreksi, harga DOGE berhasil pulih, menandakan potensi pertumbuhan lebih lanjut di masa depan. Bluntz baru-baru ini membagikan analisis teknis di X (platform media sosial) , yang menunjukkan fase akumulasi pada rasio DOGE/BTC. Menurutnya, rasio ini “masih dalam fase akumulasi,” mengindikasikan bahwa Dogecoin sedang mempersiapkan rally signifikan dalam siklus ini. Bluntz dengan percaya diri menyatakan bahwa tidak ada kemungkinan DOGE gagal melonjak selama bull run kali ini, mencerminkan pandangannya yang optimis terhadap koin meme ini. Meskipun prospek Dogecoin terlihat menjanjikan, risiko tetap ada. Volatilitas adalah karakteristik utama pasar kripto, dan Dogecoin tidak terkecuali. Selain itu, lanskap ekonomi global yang lebih luas juga menambah ketidakpastian, dengan kenaikan suku bunga, inflasi, dan tekanan ekonomi global memengaruhi sentimen investor. Faktor-faktor ini dapat menyebabkan fluktuasi harga yang tajam bagi DOGE. Bagi investor jangka panjang, fase akumulasi Dogecoin saat ini mungkin menjadi peluang untuk masuk ke pasar sebelum breakout potensial terjadi. Namun, pendekatan yang hati-hati dan manajemen risiko tetap sangat penting, terutama mengingat sifat pasar kripto yang tidak terduga serta dinamika ekonomi global. Jika Dogecoin berhasil melewati level resistensi kunci, ini dapat memvalidasi tesis bullish Bluntz dan memperkuat statusnya sebagai salah satu performer terbaik di siklus ini. Harga dalam Konsolidasi Saat ini, Dogecoin diperdagangkan pada $0,38 setelah menghadapi resistensi di level $0,40. Level ini untuk sementara menghentikan momentum kenaikan DOGE, menempatkan harga dalam fase konsolidasi. Fase perdagangan sideways seperti ini bukanlah hal yang langka dan dapat berlangsung selama beberapa hari atau bahkan minggu saat pasar mengumpulkan kekuatan untuk pergerakan berikutnya. Meskipun ada jeda, optimisme tetap tinggi di kalangan investor dan analis. Level $0,43 kini muncul sebagai resistensi kritis bagi DOGE. Jika berhasil melakukan breakout yang bersih di atas level ini, momentum bullish yang diperbarui dapat mendorong Dogecoin ke level tertinggi dalam beberapa tahun terakhir atau bahkan mencetak all-time high baru. Pencapaian ini kemungkinan besar akan menarik perhatian baru dari investor ritel maupun institusi, yang selanjutnya mendukung pergerakan naiknya. Namun, jalur ke depan tidak tanpa tantangan. Sentimen pasar dan tren kripto yang lebih luas akan memainkan peran signifikan dalam menentukan apakah Dogecoin dapat mengumpulkan kekuatan untuk bergerak lebih tinggi. Jika fase konsolidasi disertai dengan peningkatan volume perdagangan dan dukungan pembelian yang kuat, skenario breakout menjadi semakin mungkin terjadi.",Dogecoin,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-06 01:13:18

With Bitcoin and Ethereum continuing to dominate headlines, forward-looking investors are hunting for hidden gems that promise substantial returns. Among these opportunities is Qubetics ($TICS), an ecosystem poised to revolutionise Web3 infrastructure with innovation and unmatched functionality. Alongside industry giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, this best altcoin for exponential returns stands out as a smart pick for savvy investors. 1. Qubetics: The Ultimate Web3 Platform for the Best Altcoin for Exponential Returns Qubetics ($TICS) is redefining the Web3 landscape with its forward-thinking features, particularly its decentralised VPN (dVPN). Unlike centralised VPNs that can track, restrict, or censor user traffic, Qubetics introduces a fully peer-to-peer network. This blockchain-based solution ensures users’ unmatched privacy, security, and freedom globally. The decentralised architecture eliminates any central authority, offering complete censorship resistance and transparency. Using blockchain technology, Qubetics dVPN guarantees secure, anonymous internet access with multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption. Users also benefit through tokenised incentives, as participants providing bandwidth are rewarded with TICS tokens. This dynamic creates an efficient, user-driven marketplace while enhancing accessibility and privacy. Currently in Presale Phase 15, Qubetics is setting the stage for massive gains. With weekly phases bringing a 10% price hike and a final-stage increase of 20%, early adopters can lock in substantial profits. The $TICS token is priced at just $0.0414, with over $8.7M raised, more than 399M tokens sold, and 13,300+ holders already on board. Analysts predict a target of $0.25 per token post-presale, presenting an impressive ROI potential of 503% for investors entering now. Some forecasts even suggest Qubetics could soar to $10–$15 after the mainnet launch, highlighting its status as one of the best altcoins for exponential returns . 2. Bitcoin: The Undisputed King of Crypto Bitcoin needs no introduction. As the original cryptocurrency, it revolutionised digital finance and earned the title of “digital gold.” Bitcoin’s decentralised network and fixed supply of 21 million coins continue to make it the go-to asset for institutional and retail investors. With growing adoption as both a store of value and an inflation hedge, Bitcoin remains the benchmark for stability and trust in the volatile crypto market. Bitcoin made this list because it continues to lead the way in market dominance and institutional confidence. 3. Ethereum: The Foundation of Decentralised Applications Ethereum stands at the heart of decentralised finance (DeFi) and smart contracts. Its robust ecosystem enables developers to build decentralised applications (dApps), NFTs, and protocols that shape the Web3 future. With the recent shift to Ethereum 2.0 and its proof-of-stake consensus, the network now offers greater energy efficiency and scalability. Ethereum’s versatility and functionality fuel innovation across multiple sectors, making it a key player in crypto. Ethereum earned its place here because its infrastructure powers blockchain technology’s most innovative use cases. Conclusion: Best Cryptos for Exponential Returns Are Here Based on the latest research, the best cryptos for exponential returns include Qubetics ($TICS), Bitcoin, and Ethereum. Among these, Qubetics leads the charge with its innovative decentralised VPN service and unmatched presale opportunity. With the presale phase nearing a 10% price hike and an ROI potential of 503%, investors have a rare chance to enter at the ground level before exponential growth.

Trump’s Pet Doge (TRUMDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Pet Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Pet Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Pet Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Pet Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Pet Doge by entering its contract address – 6e6jZxV1zG7GGLF5MoJZf8nY4u17x8dceDatSWiTE573 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-06 02:22:00

With names as quirky as their concepts, these coins have become a cultural phenomenon, captivating Gen Z and Millennials alike. Today, we’re diving into three standout projects: BTFD Coin, Cat in a Dog’s World, and Dogs. These coins are not just about laughs; they’re serious about giving you solid returns. Before we get into the details, let’s rewind to 1973—a year when the global economy experienced a major collapse. What did smart investors do? They bought the dips, turning chaos into opportunity. Sound familiar? Let’s talk about why meme coins could be your golden ticket this week. Best new meme coins to join this week have redefined what it means to invest in crypto. They started as a joke but quickly morphed into legitimate assets with massive communities. The likes of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu paved the way, but now BTFD Coin is setting a new standard. With its P2E (Play-to-Earn) game, referral program, staking rewards, and strong community backing, BTFD Coin isn’t just another coin; it’s a movement. Let’s explore why it’s topping the charts and how it compares to Cat in a Dog’s World and Dogs. BTFD Coin: The Bull’s Charge to Glory BTFD Coin has exploded onto the crypto scene, raising over $4.9 million in its presale. Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, it’s now in Stage 13 of its 16-stage presale, priced at $0.000142. By the time it’s listed at $0.0006, early investors are looking at life-changing gains. To put it into perspective, investing $2,000 at the price of $0.000142 would get you 14.08 million BTFD coins . When the price hits $0.0006 at the end of the presale, your investment would soar to $8,448 . That’s the kind of return you can’t ignore! The coin’s appeal isn’t just its numbers. It’s backed by a robust ecosystem, including a P2E game that keeps players engaged while earning rewards. The referral program adds another layer of excitement, incentivising users to spread the word. And let’s not forget the staking rewards, offering a passive income stream for holders. What truly sets BTFD Coin apart is its community. Over 7,700 Bulls are already on board, creating a buzz that’s hard to ignore. Analysts are predicting big things for BTFD, and with its current momentum, it’s shaping up to be one of the best new meme coins to join this week. Oh, and don’t miss the BIG50 bonus code. Use it on the presale page to snag the bonused price. Simply head to the presale page, connect your wallet, enter the bonus code, and confirm your purchase. It’s as simple as that. Cat in a Dog’s World: The Underdog with Nine Lives Cat in a Dog’s World is the rebel of the meme coin universe. It flips the script by putting a cat at the centre of a dog-dominated market. Its tagline? “A cat that barks louder than dogs.” This project is as quirky as it sounds, but don’t let the humour fool you—it’s got some serious potential. The coin has garnered a dedicated community that thrives on its cheeky branding and unique tokenomics. Cat in a Dog’s World focuses heavily on social engagement, making it a hit among Gen Z. It’s not just about memes; the project plans to launch Cat NFTs and a DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation) to give holders a say in its future direction. Financially, it’s still in its early stages, making it a high-risk, high-reward option. Unlike BTFD Coin, it doesn’t have a P2E game or staking rewards yet, but its roadmap promises some exciting developments. If you’re looking for a project with a rebellious spirit and the potential to disrupt the market, Cat in a Dog’s World might just be the best new meme coin to join this week. Dogs: The OG Meme Coin with a Twist Dogs is a nostalgic nod to the early days of meme coins, but with a modern twist. It’s built on the premise that every dog has its day, and for Dogs, that day is now. With a focus on charity, Dogs aims to give back while making you rich. A portion of every transaction goes to animal shelters, making it a feel-good investment. The project has already made waves with its transparent team and clear roadmap. It’s not just about charity; Dogs also features a staking program and plans to launch a P2E game. However, it’s worth noting that its ROI potential doesn’t quite match BTFD Coin’s explosive numbers. That said, Dogs is a solid pick for those who value community and sustainability. Why Now Is the Time to Invest The 1973 economic collapse taught us a valuable lesson: in times of uncertainty, buying the dips can yield incredible rewards. Meme coins are the modern-day equivalent of that strategy. They’re not just investments; they’re cultural movements with the power to create generational wealth. BTFD Coin’s presale performance is a testament to this. With over 58 billion coins sold and a community that’s growing by the day, it’s a prime example of why meme coins are the best new meme coins to join this week. And don’t forget, the BIG50 bonus code is your ticket to maximising returns. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale Ready to dive in? Here’s how: Go to the Presale Page at https://www.btfd.io/buy-now/. Click “Connect Wallet” and select your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Enter the Bonus Code BIG50 and click “Apply.” Input the amount of $BTFD you want to buy and review the bonus coins.

From Bitcoin smashing new highs to altcoins carving out unique niches, it’s a whirlwind of opportunity. But for those looking to make smart short-term investments, understanding which coins are hot right now is key. The best coins to invest in for short term are often the ones riding waves of innovation and adoption. Enter Qubetics ($TICS), a revolutionary Layer 1 blockchain that’s turning heads with its focus on real-world asset tokenisation. It’s bringing an entirely new dimension to the blockchain space by making tokenisation accessible to everyone, not just the elite. Let’s explore how Qubetics, along with Polkadot, Ripple, Ethereum, and Solana, are redefining short-term crypto investments. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Democratising Real-World Asset Tokenisation Qubetics is making waves in the crypto community, and its presale numbers speak for themselves. In its 15th stage, the presale has already raised over $8.7 million from more than 13,300 holders. With 399 million tokens sold and a price tag of $0.0414, the presale is nearing a 10% price jump as it moves to the 14th stage this weekend. Investors are catching on quickly to what makes Qubetics unique. At its core, Qubetics is about solving the big issues that have held blockchain back. While other projects focus on single-use cases, Qubetics is creating a broad ecosystem centred on interoperability and real-world applications. It’s not just about holding a token; it’s about owning a piece of the future. Real-World Asset Tokenisation: A Game-Changer Picture this: you’ve always wanted to invest in high-end real estate or art, but those opportunities were reserved for the wealthy. With Qubetics’ tokenisation marketplace, everyday investors can own fractional shares of these assets. A single parent saving for their child’s college tuition could buy a share of a tokenised real estate property. A small business owner could diversify their investments by purchasing fractionalised shares in fine art or vintage cars. Qubetics isn’t just about making these opportunities accessible; it’s about ensuring transparency and security. The marketplace uses blockchain to verify ownership, reducing fraud and eliminating intermediaries. Whether you’re a tech-savvy millennial or someone dipping a toe into crypto for the first time, Qubetics makes it simple. Why did this coin make it to this list? Qubetics is revolutionising the way we think about investments, bringing opportunities that were once exclusive to high-net-worth individuals to the masses. Its presale success and innovative approach make it one of the best coins to invest in for short term. 2. Polkadot (DOT): The Interoperability Leader Polkadot has been busy expanding its ecosystem, and the results are showing. Its parachain auctions have attracted significant interest, enabling new projects to launch on its network. The ability to connect blockchains seamlessly has made Polkadot a favourite for developers and investors alike. Market Performance and Short-Term Potential With DOT trading around $4.80, it’s seen steady growth driven by developer activity and ecosystem expansion. As new parachains go live, the demand for DOT as a staking and governance token is expected to rise, presenting a solid short-term investment opportunity. Why did this coin make it to this list? Polkadot’s focus on interoperability and its thriving developer community position it as a top pick for short-term gains. 3. Ripple (XRP): The Cross-Border Payments Pioneer Ripple continues to dominate the cross-border payments space, and recent developments are only bolstering its position. With its RLUSD stablecoin gaining regulatory approval and partnerships with major financial institutions, XRP’s ecosystem is stronger than ever. Market Performance and Growth XRP is currently trading at $2.40, following a 400% increase in recent weeks.

Pepe the Boss (PEPEBOSS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEBOSS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe the Boss can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe the Boss could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe the Boss launched with over $8,500 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe the Boss on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe the Boss by entering its contract address – 5pgsjH712NZ6eaKunsEfZarG9UotHaxvheW5E39a8NFX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEBOSS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-06 03:50:00

The island plans to use these digital cards, which will be linked to NFTs, to provide discounts and travel subsidies to visitors. The island has been trying to leverage crypto-powered growth since 2018 but has faced challenges due to South Korea’s strict regulations on ICOs and NFTs. However, Jeju officials are now pushing for change. As reported by Maeil Kyungja, the initiative is aimed at appealing to the Millennial and Gen Z demographics, encouraging them to explore Jeju and increase the likelihood of return visits. The NFT cards will be issued in the second half of this year, with a pilot program for domestic visitors set to begin later in 2025. Additionally, the region plans to integrate its NFT project with the local blockchain-based stablecoin, Tamna Jeon, which was introduced in 2019 to support the local economy. The stablecoin is already used for rechargeable prepaid cards offering incentives to both merchants and customers. Jeju Island plans to offer domestic tourists digital tourism resident cards, which will provide various benefits such as travel subsidies, memberships, and discounts on local attractions. The travel subsidies will be paid in the island’s local currency. The Jeju Island Governor Oh Young-hoon had previously said, “This year, we are gradually making preparations to focus on digital transformation. The core of all this is Web3. We can apply Web3, including the use of NFTs, to all areas of the government.

According to a recent Bloomberg report , Diggle said in a phone interview that fundraising could begin as soon as the first quarter. His previous firm, Artradis, made a staggering $3 billion during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Today, Diggle sees market risk levels not seen since 2008 and is putting himself in a position to capitalize on coming opportunities in potentially volatile times. The former hedge fund manager rode the turbulence of one of the most turbulent market periods in history to wealth, and he thinks there’s a repeat brewing. Steve Diggle’s former firm is worth nearly $5 billion Making his most significant move since shutting down his former firm, Artradis Fund Management, in March 2011, Steve Diggle is coming back to volatility trading in a big way. In 2008, when Artradis was still in Singapore, the company was nearly worth $5 billion thanks to winnings it made when betting on market crashes and banking problems. However, the firm struggled in the end, as an unprecedented turn in central bank intervention shifted market dynamics. Diggle sees similarities with the pre-crisis ­years, 2005–2007. The number of fault lines is higher, and the chance of something going wrong is way higher,” but risk prices have dropped,” he said. He believes years of easy monetary policy have resulted in a brittle market landscape, but now the market is effective for a sudden wave of volatility.

Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin are gaining momentum, but Rollblock is stealing the spotlight as a rising GambleFi powerhouse. Table of Contents Ethereum tokens being accumulated in vast numbers Solana ETF looks like a lock Dogecoin rises 12% as whales return Rollblock puts power back in the hands of gamers Conclusion 2025 brings the promise of huge gains across the crypto board. Analysts remain unswervingly bullish on the prospects of Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin heading into the new year as these projects look primed to dominate the entire crypto space in the coming months. Now is the time to accumulate before the huge surge expected later this year. Ethereum tokens being accumulated in vast numbers The price of Ethereum has gained 8% in the last 7 days as it now sits above $3.6k. ETH bulls recently made an attempt to break the critical $4k level, but Ethereum sellers stepped in to take profits in this area. It has emerged that Ethereum whales have been accumulating behind the scenes as wallets that hold at least 100,000 tokens now make up more than 57% of the total Ethereum supply. This accumulation could see Ethereum reach $8-10k during 2025. Solana ETF looks like a lock Solana is another promising layer 1 chain that has shown increasing strength in recent days. Solana has been one of the best-performing coins in the crypto top 10 lately, with a 14% rally in the last 7 days sending Solana back above $200, where it currently sits at $216. The odds of a Solana spot ETF are looking better by the day thanks to the incoming crypto-friendly administration and a change of leadership at the SEC. The crypto betting site Polymarket currently has the odds of this being approved in 2025 at around 85%, suggesting that Solana could soon see a dedicated Wall Street fund. This could send Solana flying to $500 within weeks. Dogecoin rises 12% as whales return The price of Dogecoin rose by a whopping 12% in the last 24 hours, bringing the weekly Dogecoin candle to a mighty 21%. Dogecoin is now trading at $0.38, following increased whale activity on-chain. Transactions worth more than $100,000 on the Dogecoin chain are currently valued at over $23 billion. This suggests that Dogecoin whales are bullish on Dogecoin’s prospects looking forward, with many in the space suggesting that Dogecoin to $1 is inevitable and will merely mark the start of a coming monster rally that could take Dogecoin all the way to $10 this cycle.

Rollblock recently celebrated over 40,000 presale registrations , as more than $8 million has poured into this blockchain-backed betting powerhouse. The bullish momentum and community sentiment have been nothing short of staggering in the last few months as Rollblock has staked its claim as a leading force in bringing trust and transparency back to this industry where it rightfully belongs. The Rollblock platform is already fully live and bringing in masses of revenue, as over 7,000 casino games are proving exceptionally popular with its gamers. A sports betting league has also recently launched, creating a chance to place live bets across thousands of international sporting events, from golf to soccer and Formula One racing. The list goes on. The RBLK token is popular for good reason as regular token buybacks will ensure a diminishing supply. Each week the casino will take a portion of its profits to buy up RBLK, of which 60% will be destroyed immediately and the rest allocated to stakers who can earn a generous yield. Conclusion Rollblock will likely outperform the likes of Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin with its exponential growth curve and unrivaled GambleFi offering. Stage 9 RBLK tokens are available at the discount price of $0.0445, but investors should hurry as they are selling out fast. To learn more about Rollblock, visit the website and socials.

As the sector moves into the new year, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse believes this could mark a transformative period for digital assets. In a recent statement, Garlinghouse emphasized the growing momentum within the industry, stating , “The journey is just beginning.” He pointed to the start of the 119th U.S. Congress, which he described as the “most pro-crypto Congress in history.” His remarks underscore the industry’s anticipation of meaningful progress in regulatory clarity during the year ahead. Today, here in the US, we welcomed the 119th Congress—better known as the most pro-crypto Congress in history. The journey is just beginning, but you can’t deny the energy & excitement already building across the industry. Let’s get to work. — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 3, 2025 Anticipation of Regulatory Changes Garlinghouse’s comments come at a time of significant change for the regulatory landscape in the United States. The impending departure of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler and the appointment of a new AI and crypto czar have fueled expectations that 2025 could usher in a new chapter for the crypto sector. Many within the industry view these changes as an opportunity to address long-standing uncertainties around digital assets. The Ripple CEO’s statements echo the sentiment of many stakeholders who believe the groundwork has been laid for substantial advancements. With the U.S. now positioned to adopt clearer regulatory frameworks, the stage is set for increased investment, innovation, and adoption of cryptocurrencies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Performance Reflects Optimism The renewed optimism is mirrored in the performance of major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin recently surged past $98,000, reflecting a strong start to the year. Similarly, XRP , one of the leading digital assets, has risen by over 13% since the beginning of the year. These gains highlight growing investor confidence, supported by the perception of a more stable regulatory environment. Garlinghouse’s call to action—“Let’s get to work”—serves as a rallying point for the crypto community to capitalize on these developments. By fostering collaboration and advocating for clear and consistent policies, industry participants aim to solidify the role of digital assets in the broader financial ecosystem. A Year of Potential As the 119th Congress begins its term, many consider it a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. The Congress is described as the most crypto-friendly legislative body in U.S. history. The Congress is expected to address critical issues such as regulatory clarity, investor protections, and the integration of blockchain technology into traditional financial systems. Garlinghouse’s optimistic outlook aligns with the industry’s collective sentiment that 2025 could be a defining year. By seizing this opportunity, the crypto community aims to advance the development and adoption of digital assets while ensuring compliance with emerging regulations.

Top Analysts Make Predictions On Remittix",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ethereum-eth-chainlink-link-or-remittix-top-analysts-make-predictions-on-remittix/,"The crypto market is brewing with innovation, and with every new cycle, investors monitor projects with unmatched growth potential. As a clear indicator, 2024 ended with Ethereum reclaiming its title as the undisputed king of smart contracts after it rallied above 4,000 on two separate occasions. On the other hand, Chainlink dominated the decentralized oracle space and edged all its holders in green. This time, analysts are shifting their focus to Remittix, a fresh presale token making waves in the PayFi sector. Remittix offers what crypto traders have been craving: fast and seamless cross-border payment and instantaneous FIAT transactions. With this unique use case, Remittix is cementing its stance as the best crypto to buy now amid the proven track records of Ethereum and Chainlink. Why Remittix’s crypto presale is the most promising amid crypto giants With its PayFi solutions, Remittix is fast becoming the next crypto to explode in 2025—and this shouldn’t come as a surprise. Remittix is making its mark in the cross-border payment industry, expected to reach $250 trillion in 2027. It does this by granting users access to a platform that allows seamless cross-border payments. The Remittix platform acts as a bridge that facilitates international payments. With this innovation, users can receive and send 50+ crypto pairs, including ETH and LINK, which they can instantly convert into over 30 fiat currencies. This makes Remittix the perfect platform for businesses looking to begin accepting crypto as a payment method. But it doesn’t end there; Remittix enables its users to easily exchange many cryptocurrencies for any popular fiat currency and transfer the funds to bank accounts globally. This new method of transacting eliminates the time, high charges, and complications characteristic of most cross-border transactions. Ethereum price surge to continue after ETF boom and US Election Aftermath Since the US election, investor confidence in risk assets like Ethereum has surged. This trend is partly fueled by expectations of a more favorable regulatory environment. Although Bitcoin led the surge with its monumental all-time high prices, the price of Ethereum has been climbing steadily. Despite its recent 4% decline on the daily chart, analysts believe Ethereum is among the best crypto to buy now in anticipation of a rally in 2025. They believe the Ethereum price has the potential to surge 37%, with technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and moving averages suggesting strong bullish momentum ahead. Positive developments to fuel the LINK price above $30 The LINK price experienced a shift in Q4 2024 after consolidating within a falling wedge pattern since March. Amid this recovery, Donald Trump’s World Liberty Finance has bought LINK tokens worth over $2.3m due to speculation about the Blackrock partnership. While this trend makes LINK one of the best crypto to buy now, caution still looms, and investors are turning to projects with higher upside potential. Conclusion Ethereum and Chainlink have impressed with their previous market performance. However, this time, analysts are turning heads to Remittix, whose unmatched use case could see it rival crypto giants. Currently, Remittix is available at $0.0185 and is quickly cementing itself as an investors’ best bet for massive gains in 2025 making now the best time to take action before it is too late!

In 2025, this meme coin frenzy is only set to heat up, with new and exciting projects springing to life. While the market may be volatile, savvy investors see it as a golden opportunity to get in on the ground floor of the next big thing.

BTFD Coin (BTFD) BTFD Coin has quickly emerged as one of the most exciting meme coins in the market. Launching with an incredibly low presale price of $0.000004 per coin, BTFD Coin has skyrocketed to a current price of $0.000142 during Stage 13 of its presale. In fact, it raised over $4.9 million in a matter of weeks and has already sold over 62 billion coins. The presale journey isn’t over yet, with 16 stages planned, meaning there’s still a chance to get in early before it hits the exchange at $0.0006. What makes BTFD Coin stand out from the crowd is its exciting features like the Play-to-Earn (P2E) game and staking rewards. The BTFD Play 2 Earn game is designed to give holders a chance to earn rewards while having fun. By participating in the game, players can stake their coins and earn additional tokens, building their portfolios while enjoying the process. The staking feature offers impressive APYs, providing a passive income stream that can really pay off in the long run. Why did this coin make it to this list?

Non-Playable Coin (NPC) Non-Playable Coin (NPC) has carved out a niche for itself by targeting the gaming community. As the name suggests, this coin is all about the world of video games, and it’s got the hype to back it up. NPC aims to bridge the gap between in-game assets and cryptocurrency, allowing players to monetise their gaming experiences. Whether you’re grinding in your favourite RPG or enjoying an intense battle royale, NPC is looking to make your in-game achievements truly valuable. The real draw to NPC is its community-driven model.

This level of interaction is appealing to gamers who want to earn while they play. Furthermore, with gaming on the rise as a mainstream entertainment avenue, the demand for coins that facilitate in-game economies is only going to increase. Why did this coin make it to this list?

Named after the Japanese city of Osaka, this coin taps into the global fascination with Japanese pop culture and technology. The protocol focuses on integrating blockchain with real-world applications, aiming to create a more inclusive and decentralised economy. One of Osaka Protocol’s most exciting features is its potential for real-world use.

COQ Inu (COQ) COQ Inu is another meme coin that’s gaining traction with its quirky name and lively community. This coin plays on the humour and fun associated with meme coins but also integrates a solid roadmap for growth. COQ Inu has focused on community engagement, offering rewards and incentives for holders who actively participate in the coin’s development. While COQ Inu may seem like just another meme coin at first glance, its team is serious about building something sustainable. The project has plans to launch a series of NFT collaborations and a series of utility-based applications for its token. This approach sets COQ Inu apart from other meme coins that only rely on hype without a clear roadmap for the future. Why did this coin make it to this list? COQ Inu made the list because of its community-first approach and its focus on long-term sustainability. While it’s still in the early stages, its roadmap is filled with exciting initiatives that could drive demand for the coin. If these plans come to fruition, COQ Inu could easily be one of the most promising meme coins of 2025. 5. Cheems (CHEEMS) Cheems has quickly become one of the most well-known meme coins in the crypto world, thanks to its adorable Shiba Inu mascot and playful vibe. Originally a joke based on the Cheems meme, the coin has grown into a full-fledged community with a strong following. What makes Cheems unique is its ability to combine light-hearted fun with serious community building.

While MicroStrategy hints at another significant Bitcoin acquisition as part of its ambitious 21/21 plan, Japan-based Metaplanet is setting its sights on growing its Bitcoin holdings more than fivefold. These moves come amid bullish market predictions that could see Bitcoin's price soar past $200,000. Metaplanet Eyes Massive Bitcoin Expansion Amid Bullish Market Predictions for 2025 Metaplanet , the Japan-based venture capital firm, has announced ambitious plans to significantly expand its Bitcoin holdings in 2025, aiming to more than quintuple its current stash to 10,000 BTC. This bold move comes amid growing optimism in the cryptocurrency market, with analysts projecting Bitcoin could reach or surpass $200,000 by the end of the year. Metaplanet emerged as a major player in the Bitcoin ecosystem in 2024, emulating MicroStrategy’s pioneering Bitcoin investment strategy. Currently, the firm holds 1,762 Bitcoin, worth approximately $173.4 million, accumulated over 19 purchases. These acquisitions have positioned Metaplanet as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder in Asia and the 15th largest globally among publicly listed companies, according to BitcoinTreasuries data . In a Jan. 5 post on X, Simon Gerovich, CEO of Metaplanet, outlined the firm’s vision for 2025, and said that its aim this year is to increase its holdings to 10,000 BTC “by utilizing the most accretive capital market tools available to us.” Metaplanet’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy aligns with the optimistic outlook from prominent asset managers such as VanEck and Bitwise. Both firms forecast Bitcoin could surge to $180,000–$200,000 in 2025, driven by a mix of institutional adoption, increasing scarcity, and favorable geopolitical trends. The potential for a US strategic Bitcoin reserve, possibly under a crypto-friendly Trump administration, could further fuel this growth. Speaking at Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin New Year’s Eve party in Florida, Gerovich suggested such a move could trigger a global domino effect. “Countries around the world will follow,” he said. “Japan is one of those countries where they do look to the US as their big brother, following their footsteps, so if President Trump does adopt it as a strategic reserve, then Japan and many other countries in Asia will do the same.” Metaplanet’s Bitcoin holdings increased significantly in 2024, a year when Bitcoin appreciated by roughly 120%. The firm’s most substantial acquisition came on Dec. 23, when it purchased 619.7 BTC—representing over 35% of its total holdings. This strategic buy coincided with a 27.5% increase in Metaplanet’s share price since it began its Bitcoin investment journey on April 23, with an average purchase price of $77,196 per Bitcoin. To achieve its ambitious 2025 goal, Metaplanet plans to employ a combination of financial instruments, including loans, equity, and convertible bonds. This multi-pronged approach is part of the firm’s commitment to scaling its Bitcoin holdings while maintaining financial flexibility. Adding to the optimism, Metaplanet projected an operating profit for the fiscal year ending Dec. 31, 2024, marking its first profitable year since 2017. Bitcoin’s Role in Japan and Beyond Gerovich is a vocal advocate for Bitcoin’s transformative potential, particularly in Japan, a country with a strong regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. He sees Bitcoin not just as an investment but as a tool to foster innovation and economic resilience. With Japan poised to follow global trends, the potential adoption of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset could further solidify the country’s position as a leader in digital currency innovation. Metaplanet’s ambitious plans to expand its Bitcoin holdings to 10,000 BTC suggest a growing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term value. As the firm leverages innovative financial tools to scale its investments, it also aims to champion Bitcoin adoption in Japan and beyond. With analysts forecasting a historic bull run and potential geopolitical shifts favoring Bitcoin, Metaplanet’s bold strategy could position it as a key player in the next wave of cryptocurrency adoption. MicroStrategy Prepares for Bold Bitcoin Expansion with 21/21 Plan MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor has sparked excitement among Bitcoin enthusiasts once again, hinting at an imminent Bitcoin acquisition in a cryptic post on Jan. 5. Sharing a Bitcoin price chart from the SaylorTracker website, Saylor's comment, ”Something about SaylorTracker.com is not quite right,” suggests that the tech entrepreneur and his company are gearing up for another significant Bitcoin purchase. This subtle clue comes as MicroStrategy aggressively pursues its ambitious 21/21 plan—a groundbreaking initiative to secure $42 billion worth of Bitcoin by issuing $21 billion in equity and $21 billion in fixed-income securities. Saylor’s recent post follows a familiar pattern. On Dec. 29, 2024, he shared the same chart, only for MicroStrategy to announce a purchase of 2,138 BTC at an average price of $97,837 per coin the following day. This purchase brought the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to new heights, reinforcing its position as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally. The company’s consistent Bitcoin accumulation strategy is indicative of its unwavering belief in the cryptocurrency’s potential as a long-term store of value and a hedge against inflation. As part of its 21/21 plan, MicroStrategy aims to amass unprecedented Bitcoin reserves, setting a new standard for corporate cryptocurrency adoption. MicroStrategy’s recent addition to the Nasdaq 100 index, achieved on Dec. 23, 2024, marks a significant milestone. The inclusion of the company in this prestigious index introduces traditional investors to indirect exposure to Bitcoin through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other financial instruments tracking the index. Capitalizing on this momentum, MicroStrategy held a special shareholder meeting to discuss increasing its stock issuance. In a Dec. 23 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company proposed increasing authorized Class A common stock from 330 million to 10.3 billion shares. Additionally, it sought approval to raise authorized preferred shares from 5 million to over 1 billion. On Jan. 4, MicroStrategy also announced plans to issue a $2 billion perpetual preferred stock offering. The offering, designed to attract institutional investors, would hold seniority over Class A common stock in bankruptcy scenarios and take priority in financial distributions during corporate liquidation. The offering is expected to be finalized in Q1 2025, pending shareholder approval. MicroStrategy’s 21/21 plan represents one of the most ambitious cryptocurrency strategies ever undertaken by a publicly listed company. By aligning its financial strategy with Bitcoin’s growth trajectory, the company aims to redefine corporate treasury management while solidifying Bitcoin as a mainstream asset class. The plan’s scale and timing coincide with optimistic predictions for Bitcoin’s price. Analysts foresee Bitcoin surpassing $200,000 in 2025, bolstered by increasing institutional adoption, scarcity-driven price dynamics, and geopolitical trends favoring digital assets. Saylor’s vision goes beyond MicroStrategy’s bottom line. In previous statements, he has floated the idea of a US crypto framework anchored by an $81 trillion Bitcoin reserve plan, positioning Bitcoin as a strategic asset for national economies. MicroStrategy’s Impact on Bitcoin Adoption MicroStrategy’s bold moves have ripple effects far beyond its corporate treasury. The company’s strategy has inspired other firms to consider Bitcoin as a core component of their financial strategies, much like Saylor’s efforts encouraged a wave of institutional adoption in 2020. Moreover, MicroStrategy’s Nasdaq 100 inclusion introduces Bitcoin to a broader audience, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Investors holding ETFs tracking the index indirectly participate in Bitcoin’s performance, further embedding the cryptocurrency in mainstream financial markets. Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy continue to push the boundaries of corporate Bitcoin adoption. From their ambitious 21/21 plan to innovative financing strategies like the perpetual preferred stock offering, the company is not only doubling down on Bitcoin but also reshaping the narrative around corporate treasury management. As the world watches for the next Bitcoin purchase, MicroStrategy’s unwavering conviction serves as a testament to Bitcoin’s transformative potential. If successful, the company’s vision could inspire a new era of Bitcoin-backed corporate strategies, solidifying its legacy as a pioneer in the digital asset revolution.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-06 05:30:00

As reported by BizWatch today, the rebranding is interpreted as a major strategic change. Apart from the name, the focus has changed to investment operations, forming a new entity within Bithumb. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Bithumb rebranded and injected another 1 billion KRW or 6,80,099 USD, bringing the total capital for the subsidiary under 100% ownership of Bithumb to around 2 million dollars. In 2023, previous investors in Bithumb Meta-such as LG CNS, CJ OliveNetworks, and SK Square-have now officially departed, given that the subsidiary did not live up to its expectations from NFT and metaverse projects.

This is in contrast to Bithumb Investment, which mostly engages in external investments. Moreover, Bithumb has historically invested in convertible bond investments in KOSDAQ -listed companies Iwin, Barunson, and T&R Biofab. For the time being, Bithumb Partners is looking to continue overseeing existing short-term stationary investments in addition to potentially extending into a full-fledged strategic or financial investor. There was a common sentiment among industry experts regarding Bithumb Partners, and the intended ‘spinoff’ Bithumb has been reported in the first half of 2023. There was a vision to set up an investment company used for holding operations to manage investments and real estate through leasing. Nevertheless, Bithumb Partners is the brainchild of the previous vision but takes on a more streamlined process than the initial plan. “We restructured Bithumb Meta into Bithumb Partners to streamline operations and focus on managing assets like stocks and bonds, as well as short-term financial investments. Creating a new entity from scratch and liquidating the old one would have been time-intensive.” Bithumb spokesperson. You might also like: South Korea plans to explore crypto ETFs and let firms launch security tokens in 2025 Bithumb’s IPO positioning This development coincides with an announcement made by Bithumb that it intends to undertake an IPO in 2025. Forming an investment-centric subsidiary will likely fall under a wider optimization effort of its corporate structure and financial works toward the planned IPO. Some of them said your company reorganized Bithumb Meta into Bithumb Partners to streamline operations more easily and focus on asset management related to stocks and bonds and short-term financial investments. Creating a new asset from scratch and liquidating the old one would take way too long. This follows in parallel with Bithumb’s proposal and announcement to go for an initial public offering in the United States by 2025. Forming an investment-focused subsidiary forms such a great effort to put corporate structure and operations into order before the IPO itself.

Meanwhile, traders will look at key U.S. economic reports this week for more information on what it means for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. According to a Reuters report , the Chinese yuan, on the other hand, was in the spotlight after weakening past the critical 7.3 per USD mark in the onshore market on Friday. It was the first time in 14 months that the PBOC had worked hard to keep its level flat throughout December. The onshore yuan fell 0.05% by Monday, while the offshore yuan rose 0.15% to 7.3487 per dollar. Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank (NAB), said, “The PBOC seems to have stopped defending the 7.30 level.” He added, “This raises questions about whether they are now letting the dollar-yuan pair move into a higher range, which could impact other Asian currencies, as well as the Australian and New Zealand dollars.” The PBOC set the midpoint rate, at which it trades with banks, ahead of the market’s opening on Monday at 7.1876 yuan per USD, within the 2% range.

This figure increased to 31.61% from 2023 which shows that there are still lingering threats in the cryptos space. This week’s crypto hack report will present the key events of the week, known phishing cases, and a look at the year 2025. 2024’s Surge in Crypto Hacks: $2.36 Billion in Losses As for 2024, crypto was a new favourite among hackers, who began attacking this industry more actively than ever before. CertiK’s annual report showed that there were 760 breaches and as a result led to the industry losing nearly $ 2.36 billion. The attacks also became more frequent and aggressive, even though all types were significantly differed; nonetheless, the phishing attack turned out to be the most numerous and profitable for the cybercriminals because the stolen funds reached $1.05 billion. Phishing; The Most Used Attack Vector Phishing attacks were still the most commonly used tactics in 2024 accounting for 40% of the crypto stolen. With 296 instances of the phishing attack , the average sum lost per case amounted to $2.8 million. This has made phishing, one of the most deadly threats in the crypto space which rose by 328% between 2023 and 2024. While traditional fraud is already a big problem, phishing is even worse because of the non-reversible nature of the crypto transactions. Wazirx and Coindcx: Possible Takeover as Litigations Emerge The CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta has been dropping hints about an acquisition at least in a bid to recover users who had been scammed in the WazirX incident. Statements of Gupta on Twitter show that general security troubles have been present in the Indian crypto sphere since hacks like this have occurred and big personas can have a big impact with their moves. Scammers Turn To YouTube to Scam Minor Thieves Some fake users posing to be innocent expose their wallets containing thousands of dollars on YouTube comments and then they make the victim pay a couple of dollars as a gas fee. This particular scam utilises multi-signature wallets in order to further their fraudulent activities and pull off a theft. A typical case of thieving the thieves. Superchain Ecosystem Twitter Hack: Phishing Links Spread The official Twitter account for the Superchain Ecosystem was compromised, with the hackers spammed with links that were designed to steal users’ information. For the account, Superchain had to regain the account and users were warned not to click the links posted by the hackers. Of course, there have been unprecedented cyber catastrophes that occurred in the year 2024, but the world of cryptocurrencies is changing all the time. We step into the year 2025 with the hope of better security for our cryptos and better space for investments. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Elon Loves MAGA (ELOMAGA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Loves MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Loves MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Loves MAGA launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Loves MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Loves MAGA by entering its contract address – 6mRLPcgWXUBYNfXouCxBoyjFzNjww9HNVFpBJkrqmFeE – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELOMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-06 05:40:27

Investors banking on a year-end boost to their portfolios got nothing but coal this time. U.S. markets made a small comeback on Friday—the S&P 500 rose 1.26%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite surged 1.77%. Not bad, right? Except it actually didn’t matter. These gains barely dented the damage left behind by earlier selloffs. The S&P 500 fell 0.48% for the week, the Dow dropped 0.60%, and the Nasdaq slid 0.51%. The Santa Rally refers to stocks rising during the last five trading days of the year and the first two of the new year. It’s like an annual tradition—only last year, Santa skipped Wall Street, even after a historic performance. Bitcoin rallies a bit, thanks to big money But Bitcoin bulls seem to be coming back. The apex crypto was worth $99,285 at press time, after weeks of whiplash-inducing volatility. After Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $108,850 on December 17, a series of Fed-driven selloffs dragged it down. The central bank made a hawkish rate cut and added to the fire by saying it has no desire to associate with Bitcoin ever. But as the calendar flipped to 2025, traders got optimistic again. Retail investors are piling back in, driving up prices. Analysts have made so many bold predictions. Some say Bitcoin will smash $150,000 by the end of Q2 2025. Some are expecting prices to at least double to $200,000 before the year is over. January Effect: The markets’ second chance With the Santa Rally gone, the January Effect seems primed. Sidney Wachtel, an investment banker, first spotted this anomaly in 1942. He noticed that small-cap stocks tend to outperform in January. Why? Smaller stocks usually see less trading action, but when investors start fresh in the new year, these stocks get a boost. Research backs it up. A 1976 study found that, from 1904 to 1976, January returns averaged 3.5%, compared to just 0.5% for other months. From the mid-1980s to the 2000s, the Russell 2000 Index—your go-to for small-cap performance—averaged a 1.7% gain in January. That’s second only to December. But don’t get too excited. Since 2014, January’s gains have slowed to a measly 0.1%. What’s behind the January Effect? Tax-loss harvesting is one theory. Investors sell losing stocks in December to offset gains, then reinvest in January. Another theory? New Year’s resolutions. People decide to “get their finances in order” and shuffle their portfolios. And then there’s the cash influx. Year-end bonuses mean more money to invest, and a lot of it goes into small-cap stocks. Now stocks and crypto are like dance partners, especially after last year. They practically move together now. When stocks rise, crypto tends to follow. That makes the January Effect a big deal for Bitcoin. But there’s another wildcard: Donald Trump. His inauguration is coming up, and while he has already signaled he’s genuinely pro-crypto, actions speak louder than words. If he fast-tracks crypto-friendly policies in his first 100 days, it could be a game-changer. Markets could explode. On the flip side, if he drags his feet, expect a major correction.

Here’s the Truth!,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-wall-street-secretly-manipulating-bitcoin-for-big-profits-heres-the-truth/,"The post Is Wall Street Secretly Manipulating Bitcoin for Big Profits? Here’s the Truth! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin, the king of cryptocurrencies, is often seen as a symbol of financial freedom. But recent discussions suggest Wall Street might be manipulating its price for their gain. Altcoin Daily recently shared insights on potential market manipulation and upcoming opportunities for Bitcoin. Interestingly, Bitcoin’s bull case this year can be greater than just a Bitcoin stockpile. There is a real possibility that Trump will implement not just a stockpile but also a strategic Bitcoin Reserve where the US starts the process of buying 1 million Bitcoin over the next 5 years. This is what the US Bitcoin Reserve bill spearheaded by Cynthia Lumis would mean for Bitcoin and the US. This tactic aligns with how big players in traditional markets often operate: push prices down to scare off smaller investors, then quietly buy-in. Media’s Role in Shaping Sentiment Mainstream media often highlights Bitcoin’s short-term negatives, like ETF outflows, while downplaying positives, such as BlackRock recommending a 2% Bitcoin allocation. This narrative could discourage retail investors, allowing institutions to quietly accumulate. BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, faces accusations of influencing ETF flows and sentiment to keep prices low for strategic buying. Adding to this, Jim Cramer’s bearish Bitcoin predictions align with claims of market manipulation, especially given his admitted history of influencing markets. Together, these actions fuel speculation about Wall Street’s role in controlling Bitcoin’s price. The U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Rumor Some believe the U.S. might be quietly building a Bitcoin reserve. Advocates like Michael Saylor and Senator Cynthia Lummis have floated this idea, suggesting it could strengthen the dollar and help reduce national debt. With the U.S. already holding over 200,000 Bitcoin from asset seizures, this theory gains some credibility. If true, Wall Street’s alleged manipulation could be part of a larger strategy to position the U.S. as a Bitcoin powerhouse. What This Means for Crypto Wall Street’s actions might seem like bad news for retail investors, but they could signal something big. Institutions are quietly preparing for Bitcoin’s next major move, while the media’s bearish tone might just be noise. For retail investors, the takeaway is clear: don’t let short-term narratives cloud the long-term potential of Bitcoin. With 2025 expected to be a pivotal year, staying informed and ahead of the curve could be the key to capitalizing on Bitcoin’s next big rally.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-06 05:47:46

On Saturday, a trader on crypto exchange Deribit spent over $6 million to purchase the $100,000 strike call options set to expire on March 28, according to data source Amberdata. ""This trade anticipates that new highs for bitcoin will be broken just a few months after Trump officially takes office,"" Amberdata said on X. Traders are also net buyers at the $120,000 strike, indicating strong anticipation of a rally pushing prices above that level. The $120,000 call is the most popular option on Deribit, boasting a notional open interest of $1.52 billion at press time. A call option gives the buyer the right to buy the underlying asset at a specific price later in time. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market, looking to make asymmetric gains from an expected price rally. The renewed interest in the call options comes as BTC looks to regain the $100,000 handle. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency by market value traded above $99,500, marking an 8% recovery from the Dec. 30 low of $91,384, according to data source CoinDesk and TradingView. ""The inauguration and right after will be a prime-time for bullish announcements and policies that could be bullish catalysts for bitcoin to move higher,"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in a weekly newsletter. Regulated cryptocurrency index provider CF Benchmarks voiced a similar opinion while warning that potential delays in policy development, if any, could temper the bullish mood. ""A restructured SEC under procryptocurrency leadership may reduce enforcement risks and foster innovation. These changes, coupled with streamlined compliance requirements, could enhance investor confidence,"" CF Benchmarks said in an annual report shared with CoinDesk. ""We believe that an industry framework will come, however, implementation delays or policy shifts may temper market optimism, creating short-term volatility,"" the firm added. Expectations for pro-crypto regulatory changes have bolstered the crypto market sentiment since Donald Trump won the U.S. election in early November. BTC rose from roughly $70,000 to new lifetime highs above $108,000 weeks after the election. However, the rally has lost steam in the second half of December, likely due to year-end profit-taking and hawkish Fed rate projections.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Bitcoin Options|Trump,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-06 05:51:32

After a brief retracement and correction, the star token has revamped a calculated ascending trend, aiming to surpass the $100K milestone shortly. Meanwhile, the uncertainty over the aftermath of the new president assuming office has lowered the bullish activity within the markets. Moreover, the upcoming FOMC meeting has also added icing to the cake. With the bullish sentiments piling up, will the BTC price sustain above $100K or face another rejection after rising above the levels? The spot ETF accumulation spiked gigantically as the BTC price displayed some momentum. As per the data from Coinglass, the spot BTC ETF witnessed over $900 million in inflows during the last trading day, recording one of the biggest numbers. On the other hand, the USD weakness is anticipated in the coming days, which is believed to fuel the positive momentum for the BTC price rally. What’s next? With the CPI data & Trump’s inauguration , will the price form a new ATH as it did before or face another sell-off? Bitcoin has entered one of the major liquidity zones after rising above $99,000. After nullifying the zones at $99,373 and $99,534, the token is trying hard to validate a rise above the crucial liquidity zone at $99,694.98, where more than $28.78 million in longs have been leveraged. The price retraced slightly after the previous encounters but maintained a consolidated ascending trend. Therefore, a similar price action is expected now that may slightly drag the levels close to $99,500 but trigger a strong rebound to mark the milestone at $100K shortly. The daily chart of BTC prices suggests the price is experiencing some compression due to the drop in volume. As a result, the Bollinger bands have squeezed but the DMI levels have displayed a bullish crossover, with the ADX displaying a bullish divergence. Now that the BTC price has entered the crucial resistance zone between $98,602 and $99,561, a breakout from the zone could push the price above $100K. Meanwhile, the token is yet to test the liquidity zone just above $100K at $100,016 and $100,177, where more than $55 million longs have been leveraged collectively. Therefore, the BTC price could face some liquidations here but as the sentiments are bullish, a quick rebound should be in place. The crypto markets and the Bitcoin price have entered 2025, reportedly assumed to mark the last and most exciting year of the bull run. As a result, the higher targets of the bull run are pretty tough to estimate, as the veterans and the popular analysts believe it to be somewhere above $250K to $300K.

This is a bold move from Japan’s MicroStrategy which started accumulating BTC in May 2024 and already holds over 1,761 BTC on its balance sheet. As a result, the stock price has also skyrocketed more than 2000% on the yearly chart and is currently trading around 3,600 JPY levels. Metaplanet CEO Outlines Ambitious Goals for 2025 Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich has outlined an ambitious goal for this year 2025, looking to take the company’s Bitcoin holdings to more than 10,000 BTC. This would increase its BTC holdings by 5.6x from the current levels. In order to achieve this milestone, the company would be using advanced capital market tools and might follow the MicroStrategy blueprint of fundraising through a mix of debt and equity. Furthermore, Metaplanet CEO stated that the firm will continue to seek innovative opportunities to amplify its impact within Japan as well as the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. In his message on the X platform, Gerovich wrote: “Your belief in our vision fuels our commitment to excellence. Together, we’re not just building a company but driving a movement. Stay tuned—2025 is going to be another monumental year. Here’s to a year of progress, innovation, and success”. Furthermore, the Japanese firm is planning to roll out new initiatives to boost transparency and increase shareholder engagement. Leveraging strategic partnerships, the firm aims to promote Bitcoin adoption both in Japan and on a global scale, added Gerovich. Following Footsteps of MicroStrategy Metaplanet has successfully adopted MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy of accumulating more BTC as part of the company’s reserves and increasing shareholder value. As a result, the Metaplanet stock surged 2000% over the past year. Earlier today, the stock gained another 5% shooting past 3640 JPY following the revelation of 2025’s ambitious plan. With its massive Bitcoin buying in 2024, MicroStrategy’s MSTR stock price outperformed Bitcoin gains by nearly 3x hitting an all-time high of $473 in November. However, it has retraced significantly since then and is currently trading at $330. Market analysts predict that the MicroStrategy stock rally can continue moving into 2025 surging all the way to $500. Besides, Metaplanet’s Simon Gerovich is also betting big on the United States’ official announcement of a Bitcoin reserve plan after Donald Trump takes charge. He wrote: “The U.S. adopting a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve could trigger a global domino effect. As game theory kicks in, nation-states will race to accumulate Bitcoin, knowing the last to act will pay the highest price. Fixed supply. Infinite demand”. Following the cues, other countries like Hong Kong and Germany are also exploring Bitcoin reserve options to deal with global economic uncertainties.

Trump also said he would unleash American energy, which will be made up of tariffs from countries that have taken advantage of the U.S. for years. The president-elect urged the Republicans to unite and quickly deliver the aforesaid victories for the American people. He also implored the Members of Congress to send the Bill to his desk for his signature as soon as possible. Trump seeks to renew Trump Tax Cuts Members of Congress are getting to work on one powerful Bill that will bring our Country back, and make it greater than ever before. We must Secure our Border, Unleash American Energy, and Renew the Trump Tax Cuts, which were the largest in History, but we will make it even… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2025 The president-elect included the renewal of Trump Tax Cuts, which he described as the largest in history. Trump hopes his administration will work towards a tax code that raises more revenues, is more progressive and equitable, and supports investments that make the economy work for everyone. The Bill indicates that the tax system needs to raise more revenue from wealthy people and profitable corporations to offset any tax cuts extended or expanded for those with incomes below $400,000. Trump’s tax cuts include reducing the maximum corporate income tax rate to 21%. The Bill aims to provide a deduction for pass-through income and redesigned international tax rules. The tax cuts also aim to eliminate personal and dependent exemptions and will remove tax on people without adequate health insurance coverage. Trump will also eliminate corporate alternative minimum tax and introduce spending on equipment investment. The tax cuts also increased the standard deduction, the estate tax exemption, and the individual alternative minimum tax exemption. The American politician also disclosed that Bill aims to unleash American energy. He hopes that America’s energy revolution will produce affordable, reliable energy for customers and stable, high-paying jobs for small businesses. Trump believes that he can unlock American energy while dropping U.S. carbon emissions to their lowest level in 25 years. Trump suggests no tax on tips and revenue to be compensated by tariffs The proposal suggests eliminating taxes on tips, meaning service workers would keep the full amount of tips they receive without any portion being taxed. The post highlights that no tax on tips would be compensated by imposing tariffs on countries that have been taking advantage of the U.S. economically. The president-elect disclosed that tariffs increase the cost of imported goods, making them less competitive compared to domestic products. He believes that they can lead to retaliatory tariffs from other countries, potentially increasing the cost of U.S. exports and affecting domestic industries. Trump is confident that tariffs can slow economic growth by disrupting established trade flows and increasing business costs. Trump’s idea aims to increase the take-home pay of tipped workers, potentially boosting their income without increasing their tax burden. The businessman highlighted that the tariffs might protect certain domestic industries by reducing foreign competition. Nevertheless, the president-elect also believes that tariffs can also raise prices for consumers and businesses that rely on imported goods. Kimberly Clausing of the Peterson Institute told CBS MoneyWatch that the biggest impact of higher import tariffs would likely fall on low and middle-income consumers because they spend a larger share of their income on goods and services than wealthier Americans. “If you are an economist, you know right away that tariffs are taxes. If you put a tariff on imported goods, it means they become more expensive, and competitors can raise their prices.” -Kimberly Clausing, Former Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary. The non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics revealed that Trump’s proposal would likely backfire and act as a tax on U.S. consumers. The Institute admitted that Trump’s proposed levy of 60% or more on Chinese imports would cause a typical middle-class household in the U.S. to face an estimated $1,700 a year in additional costs. The American Progress has also crunched the numbers and projects roughly $1,500 per year in extra costs for the typical household. The organization reasoned that companies in the United States that import goods from abroad typically pass the cost of tariffs on American consumers, and domestic manufacturers then often raise their own prices.

Speculation surrounding the case has intensified, with many wondering how it will ultimately play out. Jeremy Hogan, a well-known legal expert, recently suggested that the case might settle in April or May, which could lead to a favorable outcome for XRP holders. However, some have raised questions, asking why a settlement is necessary if the SEC lost the case. Former SEC attorney Marc Fagel provided clarity on the matter, explaining that the SEC did not lose entirely; rather, they won in part and lost in part. Both parties have appealed the portions of the case they were dissatisfied with, as is their legal right. Fagel elaborated that the court ruled in favor of the SEC by agreeing that Ripple had illegally sold over $700 million in unregistered securities, particularly in institutional sales, and imposed a $125 million penalty on Ripple for the violation. Despite this, both Ripple and the SEC are currently in the process of appealing the aspects of the case they lost. This has led to the penalty being put on hold until the appeal process is resolved. Fagel noted that the new SEC administration may decide not to pursue the appeal further, potentially paving the way for a settlement in line with the court’s previous ruling. SEC Under Paul Atkins: President-elect Donald Trump has selected Paul Atkins, a former SEC Commissioner, to become the next chair of the SEC. Atkins, who served as an SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush, will replace the outgoing SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, who is set to depart on January 20, 2025.

Presales are quite long, which means that the first quarter of 2025 is full of opportunities to invest in these meme coins being their launch. A presale is the best time to invest in a token because that’s when the prices are lowest. However, you’re likely to benefit from crypto fanatics like us, who can point you towards the best meme coins . In this article, we’ve compiled a list of the top 6 crypto presales you can consider investing in in the first quarter of 2025. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) With more than $40 million raised in its ongoing presale , $WEPE is all set to be the next 10x token, if not the next 100x meme coin. The biggest reason for its popularity and staggering presale numbers is its community-driven approach. Every WEPE holder gets unique insights into the crypto markets, alongside the same tools that Wall Street traders use to make their bets. This is a huge relief for retail investors who often had a hard time making a profit with the crypto whales controlling the entire market. $WEPE is currently listed at $0.00036642, but the prices will increase in less than 24 hours from now, so this is the lowest you can buy $WEPE for. 2. Flockerz ($FLOCK) FLOCK is a first-of-its-kind vote-to-earn project, where the investors get to decide the future of the project. The platform will roll out a question, for example, asking what exchange FLOCK should be listed on. Then, the users get to vote on it. Even better, regardless of what the ultimate outcome is, every user who votes will get some tokens. What’s more, this meme coin also has a robust NFT-based ecosystem that allows investors to engage in a gamified metaverse and mint, trade, and collect digital birds for fun. $FLOCK presale is ongoing and has already raised over $8.9 million. The presale is in its final stretch with around 16 days to go. So, for anyone interested in investing, this is the right time. Each token is currently available at just $0.0066351. It’s also worth noting that in the first quarter of 2025, once the token is listed, its prices are expected to go up by more than 100%. Some experts are even predicting it to be the next 100x coin. 3. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) As the name suggests, the Best Wallet Token is the native cryptocurrency of Best Wallet, a popular online crypto wallet where you can seamlessly buy, sell, or swap cryptocurrencies. It’s been a great start to the year for both the wallet and the token. The wallet is on its way to claim more than 40% of the non-custodial wallet industry by 2026, and the token just hit the $6.5 million milestone in its presale, which went public in late November 2024 after a $1 million private round. Each $BEST token right now is priced at $0.0235, and investing in it in its presale can set you up for a handsome gain, seeing the token’s high potential. $BEST holders get reduced transaction fees within the Best Wallet ecosystem, higher staking rewards, and the authority to vote on key ecosystem decisions. 4. Catslap ($SLAP) Catslap is a unique token that combines crypto with a fun clicker game. It features an angry cat that likes to slap anyone that gets in its way. The usual victims are Pepe, Gary Gensler, and Kamala Harris. Do note that there are a bunch of other options to choose from as well. Its ‘slap-to-earn’ mechanics have garnered some serious attention, with over two billion total slaps registered at the time of writing. Furthermore, the higher the ‘slapometer,’ the scarcer $SLAP tokens become, which would reduce supply and therefore spike demand. The token went into presale in November 2024 and is still in its first season, meaning its current price of $0.00343712 per token is the cheapest you can get $SLAP for. Speaking of expected growth, by the end of 2025, $SLAP is expected to hit an average price of $0.00877, which is roughly a 166% jump. 5. Race to a Billion ($RACE) Race to a Billion is a unique crypto project that allows users to place predictions on the outcomes of virtual races between meme-inspired characters using $RACE tokens. This is comparatively a smaller project, though, as it has so far raised around $225,000. Users will appreciate that every race outcome and transaction is recorded on the blockchain. This means everyone can verify the results. Currently, the tokens are priced at $0.00827 each and the prices are expected to increase in the next couple of hours, so this is the best time to get in. 6. Lightchain AI ($LCAI) Lightchain AI, or LCAI, is a new crypto project that merges AI and blockchain technologies. It basically rewards users who contribute to AI development without sacrificing network security. The tokens went into presale in 2024 and have managed to raise over $7 million so far. The initial listing price was $0.003, which has now increased to $0.004875. The bull run for this token is expected to last till the final quarter of 2025, with prices potentially hitting $0.05. The biggest reason why we think that LCAI might have considerable growth in 2025 is because the project plans to launch a lot of features. The tenet that will help developers and operators validate token staking is slotted for January. Other goodies, such as an open-source innovation hub and overall ecosystem growth, are also expected this year. Improve Your Crypto Game in 2025 Each of these 6 tokens promises a positive trajectory in the first quarter of 2025, if not for several months thereafter, too. With that said, our top choices are $WEPE and $FLOCK, given their unique offerings, positive market sentiments, and proven presale numbers.
