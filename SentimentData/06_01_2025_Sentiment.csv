By 2028, ADA/USD could decline and reach $5.50. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $6.44. Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.861 Market Cap $30.49B Trading Volume $1.17B Circulating Supply 35.12B ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.9079 24-hour Low $0.8667 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 8.76% 50-day SMA $0.925 14-Day RSI 44.18 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 73 (Greed) Green Days 15/30 (50%) Cardano price analysis: Cardano’s resistance is at $1.091, while support lies at $0.783 ADA price analysis 1-day chart ADA/USD 1-Day Chart On January 5, the 1-day Cardano (ADA) chart shows a price of $1.087, with the upper Bollinger Band at $1.091 acting as immediate resistance and the lower band at $0.783 providing strong support. The middle band, currently at $0.937, has been tested as support, signaling potential bullish momentum. RSI at 61.68 indicates a bullish trend nearing overbought levels, suggesting continued strength but caution for a potential correction. Volume at 8.37M confirms active trading interest. A breakout above $1.091 could lead ADA toward the $1.20 level, while rejection may prompt a retest of $0.937. Consolidation above $1.00 could strengthen bullish sentiment. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart ADA/USD 4-hour Chart The 4-hour Cardano (ADA) chart shows the price at $1.087, with resistance at the upper Bollinger Band of $1.146 and support at the lower band of $0.966. The middle band, at $1.056, serves as immediate support, holding against recent pullbacks. The Balance of Power (BoP) is at -0.16, suggesting mild bearish momentum. The MACD reflects consolidation, with the MACD line at 0.044 closely aligning with the signal line at 0.040, hinting at waning bullish momentum. A breakout above $1.146 could lead to gains toward $1.20, while failure to hold $1.056 may trigger a retracement to $0.966.

On the daily chart, the price at $0.878 is below the 20-SMA ($0.975), with resistance at $0.975 and $1.158, while support stands at $0.793. RSI near 42 indicates weak buying momentum. On the 4-hour chart, ADA trades below the 20-SMA ($0.878), with resistance at $0.903 and support at $0.854. The Balance of Power and MACD confirm bearish sentiment. A break below $0.854 may trigger further downside toward $0.793, while a recovery above $0.975 could signal a bullish rebound. Caution is advised amid weak momentum. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2024, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Based on our analysis, Cardano is likely to reach $5 by 2027, with a forecasted range of around $5.53. This projection is driven by Cardano’s continued technological advancements, growing adoption, strategic partnerships, and increasing market confidence, indicating a positive long-term growth trajectory for the cryptocurrency market. Will Cardano reach $10? ADA is predicted to reach $8.98 by 2030. While this brings it closer to the $10 mark, it is not expected to achieve that level yet. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano is trading around $1, with an all-time high of $2.80 in early 2021. While not impossible, reaching $50 in the next few years is highly uncertain. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. Predictions indicate that by 2030, Cardano could see significant growth, with estimates suggesting a rise to around $9. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges.

It initially gained investor support and popularity for being affordable and environmentally friendly due to its unique PoS mechanism called Ouroboros. In 2021, Cardano implemented the smart contract feature with the Alonzo update. This update came on the ADA test network and brought the interoperability and scalability that was promised to the users earlier. The ADA price reached its all-time high during the bullish cycle of 2021 when it hit $3.09. However, its price started plummeting at the beginning of September 2021 and reached a low of $0.220 in June 2023. In 2024, Cardano peaked at $0.810 in March before dropping to $0.401 in April due to heavy selling. It traded between $0.52–$0.401 in April and $0.317–$0.423 by July, with strong support at $0.33 in August. After peaking at $0.37 in September and dipping to $0.33 in November, ADA surged to $1.1999 at the start of December, hit a maximum price of $1.3264, and closed the year at $0.8451. In January 2025, Cardano is trading between $1.02 to $1.09.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-05 20:53:38

Is This Possible?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/can-all-bitcoins-really-be-mined-in-the-us-after-trump-takes-office-is-this-possible/,"Bitcoin mining has become a major industry in the United States, with American miners currently contributing around 40% of the global Bitcoin mining hashrate. But could Donald Trump’s return to the White House make the US the sole hub for all future Bitcoin mining? Experts say that’s unlikely. During his campaign, Trump made numerous pro-crypto promises, including one bold statement: He wanted all remaining Bitcoin to be mined in the U.S. But achieving that would require shutting down mining operations worldwide and transferring that capacity to America, a move seen as impractical by industry professionals. Related News: Analytics Firm Shares Critical Levels for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana - Here's What to Watch “I think it’s impossible,” said Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s director of digital assets research. He explained that global mining networks are too entrenched for such a shift to happen. CJ Burnett, chief revenue officer at Compass Mining, echoed that sentiment, noting that the U.S. lacks the infrastructure, affordable energy and mining equipment needed to undertake such a monumental task. Bitcoin mining is inherently a globally distributed network, driven by factors such as energy availability, market economics, and regulatory environments across countries. “The US cannot be the sole location for mining all of the remaining Bitcoin,” Burnett said. However, he acknowledged that better US policies could attract more miners to set up operations domestically and accelerate the growth of the sector. Frank Holmes, CEO of Hive Digital Technologies, also expressed optimism that a Trump presidency could bring “continued support for Bitcoin innovation.” *This is not investment advice.

Kiyosaki tells his 2.6 million followers on the social media platform X that a “giant” market crash has arrived that will force the financial system to create more money, widening the gap between the rich and the poor while boosting the prices of gold, silver and BTC. “GIANT MARKET CRASH here. Q: How can I be so bullish on gold, silver, and Bitcoin? A: Because the idiots running the Fed, Treasury, Banks, and Wall Street only know how to print money, which makes things worse. FYI: When fake money is printed, the rich who own real assets get richer…. while the poor and middle class, who save fake money, get poorer due to inflation and taxes. Let inflation make you richer, not poorer. Save gold, silver, and Bitcoin. Take care. Crash is here.” Kiyosaki predicts that Bitcoin will rally between 78% and 257% before this year comes to an end. “MY PRICE PREDICTION for BITCOIN 2025: $175,000 to $350,000″ The best-selling author recently referred to the US dollar as “fake money,” noting that the government can always print more units out of thin air. “I stopped trusting my government in 1965 when I noticed our silver coins were now alloys of cooper. In 1971, President Nixon continued the theft of our wealth via our money, when Tricky Dicky Nixon took the US dollar off the gold standard… If you do not [like] being ‘bent over’ and your wealth stolen via your fake money…. Keep being ignorant, working hard for fake money, and continue listening to financial planners who will tell you what to do with your fake money.” Bitcoin is trading at $98,079 at time of writing.

However, as the president will soon be sworn in, cryptocurrency’s fate stands in the balance; it could go mainstream or be brought down by a cast of villains. There are strong beliefs that the Trump administration will accommodate crypto’s plea for official recognition as a store of value. The idea of Paul Atkins assuming the SEC chairperson has rekindled these hopes because he has been warm towards crypto, unlike his predecessor, Gary Gensler. During the US presidential election campaign, Trump floated the idea of establishing a national Bitcoin reserve. Such sentiments could mean that regulatory frameworks will favor crypto, even though some critics saw the promise of a Bitcoin reserve as a scam . Criminal activities might be on the rise with crypto going mainstream While everything looks exciting, cryptocurrency has a dark side that few people understand. Already, criminals, notorious Irish gangsters, Hamas, Russian arms dealers, and North Korean hackers have moved billions of dollars through stablecoins, including Tether. Trump’s victory has impacted Tether’s outlook so much. With the current state of Tether as the world’s favorite stablecoin and Trump as the president, Tether might present serious problems. The growth of Tether will leave it exposed and interconnected with Wall Street firms like Cantor, putting the broader financial system at risk in case of crypto crises. Also, a vibrant Tether would create an enabling environment for illegal activities, undermining the government’s ability to fight crime, counter terrorism, and enforce sanctions. The current happenings are breeding confidence in the crypto space. However, there is no legal foundation or documentation to enforce these brilliant moves. Therefore, it is very difficult to predict how Bitcoin’s future will look. Will crypto be a team player or an outlaw in 2025 and beyond? Crypto optimists, including Aaron Brown, have mixed feelings about crypto, although he holds that crypto will likely go mainstream in 2025. He analyzes the journey of cryptos from 2014 when many people thought Bitcoin and other altcoins would not survive and that blockchain technology would remain a minor innovation for a niche application. He further outlined how people believed crypto was here with us but wouldn’t deliver a social revolution like the internet did. In 2022, the discussion was if crypto could integrate existing financial regulations and markets or if it would operate similarly to the dark web. We all have the outcomes of the first two scenarios Aaron explored. The year 2025 will answer the third question. If President Trump walks the talk, the cold war between crypto innovators and governments may conclude. The scenario will allow capital to move freely between the traditional and crypto sectors, enhancing financial inclusion. Moreover, Bitcoin and other dominant altcoins may go mainstream. Should this happen, dubious projects and acts of shadowy groups of hackers, anarchists, and libertarians might remain, but the struggles with the law will be out of the equation. This would increase the value of Bitcoin and other respectable digital assets.

At today’s prices, that’s about $726 million worth of Bitcoin. The company says this is part of a calculated plan to generate yield and cover rising operating expenses. MARA’s Director of Investor Relations, Robert Samuels, shared that these loans are “short-term arrangements with well-established third parties,” but he didn’t name names. In its production update, MARA revealed it mined 9,457 BTC throughout 2024 and went shopping for an additional 22,065 BTC at an average price of $87,205. That’s nearly $2 billion spent on Bitcoin. As of press time, MARA held 44,893 BTC, valued at about $4.4 billion. Modest returns, bold strategy The company’s lending program isn’t pulling in massive profits yet. Samuels called the returns “a modest single-digit yield,” adding that MARA experimented with Bitcoin loans throughout 2024. “The long-term objective is to generate sufficient yield to offset operating expenses.” This approach is risky in a market still licking its wounds from the collapse of lenders like BlockFi, Genesis, Celsius, and Babel in 2022. Those meltdowns exposed just how dangerous counterparty risks can be, but MARA appears confident in its choice of partners. Despite the risks, MARA raked in $3.9 million in interest income during Q3 2024. Most of this came from cash on its balance sheet and Bitcoin loans. By mid-2024, the company had already generated $4.8 million in interest income, though earlier filings didn’t specify Bitcoin lending as part of the haul. MARA also broke the 50 exahash per second (EH/s) mark, ending the year with an energized hashrate of 53 EH/s. Though the realized hashrate—what’s actually contributing to the Bitcoin network—remained steady at 47 EH/s. That consistency didn’t go unnoticed in a year where Bitcoin miners faced halved block rewards following the April 2024 halving. Bitcoin miners break record as 2025 begins The Bitcoin mining industry has started 2025 with a bang. On January 3, the network’s total hashrate hit 1,000 exahashes per second (EH/s)—double the 510 EH/s recorded in January 2024. This comes despite the halving, which cut mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. It slashed miner revenues in half, but instead of slowing down, miners threw billions into better rigs and energy-saving systems to stay profitable. The investments are paying off. These massive upgrades are driving efficiency like never before, even as rewards dwindle. The result? Bitcoin’s mining infrastructure is now more powerful than ever, with miners proving they can adapt to anything the market throws at them. As Bitcoin prices soared past $108,000 in December, miners started exploring new ways to cash in. Securities lending is one of the hottest trends. Miners are lending Bitcoin to get shares in ETFs, which they then loan out for a profit. Then there’s high-performance computing (HPC). Companies like BitDigital and Terawulf are turning their mining operations into hubs for AI and HPC tasks, making the most of their energy setups. This is expected to rake in billions by 2027.

A portion of his post stated, “We’re going straight to Mars. The Moon is a distraction.” This post immediately received a lot of replies, including one from the former CEO of Binance, Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao. Elon Musk Triggers Prioritization Talk in Crypto For those in the crypto ecosystem, “moon” is synonymous with making huge profits and massive investments. This concept likely triggered Zhao to respond to Musk’s tweet. CZ pointed out that chasing price is a distraction. This statement echoes the Binance founder’s long-term stand on crypto enthusiasts changing their priorities. He is more concerned with getting these entities to focus on the big picture and develop products that make a difference. Zhao says this is more sustainable and creates value than chasing short-term market movements. There you have it. Elon just said price is a distraction. Keep building. 🤣 https://t.co/Ilf7Lq4V2h — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) January 5, 2025 Once crypto enthusiasts develop products that can sell themselves, a price increase is likely to follow naturally. CZ Bullish About 2025 Before this time, CZ had clearly stated that 2025 would be a “send it” year, aligning with his view of cycles in the cryptocurrency market. He believes recovery years and initial bear markets always come before bull market years. CZ, seeking a pardon from Donald Trump , has already categorized 2024 as a recovery year and 2025 as a bull market year. With this in mind, the focus should not be on prices and their pursuit of the “moon.” Bitcoin Price Dips In 24 Hours Meanwhile, the prices of quite several cryptocurrencies have been fluctuating sideways in the last few weeks. Some factors likely trigger this outlook. The firstborn digital asset, Bitcoin (BTC), trades at $98,320.19 after losing 0.4% of its price level within 24 hours. A few analysts believe there will be a further drop in the coming weeks. They warn that Bitcoin price may slump below $60,000 by January 20, during Donald Trump’s inauguration. There have been signs of incoming bearish sentiments, including the movement of over 33,000 BTC, worth $3.23 billion, to exchanges.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As the crypto market braces for a potential bull run in 2025, iDEGEN, PATRIOT, and Akuma Inu emerge as top altcoins to watch for explosive growth. The new year is just around the corner, and with it comes the prospect of the mother of all bull runs. Consequently, traders and speculators are falling over themselves trying to find the next big cryptocurrency to invest in before the bulls come a-knockin’. The trouble is that hunting for the next crypto to explode can often blow up in your face if you don’t research. And therein lies the rub—not everyone has the time to spend hours in the deepest, dankest corners of X or Discord searching for the next biggest crypto no one has heard of before. That’s where this guide comes in. We’ve researched the best crypto to invest in ahead of 2025, so you don’t have to. Without further ado, we’ve drilled it down to the top 3 monster tokens to watch next year. iDEGEN: The most intriguing AI crypto experiment takes flight PATRIOT: The best bet in the PolitiFi meme coin arena for 2025 Akuma Inu: Hard-charging new meme coin drawing a crowd Read on to discover why these three choice cuts are being tipped as the next big crypto gainers of the bull cycle. You might also like: Bitcoin or altcoins? Find out who will win the holiday season iDEGEN: The most intriguing AI crypto experiment takes flight The AI crypto sector was the hottest narrative to dominate 2023 and 2024 alongside meme coins. And as the year ends, the spotlight is circling back to AI with the rise of sector-adjacent tokens and memecoins like ai16z and Fartcoin going parabolic even as the wider market takes a breather. AI is where the smart money and the whales are at, and we’re not even remotely close to scratching the surface of the market’s vast moon potential. Unsurprisingly, the AI crypto space is home to a gold mine of tokens with the potential to dominate the discourse in 2025, and the best of the bunch hasn’t even hit the open market yet. We’re talking about iDEGEN . It’s conducting the most unhinged AI social experiment on X. iDEGEN has unleashed a witty, autonomous AI agent trained exclusively by prompts from the most far-out fringes of Crypto Twitter. It is creating the most based and red-pilled agent never before seen in the brief history of AI crypto. The result? An AI agent without politically correct programming, without corporate brainwashing, and without the baked-in woke mind virus most AI comes out of the box with. This agent trains its algorithms on the most brilliant, deranged takes this side of Crypto Twitter —posting an hourly stream of tweets, images, and, very soon, video content on social platforms. iDEGEN responds to every mention or interaction without any filters, constantly feeding itself with input from the best and brightest that Crypto Twitter has to offer. But X is just the beginning—iDEGEN is designed to create the most attention across numerous social channels—which is expected to translate into big-time gains for its native token IDGN in 2025. You’re still early for the moon mission, too. Currently available at just $0.0410, iDEGEN is still in its adaptive auction presale phase until it hits the open market in January. With its presale raising a sensational $8.6m so far, it’s all just a matter of time before IDGN goes parabolic. Visit the iDEGEN website to learn more. PATRIOT: The best bet in the PolitiFi meme coin arena for 2025 PolitiFi was another narrative that gained major traction earlier this year ahead of the US presidential elections in November. But soon after that, the circus appeared to have left town after Trump was elected. But lo and behold, one contender has emerged from the wreckage as the next big crypto in the PolitiFi meme coin arena with the launch of PATRIOT. Using the infinitely memeable Trump for its branding, PATRIOT has popped off on an 18x run since launching in November. Investors are betting on PATRIOT to pump in the weeks leading up to Trump’s inauguration in January, making it the best bet left on the PolitiFi board in 2024. Akuma Inu: Hard-charging new meme coin drawing a crowd Meme coins have always been and always will be the main draw to crypto. Like it or not, that’s just how it is. One of the best new meme coins, as the year ends, is Akuma Inu, a canine-themed meme coin launched on Base. Since launching, Akuma Inu has recorded a staggering 3,000% gain even as the market rests up for the next leg up in 2025. Akuma Inu has blown past a $120 million market cap as of press time—and given the fact that dog-themed meme coins continue to dominate the narrative, Akuma Inu has plenty of legroom to go on a big run next year.

Trump’s Pet Doge (TRUMDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Pet Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Pet Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Pet Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Pet Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Pet Doge by entering its contract address – 6e6jZxV1zG7GGLF5MoJZf8nY4u17x8dceDatSWiTE573 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 21:55:00

The recent leak from a Baidu Tieba forum post, a popular Chinese site shows the sides, the back, and a little bit of the front of the Joycon. New Joy-con Photos from Chinese SNS by u/SwordfishAgile3472 in NintendoSwitch2 The leak shows that new controllers still slot in as one does expect from Nintendo’s console. It looks like the console will stick with the genesis of the original Switch design. The Joycons themselves seem longer and bulkier though. This detail adds to what to expect from the upcoming console , implying the Switch 2 could be a larger device. Switch 2 Joycons reportedly have some new features stealing the spotlight Not surprising that it’s sticking with the hybrid format. Although the Joycons have some new features stealing the spotlight, revealing that these controllers have more than meets the eye. We have much clearer insights than earlier leaks. It features an optical sensor (mysterious in its purpose) and a reworked locking mechanism as one standout feature. Moreover, eagle-eyed fans noticed a serial number in the leaked photos. This detail could also reveal the leaker. However, the serial number doesn’t provide enough details about the product to indicate the images are real. These new controllers are considerably more robust than the original Joycons. Unlike some other pieces of joy tech, these seem to go straight into the console rather than sliding in, and a button near the shoulder button probably to release them. There is also another noticeable upgrade; the larger concealed buttons which allow for easier play with just one Joycon. Even though one can’t really see what the front of the Joycon looks like, these leaks seem to be very promising for the Switch 2, as they imply the controllers will get some big upgrades compared to their predecessor.

Freezing Criminal Assets “By working closely with authorities across jurisdictions, Tether has been instrumental in freezing criminal assets and ensuring that bad actors do not exploit stablecoins like USDT,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether. “Criminals now have 100 million reasons to think twice before using TRON,” said Justin Sun, founder of the Tron network , who added: “T3 FCU’s rapid success in freezing criminal assets sends an unmistakable message: if you’re using USDT on TRON for crime, you will be caught.” T3 Financial Crime Unit Marks Enforcement Victory: $100 Million in Criminal Assets Frozen Across Five Continents Read more: https://t.co/HReVLYRfxz — Tether (@Tether_to) January 2, 2025 The T3 Financial Crime Unit has already analyzed millions of transactions across five continents, monitoring over 3 billion in USDT volume, according to the announcement. Chris Janczewski, head of global investigations at TRM Labs, said surpassing 100 million USDT in frozen assets is just the beginning. “In 2025 and beyond, as more and more lawful users enter the growing crypto ecosystem, it is more important than ever to keep it safe. T3 is dedicated to that mission.” Are Tether’s EU Woes About to Deepen? Tether’s market capitalization has started to shrink for the first time since late 2022, having fallen by 3 billion USDT from its peak of around $140 billion in mid-December. The decline in supply may be due to deepening concerns in Europe as its restrictive Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations were activated, raising uncertainty about USDT’s status on exchanges in the bloc. The implementation of MiCA in Europe on Dec. 30 has created an uncertain future for stablecoin issuers such as Tether since the regulations do not clarify whether USDT is compliant. However, Ardoino dismissed the concerns as FUD earlier this week as the firm added $700 million worth of Bitcoin to its treasury. “Don’t believe the FUD,” he said before adding, “Competitors are just desperate to make you believe things that don’t exist.” The post Tether-Led Crime Unit Hits $100M Milestone in Global Crypto Asset Seizures appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Tether (USDT)|Tron,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-01-05 22:05:38

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rexas Finance (RXS) outpaces Solana and Ripple, offering a unique asset tokenization approach with a 490% presale surge, making it a standout investment opportunity. Forget Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) if you want a high-growth crypto investment this crypto cycle. Although both tokens have recently enjoyed small increases—SOL growing 7.38% over the past 60 days to $186.45 and XRP flying 321.98% to $2.17—they pale compared to the explosive ascent of Rexas Finance (RXS). With a 490% increase during its presale, RXS is emerging as the standout token of this cycle. It offers a realistic path to turning $450 into $45,000. A presale performance that commands attention Rexas Finance began its presale in early September 2024 at just $0.030 per token. Since then, it has climbed an astonishing 490% to $0.175 in its 11th presale stage, raising over $34,151,703 and selling 385,864,593 RXS tokens. This impressive growth translates to a 6x return for early investors and demonstrates the token’s strong bullish momentum. Market analysts project that RXS could rise 100x during the next bull cycle, reaching $17.50. If this prediction holds, an initial $450 investment today could transform into a staggering $45,000. Notable whale activity supports this promise; Ethereum and Solana’s investors are pouring money into RXS at its present price. This is not only conjecture. Rexas Finance is distinguished mainly by its dedication to security and openness. Certik has thoroughly audited the project, giving investors faith in its code and practices. Unlike many initiatives that depend on venture capital investment, Rexas Finance has taken a community-centric approach, drawing individual investors who share its vision. This choice guarantees that the initiative stays aligned with its long-term plan of transforming asset tokenization. Already having listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, Rexas Finance has established itself. These systems increase the token’s legitimacy by offering real-time tracking and comprehensive analytics, enhancing its visibility. These listings provide a consistent supply of information for investors so they may decide on RXS with knowledge.

The competition promises 20 lucky winners $50,000 worth of RXS tokens, each with 681,868 entries thus far. Tasks on the Rexas Finance website and campaign sharing will help participants raise their chances of winning. This endeavor benefits society and emphasizes its dedication to diversity and expansion. Why Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) can’t compete Although Solana and Ripple are making news, RXS’s exponential expansion has been the star of recent performance. Though spectacular in isolation, Solana’s 7.38% increase and Ripple’s 321.98% leap fall short of the 490% rally seen in RXS. Furthermore, neither SOL nor XRP presents the revolutionary idea of actual asset tokenization that Rexas Finance proposes. Investors are noting RXS’s unique value proposition. A well-known Ethereum whale recently disclosed plans to purchase RXS for $0.175 and cited its potential to grow 100x in the next cycle. This assurance from high-net-worth investors confirms the coin’s potential for growth even more. Rexas Finance is mainly based on its capacity to tokenize actual assets. Whether it’s fractional ownership of real estate, money, or fine art, the platform lets anyone easily buy, sell, or exchange physical objects. The ramifications are significant since it creates investment prospects that were once only accessible to a few people. The platform’s support of several token standards—including ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155—guarantees the blockchain ecosystem’s flexibility and interoperability. Thanks to this capacity, Rexas Finance links conventional finance with blockchain technology. Conclusion: the time to invest is now Rexas Finance (RXS) is a transforming enterprise that can upend sectors valued in trillions of dollars, not simply another coin. With its outstanding presale performance, Certik audit, and emphasis on actual asset tokenization, RXS presents an intriguing investment possibility. Although some would find Solana and Ripple appealing, they lack the explosive innovation and expansion that RXS offers. RXS is the token to watch for anybody wishing to turn $450,000 into $45,000, as RXS could rise 100x from its current price of $0.175, which shows massive bullish momentum. Invest in the RXS presale right now to seize the opportunity to be part of this innovative project and set yourself up for lifetime-transforming results.

Here’s a simple breakdown of why these coins are worth watching. Let's dive in! 1. Altura ($ALU): The #1 Coin of AI and Gaming Altura ($ALU) has quickly gained attention as a game-changer in the gaming and NFT space. The platform enables developers to mint, distribute, and update smart NFTs seamlessly, opening the door to innovative in-game assets. With the gaming industry projected to hit $300 billion by 2025, Altura’s potential is immense. Its strong partnerships with gaming studios and recent updates to its platform make it a top contender for exponential growth.Why Watch? Altura is the #1 leader in integrating AI into gaming. As both the AI and gaming industries grow, Altura’s market cap is projected to reach between $1-3 billion or more, potentially resulting in significant price increases of over 1000%. With its innovative technology and expanding influence, $ALU stands out as a must-watch altcoin. 2. Dogecoin ($DOGE): The Original Meme Coin Dogecoin remains a popular choice among crypto enthusiasts, thanks to its active community and ongoing mainstream adoption. With consistent mentions by high-profile figures like Elon Musk and new use cases emerging, Dogecoin has maintained its relevance in the crypto market.Why Watch? As Trump won the election, Elon Musk has become close friends with him and has consistently been promoting Dogecoin. There are rumors of $DOGE becoming an official payment method for the X (Twitter) platform, which could drive significant utility and create a pro-crypto environment due to Trump's influence. Despite its playful origins, $DOGE continues to be a serious contender in the altcoin market. Its accessibility and active development make it a strong pick for those looking for a low-cost investment. 3. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): The ""Dogecoin Killer"" Shiba Inu has made waves in the crypto space as a strong competitor to Dogecoin. With a robust ecosystem that includes ShibaSwap, NFTs, and its growing Shibarium blockchain, $SHIB is more than just a meme coin. The project’s commitment to community and innovation keeps it in the spotlight.Why Watch? Because Shiba Inu launched their own network and still maintains one of the greatest hypes in the meme coin world since 2021, $SHIB continues to make a buzz. Its strong community and ongoing developments keep it at the forefront of the meme coin space, offering significant growth potential. 4. Bonk ($BONK): Solana’s Top Meme Coin $BONK has emerged as the leading meme coin on the Solana blockchain, a network celebrated for its scalability and lightning-fast transaction speeds. With Solana’s market cap surpassing $100 billion, $BONK is well-positioned to capture a substantial portion of this ecosystem.Why Watch? If $BONK captures just 10% of Solana’s market cap, it could see a 5x increase from its current levels. As the Solana ecosystem expands, $BONK has the potential to become a dominant player in the meme coin category. 5. Brett ($BRETT): A New Coin with Big Dreams Brett ($BRETT) is a newer cryptocurrency that’s catching people’s attention. It’s often referred to as the ""best friend of Pepe"" and is one of the top meme coins on the Base chain. Brett has a playful and relatable brand that draws in the meme-loving crypto crowd.Why Watch? If the Base chain continues to grow and attract more users, interest in Brett could skyrocket. With more people using the Base chain, Brett’s popularity and value might increase significantly, making it a serious contender to hit $1. Conclusion: Altura Leads the Pack While all five altcoins have the potential to deliver impressive returns, Altura ($ALU) stands out as the most promising pick. Its innovative approach to integrating AI into gaming and NFTs sets it apart, offering long-term growth potential. That said, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Bonk, and Brett are also worth keeping an eye on as they ride the wave of increasing crypto adoption. Diversifying your portfolio with these altcoins under $1 could be a winning strategy this month. Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

Here’s Your Second Shot With BTFD Coin!,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-out-on-the-cat-in-a-dogs-world-craze-heres-your-second-shot-with-btfd-coin/,"Cryptocurrencies—once a niche fascination for tech geeks—are now a global sensation. Everyone, from college kids to Wall Street hotshots, is trying to ride the crypto wave. Among them, meme coins have carved out a wild, unpredictable, and ridiculously profitable niche. Remember Dogecoin’s meteoric rise? Or Shiba Inu’s life-changing gains? Yeah, we all know someone who “got in early” and is now lounging on a beach somewhere, sipping margaritas. For the rest of us who missed the boat, it’s easy to feel like the party’s over. But here’s the kicker: the meme coin scene is just getting started. Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD) . This fresh contender is shaking up the game in ways even the OGs didn’t. BTFD isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a full-blown movement. With its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, sky-high staking rewards, and a fiercely loyal “Bulls Squad,” BTFD is setting the stage for meme coin 2.0. So, if you’re hunting for the best meme coin presale to join this month, keep reading. This might be your shot to turn FOMO into pure joy. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Meme Coin with Serious Game (Literally) BTFD Coin isn’t just cashing in on the meme coin hype; it’s redefining it. For starters, its P2E game is a massive hit. Think of it like Fortnite meets crypto: you battle it out, level up, and earn real rewards in $BTFD tokens. Whether you’re gaming on your phone during a lunch break or grinding all weekend, you’re stacking crypto while having fun. How’s that for multitasking? And then there’s the staking. Let’s get real: who doesn’t want to earn passive income? With a jaw-dropping APY that’s turning heads across the crypto world, staking BTFD is like planting money trees in your backyard. You park your coins, let the Bulls Squad do their thing, and watch your stash grow. Speaking of the Bulls Squad, this community is next-level. Over 4,700 holders strong and counting, these are die-hard believers in BTFD’s vision. Whether it’s hyping the coin on social media or diving into strategy chats, they’re all in—and it shows. Now let’s talk numbers, because we all know numbers don’t lie. BTFD’s presale is on fire. Starting at a humble $0.000004 per coin, it’s already climbed to $0.000142 in Stage 13. Over $4.9 million has been raised so far, with $1 million pouring in within just 10 days of launch. That’s the kind of momentum meme coin dreams are made of. To put it in perspective, if you dropped $15,000 during Stage 5 at $0.00005 per coin, you’d have snagged 300 million BTFD tokens. When the price hits $0.0006 at the end of the presale? You’re looking at $180,000. Yup, six figures. How’s that for ROI? With analysts predicting an even brighter future for BTFD, the buzz is real. The presale is already in full swing, so if you’ve got “get in early” on your 2024 bingo card, now’s the time. Sign up, secure your spot, and join the Bulls Squad—before it’s too late. Cat in a Dog’s World: The Underdog (or Should We Say, Undercat?) While BTFD is stealing the spotlight, Cat in a Dog’s World is carving out its own niche—and doing it with some serious style. Imagine the ultimate underdog story: a feisty feline taking on the big dogs (literally). This coin’s charm lies in its quirky narrative and tight-knit community that’s as loyal as it is creative. Cat in a Dog’s World operates on the idea that you don’t have to be a top dog to dominate. Its focus on utility-driven growth sets it apart from meme coins that rely purely on hype. The team is working on integrating their coin into NFT marketplaces and Metaverse projects, creating a use case that’s both innovative and practical. And while they’re keeping specifics under wraps, early adopters are buzzing about a possible NFT launch that could make their coin even more valuable. Price-wise, Cat in a Dog’s World is in its infancy, which means it’s dirt cheap to get in. But don’t let that fool you. Analysts predict a strong upward trajectory as the project develops and gains traction in the crypto community. For those who missed out on Dogecoin and Shiba Inu when they were fractions of a cent, this could be your chance to get in on the ground floor of the next big thing. Still, let’s be honest: it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. Unlike BTFD’s fully fleshed-out ecosystem, Cat in a Dog’s World is more speculative at this stage. But hey, high risk, high reward, right? If you’ve got a soft spot for scrappy projects with big dreams, this one’s worth keeping on your radar. Seamless BIG50 Activation Access the Presale Page now.

As the best crypto to buy now for 100x returns, Web3Bay offers a strong combination of secure data handling, versatile token advantages, and a visionary plan for growth. Here’s an in-depth review of why Web3Bay is a sound investment choice. Securing Data Privacy with Decentralized Storage In today’s digital world, data privacy is crucial, especially on e-commerce platforms where users’ sensitive information is involved. Web3Bay tackles this by incorporating the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) into its structure. IPFS uses a decentralized storage method, spreading data across various nodes to boost security and dependability. With IPFS, Web3Bay ensures that user data is protected against the vulnerabilities and failures common in centralized systems. Every transaction, be it a purchase or token exchange, is securely logged and stored, keeping personal details private. This method not only protects data but also supports blockchain’s values of openness and user control. For both buyers and sellers, this decentralized method offers assurance. Customers can shop without fear of their data being stolen or misused, while sellers face lower risks of data breaches, which can be expensive and harm their reputation. Moreover, Web3Bay’s use of IPFS puts users in control of their data, significantly reducing unauthorized access. As global concern about digital privacy grows, Web3Bay stands out as a dependable platform for secure online shopping. Enhancing Value with 3BAY Token Utility The 3BAY token is central to improving the user experience and boosting engagement on Web3Bay. More than just a currency, the token opens doors to unique benefits and rewards. Owning 3BAY tokens gets you a 5% discount on all Web3Bay transactions, promoting token use over traditional payment methods and integrating users into the platform’s expanding community. From daily purchases to exclusive sales, this discount offers real savings for active participants. The token presale is in its third phase, priced at $0.0039675, with over $320,000 raised so far. Its target launch price is $0.1959, giving early investors a potential for substantial gains. 3BAY tokens also provide governance rights, allowing holders to vote on important platform decisions, from new features to policy updates, creating a strong sense of community and ownership. Additionally, community involvement is rewarded. Users can gain extra tokens through staking, promotions, or contributing to the platform’s growth, fostering an environment where community participation brings tangible benefits. The token’s value is also supported by a deflationary model, with periodic token burns to ensure scarcity, aligning with long-term investment benefits as demand increases. Charting the Future: Web3Bay’s Strategic Growth Plan Web3Bay is dedicated to sustainable growth through a strategic plan that consistently enriches its ecosystem and enhances user engagement. At the heart of this strategy are advanced blockchain technologies poised to revolutionize decentralized e-commerce. A key upcoming feature is the integration of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), which will allow trading of unique items like art and collectibles, expanding Web3Bay’s market reach. This move not only capitalizes on the burgeoning NFT market but also opens new opportunities for creators and merchants globally. Web3Bay is also set to expand into decentralized finance (DeFi), enabling services such as loans, savings, and staking directly on its platform. This integration aims to provide a comprehensive environment for users to manage both their commercial and financial activities effortlessly. Further, Web3Bay will support interoperability with leading blockchains like Ethereum and BNB Chain, facilitating seamless transactions across different networks and encouraging wider user adoption. Plans are also underway to develop user-friendly mobile apps and integrate conventional payment options alongside cryptocurrencies, making the platform accessible to a broader audience and bridging the divide between blockchain enthusiasts and the general public. Wrapping Up: Why Web3Bay is Best Crypto to Buy for Massive Returns Web3Bay distinguishes itself in the crypto presale market with its strong emphasis on data privacy, beneficial token utility, and innovative expansion plans. It integrates IPFS technology to ensure top-tier data security, crucial for e-commerce integrity. Additionally, the versatile 3BAY token enhances user value through discounts, governance participation, and various rewards, appealing to both platform users and investors. The platform’s ambitious growth roadmap further establishes its prominence. By integrating NFTs, DeFi capabilities, and cross-chain functionality, Web3Bay shows its commitment to maintaining a cutting-edge position in blockchain technology. For investors searching for crypto with significant growth potential, Web3Bay represents an appealing option. With major advancements anticipated and a clear vision for development, Web3Bay combines utility, security, and expansive future prospects.

Pepe the Boss (PEPEBOSS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEBOSS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe the Boss can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe the Boss could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe the Boss launched with over $8,500 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe the Boss on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe the Boss by entering its contract address – 5pgsjH712NZ6eaKunsEfZarG9UotHaxvheW5E39a8NFX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEBOSS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 23:24:00

Multiple media outlets and social media users have raged after a “Polish tourist” posted a report and a video appearing to show that ASIC Bitcoin (BTC) miners are operating in rural parts of Abkhazia. These reports come just days after Russia began providing Abkhazia with “humanitarian supplies” of electricity. Abkhazia: Crypto Mining Crisis The Caucasus-based de facto state is closely allied with Moscow and is considered a breakaway Georgian republic by most Western and Western-aligned nations. The “tourist” testified: “Entire villages are humming; mountains and caves are buzzing [with the sound of ASIC mining rigs]. Cables carrying free electricity are stretching out into the forests. And the forests are also buzzing, too.” Russia is moving to restrict online images and maps showing one of the country’s oil refineries in an effort to protect the crucial infrastructure from Ukrainian drone attacks https://t.co/5s7BL0kQxh — Bloomberg (@business) January 3, 2025 The “tourist” also posted a video entitled “the sound of ASIC rigs over Abkhazia.” This video captures what appears to be the sound of whirring fans outdoors in a rural Abkhazian settlement. A journalist for the Russian media outlet Noviye Izvestia wrote: “Mining equipment in this backward, half-ruined country is installed in villages, mountains, forests, and caves.” The article was titled: “‘Thank you, Russia!’ The Illegal Miners of Abkhazia are Burning up our Free Electricity.” On Telegram, the popular Russian blogger Sergei Kolyasnikov mused: “Look at this video! Can you imagine how many devices need to be operating to make so much noise? And each ASIC rig uses 3.5 kW of power. It seems that Abkhazia has become a Russian crypto mining offshore.” Russia declared a regional state of emergency in Crimea, as workers cleared tons of contaminated sand on either side of the Kerch Strait following an oil spill in the Black Sea https://t.co/1HPbw3wMA5 pic.twitter.com/G11wVr10Zb — Reuters (@Reuters) January 5, 2025 ‘Crypto Miners to Blame’ as Rolling Blackouts Return in Abkhazia Timur Dzhindzholiya, the head of the Abkhazia power provider Chernomorenergo, said last month that illegal miners are using up “about 350 million kWh” per year . Despite the influx of Russian power, Chernomorenergo has been forced to act, turning off power supplies for a fixed period every day. The power grid, the firm claimed, cannot cope with “excessive loads.” It claims that “the main reason for” these loads “is illegal mining.” The Ministry of Finance of Abkhazia has claimed that it expects to receive over five billion rubles (over $45 million) worth of aid from Russia in 2025. China has allowed companies to send items with both civilian and military applications to Russia – while also claiming to want to help bring peace to Ukraine.

In my native Sverdlovsk Oblast, we will pay between 12.6% to 19.5% more for energy this year.” Russian blogger Sergei Kolyasnikov Crypto mining-related controversies have led to public violence at the highest level. Last month, media outlets reported an Abkhazian lawmaker was shot dead during a parliamentary debate on banning crypto mining. In previous years, Abkhazian communities have taken action, forcibly expelling suspected crypto miners to leave their villages. The de facto state endured a torrid end to 2024, with its only power station – which is only partially located in Abkhazia – shutting down on December 11. The Enguri Hydroelectric Power Station. (Source: Paata Vardanashvili [CC BY 2.0]) Activities at the Enguri Hydroelectric Power station were paused “due to critically low water levels” in one of its main reservoirs. The day prior, the government forced internet providers to cut the entire de facto state’s internet access for seven hours . The republic has also seen relations with Moscow deteriorate after politicians voted against agreeing on a new investment deal with Russia. Moscow responded by cutting its funding to the de facto state. In recent days, however, the Abkhazian government has moved to repair its relationship with Russia. Its President claimed he would “try to strengthen relations with” Moscow. “We very much appreciate Russia’s constant support in overcoming the energy crisis that Abkhazia is experiencing.

Normally, the chart is released before the firm purchases new Bitcoin the next day. Thus, analysts are predicting MicroStrategy will make another Bitcoin purchase on Monday. Saylor did similar before a recent BTC acquisition Michael Saylor, co-founder of Microstrategy, posted the firm’s Bitcoin Tracker chart on December 29. The next day, the company made another Bitcoin acquisition. MicroStrategy bought 2138 BTC all on Dec 30, spending about $97,837 on each coin. On January 5, Saylor shared a similar chart tracking all of Microstategy BTC purchases. Given its history, analysts now believe the firm is ready to make another BTC acquisition, particularly on January 6. MicroStrategy’s 21/21 plan also adds to analysts’ expectations since the company will invest about $42 billion in its Bitcoin acquisitions, using $21 billion in equity and $21 billion in fixed-income securities. The company even requested its shareholders to raise the authorized shares of preferred stock from 5 million to over 1 billion. Similarly, it is requesting an expansion of its Class A common stock authorization from 330 million to 10.3 billion shares. Moreover, MicroStrategy has disclosed its intention to pursue a $2 billion perpetual preferred stock offering. This raise initiative, separate from the firm’s 21/21 Bitcoin financing strategy, is projected for Q1 2025, contingent on internal approval. Some believe MicroStrategy will slow down on its Bitcoin purchases in 2025 BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes expects the crypto market to fall, especially after President Donald Trump’s pending inauguration. Hayes’ early investment fund, Maelstrom, claimed it would make future crypto purchases at lower prices, suggesting the fund is waiting for crypto prices to drop. However, with a projected market slowdown in January 2025, analysts believe MicroStrategy will pause its BTC acquisitions, which could affect the firm’s shares and convertible bonds distribution. Michael Saylor, however, advocated for the company to acquire Bitcoin during peak prices in early December. He said: I’m sure that I will be buying Bitcoin at $1 million a coin—probably $1 billion dollars a day of Bitcoin at $1 million a coin. ~ Michael Saylor This, however, means that Microstartegy might still make more BTC purchases, especially if its trading prices decline.

On Dec. 25, 2024, in Karachi, Pakistan, seven suspects—including an officer from the Counter-Terrorism Department—were taken into custody on suspicion of participating in the kidnapping of a cryptocurrency trader and demanding a ransom of $340,000. While confirming that one CTD officer had been arrested, Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon stated that attempts were still underway to capture another police officer implicated in the crime. The victim, 30-year-old Mohammed Arsalan, was kidnapped from Manghopir, a well-known neighborhood in the northwestern part of Karachi. According to Arsalan, the abductors forced him to transfer $340,000 from his Binance account to several wallets they controlled before releasing him hours later near the Quaid-e-Azam mausoleum. You might also like: Pakistan proposes new crypto framework to central bank rules Arsalan later shared additional details on Facebook, but independent sources largely unverified his claims, including the specific amount transferred and the exact sequence of events. He claimed that $277,000 of the stolen amount was transferred to a specific wallet through decentralized exchanges before being moved off-chain to Binance . Arsalan Malik’s Post | Source: Facebook While Arsalan assured the public that law enforcement was actively working to trace the transactions and identify the individuals behind the wallets, experts have pointed out the challenges of tracking funds through decentralized finance systems, where anonymity is often a core feature. Arsalan also posted a screenshot of his Binance withdrawal history on Facebook , showing multiple forced transfers in various cryptocurrencies, including significant amounts in USDT and other tokens, totaling over $340,000. Although screenshots can provide useful evidence, investigators must authenticate this data to fully corroborate his account. The suspects, identified as Mohammed Rizwan Shah, Tariq Hasan Shah alias Amir, Muzamil Raza, Umer Jilani, Umer Irshad, Noman Riffat, and Haris alias Ashar, were apprehended by the Anti-Violence Crime Cell. According to a statement by AVCC officials, the team, led by SSP Aneel Haider Minhas, conducted multiple operations throughout Karachi to capture the suspects. However, details about the exact timeline of their arrests and the evidence linking each suspect to the crime remain unclear. The AVCC described the arrested individuals as habitual offenders who had been jailed for similar crimes in the past, but public records or court documents to substantiate this characterization were not immediately available. Arsalan’s account of the lead-up to his abduction also raises some unanswered questions. Weeks before the incident, he claimed that a man named Hamid approached him to purchase US dollars. Despite Arsalan’s refusal, Hamid persisted and eventually set up a meeting with Arsalan’s friend Zohaib. On Dec. 24, 2024, three men, including Muzamil and Hammad, visited Arsalan’s office and invited him to a restaurant where other suspects joined them. It remains unclear why Arsalan agreed to meet with individuals he was reportedly suspicious of or whether any measures were taken to verify their identities. Such details could be critical in understanding whether this was a premeditated targeting of Arsalan or an opportunistic crime. Later that night, Arsalan said he was abducted by a group of armed men in an unmarked police vehicle. They gagged him with a cloth and detained him near the Saddar FIA office. There, they allegedly forced him to unlock his Binance account and transfer his money to multiple wallets. After resetting his phone, they released him near a local point of attraction, known as Quaid-e-Azam Mausoleum at 4 a.m. The choice of location for his release and the precise steps taken to reset his phone suggest a level of planning and technological know-how among the kidnappers. In an interview with Dawn , IGP Memon called it a singular instance of misconduct by individual officers and stressed that the police force does not tolerate unlawful activities. However, his remarks have been met with skepticism, given the significant role that rogue officers allegedly played in the crime. Critics argue that a more transparent internal investigation is required to restore public confidence in law enforcement. Arsalan, in a Facebook post , expressed his devastation over the loss of his hard-earned money. He condemned those accusing him of fabricating the incident, stating that the DIG was personally supervising the investigation. He also clarified that no investors or relatives were implicated in the case and vowed to repay any losses incurred by others. Arsalan promised not to spare any of the culprits responsible for orchestrating the crime. Arsalan Malik’s Post | Source: Facebook Although individuals impacted may find some solace in Arsalan’s promises, his assertion that he will reimburse losses may raise questions about his post-theft financial status and whether more investigation into his business activities is necessary. Additionally, making such assurances could unintentionally divert attention from holding the offenders accountable. Serious questions have been raised by the occurrence regarding the security of cryptocurrency traders in Pakistan as well as the abuse of authority by law authorities. The region’s increasing use of cryptocurrencies exposes traders to these types of crimes due to a lack of governmental control and education on the security of digital assets. According to observers, this case might act as a wake-up call for more robust legislative measures and a thorough examination of Pakistan’s legal framework’s protections for digital assets.

Elon Loves MAGA (ELOMAGA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Loves MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Loves MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Loves MAGA launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Loves MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Loves MAGA by entering its contract address – 6mRLPcgWXUBYNfXouCxBoyjFzNjww9HNVFpBJkrqmFeE – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Inmortal tells his 222,400 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks Ethereum is gearing up for rallies this quarter. The trader believes that ETH is about to follow in the footsteps of its Q1 2024 price action. “ETH about to have a good Q1.”‘ Source: Inmortal/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that ETH will hit a new all-time high of $5,300 by March. At time of writing, ETH is worth $3,646. He also thinks old altcoins and artificial intelligence (AI)-focused projects will ignite rallies in the next three months. “In Q1: 1. ETH outperforms. 2. SOL go +$300 3. AI coins mega-pump 4. Memes underperform 5. Dino coins have a good run.” While the analyst believes memecoins will not see huge rallies in Q1 of this year, he says that Floki ( FLOKI ) will be an exception. “High conviction on the memecoin leader. FLOKI.” Source: Inmortal/X Based on the trader’s chart, he appears to suggest that FLOKI is mirroring Pepe’s ( PEPE ) late 2023 to early 2024 price action when the Ethereum-based memecoin went parabolic after months of sideways movement. The trader seems to predict that FLOKI will hit a new all-time high of $0.0005 before the end of Q1. At time of writing, FLOKI is trading at $0.00019.

The CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, Hunter Horsley, has suggested that the economic policies of the Trump administration could have a major impact on the cryptocurrency sector. In a recent tweet, Horsley noted that the potential deregulation of mergers and acquisitions could allow major companies like Google or Amazon to expand even further through strategic acquisitions. M&As refer to the consolidation of companies, either through the merging of businesses or the purchase of one company by another. This process often helps corporations achieve economies of scale, expand market share, or acquire critical assets. Trump administration may unfreeze M&A. Large corporates — mag 7, etc — may finally be able to wield their market cap. Amazon could buy Instacart. Google could buy Uber. etc etc The big may get bigger, and the middle may shrink. If that happens, I think it will accelerate… — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) January 5, 2025 Horsley argued that this concentration of power could drive the adoption of decentralized systems, aligning with the core tenet of cryptocurrency: the skepticism toward centralized organizations. He believes that as large corporations gain more control, the demand for cryptocurrencies—designed to offer an alternative to such institutions—could grow. Corporate behemoths like Google and Amazon are becoming increasingly interested in blockchain technology and digital assets as they look for ways to enter the crypto markets. One example of a blockchain-related service that Amazon Web Services has introduced is Amazon Managed Blockchain , which enables companies to create and oversee scalable blockchain networks. With this action, Amazon establishes itself as a major force in the expanding enterprise blockchain market. By establishing strategic alliances with prominent blockchain initiatives and participating in campaigns to incorporate blockchain technology into its cloud infrastructure, Google has also increased its presence in the cryptocurrency sector. Blockchain-as-a-service is now available on Google Cloud , allowing companies to create and implement decentralized apps. These initiatives demonstrate how major companies are using blockchain technology to diversify their business models while leveraging traditional M&As to expand their reach, thereby further driving the adoption of decentralized systems.

Trump’s victory has been welcomed by many in the cryptocurrency industry, given his pro-business stance and policies that are seen as supportive of digital assets and blockchain technology. These policies have fueled a bullish trend in the market, with experts attributing much of the surge to a more favorable regulatory approach under Trump’s administration. Since Trump’s election win, the cryptocurrency market has seen notable growth, with the biggest example being Bitcoin which surged from approximately $69,000 on Nov. 8, 2024, to over $100,000 in early December.

Experts also believe this rise is driven by the political shift and the potential loosening of regulations, which may create a more favorable environment for digital assets. Horsley is the CEO of Bitwise , an investment firm that has exclusively focused on cryptocurrency investments for the past seven years. The company offers a range of products including crypto-focused funds, ETFs, and others, designed to provide investors exposure to the crypto and Web3 markets. According to Horsley, the influence of major market players—along with regulatory changes—could shape the future of both digital assets and traditional financial systems in 2025, making this an exciting time for both M&A activity and the cryptocurrency sector.

Sebagai pemimpin koin meme, DOGE saat ini menguji resistensi kritis di sekitar level $0,40, yang dapat menjadi penentu langkah selanjutnya. Analis ternama Bluntz baru-baru ini membagikan analisis yang mendalam, menekankan bahwa Dogecoin sedang berada dalam fase akumulasi strategis. Menurut Bluntz, fase ini menjadi dasar untuk lonjakan agresif di siklus selanjutnya, yang berpotensi memberikan keuntungan signifikan bagi DOGE. Fase akumulasi seperti ini sering kali menjadi pertanda pergerakan naik yang eksplosif, terutama untuk aset dengan dukungan komunitas yang kuat seperti Dogecoin. Hari-hari mendatang akan menjadi penentu bagi DOGE dalam usahanya menembus level resistensi $0,40. Jika DOGE berhasil melakukan breakout, ini dapat memicu rally bullish yang memperkuat posisinya sebagai favorit pasar. Sebaliknya, kegagalan untuk menembus zona ini dapat menyebabkan konsolidasi jangka pendek, yang akan menunda lonjakan yang diantisipasi. Dogecoin Menyiapkan Rally Dogecoin menunjukkan aksi harga bullish yang kuat sejak awal November, melawan volatilitas pasar dan menarik perhatian investor. Meskipun sempat mengalami koreksi, harga DOGE berhasil pulih, menandakan potensi pertumbuhan lebih lanjut di masa depan. Bluntz baru-baru ini membagikan analisis teknis di X (platform media sosial) , yang menunjukkan fase akumulasi pada rasio DOGE/BTC. Menurutnya, rasio ini “masih dalam fase akumulasi,” mengindikasikan bahwa Dogecoin sedang mempersiapkan rally signifikan dalam siklus ini. Bluntz dengan percaya diri menyatakan bahwa tidak ada kemungkinan DOGE gagal melonjak selama bull run kali ini, mencerminkan pandangannya yang optimis terhadap koin meme ini. Meskipun prospek Dogecoin terlihat menjanjikan, risiko tetap ada. Volatilitas adalah karakteristik utama pasar kripto, dan Dogecoin tidak terkecuali. Selain itu, lanskap ekonomi global yang lebih luas juga menambah ketidakpastian, dengan kenaikan suku bunga, inflasi, dan tekanan ekonomi global memengaruhi sentimen investor. Faktor-faktor ini dapat menyebabkan fluktuasi harga yang tajam bagi DOGE. Bagi investor jangka panjang, fase akumulasi Dogecoin saat ini mungkin menjadi peluang untuk masuk ke pasar sebelum breakout potensial terjadi. Namun, pendekatan yang hati-hati dan manajemen risiko tetap sangat penting, terutama mengingat sifat pasar kripto yang tidak terduga serta dinamika ekonomi global. Jika Dogecoin berhasil melewati level resistensi kunci, ini dapat memvalidasi tesis bullish Bluntz dan memperkuat statusnya sebagai salah satu performer terbaik di siklus ini. Harga dalam Konsolidasi Saat ini, Dogecoin diperdagangkan pada $0,38 setelah menghadapi resistensi di level $0,40. Level ini untuk sementara menghentikan momentum kenaikan DOGE, menempatkan harga dalam fase konsolidasi. Fase perdagangan sideways seperti ini bukanlah hal yang langka dan dapat berlangsung selama beberapa hari atau bahkan minggu saat pasar mengumpulkan kekuatan untuk pergerakan berikutnya. Meskipun ada jeda, optimisme tetap tinggi di kalangan investor dan analis. Level $0,43 kini muncul sebagai resistensi kritis bagi DOGE. Jika berhasil melakukan breakout yang bersih di atas level ini, momentum bullish yang diperbarui dapat mendorong Dogecoin ke level tertinggi dalam beberapa tahun terakhir atau bahkan mencetak all-time high baru. Pencapaian ini kemungkinan besar akan menarik perhatian baru dari investor ritel maupun institusi, yang selanjutnya mendukung pergerakan naiknya. Namun, jalur ke depan tidak tanpa tantangan. Sentimen pasar dan tren kripto yang lebih luas akan memainkan peran signifikan dalam menentukan apakah Dogecoin dapat mengumpulkan kekuatan untuk bergerak lebih tinggi. Jika fase konsolidasi disertai dengan peningkatan volume perdagangan dan dukungan pembelian yang kuat, skenario breakout menjadi semakin mungkin terjadi.",Dogecoin,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-06 01:13:18

With Bitcoin and Ethereum continuing to dominate headlines, forward-looking investors are hunting for hidden gems that promise substantial returns. Among these opportunities is Qubetics ($TICS), an ecosystem poised to revolutionise Web3 infrastructure with innovation and unmatched functionality. Alongside industry giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, this best altcoin for exponential returns stands out as a smart pick for savvy investors. 1. Qubetics: The Ultimate Web3 Platform for the Best Altcoin for Exponential Returns Qubetics ($TICS) is redefining the Web3 landscape with its forward-thinking features, particularly its decentralised VPN (dVPN). Unlike centralised VPNs that can track, restrict, or censor user traffic, Qubetics introduces a fully peer-to-peer network. This blockchain-based solution ensures users’ unmatched privacy, security, and freedom globally. The decentralised architecture eliminates any central authority, offering complete censorship resistance and transparency. Using blockchain technology, Qubetics dVPN guarantees secure, anonymous internet access with multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption. Users also benefit through tokenised incentives, as participants providing bandwidth are rewarded with TICS tokens. This dynamic creates an efficient, user-driven marketplace while enhancing accessibility and privacy. Currently in Presale Phase 15, Qubetics is setting the stage for massive gains. With weekly phases bringing a 10% price hike and a final-stage increase of 20%, early adopters can lock in substantial profits. The $TICS token is priced at just $0.0414, with over $8.7M raised, more than 399M tokens sold, and 13,300+ holders already on board. Analysts predict a target of $0.25 per token post-presale, presenting an impressive ROI potential of 503% for investors entering now. Some forecasts even suggest Qubetics could soar to $10–$15 after the mainnet launch, highlighting its status as one of the best altcoins for exponential returns . 2. Bitcoin: The Undisputed King of Crypto Bitcoin needs no introduction. As the original cryptocurrency, it revolutionised digital finance and earned the title of “digital gold.” Bitcoin’s decentralised network and fixed supply of 21 million coins continue to make it the go-to asset for institutional and retail investors. With growing adoption as both a store of value and an inflation hedge, Bitcoin remains the benchmark for stability and trust in the volatile crypto market. Bitcoin made this list because it continues to lead the way in market dominance and institutional confidence. 3. Ethereum: The Foundation of Decentralised Applications Ethereum stands at the heart of decentralised finance (DeFi) and smart contracts. Its robust ecosystem enables developers to build decentralised applications (dApps), NFTs, and protocols that shape the Web3 future. With the recent shift to Ethereum 2.0 and its proof-of-stake consensus, the network now offers greater energy efficiency and scalability. Ethereum’s versatility and functionality fuel innovation across multiple sectors, making it a key player in crypto. Ethereum earned its place here because its infrastructure powers blockchain technology’s most innovative use cases. Conclusion: Best Cryptos for Exponential Returns Are Here Based on the latest research, the best cryptos for exponential returns include Qubetics ($TICS), Bitcoin, and Ethereum. Among these, Qubetics leads the charge with its innovative decentralised VPN service and unmatched presale opportunity. With the presale phase nearing a 10% price hike and an ROI potential of 503%, investors have a rare chance to enter at the ground level before exponential growth.

Trump’s Pet Doge (TRUMDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Pet Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Pet Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Pet Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Pet Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Pet Doge by entering its contract address – 6e6jZxV1zG7GGLF5MoJZf8nY4u17x8dceDatSWiTE573 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-06 02:22:00

With names as quirky as their concepts, these coins have become a cultural phenomenon, captivating Gen Z and Millennials alike. Today, we’re diving into three standout projects: BTFD Coin, Cat in a Dog’s World, and Dogs. These coins are not just about laughs; they’re serious about giving you solid returns. Before we get into the details, let’s rewind to 1973—a year when the global economy experienced a major collapse. What did smart investors do? They bought the dips, turning chaos into opportunity. Sound familiar? Let’s talk about why meme coins could be your golden ticket this week. Best new meme coins to join this week have redefined what it means to invest in crypto. They started as a joke but quickly morphed into legitimate assets with massive communities. The likes of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu paved the way, but now BTFD Coin is setting a new standard. With its P2E (Play-to-Earn) game, referral program, staking rewards, and strong community backing, BTFD Coin isn’t just another coin; it’s a movement. Let’s explore why it’s topping the charts and how it compares to Cat in a Dog’s World and Dogs. BTFD Coin: The Bull’s Charge to Glory BTFD Coin has exploded onto the crypto scene, raising over $4.9 million in its presale. Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, it’s now in Stage 13 of its 16-stage presale, priced at $0.000142. By the time it’s listed at $0.0006, early investors are looking at life-changing gains. To put it into perspective, investing $2,000 at the price of $0.000142 would get you 14.08 million BTFD coins . When the price hits $0.0006 at the end of the presale, your investment would soar to $8,448 . That’s the kind of return you can’t ignore! The coin’s appeal isn’t just its numbers. It’s backed by a robust ecosystem, including a P2E game that keeps players engaged while earning rewards. The referral program adds another layer of excitement, incentivising users to spread the word. And let’s not forget the staking rewards, offering a passive income stream for holders. What truly sets BTFD Coin apart is its community. Over 7,700 Bulls are already on board, creating a buzz that’s hard to ignore. Analysts are predicting big things for BTFD, and with its current momentum, it’s shaping up to be one of the best new meme coins to join this week. Oh, and don’t miss the BIG50 bonus code. Use it on the presale page to snag the bonused price. Simply head to the presale page, connect your wallet, enter the bonus code, and confirm your purchase. It’s as simple as that. Cat in a Dog’s World: The Underdog with Nine Lives Cat in a Dog’s World is the rebel of the meme coin universe. It flips the script by putting a cat at the centre of a dog-dominated market. Its tagline? “A cat that barks louder than dogs.” This project is as quirky as it sounds, but don’t let the humour fool you—it’s got some serious potential. The coin has garnered a dedicated community that thrives on its cheeky branding and unique tokenomics. Cat in a Dog’s World focuses heavily on social engagement, making it a hit among Gen Z. It’s not just about memes; the project plans to launch Cat NFTs and a DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation) to give holders a say in its future direction. Financially, it’s still in its early stages, making it a high-risk, high-reward option. Unlike BTFD Coin, it doesn’t have a P2E game or staking rewards yet, but its roadmap promises some exciting developments. If you’re looking for a project with a rebellious spirit and the potential to disrupt the market, Cat in a Dog’s World might just be the best new meme coin to join this week. Dogs: The OG Meme Coin with a Twist Dogs is a nostalgic nod to the early days of meme coins, but with a modern twist. It’s built on the premise that every dog has its day, and for Dogs, that day is now. With a focus on charity, Dogs aims to give back while making you rich. A portion of every transaction goes to animal shelters, making it a feel-good investment. The project has already made waves with its transparent team and clear roadmap. It’s not just about charity; Dogs also features a staking program and plans to launch a P2E game. However, it’s worth noting that its ROI potential doesn’t quite match BTFD Coin’s explosive numbers. That said, Dogs is a solid pick for those who value community and sustainability. Why Now Is the Time to Invest The 1973 economic collapse taught us a valuable lesson: in times of uncertainty, buying the dips can yield incredible rewards. Meme coins are the modern-day equivalent of that strategy. They’re not just investments; they’re cultural movements with the power to create generational wealth. BTFD Coin’s presale performance is a testament to this. With over 58 billion coins sold and a community that’s growing by the day, it’s a prime example of why meme coins are the best new meme coins to join this week. And don’t forget, the BIG50 bonus code is your ticket to maximising returns. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale Ready to dive in? Here’s how: Go to the Presale Page at https://www.btfd.io/buy-now/. Click “Connect Wallet” and select your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Enter the Bonus Code BIG50 and click “Apply.” Input the amount of $BTFD you want to buy and review the bonus coins.

From Bitcoin smashing new highs to altcoins carving out unique niches, it’s a whirlwind of opportunity. But for those looking to make smart short-term investments, understanding which coins are hot right now is key. The best coins to invest in for short term are often the ones riding waves of innovation and adoption. Enter Qubetics ($TICS), a revolutionary Layer 1 blockchain that’s turning heads with its focus on real-world asset tokenisation. It’s bringing an entirely new dimension to the blockchain space by making tokenisation accessible to everyone, not just the elite. Let’s explore how Qubetics, along with Polkadot, Ripple, Ethereum, and Solana, are redefining short-term crypto investments. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Democratising Real-World Asset Tokenisation Qubetics is making waves in the crypto community, and its presale numbers speak for themselves. In its 15th stage, the presale has already raised over $8.7 million from more than 13,300 holders. With 399 million tokens sold and a price tag of $0.0414, the presale is nearing a 10% price jump as it moves to the 14th stage this weekend. Investors are catching on quickly to what makes Qubetics unique. At its core, Qubetics is about solving the big issues that have held blockchain back. While other projects focus on single-use cases, Qubetics is creating a broad ecosystem centred on interoperability and real-world applications. It’s not just about holding a token; it’s about owning a piece of the future. Real-World Asset Tokenisation: A Game-Changer Picture this: you’ve always wanted to invest in high-end real estate or art, but those opportunities were reserved for the wealthy. With Qubetics’ tokenisation marketplace, everyday investors can own fractional shares of these assets. A single parent saving for their child’s college tuition could buy a share of a tokenised real estate property. A small business owner could diversify their investments by purchasing fractionalised shares in fine art or vintage cars. Qubetics isn’t just about making these opportunities accessible; it’s about ensuring transparency and security. The marketplace uses blockchain to verify ownership, reducing fraud and eliminating intermediaries. Whether you’re a tech-savvy millennial or someone dipping a toe into crypto for the first time, Qubetics makes it simple. Why did this coin make it to this list? Qubetics is revolutionising the way we think about investments, bringing opportunities that were once exclusive to high-net-worth individuals to the masses. Its presale success and innovative approach make it one of the best coins to invest in for short term. 2. Polkadot (DOT): The Interoperability Leader Polkadot has been busy expanding its ecosystem, and the results are showing. Its parachain auctions have attracted significant interest, enabling new projects to launch on its network. The ability to connect blockchains seamlessly has made Polkadot a favourite for developers and investors alike. Market Performance and Short-Term Potential With DOT trading around $4.80, it’s seen steady growth driven by developer activity and ecosystem expansion. As new parachains go live, the demand for DOT as a staking and governance token is expected to rise, presenting a solid short-term investment opportunity. Why did this coin make it to this list? Polkadot’s focus on interoperability and its thriving developer community position it as a top pick for short-term gains. 3. Ripple (XRP): The Cross-Border Payments Pioneer Ripple continues to dominate the cross-border payments space, and recent developments are only bolstering its position. With its RLUSD stablecoin gaining regulatory approval and partnerships with major financial institutions, XRP’s ecosystem is stronger than ever. Market Performance and Growth XRP is currently trading at $2.40, following a 400% increase in recent weeks.

Pepe the Boss (PEPEBOSS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEBOSS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe the Boss can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe the Boss could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe the Boss launched with over $8,500 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe the Boss on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe the Boss by entering its contract address – 5pgsjH712NZ6eaKunsEfZarG9UotHaxvheW5E39a8NFX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEBOSS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-06 03:50:00
