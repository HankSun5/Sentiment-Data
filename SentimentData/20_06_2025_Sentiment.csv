Ruvi AI’s (RUVI) Early Entry Bonuses And Growing Hype Could Turn $1,500 Into 6 Figures",https://timestabloid.com/ripple-xrp-too-slow-ruvi-ais-ruvi-early-entry-bonuses-and-growing/,"Ripple (XRP) has long been a favorite for those seeking a stable and utility-driven cryptocurrency, built for efficient cross-border payments. Yet, its measured growth has often left investors craving a faster path to larger returns. Enter Ruvi AI (RUVI) , a blockchain and AI-powered project making waves with its impressive early performance and massive growth potential. Analysts and investors alike are pointing to Ruvi AI as a far more dynamic investment, thanks to its innovative model and potential to turn $1,500 into six figures . Why Investors Are Considering Ruvi AI Over Ripple While Ripple focuses heavily on financial institutions and cross-border transaction efficiency, Ruvi AI widens its scope by addressing critical challenges in marketing , entertainment , and finance . Incorporating both blockchain technology and artificial intelligence , Ruvi AI creates scalable solutions that meet real-world needs. What differentiates Ruvi AI from Ripple is its structured growth model , which provides investors with immediate returns and long-term potential. Currently in Phase 2 of its presale , RUVI tokens are priced at $0.015 each , offering an affordable entry point for early backers. Post-presale, the token price increases to $0.07 per token, delivering a nearly 5x return before the token is publicly listed. Analysts further project Ruvi AI could reach $1 per token , representing a 66x ROI and a clear advantage for proactive investors. Presale Success Showcases Momentum Ruvi AI’s presale has already achieved significant milestones, a marker of investor confidence in its value-driven proposition. With over $1.8 million raised and 1,600+ holders , the platform has additionally sold more than 160 million tokens , solidifying its growing reputation in the market. Unlike speculative projects, Ruvi AI’s roadmap includes a guaranteed price increase to $0.07 after the presale. This transparency gives investors clarity and reduces risks, establishing Ruvi AI as a standout in an often volatile crypto space. VIP Tiers Provide Exceptional Bonus Opportunities Beyond offering early entry pricing, Ruvi AI features VIP tiers , designed to reward contributors with substantial bonus token allocations. These bonuses significantly amplify the earning potential for investors: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These lucrative VIP tiers underline the importance of joining Ruvi AI’s presale early for optimal gains. Built on Transparency and Security A significant part of Ruvi AI’s rapid success stems from its dedication to transparency and security , values that resonate strongly with investors. Ruvi AI has partnered with CyberScope , a top blockchain auditing firm, for a third-party audit , ensuring its systems meet rigorous security standards. Additionally, Ruvi AI has teamed up with WEEX Exchange , guaranteeing post-presale liquidity and paving the way for seamless trading once the token is publicly listed. This partnership reflects Ruvi AI’s commitment to building a trustworthy ecosystem for its investors. Real-World Utility Drives Long-Term Demand Ruvi AI’s significance reaches far beyond its potential for immediate returns. By solving real-world problems across major industries, it establishes a sustainable demand for RUVI tokens. Some of its notable applications include: Marketing: With AI-powered tools for ad targeting and campaign optimization, Ruvi AI helps businesses improve ROI and reach their ideal audiences. Entertainment: Blockchain-supported payment systems paired with AI-curated recommendations allow creators to monetize efficiently while engaging users more effectively. Finance: Ruvi AI’s tools for fraud prevention, transparency, and operational scalability empower financial institutions to modernize. These applications ensure Ruvi AI’s longevity, making it more than just a short-term investment opportunity. Why Ruvi AI Can Outpace Ripple Ripple’s stability makes it a decent choice for conservative investors, but Ruvi AI’s $0.015 presale pricing , guaranteed rise to $0.07 post-presale , and projected $1 valuation provide unparalleled upside for those seeking explosive growth. Having already raised $1.8 million , sold 160 million tokens , and secured partnerships with CyberScope and WEEX Exchange , Ruvi AI is proving to be a leader in the blockchain and AI space. If you’ve been searching for a promising investment that could turn $1,500 into six figures , Ruvi AI is likely your best bet. Don’t wait to join this revolutionary opportunity.

While many projects talk big but deliver little, a few are setting themselves apart with real-world milestones. These four projects, BlockDAG, XRP, PEPE, and Sui, showcase the power of delivering tangible results. From miner rollouts to institutional finance, each one highlights what it means to turn vision into reality in the Web3 space. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Hardware Shipment & Network Participation BlockDAG leads by example among top crypto assets, taking a practical step by shipping real mining hardware. Beginning July 7, users will receive the X-Series lineup, including X10, X30, and X100 models. These units are ready-to-use, bringing real mining capability into users’ hands. The X10 targets new entrants, while the X30 and X100 serve high-performance needs. Built on a hybrid DAG and Proof-of-Work model, BlockDAG blends accessibility with proven security. Unlike many presale projects, it’s already delivering physical results. With $312 million raised in its presale and 22.8 billion coins sold across 29 batches, BlockDAG shows strong support. The coin is currently priced at $0.0276, and early participants have seen a 2,660% ROI. Until June 20, a reduced rate of $0.0018 remains available. BlockDAG is not about speculation; it’s about building and scaling ahead of exchange listings. 2. PEPE: Community Strength & Viral Appeal PEPE stands out not for enterprise use but for its ability to dominate conversations and generate high engagement. As a meme-driven coin, PEPE thrives on cultural recognition and strong community backing. It gained traction quickly, with rapid price increases and widespread exchange listings. Although it lacks a technical roadmap, it offers users speculative excitement and strong liquidity. Its place among the top crypto assets in 2025 comes from community growth and social momentum. 3. XRP: Reliable Utility in Cross-Border Finance XRP continues to be recognized among the top crypto assets due to its consistent use case in global payments. It supports quick, low-cost transfers, making it a practical solution for institutions. Despite legal battles involving Ripple, the team behind XRP, the project has secured significant partnerships. These developments suggest long-term alignment with the financial sector. XRP’s performance is driven by steady utility rather than hype, appealing to those who prioritize function and reliability. 4. Sui (SUI): Technical Foundation for Scalable Applications Sui brings speed and scale to the Layer-1 blockchain space. Built by Mysten Labs and leveraging the Move programming language, Sui enables secure and efficient smart contract execution. What sets Sui apart is its proven capacity to handle real-world transactions. Its parallel execution and near-instant finality create a strong foundation for developers and applications. Ongoing support and tooling improvements have strengthened its reputation. Rather than chasing hype, Sui focuses on enabling real use. Its technical progress and builder-centric approach make it a long-term contender in the Web3 infrastructure category. Which Are the Top Crypto Assets of 2025? When it comes to the top crypto assets of 2025 , the common thread is tangible progress. BlockDAG leads with hardware rollout and network integration. XRP maintains relevance through enterprise adoption. PEPE shows the strength of cultural engagement. Sui offers a solid technical base for application development. For anyone seeking more than promises, these projects show what execution, utility, and community can achieve in a growing Web3 world.

As expected, the central bank did not make changes to its federal funds rate. However, Chairman Jerome Powell did assert that they still expect to make two rate cuts this year. As a result, he may have calmed down the markets for a bit at a point when rising tensions in the Middle East have rattled investors. XRP is about to explode. I’m eyeing at least $8, and the market still hasn’t caught up to the fact that the SEC doesn’t consider it a security. $XRP holders are about to PRINT. I’ll drop the signal to exit right here when the moment is right. You’ll regret not following. pic.twitter.com/oiE8INoy7F — Crypto Beast (@cryptobeastreal) June 16, 2025 In the past week, XRP has accumulated a 3.2% loss. However, the crypto analyst “Crypto Beast”, whose account on X is followed by 727,000 users, seems to think that this token has significant upside potential ahead now that its regulatory headwinds have disappeared. Crypto Beast has identified a bullish price flag pattern that could result in significant gains for the native asset of the Ripple network in the near term. His baseline XRP price forecast sees a jump to $10 after a bullish breakout is confirmed. “You’ll regret not following,” he said. XRP Price Prediction: Ongoing Consolidation Confirms Crypto Beasts’ Thesis XRP has been consolidating for a while now after the token experienced a significant jump following Ripple’s legal victories against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the appointment of a new leader, Paul Atkins, for the regulatory agency. Looking at XRP’s 4-hour chart, this consolidation has been going on since Monday and shows that the price has traded range-bound between $2.33 and $2.10. Consolidation patterns tend to anticipate a big breakout ahead. They are not directional, so it is not possible to tell if they favor a bearish or bullish XRP price prediction. Traders should keep an eye on how this pattern unfolds. To further confirm Crypto Beast’s bullish XRP price prediction, the price would have to break above $2.35 with strong trading volumes. This should lead to a retest of multiple upper resistances, the first and most relevant one being the $2.65 level. Although XRP has failed to deliver the outstanding gains that investors may have been expecting throughout this year, Bitcoin (BTC) has already made a new all-time high as the top crypto is seen as a safe haven. A new crypto presale called Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) aims to unlock the huge potential of Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem by launching a Solana-power layer-2 scaling solution. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Raises $1.4M in Less Than a Month to Launch its L2 Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) leverages the efficiency of the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to launch a layer-2 protocol for the Bitcoin network that will support the rapid expansion of its DeFi and meme coin ecosystem. This solution will support cheap and fast asset transfer of Bitcoin tokens through a secure L2 that offers near-instant finality on all transactions. The L2’s architecture is quite simple. BTC tokens are transferred to a Bitcoin address monitored by Bitcoin Hyper’s Canonical Bridge. Once the assets are received, they will be minted in the L2 via smart contracts. As this solution gains popularity and becomes widely adopted by wallets and exchanges, the demand for $HYPER will explode. To buy this token at its discounted presale price, head to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to invest.

46372989,https://timestabloid.com/?p=71650,1750374327,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Pundit Uses $100 XRP Price to Prove Market Is Still Early,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-uses-100-xrp-price-to-prove-market-is-still-early/,"In a recent market update, prominent cryptocurrency commentator known as The Modern Investor asserted that the current valuations of major digital assets, including XRP and Bitcoin, suggest the broader crypto market has not yet reached maturity. His analysis focused particularly on XRP’s price level and long-term growth potential, positioning today’s market as an early-stage opportunity for strategic investors. XRP and Bitcoin Prices Reflect an Unfinished Market Cycle At the time of the analysis, XRP was trading at approximately $2.14, while Bitcoin remained under $105,000, far from the multi-million-dollar valuations that some long-term projections have anticipated for Bitcoin. The Modern Investor argued that these figures are indicative of a market still in development, emphasizing that significant growth potential remains across multiple cycles. According to him, many investors mistakenly believe they’ve missed their chance due to not entering the market during the earliest phases. However, he pointed out that the lack of a $100 XRP or a $2 million Bitcoin reinforces the idea that there is still considerable time for patient accumulation and strategy. Long-Term Growth and Accumulation Strategies Referencing an earlier claim by a market observer who projected that XRP could eventually reach the $100 mark , The Modern Investor noted that the target, while ambitious, could be realized throughout several bull markets. He stressed that long-term accumulation and disciplined investing are often underestimated strategies. According to his view, the growth potential of cryptocurrencies like XRP is not just theoretical; it is supported by previous market trends where assets have seen exponential increases over extended periods. The video also addressed recent commentary from market voices such as Edoardo Farina, who has urged investors to aim for holding at least 10,000 XRP. At today’s price, that target would require an investment of roughly $21,400. While Farina presented this as a worthwhile benchmark, The Modern Investor raised concerns about its practicality for the average retail investor. He acknowledged that while the intent behind such advice may be well-meaning, it may not account for the financial limitations many individuals face. Interestingly, Farina has expressed similar views, recognizing that acquiring such a position is becoming increasingly difficult . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Modern Investor described it as a hard truth, one that reflects how quickly digital asset prices can become inaccessible to everyday participants. Ownership Distribution and Market Positioning Further illustrating this point, data from the XRP Rich List indicates that owning around 11,000 XRP places an investor within the top 4% of all XRP wallet holders. Out of more than 6.5 million wallets, just over 263,000 meet this threshold. This suggests that even a relatively modest XRP holding by future standards could place investors in a highly advantageous position if the market moves as projected. If XRP were to reach $100, owning 10,000 tokens would translate to a portfolio worth $1 million. According to The Modern Investor, many long-time investors who adopted a strategy of small, consistent purchases over several years have already met or exceeded their goals through persistence and planning. Market Opportunities Remain Despite the recent price increases, The Modern Investor emphasized that opportunities still exist. While prices like $0.50 XRP are no longer available, he argued that the market’s current state still allows for smart investment decisions. He also discussed the growing trend of staking major assets, including XRP and Bitcoin, to generate passive income, viewing it as another avenue for building long-term financial security. The Modern Investor maintains that the absence of a $100 XRP should be interpreted not as a missed opportunity but as a sign that the market remains in its formative stages. For investors willing to remain focused and strategic, the path to meaningful gains is still accessible. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Musk’s companies merged following a $33B acquisition of the social media platform, X, by the billionaire’s AI startup, xAI. The move has drawn new regulatory scrutiny from the European Union, and it could have potential consequences that change the relationship between large tech companies and EU law. xAI buys out X The European Commission has reportedly sent a fresh wave of inquiries to X concerning the implications of the March buyout. The deal raised xAI’s value to $80B and effectively placed X under the AI startup’s umbrella. The move raised concern in Brussels that the restructuring could affect the scale of penalties the company may face under the Digital Services Act (DSA). Under the DSA, the EU holds the power to fine digital firms for up to 6% of their annual global turnover if they fail to address illegal content, disinformation, or comply with transparency requirements. According to insiders cited in publications, the European Commission is currently evaluating whether to include revenue from Musk’s other ventures, such as SpaceX , Neuralink, and The Boring Company, when calculating a potential fine against X. By attaching the penalties to the company’s total global revenue, the regulation raises the stakes for large corporations like Musk’s X. “We are following closely changes in the corporate structure of X, as we would changes in any other designated platform,” The Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier said on Thursday. He confirmed that the Commission sent a request for information to X, emphasizing that such structural changes could influence the ongoing investigation. EU regulators may pass fine decision by summer Regulators have yet to issue their first major penalty under the DSA, and insiders have revealed that a decision regarding X’s case could come before the Commission’s summer recess in August. However, the timeline for the decision remains unclear because the final size or even the rationale for a fine is still being determined. The investigation into X started in 2023 and is a result of multiple suspected DSA breaches, including the platform’s failure to curb disinformation, lapses in transparency for advertisers and researchers, and most notably, the controversial overhaul of its blue checkmark system. The European Commission argued that the change to the checkmark policy deviated from established industry norms and contributed to a more opaque information environment. X explained the blue checkmark’s current functionality in a recent attempt to avoid penalties, but it is unclear if it satisfied the Commission’s inquiry. Platforms under DSA scrutiny have the opportunity to make binding commitments to address violations in exchange for leniency. Brussels has thus far shown limited tolerance for superficial fixes. X has yet to respond publicly to the Commission’s latest inquiries. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

The project’s decentralized oracle technology revolutionized blockchain connectivity, helping Chainlink earn a reputation as one of the most popular cryptocurrency launches of its time. However, with prices now down more than 75% from that peak, those late to join have found themselves searching for the next significant opportunity. Today, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out at the center of this search. With its ongoing crypto presale at $0.3370, Qubetics offers features designed to address real-world needs, including its non-custodial multi-chain wallet. This new platform is attracting buyers who are focused on utility, growth, and security, qualities that define the most popular cryptocurrency choices today. For those seeking a fresh chance at advancement, Qubetics could be the project to watch now. Qubetics Brings Multi-Chain Wallet Convenience to Crypto The non-custodial multi-chain wallet from Qubetics addresses a crucial gap in the digital asset sector. In today’s market, many users are active on more than one blockchain. Managing funds, tracking tokens, and making transactions across networks can be confusing and time-consuming. Qubetics solves this challenge by offering a wallet where users control their assets, manage private keys, and interact seamlessly across multiple chains. A designer managing payments from international clients can now receive digital assets from various blockchains and keep them in a single secure wallet. This eliminates the need to transfer assets through multiple exchanges, saving both time and fees. For an e-commerce shop expanding into digital collectibles, the Qubetics wallet allows for simple management of different tokens, streamlining business growth. Professional service providers and consultants also benefit from the non-custodial approach. Sensitive transactions, such as legal settlements or high-value payments, are handled with full ownership and without relying on a third party. Enterprises handling payroll or supplier payments across borders can move funds securely, track everything in real time, and avoid compatibility issues between networks. By focusing on user control, privacy, and compatibility, Qubetics is setting a new standard among the most popular cryptocurrency solutions. The wallet’s ability to bridge networks and deliver convenience for a wide audience positions Qubetics as a leader in real utility and community trust. Its practical impact is becoming clear as more buyers join the ongoing crypto presale and look for technologies that can deliver lasting value. Qubetics Crypto Presale: Final Phase Unlocks High Demand Qubetics has now entered the final 37th stage of its crypto presale. Over 516 million tokens have been sold to more than 28,100 holders, and the platform has raised over $18 million so far. With less than 10 million $TICS remaining, the current price is locked at $0.3370 per token, ahead of an expected 20% increase to $0.40 at public listing. The total supply has been cut from 4 billion to 1.36 billion, with 38.55% allocated to the public. This approach puts control in the hands of the community. The combination of scarcity, transparent distribution, and practical features could drive a strong rally after Qubetics’ listing. The ongoing crypto presale stands out for those seeking the most popular cryptocurrency in its early stage, where both value and accessibility remain high. Those who buy $TICS at this stage immediately position themselves for a projected surge. Current estimates suggest $TICS could reach between $5 and $10 post-listing. The structure of this crypto presale rewards early adopters with access and growth that is rarely seen in established projects. A $25,000 entry into the current Qubetics crypto presale yields approximately 74,187 $TICS tokens at the price of $0.3370 each. If $TICS lists at $0.40, that holding would already be valued at $29,674, a 20% increase at listing alone. Should $TICS reach $1, the value rises to $74,187. A climb to $5 projects a return of $370,935, while $10 takes the total to $741,870. Participants from stage 1, who bought at $0.01, are already looking at gains above 3,270%. Although the earliest phase has ended, the current stage still offers significant return potential for those ready to join. Only a limited amount of tokens remain, creating urgency for buyers who do not want to miss out on the most popular cryptocurrency presale before the public launch. Chainlink: From All-Time Highs to a Slower Growth Cycle Chainlink began as a blockchain abstraction layer and quickly earned a place among the most popular cryptocurrency networks. The protocol’s decentralized oracle technology enables smart contracts to securely access off-chain data, powering innovations in DeFi, insurance, gaming, and more. Chainlink’s cross-chain interoperability protocol has continued to evolve, connecting blockchain networks with real-world data and services. However, Chainlink’s all-time high was reached four years ago at $52.88. Since then, the price has remained more than 75% below that record, with most late arrivals missing out on the early exponential growth. Despite regular network upgrades and expanding adoption, Chainlink’s current phase is marked by steadier growth and lower volatility. While it continues to be respected and widely integrated, the chance for new buyers to experience the dramatic wealth creation seen in the initial phase has largely passed. The market now looks for projects that combine proven technology with genuine new access. Qubetics is drawing attention as the most popular cryptocurrency for those seeking both practical features and early entry potential. Looking Ahead Market sentiment continues to shift as community members seek the next major platform with both real-world application and strong potential for returns. Qubetics stands out for its focus on interoperability, user ownership, and transparency. Its non-custodial multi-chain wallet addresses the challenges faced by modern crypto users and businesses, bringing fresh relevance to the most popular cryptocurrency debate. As the final crypto presale stage advances, Qubetics is seeing growing demand and positive coverage. Credible analysis and active community engagement signal a project with significant room to grow. Those who missed the ICO phase of earlier projects have a new chance to participate, as the opportunity remains open.

46373648,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=750302,1750374978,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46373648.jpeg,Local Texas lawmakers could delay Musk’s robotaxi launch until September,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/texas-lawmakers-could-delay-musk-robotaxi/,"Lawmakers from the Texas House of Representatives and Senate are trying to get Tesla to postpone its robotaxi launch and have signed a letter of request to this effect. The letter, which was signed on Wednesday, June 18, requests that Tesla delay its robotaxi launch until September, when new autonomous driving regulations are scheduled to go into effect. Lawmakers express concern as they push for a delay The regulations coming into effect in September would require autonomous cars to be registered under Texas law, meet certain safety and vehicle standards, and also be “capable of achieving a minimal risk condition if the automated driving system is rendered inoperable.” In accordance with the regulations, companies operating autonomous vehicles would also be required to provide a First Responder Interaction Plan to the Department of Public Safety detailing how emergency personnel should interact with driverless vehicles. The lawmakers wrote that Tesla can still go ahead with the robotaxi launch which is slated for June 22 if it responds to the letter with “detailed information demonstrating that Tesla will be compliant with the new law upon the launch of driverless operations in Austin.” However, there is at least one person among the writers of the letter who is skeptical about Tesla’s readiness to launch. “I don’t know that it is ready to be launched,” Goodwin said of Tesla robotaxis on CBS Austin on Wednesday. “There is more work that needs to be done before they let them loose on the streets.” Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk has said his company has been testing its full self-driving cars on the streets of Austin over the last month, with one driverless Tesla Model Y spotted on public roads in Austin. Musk announced plans to launch thousands of Tesla robotaxis in Austin in May, with future plans to expand to cities like San Francisco. However, in a safety test conducted by The Dawn Project, a known critic of Tesla’s self-driving tech, a Tesla Model Y with Full Self-Driving engaged was unable to stop in the presence of a school bus stop sign and child-sized dummy, raising concerns about how ready it is to be deployed. Texas is attracting autonomous vehicle companies, but public safety officials are worried about oversight As it stands, Texas has minimal regulations for autonomous vehicles, allowing operation with basic registration and insurance, which has made it an attractive hub for companies like Tesla. If Tesla decides to push forward with the launch, it will be competing on Austin’s streets with Google’s Waymo, Amazon’s Zoox, and ventures funded by automakers VW and Hyundai. Unfortunately, the lack of oversight has raised concerns among public safety officials, especially since Tesla has a history of unfulfilled self-driving promises and recent safety test failures. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) also sent Tesla a letter in May 2025, requesting to know about how its robotaxis plan to handle collisions, poor visibility, and emergency situations. Tesla has not publicly responded to either the lawmakers’ or NHTSA’s letters, though a response to the NHTSA’s letter was expected on June 19. How Tesla will respond is unclear, but the request of the Democratic lawmakers is not expected to do much to stop Tesla’s progress, especially in a Republican-dominated state, where the governor and legislative majorities favor a hands-off regulatory approach to promote the autonomous vehicle industry. To his credit, Musk is also very big on safety, noting that the company is “being super paranoid” and could shift the launch date if needed. “We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,” Musk wrote on X on June 10.

The Russian newspaper Vedomosti reported that the fund is called Crypto Factory. It is the brainchild of the Penza-based gas power unit provider Power Systems and the financial management firm Finam. Only qualified investors will be allowed access to the fund. Investors’ money will go toward powering BTC mining rigs on farms that use natural gas. The fund’s operators will then sell the Bitcoin (BTC) they mine and provide regular payouts to the investors. Power Systems’ Bitcoin mining rigs. (Source: Power Systems Crypto/Instagram) Russian Power Firm’s BTC Mining CEF In the financial world, CEFs usually refer to investment funds that issue a fixed number of shares only once, typically during an initial offering. Unlike traditional open-ended funds, their issuers do not continuously issue or redeem shares. Instead, CEF shares are traded on a stock exchange, much like individual stocks. Power Systems said that it would send investors analytics data. It will also let them access CCTV camera feeds that monitor work at the mining farms. The fund’s term is five years, and with an initial capital worth 850 million rubles (around $11 million. Potential investors must put a minimum of 5 million rubles ($63,719) into the fund, the company said. The power firm says its basic financial model assumes a return of 49% per annum. It also promised 10% per year interim payments, with a quarterly frequency. Finam said that the shares would not be made available on secondary markets. It said that its commission fee would be 1% of the average annual value of the fund’s net assets. The #crypto market is down again today, and #BTC fell below $105,000.

Providing BTC prices do not drop below this rate, investors could expect to make money from their stakes, the company said. The exact cost of mining BTC in Russia remains unclear, with power prices varying from region to region. Experts said at the end of the past financial year that US miners spent an average of $82,162 to mine BTC 1.

Having remained relatively cautious about allowing investors access to crypto-related financial products in the past, Moscow has become decidedly more bullish in 2025. At the end of May, the Russian Central Bank allowed financial institutions to offer qualified investors access to crypto derivative products. And earlier this month, the Moscow Exchange began offering a Bitcoin futures contract product for qualified investors. The product is linked to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). It is the exchange’s first crypto-related product. Power Systems, founded in 2005, has recently turned its attention to gas-powered crypto mining operations, using associated gas . The latter often releases during oil drilling operations. Drillers usually flare this gas on site if they cannot find an immediate use for it. The firm claimed that mining BTC at gas fields “helps reduce costs.” It added that this not only makes mining cheaper, but also helps reduce miners’ carbon footprints.

The development was recently discussed by George Tung, co-founder of CryptosRus, who described the integration as a major strategic move. Cardano to Strengthen Cross-Chain Compatibility Hoskinson confirmed on June 14 via X that his team is actively developing tools to enable stronger XRP compatibility within Cardano. This includes the introduction of XRP-based DeFi products, integration of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, and participation of XRP holders in upcoming airdrops. These developments mark a significant step in Cardano’s long-term goal of becoming a multi-chain platform. There is a whole XRP package with the glacier drop, lace wallet support, XRP DeFi and the RealUSD talks. — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 14, 2025 Among the proposed initiatives is the Glacier Airdrop , now set to take place in Q4 2025. The airdrop will involve the distribution of Midnight tokens, a privacy-oriented token designed for Cardano’s Midnight sidechain, to users on multiple blockchain networks, including XRP. While initially scheduled earlier, the timeline was extended to accommodate broader cross-chain coordination. The aim is to attract XRP users to Cardano’s ecosystem and encourage the adoption of its privacy-enabled solutions. Lace Wallet to Introduce XRP Support Cardano’s Lace wallet is also on track to expand its supported assets. Following the successful rollout of Bitcoin support in Lace version 1.22 in April 2025, the next update will include functionality for XRP . This upgrade will allow users to manage XRP alongside native assets such as ADA and Bitcoin from a single interface. The addition of XRP support reflects Cardano’s broader efforts to create a unified and user-friendly environment for managing digital assets. It underscores the project’s commitment to building infrastructure that supports multiple leading cryptocurrencies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP DeFi Tools and RLUSD Stablecoin Under Development In addition to the wallet and token initiatives, Cardano is working on integrating XRP into its DeFi framework. Current development efforts are focused on establishing decentralized exchanges and cross-chain liquidity pools that leverage XRP’s efficiency and transaction speed. These tools are intended to offer users faster and lower-cost trading options while contributing to Cardano’s overall DeFi expansion. Furthermore, early-stage discussions are taking place between Cardano and Ripple to enable RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, on the Cardano network. Though still under consideration, both entities are exploring the potential benefits of such collaboration. Successful implementation of RLUSD could diversify stablecoin offerings within the Cardano ecosystem and attract a broader user base. Strategic Integration to Boost Cardano’s DeFi Metrics Hoskinson has previously stated that the integration of assets such as Bitcoin and XRP could be central to Cardano’s projected growth over the next several years. He emphasized that supporting projects centered on these cryptocurrencies could help Cardano significantly increase its total value locked (TVL), potentially exceeding that of competing blockchains like Solana and Ethereum. By committing to cross-chain integration and fostering partnerships with major crypto assets, Cardano is positioning itself as a competitive force in the evolving DeFi landscape. Hoskinson’s strategy appears focused on building infrastructure that facilitates accessibility, interoperability, and growth through targeted collaborations, particularly with Ripple and the XRP community.

Traders are now scanning the altcoin landscape for early opportunities—and one project is starting to stand out across analyst discussions and trading desks alike. Why Analysts Are Turning Their Attention to MAGACOINFINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most actively discussed altcoins right now. Unlike many short-lived meme projects, this one has evolved into something more strategic — thanks to key developments that traders are now pricing in. With the total token supply locked, analysts are highlighting this altcoin for its combination of scarcity, stability, and long-term yield potential. The project’s clean audit by HashEx and its full ownership model have further cemented credibility, drawing a different class of investor — one more focused on structure and performance than just short-term hype. What’s catching eyes now is the clear setup for accumulation: reduced transactional churn, concentrated wallet growth, and on-chain patterns indicating strategic positioning rather than exit-driven trading. MAGACOIN FINANCE may be a newer name, but the trading behaviors forming around it suggest this one has room to run. Bitcoin’s Macro Advantage Continues to Lead the Pack Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of crypto sentiment, and this month, it’s once again asserting dominance. As global economic pressure and inflationary concerns loom, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a hedge by both retail and institutional investors. This resilience gives it a dual role — both as a barometer for the entire market and as a trigger for altcoin momentum. Traders are currently tracking its consolidation behavior closely, expecting it to be the fuse for the next breakout cycle. Bitcoin’s strength continues to act as a launchpad for strategic rotations into high-potential altcoins. XRP Inches Closer to Regulatory Clarity XRP is riding a wave of renewed optimism as developments surrounding its legal battle with the SEC begin to take shape. A proposed motion to unlock $125 million from escrow has hinted at the closing stages of litigation, and investors are watching with heightened anticipation. Some analysts believe an end to this prolonged case could unleash significant institutional capital, particularly if the XRP ETF rumors hold weight. In parallel, Ripple’s strategic vision of handling up to 14% of SWIFT’s global cross-border transactions in the future gives XRP added long-term weight. SOL, TRX, and KAS React in Different Ways Solana (SOL) continues to hold its position as one of the most active blockchains by user participation. While no major headlines have surfaced recently, Solana’s stability and developer momentum remain positive signals. Traders see it as a consistent contender in the Layer 1 race. TRON (TRX) is staying in the spotlight for its transaction reliability and stablecoin support. Though the market has seen limited price excitement, Justin Sun’s ongoing engagement continues to support the network’s visibility and ecosystem activity. Kaspa (KAS), meanwhile, has had a quieter cycle. Without fresh announcements, KAS maintains a low-profile stance — yet some traders view this calm period as a potential accumulation window depending on upcoming ecosystem signals. Final Thoughts Bitcoin and XRP are proving their staying power this cycle, but the real question for traders is where to find early entries with future momentum. SOL, TRX, and KAS all offer different appeal — yet MAGACOINFINANCE stands apart with confirmed scarcity, passive yield potential, and investor traction. As analysts scan for altcoins positioned to break out, this one is quickly moving up the list.

This June, three presales are getting a lot of attention: MAGACOIN FINANCE, Ruvi AI, and BlockDAG Each of these projects brings something unique to the table, but one name stands out from the pack—and that’s MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The One Everyone’s Talking About Let’s be honest—most people don’t want to miss the next Shiba Inu or Dogecoin moment again. At the moment, MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be poised as the next cryptocurrency breakout to watch out for. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about names in crypto circles. From analyst mentions to investor forums, the project is everywhere, and it’s not slowing down. What’s driving the surge? It’s the sheer energy behind the brand. The tone, timing, and market are all lining up to create the kind of viral lift that’s hard to ignore. While other tokens focus on features and functions, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building a movement, and the market is clearly paying attention. Predictions for MAGACOIN FINANCE are over the roof, but what is really driving investors and institutional interest in the token is the timing, energy, and early-stage opportunity. This isn’t a slow, utility-focused token that hopes to go mainstream one day. MAGACOIN FINANCE is advancing swiftly, and according to insiders, buyer activity has been rapidly increasing. People aren’t just watching this one—they’re getting in. If you’ve ever looked back and said, “I should’ve bought earlier,” this might be one of those moments you remember. Ruvi AI: A Smart Bet for the AI Crowd Ruvi AI is offering something different. It combines blockchain with artificial intelligence to create practical tools in marketing, finance, and entertainment—and it’s doing it with a solid plan in place. With over $1.8 million already raised and more than 155 million tokens sold, it’s clear that people are taking it seriously. Analysts say it’s one of the better-planned and more organized projects in the current presale scene. Some projections suggest that Ruvi AI could deliver 66x returns once it lists, and if AI continues its current trajectory, it could become a long-term winner for patient investors. BlockDAG: Big Tech, Bigger Potential BlockDAG isn’t just another blockchain project. It’s already gained traction for its unique mix of tech, combining DAG and Proof-of-Work in a way that’s got developers and investors alike paying close attention. BlockDAG is obviously aiming for scale, as evidenced by the more than $294 million raised and the confirmed listings on 20 exchanges. Add in a mobile mining app with over 1.5 million users, and it’s easy to see why some analysts are expecting up to 55x returns once it launches. This might be worth keeping an eye on if you’re the type of investor who enjoys large infrastructure plays with long-term utility. The Takeaway: One Name Is Rising Faster Than the Rest All three projects have their strengths, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is the one generating the real heat right now. It’s the project everyone’s talking about. It has the hype, the early movement, and the kind of projections that make people take action. For many, this feels like a rare second chance—a shot at getting in early before the headlines really take off. And let’s be honest: in crypto, the people who get there first usually win.

These zones have tracked major moves from fear-based accumulation to key resistance points. With new formations developing, a potentially parabolic move could be on the horizon. Perfect Setups For SUI That Paid Off Big Cheek Analytics, in a recent X post, identified $1.57 as SUI’s fundamental price and an ideal buy zone, especially during periods of fear. Historical data show that entering at this level on August 3, 2024, could have yielded up to a 957% gain, while a similar setup on April 7, 2025, has already returned up to a 134% gain at its peak. Related Reading: Breakout In Sight? SUI Set To Test Crucial $3.5 Resistance With ATH In View Cheek Analytics also pointed to the Purple Cloud around $4 as the first significant resistance SUI needs to clear. This zone has been tested several times, with one brief breakthrough, only for the price to fall back and validate it as resistance. Cheek views this level as a key barrier: breaking above it would shift the momentum decisively and set the stage for further gains. Looking further ahead, Cheek Analytics highlighted the Orange Cloud at $9 as SUI’s major resistance zone. Historically, once the purple zone is broken, price often accelerates toward this level. However, during a past attempt, growing cloud zones stalled the move, and sentiment shifted to extreme greed, triggering profit-taking. SUI later retraced by -52% and still trades -28% below its peak. To round out the roadmap, Cheek Analytics introduced the Red Cloud at $20 as the long-term target zone, a region that could come into play if the orange cloud flips to support. However, Cheek notes that on larger altcoins like SUI, the red cloud is rarely touched. This is because all cloud zones expand or contract with market movement. Higher Highs Needed: The Path To Breaking Resistance Cheek Analytics concluded that SUI shows strong long-term potential, as seen in its expanding cloud zones. However, for further upside, the price must form higher lows and higher highs; otherwise, a breakout above the purple cloud may fail and attract renewed selling pressure. Related Reading: Here’s Why SUI At $3.61 Could Be the Calm Before A Parabolic Surge If the bullish structure fails to materialize, the analyst warns of a likely retracement back toward the fundamental green line at $1.57, a level described as an ideal accumulation point for long-term believers, or as they put it, “buttlievers.” Currently, the sentiment indicator is already showing fear, marked by a light blue background. Should price revisit the green line, Cheek Analytics expects sentiment to shift into extreme fear, setting the stage for optimal dollar-cost averaging (DCA) conditions for committed holders aiming to ride the next major wave.

MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly gaining momentum, with analysts and investors spotlighting its presale structure and upside potential. As ADA, ETH, OP, and VET also make headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a top contender in the evolving altcoin race. MAGACOIN FINANCE Surges, Igniting an 18,500% ROI Predictions for Early Buyers MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves across the 2025 altcoin landscape, igniting record-breaking investor interest with its sub-$0.01 pre-sale entry point. The project’s rapid momentum—driven by strategic accumulation from both retail and institutional buyers—is reinforcing its position as a serious contender. Backed by viral branding, streamlined tokenomics, and limited-access bonuses, MAGACOIN FINANCE is widely regarded as one of the most promising early-stage opportunities this year. With over $10 million already secured and analysts highlighting major upside potential, market attention continues to intensify. Cardano (ADA): Testing Key Support Amid Volatility Cardano is under pressure in June, slipping below critical support at $0.72 and currently trading around $0.70. Despite short-term technical vulnerability, medium-term prospects remain cautiously optimistic if ADA can reclaim key zones. As some ADA holders rotate into MAGACOIN FINANCE, the altcoin’s appeal as a speculative pick is growing. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Momentum Eyes $2,900 Ethereum is showing renewed strength, with price predictions for June targeting a move back to the $2,800–$2,900 range. Increased trading volumes and bullish technicals are fueling optimism. MAGACOIN FINANCE is benefiting from this positive DeFi sentiment, with ETH whales reportedly joining its presale for early exposure. Optimism (OP): Upward Trend Continues Optimism (OP) has posted an 8% monthly gain, with June forecasts suggesting a potential move to $0.67 or higher. As OP’s ecosystem expands, traders are also looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for similar high-upside opportunities in the altcoin space. VeChain (VET): AI-Driven Price Predictions Signal Upside VeChain is forecasted to rise 55% by the end of June, with a target of $0.035. As VET’s fundamentals improve, the broader altcoin market—including MAGACOIN FINANCE—stands to benefit from renewed investor interest. Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE, Cardano, and Ethereum are capturing the spotlight as traders seek the next big move in crypto. With strong fundamentals and growing community support, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned as a breakout candidate for 2025.

According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Eastern District of California, a 17-count indictment unsealed on Tuesday charges brothers-in-law Ayman Alaaraj and Ahmad Nassar with bank fraud and aggravated identity theft. Court documents show that in May 2023, Nassar took over several bank accounts belonging to two elderly victims at two separate banks using sophisticated techniques, such as porting over the phone number belonging to one of the victims. The method enabled Nassar to access the accounts and bypass the banks’ two-factor authentication protection. Nassar, occasionally assisted by Alaaraj, then drained the accounts and ran up unpaid credit card debits, causing more than $794,000 in losses to the victims. The two men then moved the stolen money through the pass-through accounts created under the victim’s names, as well as funneled $100,000 through Alaaraj’s businesses. The defendants eventually transferred the money to themselves using ATM cash withdrawals, personal checks, Western Union transactions and Zelle transactions. They also used the stolen funds to pay credit cards, engage in online gambling and buy a Mercedes. If found guilty, the two men face up to 30 years of jail time and a $1 million fine for each count of bank fraud. They also face a mandatory prison term of two years and a fine of up to $250,000, or twice the gross gain or gross loss, for the aggravated identity theft count.

It’s time to focus on what really matters: adoption, users, and working systems. In 2025, some coins stand out not just for their name, but for their actual use. BlockDAG, Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana are gaining real momentum. They show up not because of buzzwords, but because people are using them in everyday life. From mobile-friendly mining to smart contracts and fast networks, these top crypto coins are leading for a reason. This guide gives you a clear picture, simple, real, and easy to follow. Whether you’re new or experienced in the space, keep reading to learn why these four names matter in today’s Web3 world. 1. BlockDAG’s Mobile Growth and $312M Milestone BlockDAG is standing out fast, thanks to its simple and powerful X1 Miner App. With over 2 million users mining on the app, X1 is one of the fastest-growing apps in the crypto world this year. What makes it so different? No hardware. No big setup. Just a smartphone is enough to start earning BDAG. This easy model is drawing in users beyond the usual crypto crowd. Its strength also lies in its smart design. BlockDAG combines DAG technology with Proof-of-Work. This setup helps the system stay fast and secure while still being decentralized. That balance is not easy to find, and it puts BlockDAG (BDAG) ahead of many others in the space. The numbers speak for themselves. So far, BlockDAG has raised $312 million, now in Batch 29, priced at $0.0276. The early backers in Batch 1 have already seen a strong 2,660% return. In total, over 22.8 billion coins have been sold. For those still thinking about it, the special price of $0.0018 is available till June 20th, a rare chance to get in early. This isn’t just about numbers. BlockDAG is showing real-world use and growth. It offers a system anyone can access, backed by strong tech. With its reach growing and its user base expanding quickly, BlockDAG is firmly placed among the top crypto coins, leading the shift in how blockchain connects to everyday users. 2. Ethereum Powers DeFi With Upgrades in 2025 Ethereum continues to hold a strong position in crypto, backed by its massive network and active developer base. Though it faced past issues like high fees and speed problems, recent updates are solving those pain points. The switch to Proof-of-Stake and Layer 2 upgrades have helped cut costs and increase speed. In 2025, Ethereum remains a top choice for DeFi, NFTs, and dApps. Billions of dollars are tied up in smart contracts here, showing strong trust and real use. While newer names are growing fast, none have matched Ethereum’s size or reliability yet. It continues to be one of the top crypto coins, offering proven tools and a strong track record in building Web3 systems that actually work. 3. Cardano Grows With Research-Driven Progress Cardano stands out for its slow but steady path. Built on deep research and peer-reviewed work, it focuses on getting things right rather than rushing. In 2025, that careful approach is starting to show results, with more apps and smart contracts going live on its platform. Its Hydra upgrade is helping it scale, while partnerships in developing regions grow its reach. ADA may not have flashy news every week, but it keeps building in the background. That stable growth makes it one of the top crypto coins to watch. It may not be loud, but it’s consistent, something many in the space value when looking for lasting results instead of short-term hype. 4. Solana Delivers Speed With Better Stability Solana has always been known for its fast speeds. It can process tens of thousands of transactions per second and charges very low fees. That makes it ideal for areas like gaming, real-time payments, and quick DeFi moves. Although it faced network downtime in the past, 2025 has brought better results. The team has worked on stability, and it’s paying off. More apps and platforms, especially in NFTs and social media, are choosing Solana as their base. Its fast-growing user base and active devs keep it moving forward. Solana proves that strong performance and improved trust can go hand in hand. It earns its spot as one of the top crypto coins with real-time use and solid backing. Final Thoughts In 2025, success in crypto isn’t just about early hype or big promises. It’s about tools that work, people who use them, and systems built to last. BlockDAG shows how simple mobile access can open doors for everyone. Ethereum keeps leading with its tech and trusted platform. Cardano grows at a steady pace with a research-first focus. Solana offers speed and strong user tools. These four each bring something unique. Together, they shape what the future looks like. As Web3 grows, these top crypto coins show us the way forward, clear, usable, and ready for what’s next.

As attention shifts to high-upside altcoins, a growing number of traders and analysts are keeping close tabs on MAGACOINFINANCE — a fast-developing asset that’s gaining traction thanks to structural strength and bullish indicators. Bitcoin’s Role as Market Driver Remains Strong Bitcoin continues to act as the lead barometer for risk sentiment in crypto. With broader geopolitical concerns easing slightly and macro trends pointing toward cautious optimism, traders are repositioning around BTC’s next major move. Recent strength suggests a renewed appetite for digital assets, and as history shows, Bitcoin rallies often set the tone for altcoin rotations shortly after. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is on Every Analyst’s Radar MAGACOINFINANCE is now being tracked closely by Bitcoin and XRP investors seeking asymmetric returns. The recent staking activation and firm supply cap of 170 billion tokens have added credibility to what began as a meme-inspired entry and is now being taken seriously as a long-term player. Investor behavior tells the story: On-chain wallets show long-term holding patterns Staking inflows continue without major dumps Audit from HashEx confirms code integrity Full ownership structure avoids VC overreach Adding to the momentum, MAGACOINFINANCE has introduced a limited-time bonus offer under the promo PATRIOTS100X , giving new buyers added leverage ahead of wider listing exposure. This has only amplified the wave of interest from early adopters looking for strategic positioning. XRP Closer Than Ever to Legal Resolution For XRP, this cycle feels different. The token has bounced back from a multi-day pullback and now rides on the momentum of an almost-resolved legal battle with the SEC. A joint motion to unlock $125 million from escrow marks a potential end to the years-long case — and that’s attracting fresh capital. Speculation is also building around a possible XRP ETF approval, which, if confirmed, could act as a powerful new catalyst. SOL, KAS, and TRX Show Different Strengths Solana (SOL) remains a top Layer 1 in terms of user activity. While no major events have hit headlines, the network continues to support a thriving developer base, maintaining its reputation as a high-performance chain. Kaspa (KAS) is less visible in the current cycle but is quietly attracting attention from long-term traders looking for value entries. KAS remains an infrastructure-focused project with room to surprise if upcoming releases deliver impact. TRON (TRX) is staying consistent. With active support for stablecoins and a growing decentralized ecosystem, it remains a favorite among traders seeking dependable, lower-volatility exposure. Final Thoughts Bitcoin and XRP are creating room for altcoins to move — and while SOL, TRX, and KAS maintain unique strengths, MAGACOINFINANCE is increasingly being viewed as the altcoin with breakout potential. With staking live, a locked supply, and smart investor accumulation underway, the setup is clear for those watching closely.

The firm said on Thursday that it planned to amass 105,000 Bitcoins by the end of 2027, enough to make it one of the world’s largest corporate holders of digital assets. The company’s Bitcoin purchasing plan is set to be rolled out over three years, led by Joe Burnett, the director of Bitcoin strategy . Semler is hoping to own 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025. That figure will increase to 42,000 BTC by the end of 2026 and to 105,000 BTC by the end of 2027. That approach is part of a broader trend among publicly held companies that are forward-looking and increasingly considering Bitcoin not as a speculative bet but as a long-term store of value and a core treasury asset. Semler treats Bitcoin as a long-term asset Semler’s dive into Bitcoin is no flight of fancy. The company’s been on this path since May 2024, when it jumped onto what it calls the “ Bitcoin Standard .” Since then, Semler has pivoted to a Bitcoin bull and is among the most vocal corporate cheerleaders for cryptocurrency. On June 4, 2025, the company held 4,449 BTC valued at $462 million. That would make it one of the 15 biggest Bitcoin collectives in the world. However, the outfit’s 287% BTC yield and $177 million in profit from its Bitcoin holdings as of early June are more remarkable. These returns reinforce the firm’s argument that Bitcoin is not just a hedge but also a potent value-generating asset. Burnett, who has spoken with some of the smartest economists, investors, and Bitcoin thinkers across every format, will help Semler build its thesis around education, macro insights, and treasury diversification with Bitcoin. It also indicates a more deliberate, permanent establishment of Bitcoin strategy within the company’s executive ranks. Semler builds reputation as Bitcoin strategy leader Semler Scientific’s approach puts it in the company of firms such as Strategy, currently the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. With Semler’s 15,000 BTC to date, compared to Strategy’s 214,400 BTC, closing this gap in the longer term is truly underway. It is now the second US public company to adopt the Bitcoin Standard, following Strategy. According to The Block data, almost 230 companies worldwide have adopted similar Bitcoin treasury strategies. Semler’s move is part of a growing institutional trend toward Bitcoin, such as the growing number of US spot Bitcoin ETFs on the heels of more positive regulatory clarity and greater macroeconomic uncertainty, leading many to diversify their asset portfolio. The company now trades on the Nasdaq under the trading symbol SMLR. It now trades at about $32 a share for a market capitalization of about $375 million. Semler’s aggressive crypto play has garnered interest from traditional investors and Bitcoin enthusiasts. Though it has been relatively modest in size, the fund has seen users plow money into it at a rapid clip. In an industry where few healthcare companies have been brave enough to take such a step, Semler establishes a distinct brand that blends healthcare innovation with Bitcoin maximalism. Assuming its plan proceeds according to schedule, the company may soon become one of the biggest non-financial corporate owners of Bitcoin in the next two years.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins its trading day, bitcoin BTC is trading above $104,500 and, despite a possible looming war in the Middle East, has been relatively flat on the day with negligible market movement. Indeed, for the last full week, BTC is only down 2%, according to CoinDesk market data . Analysts are debating whether the crypto market’s current stillness is a sign of strength or if something more precarious is afoot. Three new reports this week from CryptoQuant , Glassnode , and trading firm Flowdesk all point to the same surface conditions: low volatility, tight price action, and subdued on-chain activity. Additionally, retail participation has waned, and institutional players, from ETFs to whales, are now shaping the structure of flows. But it’s CryptoQuant that’s flashing the most urgent warning. In its June 19 report, CryptoQuant argued that BTC could soon revisit $92,000 support or even fall as low as $81,000 if demand continues to deteriorate. Spot demand is still increasing, but well below trend. ETF flows have dropped by more than 60% since April, while whale accumulation has halved. Short-term holders, who are usually newer market participants, have shed approximately 800,000 BTC since late May. Their demand momentum indicator, which tracks directional buying strength across key cohorts, is now reading negative 2 million BTC, the lowest in CryptoQuant’s dataset. Glassnode , however, sees the same signals and arrives at a far less dire conclusion. In its weekly on-chain update, the firm acknowledges that the Bitcoin blockchain is “quiet,"" meaning transaction counts are down, fees are minimal, and miner revenue is subdued. However, this suggests that it may not be a weakness, but rather a reflection of the network’s evolution. On-chain settlement volume remains high, but it’s concentrated in large-value transfers, suggesting the chain is increasingly being used by institutions and whales. The derivatives market, Glassnode notes, now dwarfs on-chain activity, with futures and options volumes regularly exceeding spot by 7x–16x. That shift has brought more sophisticated hedging, better collateral practices, and a more mature, if less frenetic, market structure. France-based Flowdesk, a market maker and trading firm, has views that fall somewhere in between. While noting thinning altcoin flows and flat market-making volumes, its June 19 update describes the market as “coiled,” not cracking. Flowdesk highlights a surge in tokenized assets, such as Gold-backed XAUT (up 56% in volume), stablecoin growth, and increasing RWA activity. To them, low volatility may simply be the calm before a directional breakout, which is not necessarily downwards. But in the end, no one seems to hold a reliable map for what’s ahead. Even Polymarket isn't sure. Bettors are giving a near equal chance of BTC dropping to $90K in June or moving up to $115K-120K. One thing is for sure: the tug-of-war between bullish institutional activities and waning retail demand potentially opens bitcoin up to dramatic moves on either side of the trade, which will likely dictate the market’s next chapter. Presto Research Says Crypto Treasury Companies Have Less Risk Than You Think A new report from Presto Research argues that Crypto Treasury Companies (CTCs), such as Strategy and Metaplanet, are not just leveraged bitcoin ETFs, but a new form of financial engineering with less risk than many investors assume. Strategy’s latest raise, which raised nearly $1 billion via perpetual preferred shares , shows how BTC’s volatility can be used to an issuer’s advantage. These securities, along with convertible bonds and at-the-market equity sales, allow CTCs to fund aggressive crypto accumulation without triggering margin risk. Presto points out that Strategy’s BTC is unpledged and Metaplanet’s bonds are unsecured, meaning collateral liquidation, the primary trigger in past crypto blowups like Celsius and Three Arrows, is largely absent here. That does not eliminate risk, but it changes the nature of it. The real challenge, Presto argues, is not crypto exposure itself but the discipline to manage dilution, cash flow, and capital timing. Metaplanet’s “bitcoin yield” metric, which measures BTC per fully diluted share, reflects that focus on shareholder value. As long as CTCs can manage the financial mechanics behind their accumulation strategies, they will earn NAV premiums just like high-growth companies in traditional markets. But if they miscalculate, the same tools that fuel their rise could accelerate their fall. Semler Scientific Maps Bold Plan to Hold 105,000 BTC by 2027 Semler Scientific (Nasdaq: SMLR) has unveiled one of the most aggressive bitcoin accumulation roadmaps in corporate history, announcing plans to hold 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, 42,000 by 2026, and a staggering 105,000 by the close of 2027. The California-based medical device maker, which pivoted to a bitcoin treasury strategy last year, is effectively trying to 24x its current bitcoin stash of 4,449 coins over the next 30 months. It plans to do so using a mix of equity raises, debt financing, and operational cash flow. But the path forward isn’t guaranteed. Semler’s primary mechanism for acquiring bitcoin, selling new shares under its at-the-market (ATM) program, relies on the company trading at a premium to its net asset value (NAV). According to data from Strategy-Tracker , Semler’s mNAV currently sits at 0.859x, meaning the market values the firm’s equity lower than its BTC holdings, effectively cutting off its ability to raise accretive capital. That dynamic has made Semler something of a paradox in the world of bitcoin treasuries: a high-conviction buyer without the premium to fund its buying. Even as bitcoin has surged to all-time highs above $100,000, Semler shares are down nearly 40% on the year. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin remains stuck below $105K despite strong ETF inflows, with repeated resistance at $105,150 and signs of institutional accumulation offset by short-term bearish momentum and macro volatility. ETH: Ethereum found support at $2,490 after a high-volume selloff broke key levels, with the price consolidating in a tight range amid geopolitical tensions and macro uncertainty, signaling potential for a breakout if resistance at $2,510 is cleared. Gold: Gold hovered near $3,366 on Thursday, little changed as escalating geopolitical tensions offset pressure from the Fed’s hawkish stance, while platinum retreated after hitting a near 10-year high; U.S. markets remained closed for Juneteenth. Nikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei 225 opened 0.24% higher Friday as Asia-Pacific markets mostly rose ahead of China’s loan prime rate decision and amid ongoing Israel-Iran tensions.

While Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Injective (INJ), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) continue to dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as a strategic buy with breakout potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: 2025’s Most-Watched List With Upside ROI Outlook MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining serious traction among analysts, earning a place alongside Solana, XRP, and Bitcoin on 2025’s most-watched gainers list . With a series of high-impact upgrades and strong breakout activity, the project is drawing growing attention from experienced investors and strategic buyers. Its early positioning, combined with rising momentum, signals long-term potential that many believe could rival—and even surpass—larger-cap competitors. Now widely seen as a “high-conviction buy under $0.01,” MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a preferred entry point for those seeking asymmetric upside in a crowded market. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Outlook as Institutional Demand Grows Ethereum is poised for a strong June, with price predictions targeting a reclaim of the $2,800–$2,900 range if bullish momentum continues. Institutional buying and DeFi utility are driving optimism, and as ETH consolidates, some investors are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture early-stage growth alongside blue-chip stability. XRP: Lawsuit Decision and ETF Hopes Drive Volatility XRP is trading near $0.54, with investor focus on the pivotal June 16 Ripple lawsuit decision and ongoing ETF speculation. A favorable outcome could push XRP above $0.65, but regardless, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention as a fresh alternative for those seeking new alpha in a volatile market. Injective (INJ): Uptrend Continues with Strong Forecasts INJ remains in an uptrend, with June forecasts projecting prices as high as $16.63. As traders look for the next big mover, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s parabolic presale growth is drawing comparisons to early-stage INJ, especially among those seeking high potential returns. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Steady Growth Amid Market Optimism Bitcoin Cash is trading above $500, with a solid 18% weekly gain and forecasts for continued strength into July. As BCH solidifies its position, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as a complementary play for investors seeking both established and emerging opportunities. Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE, Ethereum, and XRP are capturing the spotlight as Bitcoin insiders and traders seek the next breakout story in 2025. With strong fundamentals and growing support, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a top contender in the altcoin race.

According to market watcher Titan of Crypto, the story isn’t over yet. Related Reading: Tether Enforces Freeze On $12 Million In Tron Funds Over Illicit Activity Bitcoin slipped just 6% from its all‑time high of $112,000, but some analysts pointed to a cooling relative strength index (RSI) and warned of a top. Titan’s take flips that view on its head, arguing that we’re still deep in the meat of the bull cycle. Fractal Cycles Keep Running Titan pointed to a clear pattern in Bitcoin’s last two cycles. Each cycle began with roughly 13 monthly bars—about 396 days—of steep decline. In 2014–15, Bitcoin fell from $1,240 to $161 over that span. Prices then rallied for 35 bars (1,065 days) to hit $19,800 in December 2017. The same 13‑bar slide followed by 35 bars of gains played out again after 2018, ending at $69,000 in 2021. #Bitcoin Bull Market Entering Final Phase 🏁 As in previous cycles: ~1 year of bear market, followed by ~3 years of expansion.$BTC looks to be in the final leg but not done yet. pic.twitter.com/MGre5ahz3P — Titan of Crypto (@Washigorira) June 18, 2025 Momentum And RSI In Focus Some analysts flagged a weakening RSI as a sign that Bitcoin has peaked. That metric can’t be ignored—when momentum wanes, price often takes a breather. Titan’s chart lays down the time‑based pattern, but RSI, trading volume, and on‑chain data give a live read on demand. Bull Run Still Has Room Based on reports, the current cycle’s bullish phase kicked off in January 2023 and sits in the 29th bar this month. Bitcoin has climbed 530% since the start of that run. If history holds, we’ve got at least five more monthly bars of uptrend before the rally tops out around November. Earlier studies even point to a wedge breakout that could send price to about $137,000 before any serious pullback. Big Names See Higher Peaks Samson Mow, the CEO of Jan3, foresees Bitcoin tearing past the $1 million mark in a fierce upswing, powered by government rollouts, sovereign bond issuances, and an urgent surge in ‘hyperbitcoinization’ before seeing any real correction. Raoul Pal (Real Vision), the former Goldman Sachs executive, shares a familiar bullish view. He has laid out scenarios where Bitcoin hits $1 million by 2030, based on monetary stimulus and limited supply. Related Reading: Iran’s Top Crypto Hub Loses $82 Million To Hackers With Israeli Links—Details Strategy’s Michael Saylor has also said Bitcoin could skyrocket to between $500,000 and $1 million before seeing any real correction. These big names in the crypto industry highlight growing institutional inflows and a looming supply squeeze after the next halving as fuel for an even higher peak. This rally isn’t just a rerun of what we saw in 2017 or 2021. Bitcoin today moves with ETFs, big‑ticket corporate buys, and more traders watching on‑chain signals than ever before. Meanwhile, the latest outlook by CoinCodex sees Bitcoin climbing 5.73% to hit roughly $110,732 by July 19, 2025. Right now, technical signals point to a Neutral mood, while the Fear & Greed Index sits at 57—squarely in Greed territory.
