Ruvi AI’s (RUVI) Early Entry Bonuses And Growing Hype Could Turn $1,500 Into 6 Figures",https://timestabloid.com/ripple-xrp-too-slow-ruvi-ais-ruvi-early-entry-bonuses-and-growing/,"Ripple (XRP) has long been a favorite for those seeking a stable and utility-driven cryptocurrency, built for efficient cross-border payments. Yet, its measured growth has often left investors craving a faster path to larger returns. Enter Ruvi AI (RUVI) , a blockchain and AI-powered project making waves with its impressive early performance and massive growth potential. Analysts and investors alike are pointing to Ruvi AI as a far more dynamic investment, thanks to its innovative model and potential to turn $1,500 into six figures . Why Investors Are Considering Ruvi AI Over Ripple While Ripple focuses heavily on financial institutions and cross-border transaction efficiency, Ruvi AI widens its scope by addressing critical challenges in marketing , entertainment , and finance . Incorporating both blockchain technology and artificial intelligence , Ruvi AI creates scalable solutions that meet real-world needs. What differentiates Ruvi AI from Ripple is its structured growth model , which provides investors with immediate returns and long-term potential. Currently in Phase 2 of its presale , RUVI tokens are priced at $0.015 each , offering an affordable entry point for early backers. Post-presale, the token price increases to $0.07 per token, delivering a nearly 5x return before the token is publicly listed. Analysts further project Ruvi AI could reach $1 per token , representing a 66x ROI and a clear advantage for proactive investors. Presale Success Showcases Momentum Ruvi AI’s presale has already achieved significant milestones, a marker of investor confidence in its value-driven proposition. With over $1.8 million raised and 1,600+ holders , the platform has additionally sold more than 160 million tokens , solidifying its growing reputation in the market. Unlike speculative projects, Ruvi AI’s roadmap includes a guaranteed price increase to $0.07 after the presale. This transparency gives investors clarity and reduces risks, establishing Ruvi AI as a standout in an often volatile crypto space. VIP Tiers Provide Exceptional Bonus Opportunities Beyond offering early entry pricing, Ruvi AI features VIP tiers , designed to reward contributors with substantial bonus token allocations. These bonuses significantly amplify the earning potential for investors: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These lucrative VIP tiers underline the importance of joining Ruvi AI’s presale early for optimal gains. Built on Transparency and Security A significant part of Ruvi AI’s rapid success stems from its dedication to transparency and security , values that resonate strongly with investors. Ruvi AI has partnered with CyberScope , a top blockchain auditing firm, for a third-party audit , ensuring its systems meet rigorous security standards. Additionally, Ruvi AI has teamed up with WEEX Exchange , guaranteeing post-presale liquidity and paving the way for seamless trading once the token is publicly listed. This partnership reflects Ruvi AI’s commitment to building a trustworthy ecosystem for its investors. Real-World Utility Drives Long-Term Demand Ruvi AI’s significance reaches far beyond its potential for immediate returns. By solving real-world problems across major industries, it establishes a sustainable demand for RUVI tokens. Some of its notable applications include: Marketing: With AI-powered tools for ad targeting and campaign optimization, Ruvi AI helps businesses improve ROI and reach their ideal audiences. Entertainment: Blockchain-supported payment systems paired with AI-curated recommendations allow creators to monetize efficiently while engaging users more effectively. Finance: Ruvi AI’s tools for fraud prevention, transparency, and operational scalability empower financial institutions to modernize. These applications ensure Ruvi AI’s longevity, making it more than just a short-term investment opportunity. Why Ruvi AI Can Outpace Ripple Ripple’s stability makes it a decent choice for conservative investors, but Ruvi AI’s $0.015 presale pricing , guaranteed rise to $0.07 post-presale , and projected $1 valuation provide unparalleled upside for those seeking explosive growth. Having already raised $1.8 million , sold 160 million tokens , and secured partnerships with CyberScope and WEEX Exchange , Ruvi AI is proving to be a leader in the blockchain and AI space. If you’ve been searching for a promising investment that could turn $1,500 into six figures , Ruvi AI is likely your best bet. Don’t wait to join this revolutionary opportunity.

While many projects talk big but deliver little, a few are setting themselves apart with real-world milestones. These four projects, BlockDAG, XRP, PEPE, and Sui, showcase the power of delivering tangible results. From miner rollouts to institutional finance, each one highlights what it means to turn vision into reality in the Web3 space. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Hardware Shipment & Network Participation BlockDAG leads by example among top crypto assets, taking a practical step by shipping real mining hardware. Beginning July 7, users will receive the X-Series lineup, including X10, X30, and X100 models. These units are ready-to-use, bringing real mining capability into users’ hands. The X10 targets new entrants, while the X30 and X100 serve high-performance needs. Built on a hybrid DAG and Proof-of-Work model, BlockDAG blends accessibility with proven security. Unlike many presale projects, it’s already delivering physical results. With $312 million raised in its presale and 22.8 billion coins sold across 29 batches, BlockDAG shows strong support. The coin is currently priced at $0.0276, and early participants have seen a 2,660% ROI. Until June 20, a reduced rate of $0.0018 remains available. BlockDAG is not about speculation; it’s about building and scaling ahead of exchange listings. 2. PEPE: Community Strength & Viral Appeal PEPE stands out not for enterprise use but for its ability to dominate conversations and generate high engagement. As a meme-driven coin, PEPE thrives on cultural recognition and strong community backing. It gained traction quickly, with rapid price increases and widespread exchange listings. Although it lacks a technical roadmap, it offers users speculative excitement and strong liquidity. Its place among the top crypto assets in 2025 comes from community growth and social momentum. 3. XRP: Reliable Utility in Cross-Border Finance XRP continues to be recognized among the top crypto assets due to its consistent use case in global payments. It supports quick, low-cost transfers, making it a practical solution for institutions. Despite legal battles involving Ripple, the team behind XRP, the project has secured significant partnerships. These developments suggest long-term alignment with the financial sector. XRP’s performance is driven by steady utility rather than hype, appealing to those who prioritize function and reliability. 4. Sui (SUI): Technical Foundation for Scalable Applications Sui brings speed and scale to the Layer-1 blockchain space. Built by Mysten Labs and leveraging the Move programming language, Sui enables secure and efficient smart contract execution. What sets Sui apart is its proven capacity to handle real-world transactions. Its parallel execution and near-instant finality create a strong foundation for developers and applications. Ongoing support and tooling improvements have strengthened its reputation. Rather than chasing hype, Sui focuses on enabling real use. Its technical progress and builder-centric approach make it a long-term contender in the Web3 infrastructure category. Which Are the Top Crypto Assets of 2025? When it comes to the top crypto assets of 2025 , the common thread is tangible progress. BlockDAG leads with hardware rollout and network integration. XRP maintains relevance through enterprise adoption. PEPE shows the strength of cultural engagement. Sui offers a solid technical base for application development. For anyone seeking more than promises, these projects show what execution, utility, and community can achieve in a growing Web3 world.

As expected, the central bank did not make changes to its federal funds rate. However, Chairman Jerome Powell did assert that they still expect to make two rate cuts this year. As a result, he may have calmed down the markets for a bit at a point when rising tensions in the Middle East have rattled investors. XRP is about to explode. I’m eyeing at least $8, and the market still hasn’t caught up to the fact that the SEC doesn’t consider it a security. $XRP holders are about to PRINT. I’ll drop the signal to exit right here when the moment is right. You’ll regret not following. pic.twitter.com/oiE8INoy7F — Crypto Beast (@cryptobeastreal) June 16, 2025 In the past week, XRP has accumulated a 3.2% loss. However, the crypto analyst “Crypto Beast”, whose account on X is followed by 727,000 users, seems to think that this token has significant upside potential ahead now that its regulatory headwinds have disappeared. Crypto Beast has identified a bullish price flag pattern that could result in significant gains for the native asset of the Ripple network in the near term. His baseline XRP price forecast sees a jump to $10 after a bullish breakout is confirmed. “You’ll regret not following,” he said. XRP Price Prediction: Ongoing Consolidation Confirms Crypto Beasts’ Thesis XRP has been consolidating for a while now after the token experienced a significant jump following Ripple’s legal victories against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the appointment of a new leader, Paul Atkins, for the regulatory agency. Looking at XRP’s 4-hour chart, this consolidation has been going on since Monday and shows that the price has traded range-bound between $2.33 and $2.10. Consolidation patterns tend to anticipate a big breakout ahead. They are not directional, so it is not possible to tell if they favor a bearish or bullish XRP price prediction. Traders should keep an eye on how this pattern unfolds. To further confirm Crypto Beast’s bullish XRP price prediction, the price would have to break above $2.35 with strong trading volumes. This should lead to a retest of multiple upper resistances, the first and most relevant one being the $2.65 level. Although XRP has failed to deliver the outstanding gains that investors may have been expecting throughout this year, Bitcoin (BTC) has already made a new all-time high as the top crypto is seen as a safe haven. A new crypto presale called Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) aims to unlock the huge potential of Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem by launching a Solana-power layer-2 scaling solution. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Raises $1.4M in Less Than a Month to Launch its L2 Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) leverages the efficiency of the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to launch a layer-2 protocol for the Bitcoin network that will support the rapid expansion of its DeFi and meme coin ecosystem. This solution will support cheap and fast asset transfer of Bitcoin tokens through a secure L2 that offers near-instant finality on all transactions. The L2’s architecture is quite simple. BTC tokens are transferred to a Bitcoin address monitored by Bitcoin Hyper’s Canonical Bridge. Once the assets are received, they will be minted in the L2 via smart contracts. As this solution gains popularity and becomes widely adopted by wallets and exchanges, the demand for $HYPER will explode. To buy this token at its discounted presale price, head to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to invest.

46372989,https://timestabloid.com/?p=71650,1750374327,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Pundit Uses $100 XRP Price to Prove Market Is Still Early,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-uses-100-xrp-price-to-prove-market-is-still-early/,"In a recent market update, prominent cryptocurrency commentator known as The Modern Investor asserted that the current valuations of major digital assets, including XRP and Bitcoin, suggest the broader crypto market has not yet reached maturity. His analysis focused particularly on XRP’s price level and long-term growth potential, positioning today’s market as an early-stage opportunity for strategic investors. XRP and Bitcoin Prices Reflect an Unfinished Market Cycle At the time of the analysis, XRP was trading at approximately $2.14, while Bitcoin remained under $105,000, far from the multi-million-dollar valuations that some long-term projections have anticipated for Bitcoin. The Modern Investor argued that these figures are indicative of a market still in development, emphasizing that significant growth potential remains across multiple cycles. According to him, many investors mistakenly believe they’ve missed their chance due to not entering the market during the earliest phases. However, he pointed out that the lack of a $100 XRP or a $2 million Bitcoin reinforces the idea that there is still considerable time for patient accumulation and strategy. Long-Term Growth and Accumulation Strategies Referencing an earlier claim by a market observer who projected that XRP could eventually reach the $100 mark , The Modern Investor noted that the target, while ambitious, could be realized throughout several bull markets. He stressed that long-term accumulation and disciplined investing are often underestimated strategies. According to his view, the growth potential of cryptocurrencies like XRP is not just theoretical; it is supported by previous market trends where assets have seen exponential increases over extended periods. The video also addressed recent commentary from market voices such as Edoardo Farina, who has urged investors to aim for holding at least 10,000 XRP. At today’s price, that target would require an investment of roughly $21,400. While Farina presented this as a worthwhile benchmark, The Modern Investor raised concerns about its practicality for the average retail investor. He acknowledged that while the intent behind such advice may be well-meaning, it may not account for the financial limitations many individuals face. Interestingly, Farina has expressed similar views, recognizing that acquiring such a position is becoming increasingly difficult . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Modern Investor described it as a hard truth, one that reflects how quickly digital asset prices can become inaccessible to everyday participants. Ownership Distribution and Market Positioning Further illustrating this point, data from the XRP Rich List indicates that owning around 11,000 XRP places an investor within the top 4% of all XRP wallet holders. Out of more than 6.5 million wallets, just over 263,000 meet this threshold. This suggests that even a relatively modest XRP holding by future standards could place investors in a highly advantageous position if the market moves as projected. If XRP were to reach $100, owning 10,000 tokens would translate to a portfolio worth $1 million. According to The Modern Investor, many long-time investors who adopted a strategy of small, consistent purchases over several years have already met or exceeded their goals through persistence and planning. Market Opportunities Remain Despite the recent price increases, The Modern Investor emphasized that opportunities still exist. While prices like $0.50 XRP are no longer available, he argued that the market’s current state still allows for smart investment decisions. He also discussed the growing trend of staking major assets, including XRP and Bitcoin, to generate passive income, viewing it as another avenue for building long-term financial security. The Modern Investor maintains that the absence of a $100 XRP should be interpreted not as a missed opportunity but as a sign that the market remains in its formative stages. For investors willing to remain focused and strategic, the path to meaningful gains is still accessible. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Musk’s companies merged following a $33B acquisition of the social media platform, X, by the billionaire’s AI startup, xAI. The move has drawn new regulatory scrutiny from the European Union, and it could have potential consequences that change the relationship between large tech companies and EU law. xAI buys out X The European Commission has reportedly sent a fresh wave of inquiries to X concerning the implications of the March buyout. The deal raised xAI’s value to $80B and effectively placed X under the AI startup’s umbrella. The move raised concern in Brussels that the restructuring could affect the scale of penalties the company may face under the Digital Services Act (DSA). Under the DSA, the EU holds the power to fine digital firms for up to 6% of their annual global turnover if they fail to address illegal content, disinformation, or comply with transparency requirements. According to insiders cited in publications, the European Commission is currently evaluating whether to include revenue from Musk’s other ventures, such as SpaceX , Neuralink, and The Boring Company, when calculating a potential fine against X. By attaching the penalties to the company’s total global revenue, the regulation raises the stakes for large corporations like Musk’s X. “We are following closely changes in the corporate structure of X, as we would changes in any other designated platform,” The Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier said on Thursday. He confirmed that the Commission sent a request for information to X, emphasizing that such structural changes could influence the ongoing investigation. EU regulators may pass fine decision by summer Regulators have yet to issue their first major penalty under the DSA, and insiders have revealed that a decision regarding X’s case could come before the Commission’s summer recess in August. However, the timeline for the decision remains unclear because the final size or even the rationale for a fine is still being determined. The investigation into X started in 2023 and is a result of multiple suspected DSA breaches, including the platform’s failure to curb disinformation, lapses in transparency for advertisers and researchers, and most notably, the controversial overhaul of its blue checkmark system. The European Commission argued that the change to the checkmark policy deviated from established industry norms and contributed to a more opaque information environment. X explained the blue checkmark’s current functionality in a recent attempt to avoid penalties, but it is unclear if it satisfied the Commission’s inquiry. Platforms under DSA scrutiny have the opportunity to make binding commitments to address violations in exchange for leniency. Brussels has thus far shown limited tolerance for superficial fixes. X has yet to respond publicly to the Commission’s latest inquiries. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

The project’s decentralized oracle technology revolutionized blockchain connectivity, helping Chainlink earn a reputation as one of the most popular cryptocurrency launches of its time. However, with prices now down more than 75% from that peak, those late to join have found themselves searching for the next significant opportunity. Today, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out at the center of this search. With its ongoing crypto presale at $0.3370, Qubetics offers features designed to address real-world needs, including its non-custodial multi-chain wallet. This new platform is attracting buyers who are focused on utility, growth, and security, qualities that define the most popular cryptocurrency choices today. For those seeking a fresh chance at advancement, Qubetics could be the project to watch now. Qubetics Brings Multi-Chain Wallet Convenience to Crypto The non-custodial multi-chain wallet from Qubetics addresses a crucial gap in the digital asset sector. In today’s market, many users are active on more than one blockchain. Managing funds, tracking tokens, and making transactions across networks can be confusing and time-consuming. Qubetics solves this challenge by offering a wallet where users control their assets, manage private keys, and interact seamlessly across multiple chains. A designer managing payments from international clients can now receive digital assets from various blockchains and keep them in a single secure wallet. This eliminates the need to transfer assets through multiple exchanges, saving both time and fees. For an e-commerce shop expanding into digital collectibles, the Qubetics wallet allows for simple management of different tokens, streamlining business growth. Professional service providers and consultants also benefit from the non-custodial approach. Sensitive transactions, such as legal settlements or high-value payments, are handled with full ownership and without relying on a third party. Enterprises handling payroll or supplier payments across borders can move funds securely, track everything in real time, and avoid compatibility issues between networks. By focusing on user control, privacy, and compatibility, Qubetics is setting a new standard among the most popular cryptocurrency solutions. The wallet’s ability to bridge networks and deliver convenience for a wide audience positions Qubetics as a leader in real utility and community trust. Its practical impact is becoming clear as more buyers join the ongoing crypto presale and look for technologies that can deliver lasting value. Qubetics Crypto Presale: Final Phase Unlocks High Demand Qubetics has now entered the final 37th stage of its crypto presale. Over 516 million tokens have been sold to more than 28,100 holders, and the platform has raised over $18 million so far. With less than 10 million $TICS remaining, the current price is locked at $0.3370 per token, ahead of an expected 20% increase to $0.40 at public listing. The total supply has been cut from 4 billion to 1.36 billion, with 38.55% allocated to the public. This approach puts control in the hands of the community. The combination of scarcity, transparent distribution, and practical features could drive a strong rally after Qubetics’ listing. The ongoing crypto presale stands out for those seeking the most popular cryptocurrency in its early stage, where both value and accessibility remain high. Those who buy $TICS at this stage immediately position themselves for a projected surge. Current estimates suggest $TICS could reach between $5 and $10 post-listing. The structure of this crypto presale rewards early adopters with access and growth that is rarely seen in established projects. A $25,000 entry into the current Qubetics crypto presale yields approximately 74,187 $TICS tokens at the price of $0.3370 each. If $TICS lists at $0.40, that holding would already be valued at $29,674, a 20% increase at listing alone. Should $TICS reach $1, the value rises to $74,187. A climb to $5 projects a return of $370,935, while $10 takes the total to $741,870. Participants from stage 1, who bought at $0.01, are already looking at gains above 3,270%. Although the earliest phase has ended, the current stage still offers significant return potential for those ready to join. Only a limited amount of tokens remain, creating urgency for buyers who do not want to miss out on the most popular cryptocurrency presale before the public launch. Chainlink: From All-Time Highs to a Slower Growth Cycle Chainlink began as a blockchain abstraction layer and quickly earned a place among the most popular cryptocurrency networks. The protocol’s decentralized oracle technology enables smart contracts to securely access off-chain data, powering innovations in DeFi, insurance, gaming, and more. Chainlink’s cross-chain interoperability protocol has continued to evolve, connecting blockchain networks with real-world data and services. However, Chainlink’s all-time high was reached four years ago at $52.88. Since then, the price has remained more than 75% below that record, with most late arrivals missing out on the early exponential growth. Despite regular network upgrades and expanding adoption, Chainlink’s current phase is marked by steadier growth and lower volatility. While it continues to be respected and widely integrated, the chance for new buyers to experience the dramatic wealth creation seen in the initial phase has largely passed. The market now looks for projects that combine proven technology with genuine new access. Qubetics is drawing attention as the most popular cryptocurrency for those seeking both practical features and early entry potential. Looking Ahead Market sentiment continues to shift as community members seek the next major platform with both real-world application and strong potential for returns. Qubetics stands out for its focus on interoperability, user ownership, and transparency. Its non-custodial multi-chain wallet addresses the challenges faced by modern crypto users and businesses, bringing fresh relevance to the most popular cryptocurrency debate. As the final crypto presale stage advances, Qubetics is seeing growing demand and positive coverage. Credible analysis and active community engagement signal a project with significant room to grow. Those who missed the ICO phase of earlier projects have a new chance to participate, as the opportunity remains open.

46373648,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=750302,1750374978,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46373648.jpeg,Local Texas lawmakers could delay Musk’s robotaxi launch until September,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/texas-lawmakers-could-delay-musk-robotaxi/,"Lawmakers from the Texas House of Representatives and Senate are trying to get Tesla to postpone its robotaxi launch and have signed a letter of request to this effect. The letter, which was signed on Wednesday, June 18, requests that Tesla delay its robotaxi launch until September, when new autonomous driving regulations are scheduled to go into effect. Lawmakers express concern as they push for a delay The regulations coming into effect in September would require autonomous cars to be registered under Texas law, meet certain safety and vehicle standards, and also be “capable of achieving a minimal risk condition if the automated driving system is rendered inoperable.” In accordance with the regulations, companies operating autonomous vehicles would also be required to provide a First Responder Interaction Plan to the Department of Public Safety detailing how emergency personnel should interact with driverless vehicles. The lawmakers wrote that Tesla can still go ahead with the robotaxi launch which is slated for June 22 if it responds to the letter with “detailed information demonstrating that Tesla will be compliant with the new law upon the launch of driverless operations in Austin.” However, there is at least one person among the writers of the letter who is skeptical about Tesla’s readiness to launch. “I don’t know that it is ready to be launched,” Goodwin said of Tesla robotaxis on CBS Austin on Wednesday. “There is more work that needs to be done before they let them loose on the streets.” Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk has said his company has been testing its full self-driving cars on the streets of Austin over the last month, with one driverless Tesla Model Y spotted on public roads in Austin. Musk announced plans to launch thousands of Tesla robotaxis in Austin in May, with future plans to expand to cities like San Francisco. However, in a safety test conducted by The Dawn Project, a known critic of Tesla’s self-driving tech, a Tesla Model Y with Full Self-Driving engaged was unable to stop in the presence of a school bus stop sign and child-sized dummy, raising concerns about how ready it is to be deployed. Texas is attracting autonomous vehicle companies, but public safety officials are worried about oversight As it stands, Texas has minimal regulations for autonomous vehicles, allowing operation with basic registration and insurance, which has made it an attractive hub for companies like Tesla. If Tesla decides to push forward with the launch, it will be competing on Austin’s streets with Google’s Waymo, Amazon’s Zoox, and ventures funded by automakers VW and Hyundai. Unfortunately, the lack of oversight has raised concerns among public safety officials, especially since Tesla has a history of unfulfilled self-driving promises and recent safety test failures. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) also sent Tesla a letter in May 2025, requesting to know about how its robotaxis plan to handle collisions, poor visibility, and emergency situations. Tesla has not publicly responded to either the lawmakers’ or NHTSA’s letters, though a response to the NHTSA’s letter was expected on June 19. How Tesla will respond is unclear, but the request of the Democratic lawmakers is not expected to do much to stop Tesla’s progress, especially in a Republican-dominated state, where the governor and legislative majorities favor a hands-off regulatory approach to promote the autonomous vehicle industry. To his credit, Musk is also very big on safety, noting that the company is “being super paranoid” and could shift the launch date if needed. “We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,” Musk wrote on X on June 10.

The Russian newspaper Vedomosti reported that the fund is called Crypto Factory. It is the brainchild of the Penza-based gas power unit provider Power Systems and the financial management firm Finam. Only qualified investors will be allowed access to the fund. Investors’ money will go toward powering BTC mining rigs on farms that use natural gas. The fund’s operators will then sell the Bitcoin (BTC) they mine and provide regular payouts to the investors. Power Systems’ Bitcoin mining rigs. (Source: Power Systems Crypto/Instagram) Russian Power Firm’s BTC Mining CEF In the financial world, CEFs usually refer to investment funds that issue a fixed number of shares only once, typically during an initial offering. Unlike traditional open-ended funds, their issuers do not continuously issue or redeem shares. Instead, CEF shares are traded on a stock exchange, much like individual stocks. Power Systems said that it would send investors analytics data. It will also let them access CCTV camera feeds that monitor work at the mining farms. The fund’s term is five years, and with an initial capital worth 850 million rubles (around $11 million. Potential investors must put a minimum of 5 million rubles ($63,719) into the fund, the company said. The power firm says its basic financial model assumes a return of 49% per annum. It also promised 10% per year interim payments, with a quarterly frequency. Finam said that the shares would not be made available on secondary markets. It said that its commission fee would be 1% of the average annual value of the fund’s net assets. The #crypto market is down again today, and #BTC fell below $105,000.

Providing BTC prices do not drop below this rate, investors could expect to make money from their stakes, the company said. The exact cost of mining BTC in Russia remains unclear, with power prices varying from region to region. Experts said at the end of the past financial year that US miners spent an average of $82,162 to mine BTC 1.

Having remained relatively cautious about allowing investors access to crypto-related financial products in the past, Moscow has become decidedly more bullish in 2025. At the end of May, the Russian Central Bank allowed financial institutions to offer qualified investors access to crypto derivative products. And earlier this month, the Moscow Exchange began offering a Bitcoin futures contract product for qualified investors. The product is linked to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). It is the exchange’s first crypto-related product. Power Systems, founded in 2005, has recently turned its attention to gas-powered crypto mining operations, using associated gas . The latter often releases during oil drilling operations. Drillers usually flare this gas on site if they cannot find an immediate use for it. The firm claimed that mining BTC at gas fields “helps reduce costs.” It added that this not only makes mining cheaper, but also helps reduce miners’ carbon footprints.

The development was recently discussed by George Tung, co-founder of CryptosRus, who described the integration as a major strategic move. Cardano to Strengthen Cross-Chain Compatibility Hoskinson confirmed on June 14 via X that his team is actively developing tools to enable stronger XRP compatibility within Cardano. This includes the introduction of XRP-based DeFi products, integration of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, and participation of XRP holders in upcoming airdrops. These developments mark a significant step in Cardano’s long-term goal of becoming a multi-chain platform. There is a whole XRP package with the glacier drop, lace wallet support, XRP DeFi and the RealUSD talks. — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 14, 2025 Among the proposed initiatives is the Glacier Airdrop , now set to take place in Q4 2025. The airdrop will involve the distribution of Midnight tokens, a privacy-oriented token designed for Cardano’s Midnight sidechain, to users on multiple blockchain networks, including XRP. While initially scheduled earlier, the timeline was extended to accommodate broader cross-chain coordination. The aim is to attract XRP users to Cardano’s ecosystem and encourage the adoption of its privacy-enabled solutions. Lace Wallet to Introduce XRP Support Cardano’s Lace wallet is also on track to expand its supported assets. Following the successful rollout of Bitcoin support in Lace version 1.22 in April 2025, the next update will include functionality for XRP . This upgrade will allow users to manage XRP alongside native assets such as ADA and Bitcoin from a single interface. The addition of XRP support reflects Cardano’s broader efforts to create a unified and user-friendly environment for managing digital assets. It underscores the project’s commitment to building infrastructure that supports multiple leading cryptocurrencies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP DeFi Tools and RLUSD Stablecoin Under Development In addition to the wallet and token initiatives, Cardano is working on integrating XRP into its DeFi framework. Current development efforts are focused on establishing decentralized exchanges and cross-chain liquidity pools that leverage XRP’s efficiency and transaction speed. These tools are intended to offer users faster and lower-cost trading options while contributing to Cardano’s overall DeFi expansion. Furthermore, early-stage discussions are taking place between Cardano and Ripple to enable RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, on the Cardano network. Though still under consideration, both entities are exploring the potential benefits of such collaboration. Successful implementation of RLUSD could diversify stablecoin offerings within the Cardano ecosystem and attract a broader user base. Strategic Integration to Boost Cardano’s DeFi Metrics Hoskinson has previously stated that the integration of assets such as Bitcoin and XRP could be central to Cardano’s projected growth over the next several years. He emphasized that supporting projects centered on these cryptocurrencies could help Cardano significantly increase its total value locked (TVL), potentially exceeding that of competing blockchains like Solana and Ethereum. By committing to cross-chain integration and fostering partnerships with major crypto assets, Cardano is positioning itself as a competitive force in the evolving DeFi landscape. Hoskinson’s strategy appears focused on building infrastructure that facilitates accessibility, interoperability, and growth through targeted collaborations, particularly with Ripple and the XRP community.

Traders are now scanning the altcoin landscape for early opportunities—and one project is starting to stand out across analyst discussions and trading desks alike. Why Analysts Are Turning Their Attention to MAGACOINFINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most actively discussed altcoins right now. Unlike many short-lived meme projects, this one has evolved into something more strategic — thanks to key developments that traders are now pricing in. With the total token supply locked, analysts are highlighting this altcoin for its combination of scarcity, stability, and long-term yield potential. The project’s clean audit by HashEx and its full ownership model have further cemented credibility, drawing a different class of investor — one more focused on structure and performance than just short-term hype. What’s catching eyes now is the clear setup for accumulation: reduced transactional churn, concentrated wallet growth, and on-chain patterns indicating strategic positioning rather than exit-driven trading. MAGACOIN FINANCE may be a newer name, but the trading behaviors forming around it suggest this one has room to run. Bitcoin’s Macro Advantage Continues to Lead the Pack Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of crypto sentiment, and this month, it’s once again asserting dominance. As global economic pressure and inflationary concerns loom, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a hedge by both retail and institutional investors. This resilience gives it a dual role — both as a barometer for the entire market and as a trigger for altcoin momentum. Traders are currently tracking its consolidation behavior closely, expecting it to be the fuse for the next breakout cycle. Bitcoin’s strength continues to act as a launchpad for strategic rotations into high-potential altcoins. XRP Inches Closer to Regulatory Clarity XRP is riding a wave of renewed optimism as developments surrounding its legal battle with the SEC begin to take shape. A proposed motion to unlock $125 million from escrow has hinted at the closing stages of litigation, and investors are watching with heightened anticipation. Some analysts believe an end to this prolonged case could unleash significant institutional capital, particularly if the XRP ETF rumors hold weight. In parallel, Ripple’s strategic vision of handling up to 14% of SWIFT’s global cross-border transactions in the future gives XRP added long-term weight. SOL, TRX, and KAS React in Different Ways Solana (SOL) continues to hold its position as one of the most active blockchains by user participation. While no major headlines have surfaced recently, Solana’s stability and developer momentum remain positive signals. Traders see it as a consistent contender in the Layer 1 race. TRON (TRX) is staying in the spotlight for its transaction reliability and stablecoin support. Though the market has seen limited price excitement, Justin Sun’s ongoing engagement continues to support the network’s visibility and ecosystem activity. Kaspa (KAS), meanwhile, has had a quieter cycle. Without fresh announcements, KAS maintains a low-profile stance — yet some traders view this calm period as a potential accumulation window depending on upcoming ecosystem signals. Final Thoughts Bitcoin and XRP are proving their staying power this cycle, but the real question for traders is where to find early entries with future momentum. SOL, TRX, and KAS all offer different appeal — yet MAGACOINFINANCE stands apart with confirmed scarcity, passive yield potential, and investor traction. As analysts scan for altcoins positioned to break out, this one is quickly moving up the list.

This June, three presales are getting a lot of attention: MAGACOIN FINANCE, Ruvi AI, and BlockDAG Each of these projects brings something unique to the table, but one name stands out from the pack—and that’s MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The One Everyone’s Talking About Let’s be honest—most people don’t want to miss the next Shiba Inu or Dogecoin moment again. At the moment, MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be poised as the next cryptocurrency breakout to watch out for. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about names in crypto circles. From analyst mentions to investor forums, the project is everywhere, and it’s not slowing down. What’s driving the surge? It’s the sheer energy behind the brand. The tone, timing, and market are all lining up to create the kind of viral lift that’s hard to ignore. While other tokens focus on features and functions, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building a movement, and the market is clearly paying attention. Predictions for MAGACOIN FINANCE are over the roof, but what is really driving investors and institutional interest in the token is the timing, energy, and early-stage opportunity. This isn’t a slow, utility-focused token that hopes to go mainstream one day. MAGACOIN FINANCE is advancing swiftly, and according to insiders, buyer activity has been rapidly increasing. People aren’t just watching this one—they’re getting in. If you’ve ever looked back and said, “I should’ve bought earlier,” this might be one of those moments you remember. Ruvi AI: A Smart Bet for the AI Crowd Ruvi AI is offering something different. It combines blockchain with artificial intelligence to create practical tools in marketing, finance, and entertainment—and it’s doing it with a solid plan in place. With over $1.8 million already raised and more than 155 million tokens sold, it’s clear that people are taking it seriously. Analysts say it’s one of the better-planned and more organized projects in the current presale scene. Some projections suggest that Ruvi AI could deliver 66x returns once it lists, and if AI continues its current trajectory, it could become a long-term winner for patient investors. BlockDAG: Big Tech, Bigger Potential BlockDAG isn’t just another blockchain project. It’s already gained traction for its unique mix of tech, combining DAG and Proof-of-Work in a way that’s got developers and investors alike paying close attention. BlockDAG is obviously aiming for scale, as evidenced by the more than $294 million raised and the confirmed listings on 20 exchanges. Add in a mobile mining app with over 1.5 million users, and it’s easy to see why some analysts are expecting up to 55x returns once it launches. This might be worth keeping an eye on if you’re the type of investor who enjoys large infrastructure plays with long-term utility. The Takeaway: One Name Is Rising Faster Than the Rest All three projects have their strengths, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is the one generating the real heat right now. It’s the project everyone’s talking about. It has the hype, the early movement, and the kind of projections that make people take action. For many, this feels like a rare second chance—a shot at getting in early before the headlines really take off. And let’s be honest: in crypto, the people who get there first usually win.

These zones have tracked major moves from fear-based accumulation to key resistance points. With new formations developing, a potentially parabolic move could be on the horizon. Perfect Setups For SUI That Paid Off Big Cheek Analytics, in a recent X post, identified $1.57 as SUI’s fundamental price and an ideal buy zone, especially during periods of fear. Historical data show that entering at this level on August 3, 2024, could have yielded up to a 957% gain, while a similar setup on April 7, 2025, has already returned up to a 134% gain at its peak. Related Reading: Breakout In Sight? SUI Set To Test Crucial $3.5 Resistance With ATH In View Cheek Analytics also pointed to the Purple Cloud around $4 as the first significant resistance SUI needs to clear. This zone has been tested several times, with one brief breakthrough, only for the price to fall back and validate it as resistance. Cheek views this level as a key barrier: breaking above it would shift the momentum decisively and set the stage for further gains. Looking further ahead, Cheek Analytics highlighted the Orange Cloud at $9 as SUI’s major resistance zone. Historically, once the purple zone is broken, price often accelerates toward this level. However, during a past attempt, growing cloud zones stalled the move, and sentiment shifted to extreme greed, triggering profit-taking. SUI later retraced by -52% and still trades -28% below its peak. To round out the roadmap, Cheek Analytics introduced the Red Cloud at $20 as the long-term target zone, a region that could come into play if the orange cloud flips to support. However, Cheek notes that on larger altcoins like SUI, the red cloud is rarely touched. This is because all cloud zones expand or contract with market movement. Higher Highs Needed: The Path To Breaking Resistance Cheek Analytics concluded that SUI shows strong long-term potential, as seen in its expanding cloud zones. However, for further upside, the price must form higher lows and higher highs; otherwise, a breakout above the purple cloud may fail and attract renewed selling pressure. Related Reading: Here’s Why SUI At $3.61 Could Be the Calm Before A Parabolic Surge If the bullish structure fails to materialize, the analyst warns of a likely retracement back toward the fundamental green line at $1.57, a level described as an ideal accumulation point for long-term believers, or as they put it, “buttlievers.” Currently, the sentiment indicator is already showing fear, marked by a light blue background. Should price revisit the green line, Cheek Analytics expects sentiment to shift into extreme fear, setting the stage for optimal dollar-cost averaging (DCA) conditions for committed holders aiming to ride the next major wave.

MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly gaining momentum, with analysts and investors spotlighting its presale structure and upside potential. As ADA, ETH, OP, and VET also make headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a top contender in the evolving altcoin race. MAGACOIN FINANCE Surges, Igniting an 18,500% ROI Predictions for Early Buyers MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves across the 2025 altcoin landscape, igniting record-breaking investor interest with its sub-$0.01 pre-sale entry point. The project’s rapid momentum—driven by strategic accumulation from both retail and institutional buyers—is reinforcing its position as a serious contender. Backed by viral branding, streamlined tokenomics, and limited-access bonuses, MAGACOIN FINANCE is widely regarded as one of the most promising early-stage opportunities this year. With over $10 million already secured and analysts highlighting major upside potential, market attention continues to intensify. Cardano (ADA): Testing Key Support Amid Volatility Cardano is under pressure in June, slipping below critical support at $0.72 and currently trading around $0.70. Despite short-term technical vulnerability, medium-term prospects remain cautiously optimistic if ADA can reclaim key zones. As some ADA holders rotate into MAGACOIN FINANCE, the altcoin’s appeal as a speculative pick is growing. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Momentum Eyes $2,900 Ethereum is showing renewed strength, with price predictions for June targeting a move back to the $2,800–$2,900 range. Increased trading volumes and bullish technicals are fueling optimism. MAGACOIN FINANCE is benefiting from this positive DeFi sentiment, with ETH whales reportedly joining its presale for early exposure. Optimism (OP): Upward Trend Continues Optimism (OP) has posted an 8% monthly gain, with June forecasts suggesting a potential move to $0.67 or higher. As OP’s ecosystem expands, traders are also looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for similar high-upside opportunities in the altcoin space. VeChain (VET): AI-Driven Price Predictions Signal Upside VeChain is forecasted to rise 55% by the end of June, with a target of $0.035. As VET’s fundamentals improve, the broader altcoin market—including MAGACOIN FINANCE—stands to benefit from renewed investor interest. Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE, Cardano, and Ethereum are capturing the spotlight as traders seek the next big move in crypto. With strong fundamentals and growing community support, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned as a breakout candidate for 2025.

According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Eastern District of California, a 17-count indictment unsealed on Tuesday charges brothers-in-law Ayman Alaaraj and Ahmad Nassar with bank fraud and aggravated identity theft. Court documents show that in May 2023, Nassar took over several bank accounts belonging to two elderly victims at two separate banks using sophisticated techniques, such as porting over the phone number belonging to one of the victims. The method enabled Nassar to access the accounts and bypass the banks’ two-factor authentication protection. Nassar, occasionally assisted by Alaaraj, then drained the accounts and ran up unpaid credit card debits, causing more than $794,000 in losses to the victims. The two men then moved the stolen money through the pass-through accounts created under the victim’s names, as well as funneled $100,000 through Alaaraj’s businesses. The defendants eventually transferred the money to themselves using ATM cash withdrawals, personal checks, Western Union transactions and Zelle transactions. They also used the stolen funds to pay credit cards, engage in online gambling and buy a Mercedes. If found guilty, the two men face up to 30 years of jail time and a $1 million fine for each count of bank fraud. They also face a mandatory prison term of two years and a fine of up to $250,000, or twice the gross gain or gross loss, for the aggravated identity theft count.

It’s time to focus on what really matters: adoption, users, and working systems. In 2025, some coins stand out not just for their name, but for their actual use. BlockDAG, Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana are gaining real momentum. They show up not because of buzzwords, but because people are using them in everyday life. From mobile-friendly mining to smart contracts and fast networks, these top crypto coins are leading for a reason. This guide gives you a clear picture, simple, real, and easy to follow. Whether you’re new or experienced in the space, keep reading to learn why these four names matter in today’s Web3 world. 1. BlockDAG’s Mobile Growth and $312M Milestone BlockDAG is standing out fast, thanks to its simple and powerful X1 Miner App. With over 2 million users mining on the app, X1 is one of the fastest-growing apps in the crypto world this year. What makes it so different? No hardware. No big setup. Just a smartphone is enough to start earning BDAG. This easy model is drawing in users beyond the usual crypto crowd. Its strength also lies in its smart design. BlockDAG combines DAG technology with Proof-of-Work. This setup helps the system stay fast and secure while still being decentralized. That balance is not easy to find, and it puts BlockDAG (BDAG) ahead of many others in the space. The numbers speak for themselves. So far, BlockDAG has raised $312 million, now in Batch 29, priced at $0.0276. The early backers in Batch 1 have already seen a strong 2,660% return. In total, over 22.8 billion coins have been sold. For those still thinking about it, the special price of $0.0018 is available till June 20th, a rare chance to get in early. This isn’t just about numbers. BlockDAG is showing real-world use and growth. It offers a system anyone can access, backed by strong tech. With its reach growing and its user base expanding quickly, BlockDAG is firmly placed among the top crypto coins, leading the shift in how blockchain connects to everyday users. 2. Ethereum Powers DeFi With Upgrades in 2025 Ethereum continues to hold a strong position in crypto, backed by its massive network and active developer base. Though it faced past issues like high fees and speed problems, recent updates are solving those pain points. The switch to Proof-of-Stake and Layer 2 upgrades have helped cut costs and increase speed. In 2025, Ethereum remains a top choice for DeFi, NFTs, and dApps. Billions of dollars are tied up in smart contracts here, showing strong trust and real use. While newer names are growing fast, none have matched Ethereum’s size or reliability yet. It continues to be one of the top crypto coins, offering proven tools and a strong track record in building Web3 systems that actually work. 3. Cardano Grows With Research-Driven Progress Cardano stands out for its slow but steady path. Built on deep research and peer-reviewed work, it focuses on getting things right rather than rushing. In 2025, that careful approach is starting to show results, with more apps and smart contracts going live on its platform. Its Hydra upgrade is helping it scale, while partnerships in developing regions grow its reach. ADA may not have flashy news every week, but it keeps building in the background. That stable growth makes it one of the top crypto coins to watch. It may not be loud, but it’s consistent, something many in the space value when looking for lasting results instead of short-term hype. 4. Solana Delivers Speed With Better Stability Solana has always been known for its fast speeds. It can process tens of thousands of transactions per second and charges very low fees. That makes it ideal for areas like gaming, real-time payments, and quick DeFi moves. Although it faced network downtime in the past, 2025 has brought better results. The team has worked on stability, and it’s paying off. More apps and platforms, especially in NFTs and social media, are choosing Solana as their base. Its fast-growing user base and active devs keep it moving forward. Solana proves that strong performance and improved trust can go hand in hand. It earns its spot as one of the top crypto coins with real-time use and solid backing. Final Thoughts In 2025, success in crypto isn’t just about early hype or big promises. It’s about tools that work, people who use them, and systems built to last. BlockDAG shows how simple mobile access can open doors for everyone. Ethereum keeps leading with its tech and trusted platform. Cardano grows at a steady pace with a research-first focus. Solana offers speed and strong user tools. These four each bring something unique. Together, they shape what the future looks like. As Web3 grows, these top crypto coins show us the way forward, clear, usable, and ready for what’s next.

As attention shifts to high-upside altcoins, a growing number of traders and analysts are keeping close tabs on MAGACOINFINANCE — a fast-developing asset that’s gaining traction thanks to structural strength and bullish indicators. Bitcoin’s Role as Market Driver Remains Strong Bitcoin continues to act as the lead barometer for risk sentiment in crypto. With broader geopolitical concerns easing slightly and macro trends pointing toward cautious optimism, traders are repositioning around BTC’s next major move. Recent strength suggests a renewed appetite for digital assets, and as history shows, Bitcoin rallies often set the tone for altcoin rotations shortly after. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is on Every Analyst’s Radar MAGACOINFINANCE is now being tracked closely by Bitcoin and XRP investors seeking asymmetric returns. The recent staking activation and firm supply cap of 170 billion tokens have added credibility to what began as a meme-inspired entry and is now being taken seriously as a long-term player. Investor behavior tells the story: On-chain wallets show long-term holding patterns Staking inflows continue without major dumps Audit from HashEx confirms code integrity Full ownership structure avoids VC overreach Adding to the momentum, MAGACOINFINANCE has introduced a limited-time bonus offer under the promo PATRIOTS100X , giving new buyers added leverage ahead of wider listing exposure. This has only amplified the wave of interest from early adopters looking for strategic positioning. XRP Closer Than Ever to Legal Resolution For XRP, this cycle feels different. The token has bounced back from a multi-day pullback and now rides on the momentum of an almost-resolved legal battle with the SEC. A joint motion to unlock $125 million from escrow marks a potential end to the years-long case — and that’s attracting fresh capital. Speculation is also building around a possible XRP ETF approval, which, if confirmed, could act as a powerful new catalyst. SOL, KAS, and TRX Show Different Strengths Solana (SOL) remains a top Layer 1 in terms of user activity. While no major events have hit headlines, the network continues to support a thriving developer base, maintaining its reputation as a high-performance chain. Kaspa (KAS) is less visible in the current cycle but is quietly attracting attention from long-term traders looking for value entries. KAS remains an infrastructure-focused project with room to surprise if upcoming releases deliver impact. TRON (TRX) is staying consistent. With active support for stablecoins and a growing decentralized ecosystem, it remains a favorite among traders seeking dependable, lower-volatility exposure. Final Thoughts Bitcoin and XRP are creating room for altcoins to move — and while SOL, TRX, and KAS maintain unique strengths, MAGACOINFINANCE is increasingly being viewed as the altcoin with breakout potential. With staking live, a locked supply, and smart investor accumulation underway, the setup is clear for those watching closely.

The firm said on Thursday that it planned to amass 105,000 Bitcoins by the end of 2027, enough to make it one of the world’s largest corporate holders of digital assets. The company’s Bitcoin purchasing plan is set to be rolled out over three years, led by Joe Burnett, the director of Bitcoin strategy . Semler is hoping to own 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025. That figure will increase to 42,000 BTC by the end of 2026 and to 105,000 BTC by the end of 2027. That approach is part of a broader trend among publicly held companies that are forward-looking and increasingly considering Bitcoin not as a speculative bet but as a long-term store of value and a core treasury asset. Semler treats Bitcoin as a long-term asset Semler’s dive into Bitcoin is no flight of fancy. The company’s been on this path since May 2024, when it jumped onto what it calls the “ Bitcoin Standard .” Since then, Semler has pivoted to a Bitcoin bull and is among the most vocal corporate cheerleaders for cryptocurrency. On June 4, 2025, the company held 4,449 BTC valued at $462 million. That would make it one of the 15 biggest Bitcoin collectives in the world. However, the outfit’s 287% BTC yield and $177 million in profit from its Bitcoin holdings as of early June are more remarkable. These returns reinforce the firm’s argument that Bitcoin is not just a hedge but also a potent value-generating asset. Burnett, who has spoken with some of the smartest economists, investors, and Bitcoin thinkers across every format, will help Semler build its thesis around education, macro insights, and treasury diversification with Bitcoin. It also indicates a more deliberate, permanent establishment of Bitcoin strategy within the company’s executive ranks. Semler builds reputation as Bitcoin strategy leader Semler Scientific’s approach puts it in the company of firms such as Strategy, currently the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. With Semler’s 15,000 BTC to date, compared to Strategy’s 214,400 BTC, closing this gap in the longer term is truly underway. It is now the second US public company to adopt the Bitcoin Standard, following Strategy. According to The Block data, almost 230 companies worldwide have adopted similar Bitcoin treasury strategies. Semler’s move is part of a growing institutional trend toward Bitcoin, such as the growing number of US spot Bitcoin ETFs on the heels of more positive regulatory clarity and greater macroeconomic uncertainty, leading many to diversify their asset portfolio. The company now trades on the Nasdaq under the trading symbol SMLR. It now trades at about $32 a share for a market capitalization of about $375 million. Semler’s aggressive crypto play has garnered interest from traditional investors and Bitcoin enthusiasts. Though it has been relatively modest in size, the fund has seen users plow money into it at a rapid clip. In an industry where few healthcare companies have been brave enough to take such a step, Semler establishes a distinct brand that blends healthcare innovation with Bitcoin maximalism. Assuming its plan proceeds according to schedule, the company may soon become one of the biggest non-financial corporate owners of Bitcoin in the next two years.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins its trading day, bitcoin BTC is trading above $104,500 and, despite a possible looming war in the Middle East, has been relatively flat on the day with negligible market movement. Indeed, for the last full week, BTC is only down 2%, according to CoinDesk market data . Analysts are debating whether the crypto market’s current stillness is a sign of strength or if something more precarious is afoot. Three new reports this week from CryptoQuant , Glassnode , and trading firm Flowdesk all point to the same surface conditions: low volatility, tight price action, and subdued on-chain activity. Additionally, retail participation has waned, and institutional players, from ETFs to whales, are now shaping the structure of flows. But it’s CryptoQuant that’s flashing the most urgent warning. In its June 19 report, CryptoQuant argued that BTC could soon revisit $92,000 support or even fall as low as $81,000 if demand continues to deteriorate. Spot demand is still increasing, but well below trend. ETF flows have dropped by more than 60% since April, while whale accumulation has halved. Short-term holders, who are usually newer market participants, have shed approximately 800,000 BTC since late May. Their demand momentum indicator, which tracks directional buying strength across key cohorts, is now reading negative 2 million BTC, the lowest in CryptoQuant’s dataset. Glassnode , however, sees the same signals and arrives at a far less dire conclusion. In its weekly on-chain update, the firm acknowledges that the Bitcoin blockchain is “quiet,"" meaning transaction counts are down, fees are minimal, and miner revenue is subdued. However, this suggests that it may not be a weakness, but rather a reflection of the network’s evolution. On-chain settlement volume remains high, but it’s concentrated in large-value transfers, suggesting the chain is increasingly being used by institutions and whales. The derivatives market, Glassnode notes, now dwarfs on-chain activity, with futures and options volumes regularly exceeding spot by 7x–16x. That shift has brought more sophisticated hedging, better collateral practices, and a more mature, if less frenetic, market structure. France-based Flowdesk, a market maker and trading firm, has views that fall somewhere in between. While noting thinning altcoin flows and flat market-making volumes, its June 19 update describes the market as “coiled,” not cracking. Flowdesk highlights a surge in tokenized assets, such as Gold-backed XAUT (up 56% in volume), stablecoin growth, and increasing RWA activity. To them, low volatility may simply be the calm before a directional breakout, which is not necessarily downwards. But in the end, no one seems to hold a reliable map for what’s ahead. Even Polymarket bettors aren't sure as there is a near equal chance of BTC dropping to $90K in June or moving up to $115K-120K. One thing is for sure: the tug-of-war between bullish institutional activities and waning retail demand potentially opens bitcoin up to dramatic moves on either side of the trade, which will likely dictate the market’s next chapter. Presto Research Says Crypto Treasury Companies Have Less Risk Than You Think A new report from Presto Research argues that Crypto Treasury Companies (CTCs), such as Strategy and Metaplanet, are not just leveraged bitcoin ETFs, but a new form of financial engineering with less risk than many investors assume. Strategy’s latest raise, which raised nearly $1 billion via perpetual preferred shares , shows how BTC’s volatility can be used to an issuer’s advantage. These securities, along with convertible bonds and at-the-market equity sales, allow CTCs to fund aggressive crypto accumulation without triggering margin risk. Presto points out that Strategy’s BTC is unpledged and Metaplanet’s bonds are unsecured, meaning collateral liquidation, the primary trigger in past crypto blowups like Celsius and Three Arrows, is largely absent here. That does not eliminate risk, but it changes the nature of it. The real challenge, Presto argues, is not crypto exposure itself but the discipline to manage dilution, cash flow, and capital timing. Metaplanet’s “bitcoin yield” metric, which measures BTC per fully diluted share, reflects that focus on shareholder value. As long as CTCs can manage the financial mechanics behind their accumulation strategies, they will earn NAV premiums just like high-growth companies in traditional markets. But if they miscalculate, the same tools that fuel their rise could accelerate their fall. Semler Scientific Maps Bold Plan to Hold 105,000 BTC by 2027 Semler Scientific (Nasdaq: SMLR) has unveiled one of the most aggressive bitcoin accumulation roadmaps in corporate history, announcing plans to hold 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, 42,000 by 2026, and a staggering 105,000 by the close of 2027. The California-based medical device maker, which pivoted to a bitcoin treasury strategy last year, is effectively trying to increase its current bitcoin stash of 4,449 coins by more than two fold over the next 30 months. It plans to do so using a mix of equity raises, debt financing, and operational cash flow. There aren't specific details of how the company plans to fund the buy. Hwever, historically Semler’s primary mechanism for acquiring bitcoin was selling new shares under its at-the-market (ATM) program, which relies on the company trading at a premium to its net asset value (NAV). According to data from Strategy-Tracker , Semler’s mNAV currently sits at 0.859x, meaning the market values the firm’s equity lower than its BTC holdings, which could be cutting off its ability to raise accretive capital. How this dynamic plays out, would be worth watching as the firm initiates more bitcoin buying. Even as bitcoin has surged to all-time highs above $100,000, Semler shares are down nearly 40% on the year. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin remains stuck below $105K despite strong ETF inflows, with repeated resistance at $105,150 and signs of institutional accumulation offset by short-term bearish momentum and macro volatility. ETH: Ethereum found support at $2,490 after a high-volume selloff broke key levels, with the price consolidating in a tight range amid geopolitical tensions and macro uncertainty, signaling potential for a breakout if resistance at $2,510 is cleared. Gold: Gold hovered near $3,366 on Thursday, little changed as escalating geopolitical tensions offset pressure from the Fed’s hawkish stance, while platinum retreated after hitting a near 10-year high; U.S. markets remained closed for Juneteenth. Nikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei 225 opened 0.24% higher Friday as Asia-Pacific markets mostly rose ahead of China’s loan prime rate decision and amid ongoing Israel-Iran tensions.

While Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Injective (INJ), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) continue to dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as a strategic buy with breakout potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: 2025’s Most-Watched List With Upside ROI Outlook MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining serious traction among analysts, earning a place alongside Solana, XRP, and Bitcoin on 2025’s most-watched gainers list . With a series of high-impact upgrades and strong breakout activity, the project is drawing growing attention from experienced investors and strategic buyers. Its early positioning, combined with rising momentum, signals long-term potential that many believe could rival—and even surpass—larger-cap competitors. Now widely seen as a “high-conviction buy under $0.01,” MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a preferred entry point for those seeking asymmetric upside in a crowded market. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Outlook as Institutional Demand Grows Ethereum is poised for a strong June, with price predictions targeting a reclaim of the $2,800–$2,900 range if bullish momentum continues. Institutional buying and DeFi utility are driving optimism, and as ETH consolidates, some investors are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture early-stage growth alongside blue-chip stability. XRP: Lawsuit Decision and ETF Hopes Drive Volatility XRP is trading near $0.54, with investor focus on the pivotal June 16 Ripple lawsuit decision and ongoing ETF speculation. A favorable outcome could push XRP above $0.65, but regardless, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention as a fresh alternative for those seeking new alpha in a volatile market. Injective (INJ): Uptrend Continues with Strong Forecasts INJ remains in an uptrend, with June forecasts projecting prices as high as $16.63. As traders look for the next big mover, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s parabolic presale growth is drawing comparisons to early-stage INJ, especially among those seeking high potential returns. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Steady Growth Amid Market Optimism Bitcoin Cash is trading above $500, with a solid 18% weekly gain and forecasts for continued strength into July. As BCH solidifies its position, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as a complementary play for investors seeking both established and emerging opportunities. Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE, Ethereum, and XRP are capturing the spotlight as Bitcoin insiders and traders seek the next breakout story in 2025. With strong fundamentals and growing support, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a top contender in the altcoin race.

You’re not alone. With so many options, knowing where to look can be tough. In this article, we explore some of the most promising top altcoins for 2025. We’ll break down what makes BlockDAG, Monero, Aave, and Celestia stand out. Each of these projects tackles real issues in crypto with fresh ideas. Whether you’re just getting started or you’ve been around crypto for a while, these coins offer clear reasons to pay attention. We’ll highlight features, growth signs, and what each brings to the table. Let’s dive in and make sense of these top altcoins so you can follow opportunities with confidence. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Where Simplicity Meets Strong Growth BlockDAG is making waves as a user‑friendly and simple option among top altcoins. Its main draw is the X1 Miner App, which lets anyone mine by just tapping on their phone. No complex setup, no energy cost worries, no tech hurdles. It’s that simple. The app has already welcomed over 2 million people, many of them brand new to cryptocurrency. All they need is a smartphone, and they can start earning. So far, BlockDAG has raised $312 million in its presale. It is now in Batch 29, priced at $0.0276 per coin. Early supporters from Batch 1 have seen a fantastic 2,660% return on their money. To date, 22.7 billion coins have been sold. And here’s a bonus: the frozen price of $0.0018 is still available until June 20. This makes it even more accessible right now. This project stands out because it combines ease of use with real early‑stage upside. For those watching the top altcoins, BlockDAG’s figures and mobile approach help it capture attention. It reduces friction for newcomers and could appeal to a much wider audience. Its current batch price and the strong performance so far give a clear view into its momentum. BlockDAG offers both simplicity and scale in a crypto world that often feels complicated. 2. Monero (XMR): Privacy-Centred and Hard to Trace Monero is known as the leading privacy coin among the top altcoins. It hides the sender, receiver, and amount in each transaction. That makes it ideal for anyone who values stealth and control over their data. Unlike coins with public ledgers, Monero masks details so outsiders can’t trace transactions. This feature has earned it respect among users who want serious privacy. As digital surveillance grows, Monero stands as a shield. If you want to send money without exposing your identity or amounts, this coin delivers. Its strong privacy makes it unique and valuable. Many see it as essential in a world where data is constantly tracked. With user privacy becoming a hot topic, Monero stays relevant and powerful. 3. Aave (AAVE): Leading the Charge in DeFi Aave leads the way in the DeFi space and ranks high among top altcoins for good reason. It lets users lend their crypto to earn interest or borrow by using holdings as collateral. No banks, no middlemen. Everything runs on the Ethereum blockchain, using shared pools of funds. One standout feature is “flash loans.” These let users borrow and return money within one transaction. It sounds complex, but it opens doors for smart traders and programmers. Aave’s platform is open source, and its tools have gained strong traction in the decentralised finance world. It helps people earn passive returns or access capital without a traditional loan. As DeFi grows, Aave stands out as one of the most trusted and innovative platforms. 4. Celestia (CEL): Scaling Blockchain with Modular Design Celestia is a newcomer with a big idea: to solve blockchain scaling. It does so by separating how transactions are reached (consensus) from how they’re run (execution). This “modular” setup is different from older systems that try to do everything together. By splitting tasks, Celestia can handle more activity without slowing down. Developers can build apps without worrying about bottlenecks. This makes Celestia a fresh pick among top altcoins focused on next‑gen architecture. It supports more volume while keeping things secure and decentralised. If you’re curious when thinking about blockchain’s future, Celestia offers a smart route forward. Final Thoughts Crypto is a fast‑moving space, but some names keep standing out. BlockDAG brings simplicity with strong early growth. Monero covers privacy in a crowded field. Aave redefines finance without banks. Celestia builds a powerful foundation for future apps. These top altcoins each have clear strengths and offer thoughtful paths forward. Whether you’re new or experienced, they highlight different parts of the crypto puzzle. Keep an eye on them, you might find exactly what fits your goals among the top altcoins in this exciting digital world.

According to market watcher Titan of Crypto, the story isn’t over yet. Related Reading: Tether Enforces Freeze On $12 Million In Tron Funds Over Illicit Activity Bitcoin slipped just 6% from its all‑time high of $112,000, but some analysts pointed to a cooling relative strength index (RSI) and warned of a top. Titan’s take flips that view on its head, arguing that we’re still deep in the meat of the bull cycle. Fractal Cycles Keep Running Titan pointed to a clear pattern in Bitcoin’s last two cycles. Each cycle began with roughly 13 monthly bars—about 396 days—of steep decline. In 2014–15, Bitcoin fell from $1,240 to $161 over that span. Prices then rallied for 35 bars (1,065 days) to hit $19,800 in December 2017. The same 13‑bar slide followed by 35 bars of gains played out again after 2018, ending at $69,000 in 2021. #Bitcoin Bull Market Entering Final Phase 🏁 As in previous cycles: ~1 year of bear market, followed by ~3 years of expansion.$BTC looks to be in the final leg but not done yet. pic.twitter.com/MGre5ahz3P — Titan of Crypto (@Washigorira) June 18, 2025 Momentum And RSI In Focus Some analysts flagged a weakening RSI as a sign that Bitcoin has peaked. That metric can’t be ignored—when momentum wanes, price often takes a breather. Titan’s chart lays down the time‑based pattern, but RSI, trading volume, and on‑chain data give a live read on demand. Bull Run Still Has Room Based on reports, the current cycle’s bullish phase kicked off in January 2023 and sits in the 29th bar this month. Bitcoin has climbed 530% since the start of that run. If history holds, we’ve got at least five more monthly bars of uptrend before the rally tops out around November. Earlier studies even point to a wedge breakout that could send price to about $137,000 before any serious pullback. Big Names See Higher Peaks Samson Mow, the CEO of Jan3, foresees Bitcoin tearing past the $1 million mark in a fierce upswing, powered by government rollouts, sovereign bond issuances, and an urgent surge in ‘hyperbitcoinization’ before seeing any real correction. Raoul Pal (Real Vision), the former Goldman Sachs executive, shares a familiar bullish view. He has laid out scenarios where Bitcoin hits $1 million by 2030, based on monetary stimulus and limited supply. Related Reading: Iran’s Top Crypto Hub Loses $82 Million To Hackers With Israeli Links—Details Strategy’s Michael Saylor has also said Bitcoin could skyrocket to between $500,000 and $1 million before seeing any real correction. These big names in the crypto industry highlight growing institutional inflows and a looming supply squeeze after the next halving as fuel for an even higher peak. This rally isn’t just a rerun of what we saw in 2017 or 2021. Bitcoin today moves with ETFs, big‑ticket corporate buys, and more traders watching on‑chain signals than ever before. Meanwhile, the latest outlook by CoinCodex sees Bitcoin climbing 5.73% to hit roughly $110,732 by July 19, 2025. Right now, technical signals point to a Neutral mood, while the Fear & Greed Index sits at 57—squarely in Greed territory.

It’s the first time a USDC wallet has been integrated into this ecosystem on the XRP Ledger, which means people can send and receive USDC directly in and out of XRP Ledger wallets. It links one of the top stablecoins with one of the fastest and most efficient blockchain networks. Introduced by Circle and supported by fully reserved US dollars, USDC has evolved into an accessible stablecoin for payments, trading, and DeFi. Operating on the XRPL also confers the speed and scalability required to access even more users globally. This will further enhance Uphold’s speed , fee, and interoperability-centric multi-asset platform position. Now, people can smoothly and conveniently send money for remittance, personal finance, or business. It’s also a good tool for developers and entrepreneurs. They can develop apps or services that accept USDC on XRPL, making blockchain-based financial tools more accessible. New regulation strengthens trust in USDC and stablecoins The strategic combination comes at a time of significant change in the regulatory environment in the US. On June 18, American legislators introduced the Genius Act , which was designed to establish a federal framework for regulating fiat-backed stablecoins such as USDC. The Genius Act includes better licensing, disclosure, and reserve requirement parameters. The act should boost legitimate companies like Circle, the issuers of which will be seen as more credible and trustworthy in mainstream eyes. This institutional maturity is the introduction of USDC on XRPL by Uphold. Businesses receiving that guidance will have a clearer direction on complying with US law and financial best practices when using stablecoins. As the regulation progresses, stablecoins like USDC will evolve from tools for crypto traders to trusted components of the global financial infrastructure for payments, fintech, payroll, and treasury operations. This might even push more adoption of XRPL as a network for regulated digital assets. XRP ledger hits key deflationary milestone Meanwhile, the XRP Ledger nears an imminent epoch of massive deflation. More than 13.8 million XRP were burned this way as of June 2025. This burn has been hard-coded in the XRPL protocol from the very beginning. Each time you make a transaction, there is a small fee, and that fee is not paid out to miners or validators but is burned, thus effectively taking XRP out of circulation. This would eventually reduce supply and contribute to value growth and longevity. While 14 million XRP is not much when you consider that there are 100 billion that will ever exist at one point, it can illustrate a steadfast network use case, not to mention the continued working deflationary nature. Fast-finalizing, low-cost, green, deflationary aspects of XRPL provide an attractive venue to issue stablecoins and tokenize assets. Now that USDC is on XRPL through Uphold, you have a stable digital dollar and a network with no speed, efficiency, or value shortages. For developers, that also unlocks the ability to release payment applications, remittance tools, and DeFi protocols, which merge stable value with the speed of blockchain.

Over the past week, Dogecoin has dropped 12%, with a sharp 6% decline in just 24 hours as U.S. regulators delayed altcoin ETF approvals and geopolitical tensions rattled markets. While this decline raises questions over which crypto to buy now, many investors are turning their attention to projects with stronger fundamentals. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of such stand-outs, a trending crypto DeFi token with a price of less than a dollar that has a solid roadmap and 20x potential, and it is a game changer when searching to uncover the next big cryptocurrency. At present, despite being on phase-5 of its presale, MUTM has already received more than 10.8 million and it has drawn close to 12,200 investors due to its scarce price of only 0.03. Mutuum Finance Reinvents DeFi Lending with a Dual-Model Approach Mutuum Finance is raising the bar for decentralized lending by introducing a next-generation protocol built on a dual-model system that blends Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending mechanisms. In the P2C model automated smart contracts manage lending pools with dynamically adjusted interest rates based on market activity. This ensures stable returns for lenders and reliable borrowing terms bringing more predictability and safety to the lending process. Meanwhile the P2P model eliminates middlemen altogether enabling borrowers and lenders to interact directly. This setup is ideal for volatile assets offering greater flexibility and control over terms and risk management. By combining the strengths of both models Mutuum Finance delivers an unmatched mix of efficiency decentralization and adaptability, setting a new benchmark in the DeFi ecosystem. Presale Phase 5 Gathers Pace The presale of the Mutuum Finance is now at Phase 5, and the pace is snowballing. What makes up the project a fast-spreading topic of discussion is that more than 12,200 investors have already participated in the project, and almost $11 million has been raised. Stablecoin Backed by CertiK Audit Adds Layer of Trust To further nail down its platform, Mutuum Finance is planning to introduce a fully collateralized stablecoin pegged to the USD on the Ethereum network. The stablecoin, currently in development, is designed as stable compared to the unstable algorithmic cryptocurrencies and designed to remain pegged even through the volatility in the market, ensuring a reliable and safe means of exchange and saving asset. In order to assure the utmost quality of trust and security, the Mutuum stablecoin itself and the entire ecosystem of the project have been thoroughly audited by the CertiK security firm that is among the most recognizable security firms operating in the blockchain. This audit provides the clear development process and the orientation towards long-term stability and user safety of this project. While Dogecoin continues to slide, now down 12% in the past week and trading near $0.17, investors looking for high-upside opportunities are pivoting toward more fundamentally sound projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Already, Mutuum has raised over $10.8 million from 12,200+ investors during its Phase 5 presale, with the token still priced at just $0.03. Backed by a CertiK-audited ecosystem, a dual-model P2P and P2C lending protocol, and an upcoming fully collateralized stablecoin, MUTM is shaping up to be a serious force in DeFi. With 20x to 44x ROI potential projected by analysts, this could be the most promising DeFi launch of 2025. Secure your stake in Mutuum Finance now before the next price increase hits.

While XRP, Solana, Kaspa, and TRON continue to play key roles in the current cycle, a growing number of experts are now calling attention to MAGACOINFINANCE — pointing to its strategic positioning and untapped return potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Project Gaining Quiet Power MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves behind the scenes. While it started as a meme-fueled idea, it has rapidly transformed into one of the most structurally sound projects on analysts’ dashboards. The token’s capped supply of 170 billion has removed concerns around inflation or stealth dilution, and staking has already gone live — driving behavioral shifts among early investors. What’s drawing analyst attention now is the alignment between fundamentals and behavior: Wallet activity shows long-term accumulation Smart contract audited by HashEx Staking inflows are rising without quick exits Community entry points are timed ahead of major exposure Some traders are using the limited-time PATRIOTS100X bonus offer as an extra edge — locking in positions now before larger market discovery hits. XRP Nears Regulatory Breakthrough XRP’s legal path is finally becoming clearer. The SEC and Ripple have jointly filed to release $125 million from escrow, a major sign that settlement is on the table. This move, coupled with growing speculation about an XRP ETF, has given traders reason to monitor the token closely. Though recent price action reflected broader market sell-offs, sentiment around XRP is improving fast — and analysts are noting its potential for sudden upside if clarity arrives soon. SOL, TRX, and KAS Maintain Strong Foundations Solana (SOL) continues to rank as one of the most used blockchains by daily active users. While no single update has made headlines lately, Solana’s strong ecosystem and consistent technical improvements keep it firmly in trader watchlists. TRON (TRX) is showing stable growth, with particular traction in the stablecoin and dApp segments. Founder Justin Sun remains active, and community engagement continues to support on-chain expansion. Kaspa (KAS) is flying under the radar but remains popular among infrastructure-focused investors. Its quiet development cycle is viewed by some as an ideal setup for long-term positioning — especially for those looking for undiscovered value plays. Final Thoughts As XRP flirts with regulatory breakthroughs and SOL, TRX, and KAS stay on their individual paths, MAGACOINFINANCE is capturing analyst attention for all the right reasons. The foundation is set, momentum is building, and the market is beginning to take notice.

On Thursday, June 19, Polymarket, an American crypto-based prediction platform, gave the GENIUS Act an 89% chance of passing both the US Senate and House. The platform also predicted the president would sign it into law before 2026. This came just a few days after a key vote in the Senate and a recent public push from President Donald Trump to get the bill to his desk quickly. Notably, the Polymarket bet appeared to have gone live around 18 hours after the Senate passed the bill in a 68-30 vote. Polymarket’s 89% odds on the fate of the GENIUS Act sparks controversy in the crypto space Following the Polymarket odds, it is not yet clear if the bill would have strong enough support to pass the House in its current form, or whether lawmakers would append amendments to ease concerns about Trump’s ties to the crypto space, including World Liberty Financial’s stablecoin, USD1. Additionally, several senators voted against a similar change before the final passage of the GENIUS Act, which sent the bill to the House. Depending on the bill’s final version, one possible outcome is that it could open the floodgates for US companies to issue their own stablecoins to settle payments. For instance, Tech giants like Apple and Google were said to be considering their own tokens. Concerning this, two United States senators sent questions to Meta about whether the company had similar plans once the bill potentially becomes law. On the other hand, Trump has indicated he would sign the GENIUS Act “with no add-ons” if the House were to pass it swiftly. In addition, Republicans hold a narrow majority in the chamber and might soon have to vote on a bill to create a framework for a crypto market structure. The CLARITY Act, a proposal the committee passed last week, would clarify US financial regulators’ responsibility over digital assets. Meanwhile, the Polymarket odds do not necessarily predict whether United States legislators will pass the bill or President Trump will give it his signature to become a law. Instead, the prediction market displays how much crypto enthusiasts are willing to bet on one or more specific outcomes. French Hill expresses hope in the CLARITY Act to make the US a global leader in digital assets The US House Committee on Financial Services approved a crypto market structure bill, the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act. This assured crypto enthusiasts that it will soon head to the full House for a vote. House Financial Services Committee lawmakers voted 32 to 19 to send the CLARITY Act for a full floor vote. This came after the House Agriculture Committee advanced the bill in a 47 to 6 vote. Congressman French Hill, who sponsored the bill, right after the vote was successful, stated that this is the second bill that Bryan Steil has skillfully led, acknowledging first with stablecoins and then with a market structure bill. Steil, the chairman of the House Committee on Financial Services Crypto Subcommittee, acknowledged that it was a big step forward and was pleased to see that Hill’s act had made it through the House committees. Hill mentioned that this is a chance for America to take charge of the future of Web3 on the internet, especially in financial services that use tokenized payments. If the CLARITY Act and GENIUS Act are approved, they could bring a major change to cryptocurrency rules in the US, making the crypto world stronger.

As the broader market enters a decisive summer phase, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention with its high-energy pre-sale, forward-thinking tokenomics, and rapidly expanding community. While major players like XRP, Cardano (ADA), and TRON (TRX) continue to generate news, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE’s swift rise that’s prompting comparisons to the early trajectories of the cycle’s most successful altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analysts Forecast Major Growth in 2025 Altcoin Market MAGACOIN FINANCE has made a strong debut in the crypto space, positioning itself as a standout project for 2025 . With a capped supply and politically driven branding, it’s generating significant market anticipation. Analysts are already eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE as a potential disruptor in the altcoin landscape. The exclusive pre-sale—accessible only through the official website—offers a 100% bonus for contributions using PATRIOTS100X . XRP: Lawsuit Resolution and ETF Hopes Dominate June XRP is at a critical inflection point, trading near $2.15 after a recent pullback, as the market awaits the final Ripple lawsuit decision on June 16. As XRP’s volatility attracts speculative capital, some traders are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE, seeking early exposure to the next potential breakout. Cardano (ADA): Stabilizing and Eyeing Recovery ADA is consolidating around $0.75 after a correction from its early-year highs. With ecosystem upgrades like the Chang Hard Fork and Hydra scaling, Cardano’s fundamentals remain strong. If ADA maintains support above $0.70, a move toward $0.80–$0.84 is possible in June. ADA’s measured optimism is echoed by those backing MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is also seen as a growth play with robust fundamentals. TRON (TRX): Bullish Momentum and Price Surge TRON is forecasted to rise as much as 26% this month, with prices potentially reaching $0.35 by late June. Technical indicators point to sustained bullish momentum, and as TRX rallies, many traders are looking for similar high-upside opportunities—putting MAGACOIN FINANCE firmly on their radar. Solana (SOL): Record Retail Growth and Ecosystem Expansion Solana continues to impress with over 11.6 million wallets holding at least 0.1 SOL, a record for the network. Trading near $149, SOL’s technical setup is at an inflection point, with $128 as key support and $160 as breakout resistance. The highly anticipated Solaxy ICO and ongoing ecosystem launches are keeping SOL in the headlines, while MAGACOIN FINANCE’s momentum is drawing similar grassroots enthusiasm. Conclusion As Solana, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE lead the charge in June 2025, investors are watching closely for the next big breakout. With strong communities and bullish catalysts, these projects are shaping the narrative for the summer’s crypto market.

As BlockDAG (BDAG) develops further, its chances for strong growth in 2025 seem clear, especially when compared to what Pi Network and Near Protocol are doing. BlockDAG X-Series Miners Set to Ship to Early Testers BlockDAG is moving forward as it gets ready to ship its X-Series miners. The network will ship the first 100 units of the X30 and X100 models to a selected group of early testers. The shipment of X30 and X100 miners will begin on July 7, while X10 miners will ship from August 15. These first shipments are important for testing how the miners work in real situations. This step marks a key moment in BlockDAG’s push to bring decentralized mining to its network. The move from testing to real-world use is a major step in BlockDAG’s growth. The X-Series miners are designed to be efficient and eco-friendly. They avoid the large machines and high power costs usually seen in crypto mining. This makes mining easier to access and better for more people. BlockDAG’s progress is also shown in its presale numbers. It has raised $312 million so far. The current batch 29 is priced at $0.0276, with a 2,660% rise in ROI since batch one. The reduced coin price of $0.0018 is still available until June 20. As testing begins and feedback is gathered, BlockDAG is working to build its place in the crypto space. This move to live use is an important step toward making decentralized mining work within its system. Mobile Mining Drives Pi Network’s Growing Popularity Pi Network is gaining wide attention thanks to its mobile-first mining system. Users can earn Pi on their phones without using much battery or needing costly equipment. This simple and user-friendly method has helped the project build a strong and expanding community. As a result, Pi is now one of the most talked-about names in crypto today. Looking at Pi Network’s price outlook, many expect the Pi Coin to rise once the project moves fully to its mainnet. As user activity grows, the coin’s supply in the market will also increase, which may boost its overall value. With growing interest and plans for an exchange listing, some believe Pi’s price could go up sharply. Excitement around the network keeps building, pointing to the chance of a major price rise soon. Near Protocol Moves Up as Key Price Levels Hold Near Protocol has been showing strong price action recently. New technical signals suggest the price could jump by 30 percent. This comes as the project’s fast and low-cost blockchain continues to gain users, making it stand out in the world of decentralized apps. A key point in this trend is the support level near $2.00, which has stayed strong over the past few weeks. The price bounced from this zone and moved toward $2.35 to $2.40, breaking through a past barrier. If it holds above that, it might keep rising, with the next key levels between $2.80 and $3.00. BlockDAG Focuses on Scalable Mining for the Future Looking ahead to 2025, Pi Network and Near Protocol both show solid growth paths, but BlockDAG is shaping its own route through efficient and open mining. BlockDAG is now moving from its testing stage into live use, with its X-Series miners playing a central role. While Pi and Near explore their own strengths, BlockDAG is offering a mining setup that cuts down on cost and is easier for more people to use. As all three projects grow and change, BlockDAG is working toward a steady place in the crypto world through its focus on a better way to mine.

At 02:26 UTC the TradingView snapshot captured DOGE changing hands at $0.16979, fractionally lower on the session, while the 14-period relative-strength index sat at 35.72, just north of classical oversold territory. Dogecoin Prints Bullish Divergence The most striking feature of the graphic is a sequence of regular bullish divergences—price sets progressively lower lows even as the RSI traces higher troughs. Cantonese Cat illustrates three such inflection points: the first in August 2024, the second in March and April 2025 and the latest in mid-June. Historically, the first signal preceded the parabolic autumn rally that vaulted DOGE from the high-$0.05 area to an intraday peak just shy of $0.23, a nearly 300% advance. The March divergence ushered in a 100 percent rebound back to the $0.26 zone, a former support now acting as overhead resistance. Related Reading: Dogecoin Looks Like ‘It Wants To Play Dead’—Again “DOGE daily – Bullish divergence with RSI,” Cantonese Cat wrote in his post, letting the annotated arrows speak louder than prose. A schematic inserted on the right-hand side of the chart underlines the textbook definition: in the highlighted quadrant, price slopes downward while momentum slopes upward, a configuration often interpreted as buyers quietly absorbing supply. Descending Channel And Key Support Line The current structural context lends weight to the signal. Since topping out in November above $0.48, price is retracing inside a descending channel. Within that broader channel, Dogecoin is now retesting a former down-sloping resistance line—which provided stiff resistance throughout March and April this year—that it finally broke in early May and is now acting as crucial support near $0.163. Just below this back-test sits the multi-year ascending trendline which now sits close to $0.142. Should both of those levels falter, the true lower boundary of the descending channel waits a fraction lower around $0.139, giving bulls only a narrow buffer of roughly three cents to defend. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Enters ‘Alarm Zone,’ Major Move Coming? From a Fibonacci perspective, the 0.786 retracement at $0.1826—coupled with the 20- and 50-day exponential moving averages as well as the channel midline at $0.172—forms the first ceiling that must be cleared to shift near-term momentum. A breakout above that area would expose the 0.618 level at $0.247 and the 100-day EMA. Successive hurdles then stack at the 0.5 retracement ($0.292), the 0.382 ($0.338), and the 0.236 ($0.3939), each corresponding to prior congestion zones during the winter advance. Volume has begun to taper as price approaches support, while the 14-period RSI remains anchored in the mid-30s—still technically oversold, but showing a slight uptick that mirrors the bullish divergence Cantonese Cat flagged. For bears, a decisive daily close beneath the multi-year trendline would invalidate that divergence setup and likely drive DOGE toward the horizontal liquidity band between $0.135 and $0.13, with a final capitulation target around $0.10—site of last October’s base.

On Thursday, Italy’s economy minister , Giancarlo Giorgetti, called the bloc’s current budget system “stupid and senseless” and said it needed to be overhauled to give member states more leeway to boost military spending without fear of financial penalties. Those comments came as the eurozone finance ministers assembled in a critical meeting in Luxembourg, where the bloc is fighting over whether to maintain a balanced budget or step up its investment in Europe’s security while being urged to ease its focus on fiscal discipline. Most recently, the European Commission has debuted new clauses permitting greater leeway in the bloc’s fiscal rules, or the Stability and Growth Pact. The goal is to allow governments to expand defense spending in the face of growing security threats, particularly from Russia. Members would agree to be permitted to increase their defense budgets by 1.5% of GDP annually over four years. This holds even if their national budget deficits break the EU’s longstanding 3% of GDP limit, which usually prompts correction. However, this new leeway would only be relevant for countries not already under EU disciplinary procedures over debt. It would leave out Italy, the country now receiving all the attention. “It is essential to find ways to bring these rules up to date with the crisis we are experiencing so that they do not seem stupid and senseless,” the minister said in a statement issued by his staff on the sidelines of a meeting with Eurozone peers in Luxembourg. He insisted that Italy was being punished for its past deficits, even as it tried to play its part in Europe’s collective defense. Rome resists a flexibility clause to protect its financial reputation Italy has pledged to reduce its budget deficit from 3.4% of GDP in 2024 to 2.8% by 2026. Embracing the EU’s new defense spending flexibility might support NATO efforts, but would make it impossible for Italy to achieve that fiscal goal. Two of the Italian government’s most senior figures seconded his concerns, and they also said that Rome wanted to avoid taking any measures that could put its relationship with the financial markets under pressure. Investors have noticed Italy’s policing of its budget, and credit rating upgrades in recent months have reflected that progress. In May, Moody’s upgraded Italy’s credit outlook to “positive.” That came just after S&P Global raised the country’s credit rating to “BBB+” from “BBB,” a show of confidence in Italy’s economic management. Giorgetti cautioned that applying different criteria to different countries risked dividing the EU at a time when it needed to come together. Italy pushes EU to fund defense through joint debt Giorgetti said it was more necessary than ever to have a common financial capacity to address Europe’s growing defense needs. He added that Italy wanted the European Union to borrow jointly to increase military spending, arguing that this approach would share the financial burden across all member states instead of placing excessive pressure on individual national budgets. However, such a plan would require the approval of other EU nations, which is a prospect that looks uncertain. Fiscally conservative countries such as Germany and the Netherlands have long opposed the idea of mutualized EU debt and argued that each country should be responsible for its finances. For countries like Italy, it has become a fiscal juggling exercise between meeting NATO accession commitments, respecting EU budget rules, and keeping financial markets on the side.

Qubetics Ranks in the Best Cryptos to Buy This Month with 4349% Projected Gain,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-xrp-qubetics-ranks-in-the-best-cryptos-to-buy-this-month-with-4349-projected-gain/,"XRP remains a key reference point in the crypto sector. As the native token of the XRP Ledger, it once reached a high of $3.84, becoming a core asset for global financial transfers and blockchain adoption. Early community members saw significant returns, but with XRP now trading 43% below its all-time high and its lowest price recorded over a decade ago, the early wealth-building phase has passed. Many buyers joined XRP after its rapid climb, only to see modest or delayed gains. This shift has intensified the search for the best cryptos to buy this month. Buyers are now focused on projects that combine practical value with growth potential. The crypto market rewards those who act early, and recent trends show that established coins may not always offer the same rapid growth that once defined the sector. Qubetics ($TICS) now draws attention as a project that meets today’s rising standards. Its ongoing crypto presale provides an alternative for those seeking strong utility, transparent economics, and a fair entry point. The platform’s focus on advanced features is positioning it among the best cryptos to buy this month, particularly for those looking to participate in the next phase of blockchain development. Qubetics: Practical Interoperability for a Connected Crypto Sector Qubetics is built on the principle of interoperability. This allows users, businesses, and platforms to move digital assets and data across multiple blockchains without friction. In a world where many networks remain siloed, this approach addresses major challenges for both enterprises and individuals. For example, a global logistics company managing payments across various countries often struggles with incompatible networks. With Qubetics’ interoperability, cross-border settlements can occur instantly, regardless of the original blockchain used. A design studio working with international clients may need to receive and send payments in different cryptocurrencies, Qubetics enables seamless transfers without converting funds or waiting for network approvals. Freelancers, content creators, and e-commerce shops often handle assets on several blockchains. Qubetics makes it possible to manage everything in one place. This not only saves time but also reduces transaction fees and increases operational flexibility. Large enterprises integrating supply chains and procurement across decentralized platforms will find this feature critical, as it ensures consistency and reduces manual intervention. The Qubetics interoperability model is built to scale with real-world demands. Whether it’s connecting DeFi protocols, enabling new payment channels, or streamlining business processes, this feature places Qubetics among the best cryptos to buy this month. The utility for both professionals and enterprises highlights why adoption is growing in the current crypto presale. Final Stage: Qubetics Crypto Presale Reaches $18 Million Milestone Qubetics has entered its final presale phase, Stage 37, offering $TICS tokens at $0.3370. Over 516 million tokens have been sold to a community of more than 28,100 holders, raising $18 million to date. With less than 10 million tokens remaining and supply reduced from 4 billion to 1.36 billion, the focus now shifts to the public, as 38.55% of all tokens are made available for early buyers. The final crypto presale stage presents a clear opportunity: buyers at this point secure tokens ahead of an expected 20% listing surge to $0.40. Market analysts anticipate strong upward movement after listing, with $TICS price projections between $5 and $10 in the months ahead. Scarcity and rising demand are now central to Qubetics’ strategy, ensuring that current participants benefit from market-driven price growth. This structure makes Qubetics stand out among the best cryptos to buy this month. As the token approaches its exchange debut, the ongoing crypto presale is attracting buyers who missed the earliest stages of major crypto projects. Urgency is mounting as the final stage of the presale draws to a close. Qubetics $15,000 Entry: Potential Gains A $15,000 purchase at the current $0.3370 price yields approximately 44,500 $TICS tokens. When $TICS reaches its anticipated listing price of $0.40, those tokens would be worth $17,800, representing a 20% increase on listing alone. If the token rises to $1, that amount grows to $44,500, a 196% return. At $5, the projected value is $222,500. Should Qubetics reach $10, the total climbs to $445,000. Early adopters who joined at Stage 1 for $0.01 are already seeing substantial growth. While the initial round has ended, there is still strong potential for returns for those entering during the final stage of the crypto presale. Time is limited, and the chance for maximum gains remains only while tokens are still available. XRP: From Early Growth to Missed Opportunities XRP’s history is closely linked to the broader development of cryptocurrency. Developed to make global transfers faster and more affordable, the XRP Ledger quickly became recognized for its speed and efficiency. Over the years, the network has seen major upgrades, such as increased transaction throughput and lower fees, which have helped it serve a growing user base. However, the all-time low for XRP was recorded 11 years ago, and its all-time high was set seven years back. Many people joined after these milestones, often seeing only modest or delayed gains compared to those who entered early. Today, XRP remains a respected asset in the digital finance sector. It is still widely used for cross-border payments and innovative financial applications. Recent network upgrades have improved its performance and reliability, while regulatory changes and global adoption trends continue to shape its future. Despite these advancements, the pace of growth for XRP is now more gradual, reflecting its maturity and established market presence. For those aiming for significant returns, the opportunity that once existed with XRP has largely passed. This reality has renewed interest in finding the best cryptos to buy this month, projects that offer both utility and the potential for rapid growth. As the market looks ahead, new options like Qubetics are drawing attention for their promise of practical solutions and early-stage value. The Final Thoughts Market cycles often present new opportunities for those seeking growth. While XRP delivered significant returns in its initial years, today’s market environment demands forward-thinking projects. Qubetics, with its emphasis on interoperability and a transparent presale structure, is now drawing attention among those looking for the best cryptos to buy this month . Current analysis and market participation indicate that Qubetics is building momentum as a community-driven platform with expanding real-world application. As the final stage of the presale continues, interest remains strong. Rather than focusing on past opportunities, the focus shifts to what can be accomplished now, positioning Qubetics as a project to watch in the months ahead.

As a result, traders are redirecting their focus toward altcoins with clearer upside potential. While well-known assets like Polygon, Chainlink, Polkadot, and Uniswap await fresh catalysts, a new contender — MAGACOIN FINANCE — is drawing investor attention with a sharp surge in interest and a uniquely structured approach. MAGACOIN FINANCE Captures Attention With Structural Strength MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly being seen as a serious player in the altcoin space. This is not just another meme-driven surge — it’s a result of credible fundamentals and calculated tokenomics. With a total token supply permanently capped at 170 billion and staking now live, the project has transitioned from hype to high-conviction territory. What’s making analysts take notice is how investor behavior has shifted: On-chain data shows more accumulation than churn Wallet growth is steady without major sell pressure Audited smart contract from HashEx adds confidence No VC manipulation or centralized control Even more compelling, traders now have access to a limited-time bonus under the promo PATRIOTS100X , giving them a strategic edge ahead of broader market discovery. The project’s setup aligns perfectly with what seasoned investors look for — scarcity, utility, and early participation. Polygon (MATIC) Waits for a Technical Catalyst Polygon (MATIC) remains a respected name in scaling solutions, but its market activity has quieted. Despite strong technology and enterprise collaborations, MATIC’s price has struggled to ignite due to lackluster trading volume. Developers continue to build within the Polygon ecosystem, yet short-term traders are increasingly seeking more dynamic assets as MATIC lingers below key resistance levels. Chainlink (LINK) Maintains Stability but Lacks Spark Chainlink (LINK) continues to provide essential oracle services for the blockchain industry. However, LINK’s movement has been largely sideways, with few spikes in volatility to attract high-frequency traders. While it remains a long-term infrastructure play, LINK hasn’t captured breakout momentum — leading some investors to explore more active, high-reward altcoin opportunities. Polkadot (DOT) Focuses on Ecosystem Growth Polkadot (DOT) is progressing steadily, especially with its parachain rollout and multichain interoperability focus. But from a trading standpoint, DOT is currently in a holding pattern. Although fundamentally sound, the token has not seen sharp price movements in recent weeks, and investors are watching to see whether developer traction can translate into renewed market energy. Uniswap (UNI) Navigates Governance Challenges Uniswap (UNI) remains a top decentralized exchange by volume, but its token hasn’t gained much ground. Recent governance proposals and fee debates have added complexity to its investment appeal. While UNI has long-term value due to the protocol’s usage, traders seeking quick upside are looking elsewhere until a new catalyst emerges. Final Thoughts As Bitcoin cools and coins like MATIC, LINK, DOT, and UNI search for renewed traction, MAGACOINFINANCE is moving in the opposite direction — upward. With a locked supply, live staking, and mounting investor confidence, it’s quickly becoming one of the most watched assets of the month.

XRP fell to $2.16, while Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) dropped over 1%. Ethereum (ETH) also dipped 0.7%, giving up its recent gains. XRP is trading around $2.159, down 0.3% today, after failing to hold above the $2.30 resistance zone. After a rally to $2.35, sellers regained control, and pushing the price back toward $2.11. Earlier, XRP had surged above $2.40, exciting traders and fueling hopes of a breakout. But the rally didn’t last. The price fell back near $2.15, turning what looked like a bullish breakout into a fakeout. The brief spike was driven by whale activity, hopes of an SEC settlement, and strong sentiment, but the momentum faded soon. XRP Stuck in a Tight Range, Will It Revisit Lower Levels? Now, XRP is stuck in a narrow range between $2.00 and $2.50. Analysts say a breakout above $2.50 could target $3.50, but if the price drops, it could fall to $1.85 or even lower. Technical indicators like MACD are showing selling pressure. XRP is forming a symmetrical triangle, which often precedes a major move, up or down. To regain momentum, XRP must reclaim $2.206 and break through resistance around $2.18–$2.21. A successful push above $2.236 could open the way to $2.35 and beyond. But if it slips below $2.113, XRP could revisit support levels at $2.02, $1.92, and even $1.83. Over the past month, XRP has traded between $2.05 and $2.40. Several analysts say the current setup resembles the 2017 price action, which led to a massive breakout to all-time highs. XRP’s 2017 Setup Repeating? XRP has been consolidating between $1.90 and $2.90 for nearly 200 days. Analysts like see similarities to the 2017 triangle pattern that led to a 1,300% rally. With an even longer consolidation this time, a similar rally from the $0.63 breakout zone could push XRP to $8–$10. $XRP I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE 2017 UPCOMING RALLY VIBES pic.twitter.com/5joFCPyViK — Mikybull Crypto (@MikybullCrypto) June 16, 2025 Analyst Dark Defender believes XRP is nearing a crucial breakout point.

Analysts and early movers agree that this next stretch could determine who captures significant gains and who gets left watching from the sidelines. If you’re looking to realign your crypto holdings before the next leg up strategically, here are five adjustments worth considering, led by the altcoin that insiders are calling the breakout force of 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Top Pick for 2025’s Altcoin Ascent Among every token vying for attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly establishing itself as the undeniable frontrunner for the next big breakout. Crypto insiders are already moving in, citing vigorous early wallet activity, interest from smart money, and a powerful brand narrative that mirrors the early days of Ethereum and XRP. For investors who missed the rise of Shiba Inu or Dogecoin, this could be the perfect second chance—only this time, the fundamentals are even stronger. MAGACOIN FINANCE is not just riding a trend—it’s driving one. With momentum accelerating daily and analyst forecasts pointing toward massive upside, early positioning could offer asymmetric returns. Some analysts suggest this project may outperform every token in its category during this cycle. And while you’ll never see specific numbers shared, what’s clear is that every stage before has sold out rapidly, reinforcing the urgency for those still waiting to act. The exclusive PATRIOTS100X bonus offer is also generating high-conviction demand from early adopters. Rebalance Toward Layer-1 Giants With Real-World Adoption After MAGACOIN FINANCE, seasoned investors are rotating capital into battle-tested Layer-1s that continue to attract developer ecosystems and institutional attention. Names like Ethereum and Solana are proving their staying power as core infrastructure players. Ethereum’s upcoming scalability upgrades and regulatory optimism are setting the stage for a potential push to new highs. Meanwhile, Solana is drawing attention for its high-speed throughput and rapid institutional onboarding, making it both a viable core holding and a suitable investment option. But remember, these are foundation plays. For explosive upside, investors are still prioritizing early entries like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Add Exposure to Real-World Asset (RWA) Projects Tokenized real-world assets are shaping up to be one of the most promising narratives of late 2025. As regulatory clarity improves globally, RWAs offer a bridge between traditional finance and DeFi. Projects leveraging real estate, treasury bonds, and commodities through blockchain infrastructure are becoming strategic allocations for high-net-worth individuals and institutions. Positioning a small portion of your portfolio in this segment could offer downside protection with upside potential. Reduce Overexposure to High-Supply Meme Coins Meme coins continue to attract volume, but investors are becoming more selective. Tokens with vague utility or hyperinflated supplies may struggle to maintain relevance in the next leg of the bull run. Rather than gambling on the next hype wave, many are opting for early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the branding power of a meme meets disciplined tokenomics and real investor traction. Hedge With Mid-Cap Innovators in AI, Privacy, and Cross-Chain Tech Finally, smart portfolio builders are adding a hedge by diversifying into mid-cap innovators, especially those working at the intersection of AI, privacy, and interoperability. These projects might not yet be household names, but they solve real problems and have the potential to outperform in niche market rallies. Just be sure to avoid overstretching. Keep MAGACOIN FINANCE as your high-conviction anchor and rotate smaller capital into these areas based on personal risk tolerance. Final Thoughts: Don’t Wait for the Headlines By the time most people hear about a token like MAGACOIN FINANCE, the breakout will already be underway. The second half of 2025 could belong to those who act on conviction, not headlines. From high-momentum altcoins to Layer-1 juggernauts and strategic RWA plays, now is the time to realign your portfolio with bold but smart bets. MAGACOIN FINANCE leads that charge confidently, and without compromise.

While established tokens like Cardano (ADA), Ethereum (ETH), Optimism (OP), and VeChain (VET) continue to attract headlines, the stealthy moves by large holders suggest a new wave of momentum is building for MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOINFINANCE: The Breakout Altcoin of the Season MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly outpacing competing tokens this quarter, earning recognition from analysts as one of 2025’s strongest pre-sale contenders. Its accelerating growth has positioned it as a top choice for ROI-driven investors. Notably, a single 72.95 ETH transaction, now the largest early-stage crypto buy of the year—has highlighted rising whale interest and institutional-scale confidence. Combined with its capped token supply, this momentum is driving exceptional demand and establishing MAGACOIN FINANCE as the breakout altcoin of the season. XRP: Volatility and Diversification XRP’s recent whale movements have sparked volatility, with over $60 million in tokens transferred to exchanges and long positions liquidated, raising concerns of a potential price downturn. Despite these jitters, some XRP whales are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE, betting on its early-stage upside as regulatory uncertainty lingers. Solana: Retail Growth and Strategic Accumulation Solana, meanwhile, is seeing record retail growth and a surge in whale wallets, with more than 11.6 million addresses holding at least 0.1 SOL. As the Solaxy ICO and ecosystem expansion drive optimism, SOL whales are strategically adding MAGACOINFINANCE to their portfolios, seeking high-multiple returns ahead of its public listing. ADA, ETH, OP, and VET: Market Outlook Cardano (ADA) is consolidating near $0.64–$0.72, with bullish momentum expected if key support holds. Ethereum (ETH) is targeting a return to the $2,800–$2,900 zone in June, buoyed by strong institutional flows. Optimism (OP) and VeChain (VET) are also forecasted for gains, but the spotlight is now on MAGACOIN FINANCE as the smart money’s top early-stage play. Final Thoughts With XRP and Solana whales leading the charge, MAGACOINFINANCE is quickly becoming the altcoin to watch in 2025. As ADA and ETH continue to show resilience, the growing accumulation of MAGACOIN FINANCE by major players highlights its potential as the next breakout star in the crypto market.

On-Chain Signals Say ‘Watch This Level’,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-bitcoin-gearing-up-for-a-breakout-on-chain-signals-say-watch-this-level/,"Bitcoin continues to trade below its recent all-time high as selling pressure and macroeconomic developments keep the asset in consolidation. At the time of writing, BTC is priced at $104,835, down 2.1% over the past week and around 6.3% off from its peak of $111,814 recorded last month. Despite the broader trend, on-chain data reveals emerging patterns that may signal what could come next in the market. Following the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged in its latest policy meeting, analysts have noted diverging trends in Bitcoin’s price and derivatives market activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Momentum Wobbles—Analyst Predicts Correction Below $94K Derivatives Deleveraging and Liquidation Clusters Shape Price Structure According to Amr Taha, a contributor on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, BTC has been hovering above the $104,000 support zone, where strong demand appears to be absorbing sell pressure. However, Taha pointed out that open interest on Binance has declined, forming lower lows, a sign that the derivatives market is undergoing progressive deleveraging. Taha’s analysis emphasized a technical divergence: while price has remained relatively stable around the $104,000 level, open interest has been falling. This divergence suggests that traders are reducing leveraged positions, possibly due to market uncertainty or as a response to the Fed’s cautious stance. Notably, the $104K region has emerged as a critical liquidity pocket, with data showing long positions being liquidated massively in this area. The dominance of long-side liquidations, with few short liquidations, reflects a flush-out of recent entrants attempting to ride the previous rally. The analyst argued that this deleveraging phase could pave the way for a price rebound if macro conditions remain favorable. Historically, Bitcoin has responded positively to rate pauses, often resuming upward movement when signs of seller exhaustion appear. The stabilization of open interest, combined with reduced liquidations, might act as a foundation for a new upward push in the near term. Bitcoin Whale Activity on Binance and Shifts in Market Behavior In a separate analysis, another CryptoQuant analyst, Oinonen, highlighted growing whale activity on Binance. Since 2023, the whale ratio metric on the exchange has surged dramatically, climbing from 0.08 in mid-2023 to as high as 0.77 in 2025. This shift marks a 400% increase and indicates significant accumulation behavior among large holders. Whale inflows and retention on Binance have generally coincided with longer-term confidence during periods of market volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Channel Break Below $105,000 Sparks Panic, Analysts Predict Further Crashes Moreover, the data shows that during recent episodes of elevated volatility, Binance users have leaned toward holding rather than exiting positions. Inflows to the platform have remained low, particularly from both whales and retail participants, suggesting that market participants are refraining from panic selling and instead are anticipating future price appreciation.

The move follows a key government-backed trial that confirmed it is technically feasible to verify users’ ages and integrate those checks into current digital platforms. However, some tech companies remain skeptical about the reliability of age-detection technologies. With the trial results now in, the legislation is on track to be implemented by the end of the year. Tony Allen raises concerns about protecting those under 16 from social media Following the social media ban, analysts have speculated that the findings could help clear a legal pathway for other jurisdictions to follow Australia’s example. This speculation has been raised in the era when nations around the world struggle to figure out how to shield children from harmful content online. The Age Assurance Technology Trial, which the government commissioned, highlighted that age verification can occur in Australia and be private, strong, and effective. Tony Allen, the project director of the trial, weighed in on the situation. Allen highlighted that no major technological obstacles prevent 16-year-olds from getting social media accounts. Therefore, based on his argument, these solutions are technically possible, can be easily added to current services, and can help protect children’s safety and rights online. The trial examined various approaches and technologies, such as facial scans, inferring a user’s age from his or her behavior, age verification, and parental controls. “We discovered many different methods that work for various situations, but we did not find one solution that would work for every case,” the trial stated. Australia considers imposing bans on social media for minors Australia considered banning social media for kids under 16 after a massive debate consumed the nation. The move sets a standard for other countries worldwide and is one of the most stringent regulations for big tech companies. According to polls, the ban was opposed by privacy campaigners and some child rights groups, but 77% of the population supported it. A parliamentary inquiry was held in 2024 to hear from parents whose children had self-harmed as a result of being bullied on social media. In the meantime, the domestic media campaigned for a ban led by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, the largest newspaper publisher in the country, under the banner “Let Them Be Kids.” This ban was, however, likely to test Australia’s delicate friendship with its most important ally, the United States. Apart from this, the ban had also raised conflict between Australia and some of the tech giants based in the US. Earlier, Australia forced social media platforms to pay news organizations for their content, and now it wants to fine those companies if they do not take down online scams. Elon Musk, the owner of X, commented on the situation. In a post, Musk said this seemed like a backdoor method to manage how all Australians access the internet.

While familiar names like XRP, Solana, Kaspa, and TRON still hold relevance, the spotlight is now swinging toward MAGACOINFINANCE — a fast-emerging altcoin redefining what early conviction looks like. MAGACOINFINANCE: The New Favorite Among Strategic Investors MAGACOINFINANCE is quickly becoming the go-to pick for traders stepping away from stagnant leaders and into high-conviction altcoins. This project isn’t just benefiting from hype — it’s building on real structural decisions that traders trust. With staking now live and a hard-capped supply of 170 billion tokens, the fundamentals are aligning with investor behavior. On-chain activity shows long-hold patterns, reduced churn, and a notable lack of post-entry sell pressure. Combine that with a smart contract audited by HashEx and no centralized control, and you get a token that stands out — not just for what it promises, but for what it’s already proving. For those looking to move early before listings expand visibility, MAGACOINFINANCE is ticking all the boxes. XRP Approaches Critical Regulatory Crossroads XRP is entering a pivotal phase. With the SEC litigation nearing resolution and a joint motion to release $125 million from escrow now on the table, optimism is building. Traders are cautiously hopeful that an end to regulatory uncertainty could drive institutional flows. However, with price action still volatile and split analyst sentiment, some investors are taking profits and exploring newer assets with fewer legal overhangs and a cleaner growth path. Solana (SOL) Holds Strong but Faces Rotation Pressure Solana continues to perform well on-chain, maintaining its position as one of the most active blockchain ecosystems. Its strong technical reputation and thriving developer base give it long-term staying power. But for traders seeking sharper ROI in the short term, SOL’s recent lack of explosive catalysts has prompted a shift toward assets with more immediate upside potential. Kaspa (KAS) Stays Quiet During Broader Repositioning Kaspa (KAS) has been quiet this cycle. Despite its solid infrastructure and consistent development, it hasn’t captured significant market attention in recent weeks. Without new narratives or major announcements to spark volume, traders are slowly redirecting funds toward newer opportunities that offer greater narrative momentum and more pronounced price movement. TRON (TRX) Maintains Stability, But Momentum Fades TRON is stable, functional, and widely used — particularly in the stablecoin space. But for many seasoned traders, its lack of excitement is starting to limit its appeal. TRX remains a useful layer for passive exposure, but in terms of active trading opportunities, it’s being overshadowed by more dynamic plays. Final Thoughts The real movement right now is happening around MAGACOINFINANCE . With seasoned traders already making the switch, the window for early positioning may not stay open for long.

In this edition, Molly, Head of HTX MO Centre, discussed pivotal themes: the legacy of the HTX brand, the platform’s robust performance, user trust-building initiatives, the roadmap for future brand development, and opportunities for women in Web3. She also offered a sneak peek at genuine user benefits planned for HTX’s 12th Anniversary. Molly emphasized that for HTX to become the top choice for both the industry and users, it must adopt a user-centric perspective, act with genuine sincerity, and build trust through steady, practical problem-solving. HTX’s Branding Strategy Q: As HTX promotes a “return to a user-centric perspective” for its 12th anniversary, what is its branding strategy in today’s competitive market? Molly: We don’t rely on nostalgia to capitalize on past glory. An emotional connection must be built on genuine sincerity. This year, our strategy centers on “sentiment + culture”. We’re rewarding long-term users to cultivate a stronger sense of companionship, while nurturing a dynamic and youthful crypto culture. For example, our slogan for May 20th (a Chinese internet-born Valentine’s Day), “You can share anything but your private key” , is designed to make crypto relatable and engaging, helping it reach a broader audience. Establishing a Unique User Moat Q: Amid the fierce competition in marketing and innovation, how will HTX establish a unique user moat? Are there any major marketing campaigns on the horizon? Molly: HTX doesn’t employ gimmicks and values genuine sincerity. We genuinely distribute rewards, and our rules are clearly written. From awarding HTX Affiliates to allocating 70% of rewards to regular users, and adopting the slogan “You have the talent, we have the resources” , HTX seeks to transform every sincere effort into lasting user trust. “Co-building” isn’t just a catchphrase — it means actively integrating user feedback into products and providing a platform for their voices. Restoring User Trust via “Trust Marketing” Q: Given ongoing regulatory shifts and declining trust in centralized platforms, how does HTX intend to restore user trust via “trust marketing”? What specific strategies will be used? Molly: Trust isn’t built with words; it’s earned bit by bit by solving real problems. HTX has its shortcomings, and we don’t shy away from them. We’re not afraid of users raising questions; what we fear is having no one there to respond. We’ll solve what we can immediately and report what we can’t with honesty. “Real Talk with HTX Executives” isn’t for show — it’s a commitment to transparency and making open dialogue the norm. The “Miss HTX” Program and Women in Web3 Q: Why is HTX continuing to develop the “Miss HTX” program? What are your views on opportunities for women in Web3, and what’s the story behind this year’s theme of “Discover Web3 Future Queen”? Molly: I’ve been part of the journey from the first to the third season, watching many women rise from being doubted to being valued. Gold shines, but not everyone has a stage. HTX is willing to build a platform where truly talented and insightful women can be seen and recognized. They are not just participants; they have found turning points in their lives on our platform. Women in Web3 should not be labeled but should become builders in this industry, using their wisdom and perspectives to make the crypto world more prosperous. Balancing Compliance and Innovation Q: How does HTX maintain a balance between compliance and innovation? Molly: This isn’t a matter of choosing one over the other, but rather developing multiple systems that work in tandem and improve constantly. In the long run, our value lies in identifying and offering users reliable, high-quality assets. At the end of 2023, Justin Sun proposed that HTX should evolve into a platform that attracts top-tier projects and helps users screen for truly investable assets. This initiative isn’t about hype, but about establishing a secure trading environment. HTX’s Biggest Challenges Approaching its 12th Anniversary Q: As HTX approaches its 12th anniversary, what is the biggest challenge it faces? Molly: Our focus is not on existing users within the crypto space but on how to best serve the next wave of newcomers, especially those coming from traditional finance and internet sectors. These users care more about long-term value and effective risk management. HTX isn’t just in a user-acquisition race; we’re working to define the framework for a safer, more mature market. A truly trustworthy exchange should take responsibility for managing risks and empower users to achieve sustainable growth.

The move marks a “major turning point,” said Michael Sonnenshein, COO at Securitize, as it provides another option for collateral provision, reported Forbes on June 18. BUIDL is BlackRock’s first Ethereum-based tokenized money market fund backed in part by US Treasuries. It enables these traditional financial products to be traded as cryptographic tokens on blockchains. BlackRock’s $2.9B tokenized Treasury fund $BUIDL is now live on Deribit, and accepted as yield-bearing collateral. Read more via @Forbes https://t.co/ldcFF98lLV — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) June 18, 2025 Keep on BUIDLing Crypto investors have traditionally faced a difficult choice when posting collateral on exchanges and lending platforms. They can use stablecoins that don’t generate big returns, or volatile crypto assets that risk amplifying losses during market downturns. There is now a third option that is both stable and yield-generating. BUIDL currently pays around 4.5% annually, which is better than most high street banks, and it also maintains stability. Additionally, exchanges can offer lower minimum collateral requirements since it’s less risky, and investors can earn yield on their collateral instead of leaving it idle while more capital is freed up for actual trading. “We’re really starting to see not just the emergence but a real solidification of tokenized securities becoming a challenger to stablecoins as the common denominator across the crypto ecosystem,” Sonnenshein said. “They’re now becoming what we would consider programmable productive capital, as opposed to just a passive investment instrument used for yield or a safe place to park capital.” BUIDL has grown to $2.9 billion in assets under management since launching in March 2024. Meanwhile, Crypto.com will offer it to institutional clients across all trading services, and Deribit, which was acquired by Coinbase, where it will soon be accepted, will accept it for futures and options trading. Deribit CEO Luuk Strijers said 80% to 85% of the firm’s business is institutional, “and we are getting more of these traditional firms that don’t necessarily hold a lot of crypto but hold a lot of dollars and don’t want to miss out on yield.” RWA Tokenization Outlook The tokenized real-world-asset sector currently has just shy of a record $24 billion tokenized onchain, according to RWA.xyz. It has seen more than 50% growth since the beginning of this year, and BUIDL has the largest asset market share with 12% of the total. Ethereum remains the industry standard for tokenized RWA with a network market share of almost 60%.

Frustrated XRP supporters are blaming the SEC for the delay. However, a legal expert has clarified some important details of the case. Who Is Behind the Delay? According to attorney Bill Morgan, it’s actually Ripple that is causing the delay. In a recent post, the expert explained that Ripple wants the court to remove the injunction on how it can sell XRP. Surprisingly, the SEC is cooperating and even helping with the process. Wrong. Ripple is the source of the delay. It wants the injunction dissolved. Rather than cause the delay the SEC is actually bending over backwards to help ripple have the injunction dissolved. Ripple and the SEC would have settled months ago but for Ripple wanting to dissolve… https://t.co/1YPRgxes0n — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 18, 2025 While many expected a quick settlement months ago, the case has been held up because Ripple is focused on getting those restrictions lifted first. One user asked Morgan if dissolving the injunction is necessary for Ripple to move forward. Morgan said, “Ripple needs it, not the XRP investors,” making it clear that the move primarily benefits Ripple’s ability to sell XRP to institutions. Another question was raised: Can the judge remove the injunction but still keep the fine? The attorney confirmed that the judge has the authority to do that. Judge’s Ruling To Arrive Sooner? The community is frustrated over the ongoing delays in the Ripple vs SEC case. The next update in the Ripple vs. SEC case is set for August 15, 2025. But former SEC official Marc Fagel said that date is not a deadline, and the case is not delayed until then. He explained that the judge could decide on the pending motion at any time, whether in a few hours, days, or even weeks. The SEC case is NOT delayed until August 15. The district court judge can rule on the motion pending before her in hours, days, or weeks (or months or years, for that matter, but it obviously won't come to that). — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) June 18, 2025 In an earlier tweet , Fagel also clarified that Judge Torres had already ruled against Ripple last year, issuing a $125M fine and a permanent injunction. The case continues only because both Ripple and the SEC appealed and are now seeking changes, which is something that is on them, and not the judge. According to Morgan, a decision could come sooner. Any further delay could trigger new appeals and slow down the settlement talks. Both parties have signed the deal, paused their appeals, and filed the necessary motions. Now, everything hinges on Judge Torres issuing a ruling. Once approved, Ripple will pay a $50M fine, the injunction will be lifted, and both appeals will be dropped.",Uncategorized|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-20 03:52:16

Here’s the range that could end up deciding the direction of the break. Dogecoin Is Nearing The End Of A Triangle Pattern In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how Dogecoin is currently looking from a technical analysis (TA) perspective. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 1-day price of DOGE. As displayed in the graph, the daily Dogecoin price has been trading inside what appears to be a triangular channel. A triangle is a TA pattern that forms whenever an asset’s price observes consolidation between two converging trendlines. Related Reading: Solana Plunges 13%: Can Key On-Chain Support Stop The Fall? The upper line of the pattern is likely to provide resistance to the price, while the lower one support. A break out of either of the lines can signal a continuation of trend in that direction. There are a few different types of triangles, with a few popular ones being the Symmetrical, Ascending, and Descending variations. The orientation of the trendlines decides the type of the triangle. In a Symmetrical Triangle, the lines converge at a roughly equal and opposite slope. This means that as the price travels inside the pattern, both upward and downward volatility shrinks in an even manner. For the Ascending and Descending versions, however, there is a bias to the upside or downside. In the former, the upper trendline is parallel to the time-axis and the price progressively makes higher lows. Similarly, the latter involves lower highs with a flat support level. From the chart, it’s apparent that the Triangle that Dogecoin has been moving inside for the past few months is similar to a Symmetrical Triangle, but it has a slight tilt toward the downside. It’s also visible that DOGE is nearing in on the end of the triangle. Generally, triangle breakouts become more likely to occur as the asset approaches the apex, as the consolidation range squeezes tight in this region. Related Reading: These Altcoins Are Bucking The Trend—But Can They Keep It Up? Considering that Dogecoin may be in this zone now, it’s possible that its spring may be ready to uncoil. Based on the pattern forming in the daily price, the analyst has noted that DOGE looks primed for a 60% move. As for which way a break would happen, that naturally comes down to which line the memecoin exits the triangle from. ” All you need to do is wait for a daily close outside of the $0.16 to $0.22 range to determine the direction of the trend,” notes Martinez. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.168, down more than 11% over the last seven days.

Pi Waits for Listing & NEAR Targets $3,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-x-series-miner-rollout-starts-july-7-pi-waits-for-listing-near-targets-3/,"Crypto users are always looking for the next breakout project with real use cases. Pi Network and Near Protocol continue gaining traction thanks to their focus on mobile mining and blockchain scalability. Yet, BlockDAG (BDAG) is attracting serious attention with its energy-efficient, low-barrier approach to mining. It is set to begin shipments of its X-Series miners from July 7 onwards. Instead of relying on expensive equipment, BlockDAG’s X-Series enables smoother participation in mining without the high expenses usually involved. Compared with Pi Network and Near Protocol, its forward steps highlight why many are looking at BlockDAG as a potential standout in 2025. Progress Update: BlockDAG X-Series Miner Delivery Starts July 7th BlockDAG is advancing fast as it prepares to roll out its X-Series miner units. The first 100 X30 and X100 models will be sent to select early testers starting July 7. These test units are meant to confirm their performance under real-use conditions before a broader release planned for October. This stage is crucial in bringing decentralized mining directly to users within the BlockDAG network. The shift from internal tests to live use marks a key turning point for BlockDAG, setting the foundation for wide-scale deployment. These miners are designed for energy-saving mining and eliminate the need for power-hungry setups, creating easier access to mining for more users. BlockDAG’s performance is also supported by major milestones. The crypto presale has already raised $312 million, with over 22.8 billion coins sold. The current batch price is $0.0276, yet a limited-time offer at $0.0018 remains active until June 20. Since batch 1, early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds. With 2 million users on the X1 app and the live deployment phase underway, BlockDAG is becoming one of the most sought-after assets heading into 2025. Pi Network Price Analysis: Signs of a Strong Price Jump Pi Network continues gaining followers due to its app-based mining method, allowing users to earn via smartphone without draining battery life or needing special hardware. This simple method has helped Pi Network grow a large user community, making it one of the most discussed digital currencies. In terms of Pi Network price analysis, its value is expected to climb sharply when the mainnet is fully live. As more users interact with the system, Pi’s supply will expand, pushing its market influence higher. With growing interest in the upcoming exchange listings, many experts expect a major surge in Pi Coin’s price. Excitement remains high, suggesting Pi may be heading toward a strong market run soon. Near Protocol Price Rally: Crucial Resistance Levels to Monitor Near Protocol is seeing fresh momentum, with its price uptick sparking interest. Latest indicators show that a 30% increase is within reach, supported by steady development and market positivity. Known for its low-cost and scalable blockchain structure, Near is carving a solid role in the app-building sector. The $2.00 support level has held firm, triggering a push toward the $2.35-$2.40 area, where resistance has recently been cleared. If the price holds above this range, the next key levels to watch are $2.80 to $3.00. Continued bullish movement could help Near stretch even higher. Final Say! As Pi Network and Near Protocol show potential for continued traction in 2025, BlockDAG is building serious momentum through its efficient mining setup. With the transition to live deployment already in motion and 20 exchange listings already revealed, BlockDAG is gearing up to begin the shipment of its mining equipment. Its focus on easy-access, eco-friendly mining gives it an edge over complex and costly setups. While other projects develop their ecosystems, BlockDAG’s real progress and wide reach are paving the way for a strong year ahead.

With Bitcoin (BTC) maintaining its dominance and altcoins like Optimism (OP), Arbitrum (ARB), Sei (SEI), and Litecoin (LTC) making headlines, attention is turning to rising stars with breakout potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as a contender, drawing interest from both seasoned traders and new entrants eager to catch the next wave of exponential growth. Premier Launch Status Secured by MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly establishing itself as a premier crypto launch for 2025, drawing strong interest from both retail and institutional investors.

The genomics and diagnostics firm listed on Nasdaq has invested $20m to acquire 187.42 BTC, becoming the first publicly traded healthcare company to do so, according to an announcement this week. This move sent the firm’s stock 23% higher. The Hong Kong-headquartered company is known for its DNA testing platform CircleDNA and its broader health sciences initiatives, but it is now making waves for reasons outside the clinic. Its Bitcoin holdings, secured via a Kraken custody account, mark the start of what Prenetics calls a long-term digital asset strategy. At an average purchase price of just over $106,000 per Bitcoin, the investment is a clear signal of conviction.

It plans to allocate the majority of its balance sheet to Bitcoin, with board approval already in place. According to CEO Danny Yeung, the company sees a future where genomics, longevity science and digital assets converge. “To execute this vision at scale, we need substantial Bitcoin holdings,” he said. The company has also brought in heavyweight crypto experience. Andy Cheung, former COO of exchange OKEx, is joining its board to provide direct oversight as Prenetics integrates digital assets into its operations. Cheung’s appointment strengthens the firm’s ability to navigate what remains a complex and volatile market. Prenetics Follows MicroStrategy’s Playbook, But Adds A Healthcare Twist Beyond buying and holding, Prenetics will actively manage its Bitcoin. The firm outlined plans for alpha-generating strategies that include lending, yield optimization and structured financial products. In parallel, it will begin accepting cryptocurrency payments across its direct-to-consumer health platforms, building what it calls a full-stack Bitcoin ecosystem. Prenetics raised its 2025 revenue forecast to as much as $100m and expects to turn profitable by the fourth quarter of next year. The Bitcoin strategy, the company says, reflects confidence in its business trajectory and its ability to manage risk. Its move comes as dozens of public companies add Bitcoin to their treasuries. Sixty-one firms not traditionally involved in crypto have adopted similar strategies , according to Standard Chartered. Many are attempting to follow in the footsteps of MicroStrategy , which began its Bitcoin accumulation in 2020 and has since seen its stock rise over 3,000%.

Recent data from CryptoQuant suggests a potential shift is underway, and it’s something every crypto investor should understand. Chief Analyst Julio Moreno has issued a warning, indicating that the robust Bitcoin demand seen recently may be starting to cool off. What’s Happening with Bitcoin Demand? According to the latest analysis shared by CryptoQuant’s lead, the pace of Bitcoin demand growth has slowed considerably. Following a period where interest surged, pushing the price towards significant levels, the momentum appears to be waning. While there was still an increase in spot demand over the last 30 days, adding roughly 118,000 BTC to holdings, this figure represents a significant drop from the peak observed just weeks earlier. On May 27th, the 30-day change in spot holdings hit a high of 228,000 BTC. The current number is less than half of that recent peak, signaling a noticeable deceleration in buying pressure. This slowdown in Bitcoin demand is a key metric for analysts trying to gauge market sentiment and potential future price movements. Sustained high demand typically supports upward price trajectories, while a decrease can signal weakening conviction or a shift in investor focus. Insights from CryptoQuant Analysis CryptoQuant is well-known for its deep dive into on-chain data, providing unique perspectives on market dynamics that go beyond simple price charts. Their CryptoQuant analysis relies on examining transactions and holdings directly on the blockchain, offering transparency into the behavior of different market participants, from retail investors to large institutions and long-term holders. The recent warning from CryptoQuant is based on several converging data points, all pointing towards a potential dip in aggressive accumulation. By tracking metrics like spot exchange reserves, wallet movements, and the activity of specific cohorts like whales and short-term holders, they can build a comprehensive picture of where demand is coming from and how it’s evolving. This granular level of detail is crucial for understanding the underlying health of the market and anticipating potential shifts. Are Bitcoin Whales Slowing Down? One of the critical indicators highlighted in the CryptoQuant analysis is the behavior of Bitcoin whales. These large holders, often defined as wallets holding significant amounts of BTC, have a considerable impact on market dynamics due to the sheer volume they control. Historically, periods of strong whale accumulation have often preceded significant price rallies. The data shows that the growth rate of Bitcoin whales holding has decreased. Over the past month, whale holdings grew by approximately 1.7%. While any growth is positive, this is a noticeable decline from the 3.9% month-over-month growth rate observed previously. This suggests that even the largest players in the market might be becoming more cautious or are simply less aggressively adding to their positions at current price levels. A slowdown in whale activity can reduce overall buying pressure and potentially make the market more susceptible to downward price movements if selling pressure increases. Impact of Slowing Bitcoin ETF Flow Another major factor influencing Bitcoin demand over the past year, particularly in the United States, has been the introduction and subsequent activity of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). These investment vehicles have opened up a new avenue for traditional finance participants to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. ETF inflows have been a significant source of demand, absorbing large amounts of BTC from the market. However, the CryptoQuant data indicates a slowdown in this area as well. Daily purchases by U.S. Bitcoin ETF vehicles have reportedly fallen. The average daily inflow has decreased from a peak of around 9,700 BTC to approximately 3,300 BTC. This represents a substantial reduction in institutional buying pressure entering the market through these regulated products. Given the scale of previous ETF inflows, this deceleration is a key contributor to the overall cooling trend in Bitcoin demand. Potential Bitcoin Price Analysis and Support Levels So, what does this cooling demand potentially mean for the Bitcoin price? According to the CryptoQuant analysis, weakened demand could lead to price corrections. The analyst points to key on-chain support levels based on the ‘realized price’ of different cohorts of holders. The realized price represents the average cost basis of all Bitcoin currently held, calculated by valuing each UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) at the price it last moved on the blockchain. Based on this on-chain data, a significant support level could form around the $92,000 mark. This level likely corresponds to the aggregate cost basis of a large portion of recent buyers. If demand continues to weaken and this $92,000 level fails to hold, the analysis suggests the price could potentially dip further, with the next significant support identified around $81,000 . Understanding these potential support zones, derived from on-chain metrics rather than just technical chart patterns, can provide valuable context for investors evaluating risk and potential entry/exit points. Key Takeaways from the Analysis: Spot Bitcoin demand growth has slowed significantly from its recent peak. Bitcoin whales are accumulating at a slower rate. U.S. Bitcoin ETF inflows have decreased substantially. Weakening demand could lead to price testing key on-chain support levels. Potential support levels are identified around $92,000 and $81,000. What Does This Mean for Investors? While this analysis flags potential headwinds, it’s important not to panic. Market cycles involve periods of both strong demand and consolidation or correction. This data provides valuable insight into the current state of buying pressure. Challenges: The primary challenge is the increased risk of price volatility and potential downside if demand continues to fall and selling pressure mounts. The failure of key support levels could lead to further price drops. Actionable Insights: Investors can use this information to re-evaluate their risk exposure. Understanding potential support levels ($92k, $81k) can help inform decisions about setting stop-losses or identifying potential buying opportunities if those levels are tested and hold. It also reinforces the importance of looking beyond just price action and considering underlying market structure and participant behavior as revealed by on-chain data. Summary: Navigating the Cooling Market The latest CryptoQuant analysis serves as a timely warning for the Bitcoin market. While demand hasn’t disappeared entirely, the data clearly indicates a slowdown in the aggressive buying that characterized the market leading up to recent highs. Decreases in spot demand growth, slower whale accumulation, and reduced Bitcoin ETF inflows are all contributing factors to this cooling trend. Investors should pay close attention to how the market reacts around the potential support levels of $92,000 and $81,000, as identified by on-chain metrics. Staying informed with data-driven analysis like that provided by CryptoQuant is essential for navigating the potential volatility ahead.

Here’s Why These Coins Deserve Your Attention",https://thecoinrise.com/4-top-altcoins-to-watch-in-2025-blockdag-toncoin-stellar-avalanche-heres-why-these-coins-deserve-your-attention/,"The crypto space is always moving fast. In 2025, a few big names are reaching key stages that could lead to exciting new growth. Many people wonder which top altcoins are worth watching right now. It can be hard to keep up when so much is changing. But here’s some good news: a handful of projects are making clear progress, and that can help guide your choices. In this article, we’ll look at four names that are standing out: BlockDAG, Toncoin, Stellar, and Avalanche. From new tools to growing networks, these projects are giving strong signals. Read on to see what makes them worth following this year. 1. BlockDAG: $312M Raised & X Series Miners Set to be Shipped Soon If you’re looking at which projects are making steady progress, BlockDAG (BDAG) is hard to miss. The project is set to start shipping its X10 miners by August 15. These devices are small, energy-efficient, and easy to use, perfect for those new to mining. You won’t need complex or costly setups to get started. The X10 miners support BlockDAG’s wider goal: making mining simple and open to more people. The X30 and X100 models are built for larger setups, but the X10 lets anyone join with ease. Right now, BlockDAG has raised $312 million in its presale. It is in Batch 29, with a coin price of $0.0276. Those who joined in Batch 1 have already seen gains of 2,660%. So far, 22.8 billion coins have been sold. For a short time, the frozen price of $0.0018 will end in just 2 days. With the mainnet on the way and miners soon to ship, BlockDAG remains one of the top altcoins to watch this year. 2. Toncoin: Fast Growth Through Telegram’s Reach Toncoin is quickly gaining ground, thanks to its deep link with the Telegram app. Users can easily send small payments or tips inside Telegram chats. Since Telegram has a massive user base across many countries, this gives Toncoin real-world value. While Toncoin’s price has seen ups and downs, many in the crypto world see these price dips as good entry points. Often, the top altcoins are the ones seeing real use and growing interest. Toncoin fits this pattern well. As messaging apps and financial tools continue to blend, Toncoin’s role in these spaces could bring fresh momentum. This is why many are keeping it on their watchlist for 2025. 3. Stellar: Speed and Real-World Uses in Digital Currency Stellar (XLM) continues to focus on real-world solutions, such as cross-border money transfers, digital assets, and central bank digital currency projects. Its network is built for speed and low fees, which is why many public and private projects still choose it. In 2025, new pilot programs with large financial firms have brought fresh attention to Stellar. With prices still well below past peaks, many see this as a great chance to get in early. Among the top altcoins in this space, Stellar stands out for its clear purpose and active use cases. Anyone following blockchain’s role in everyday finance should be keeping an eye on XLM this year. 4. Avalanche: Growing Through Subnets and New Use Cases Avalanche (AVAX) is moving ahead strongly with its “subnet” system. This allows apps and businesses to build their own custom blockchains, making the network faster and more flexible. Lower costs and faster speeds are attracting both small teams and big companies. In 2025, new subnets are launching, and Avalanche is seeing more use in gaming and business tools. Recent price dips have also created new chances for people to join in. AVAX continues to rank among the top altcoins because of its focus on real utility and constant growth. As more builders and users come on board, Avalanche is set to stay a key player in the crypto world. Summing Up! Choosing the right coins today means more than just following the hype. What really matters are useful products, good timing, and strong communities. BlockDAG’s X10 miners make mining easy for more people. Plus, the project’s presale numbers and upcoming launch present strong signs. Toncoin and Stellar are delivering real value through payments and transfers. Avalanche keeps growing by helping others build and scale. For anyone looking at top altcoins in 2025, these projects deserve attention. When tools work well, timing is right, and communities grow, the signs are clear: this could be the moment to act. The post 4 Top Altcoins to Watch in 2025: BlockDAG, Toncoin, Stellar, Avalanche!

For the uninitiated, the inverse head & shoulders is a bullish chart pattern that signals a potential reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend. It consists of three troughs, a lower low – called the “head” – between two higher lows – called the “shoulders.” This is followed by a breakout above the “neckline” resistance, indicating rising buying pressure.

For example, noted analyst Jelle pointed out that BTC has formed a major bullish pennant above previous highs – another positive technical signal. BTC is also poised to benefit from shrinking supply on trading platforms. In an X post shared earlier today, crypto commentator Master of Crypto noted that Bitcoin balances on exchanges are about to fall below two million – the lowest level since 2017. Depleting BTC balances on exchanges suggest that investors are moving their Bitcoin to long-term storage, reducing the amount available for immediate sale. This supply constraint can create upward pressure on price, especially if demand continues to rise. Meanwhile, another Bitcoin analyst, apsk32, highlighted BTC’s ongoing alignment with the power curve cycle. Remarkably, Bitcoin has followed this cycle consistently for 15 years, and if the trend holds, the next cycle top could occur in November or December 2025. BTC Quantity More Important Than Price In a separate X post, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki emphasized that the number of BTC one holds is more important than its current price. In a detailed thread, he predicted that Bitcoin could reach as high as $1 million by 2030. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Warning: Short-Term Holder Selling Accelerates Amid Price Correction While a $1 million price target may seem ambitious, other analysts also forecast new highs in the near term. For example, CryptoQuant analyst Carmelo Aleman recently projected that BTC could top out at $205,000 by the end of 2025. In addition, exchange data suggests an impending supply crunch, as whales continue withdrawing large amounts of BTC while exchange inflows remain subdued. At press time, BTC is trading at $104,359, down 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

The proposal, released during the London Policy Summit, signals a growing urgency within the industry to see the UK regulations take a leading role in shaping the future of global finance. Ripple has long been working with regulators, unlike many crypto firms just starting. It has actively collaborated with policymakers in regions like Singapore, Dubai, and the EU, where clear crypto rules already exist. At Ripple’s UK Policy Summit earlier this year, one message was clear: the time to act is now: https://t.co/7VDmJ3eVDa Recommendations for UK policymakers: Build a growth-driven framework Lead on global standards Advance stablecoin adoption Tackle tokenization… — Ripple (@Ripple) June 18, 2025 Policy Momentum Builds Ripple $XRP has released a report on how the UK can better adopt and integrate crypto assets:""opportunity for the UK is huge.""""enhance financial inclusion and solidify the UK’s position as a competitive global financial centre."" pic.twitter.com/XQPjVHGW5b — ALLINCRYPTO (@RealAllinCrypto) June 19, 2025 The summit, hosted by Ripple alongside the UK Centre for Blockchain Technology and Innovate Finance, brought together officials and industry figures to assess the UK’s progress on crypto policy. The conversation followed a string of recent moves by the UK government, including draft legislation from HM Treasury and consultations from the Financial Conduct Authority on key issues like stablecoins, custody, and prudential standards. Even though the UK wants to ace the crypto space, they need strong crypto rules at first, and Ripple is all set to help them with their innovative plan. Singapore and Dubai are true examples of laying crypto-friendly rules without being too lenient and over-protective. Moreover, talking about the EU’s MiCA regulations , it offers a strong blueprint for managing the fast-paced crypto sector. Ripple, familiar with such systems, is now helping the UK build its framework without having to start from zero. There has also been early experimentation with blockchain-based infrastructure. A digital bond pilot backed by the UK government, DIGIT, has launched, and new players have joined the Financial Conduct Authority’s Digital Securities Sandbox, signaling growing institutional interest in tokenized assets. Ripple’s Four Priorities Ripple’s paper calls for the swift finalization of the UK’s crypto regulatory framework. The firm argues that clarity is key to attracting serious investment and ensuring the UK doesn’t fall behind in the race to shape digital markets. Next, Ripple suggests aligning domestic rules with international standards to avoid overlapping requirements for global firms. It also advocates for expedited progress on stablecoin regulation , including provisions that would allow non-UK-issued stablecoins to be used locally without additional barriers. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Tax in Australia May End : Here’s Why , Finally, Ripple is pressing for broader structural reform to remove tax and legal obstacles to tokenization, a technology it believes will play a central role in modernizing financial markets. A Chance to Lead While the report stops short of specific timelines, the tone suggests the window of opportunity is closing. Ripple believes the UK has a chance to establish itself as a global leader if it acts quickly and decisively. With more than 90% of financial institutions expected to be engaged with crypto assets by the end of this year, the firm says getting the rules right now could define the UK’s role in the next chapter of financial innovation. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The team will distribute 5% of its total $MGO supply to early users, testnet participants, and community contributors. The eligibility checker is now live, where users can connect their wallets and complete a three-step process to confirm and eventually claim their rewards. Distribution begins on June 24, with tokens issued in the order of claim. To begin, users must “bind” their Twitter accounts, which involves linking their Twitter profile to Mango’s platform to verify their identity and activity. They must also follow BeingDEX, Mango’s ecosystem partner. Mango Network TGE and Airdrop is coming. Check your eligibility for $MGO now! Thank you for being with us every step of the way. You helped build this, and now it’s time to witness the rewards. Note: Claiming will open after TGE. Please be aware of scams. — Mango Network (@MangoOS_Network) June 20, 2025 Airdrop Claiming Starts June 24, With Eligibility Based On Weighted Points After linking their profile, users can proceed to verify their airdrop share. A countdown timer on the site marks the time left to confirm eligibility. Then, users can view and confirm their airdrop share. Once confirmed, the final step will allow users to claim their rewards when the claim window opens at 17:50 UTC on June 24. Unlike typical airdrops based solely on point totals, Mango uses a weighted system. Token allocation will reflect not just the number of points a user has, but also the quality of their testnet participation and any community roles they held, such as OG status. All Tokens To Be Unlocked At Claim, With Caution Urged Against Fraud All tokens will be fully unlocked at the time of distribution. However, the team has urged users to remain cautious of scams. They said that only official Mango channels should be trusted for claiming instructions. Meanwhile, Mango Network has positioned itself as a next-generation blockchain. It aims to solve two of Web3’s toughest problems — fragmented liquidity and poor user experience. To do this, the project uses a multi-VM, full-chain infrastructure. This design promises a smoother experience for both developers and users. Now, with the airdrop underway, Mango is rewarding those who helped build its foundation. At the same time, it offers a glimpse into what the future of its ecosystem could look like.

Recent global events, from geopolitical conflicts to shifts in monetary policy, have tested various markets. Yet, amidst this uncertainty, a striking narrative is emerging: Bitcoin resilience . What Makes Bitcoin Show Such Incredible Resilience? Elliot Johnson, CEO of the Bitcoin Treasury Corporation, recently highlighted Bitcoin’s remarkable ability to withstand significant external pressures. Speaking to BeInCrypto, Johnson noted that despite the heightened tensions from the Israel-Iran conflict and the Federal Reserve’s seemingly hawkish stance on interest rates, Bitcoin has remained “incredibly resilient.” This observation isn’t just anecdotal; it points to fundamental characteristics of the cryptocurrency that allow it to weather storms that might significantly impact traditional assets. Several core factors contribute to Bitcoin’s resilience: Decentralization: Unlike traditional currencies or company stocks, Bitcoin is not controlled by any single government, central bank, or corporation. Its distributed ledger technology means no single point of failure exists, making it immune to direct political manipulation or corporate collapse. Scarcity: With a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, Bitcoin’s inherent scarcity provides a strong store-of-value narrative, often compared to digital gold. This limited supply contrasts sharply with fiat currencies, which can be printed indefinitely, potentially leading to inflation. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin operates 24/7 on a global network. It is accessible to anyone with an internet connection, transcending national borders and traditional banking hours. This makes it a potential safe haven asset for individuals in regions experiencing economic instability or capital controls. Maturing Infrastructure: The Bitcoin ecosystem has evolved significantly. Robust exchanges, secure wallets, and increasing regulatory clarity in many jurisdictions provide a more stable environment for investors compared to its earlier days. Institutional interest has also grown, bringing more sophisticated capital into the market. Protocol Security: The Bitcoin network is secured by a vast amount of computational power through mining, making it extremely difficult and prohibitively expensive for any single entity to compromise the network’s integrity. These factors combine to create an asset class that behaves differently from traditional equities, bonds, or commodities, particularly during times of geopolitical or economic stress. Understanding these underlying strengths is crucial for any comprehensive crypto market analysis . How Do Macro Factors Influence Bitcoin Price Prediction? The interplay between macroeconomic forces and Bitcoin’s price has been a subject of intense debate. Traditionally, assets like Bitcoin were seen as uncorrelated or even negatively correlated with traditional markets. However, as institutional adoption has grown and Bitcoin has become more integrated into the global financial system, its correlation with risk assets, particularly tech stocks, has increased at times. Let’s consider the two macro factors highlighted: 1. Geopolitical Conflict (e.g., Israel-Iran): Geopolitical tensions often lead to market uncertainty. Historically, assets perceived as safe havens, like gold or certain government bonds, might see inflows. Bitcoin’s reaction to such events has been mixed. Sometimes it acts as a risk-on asset, selling off alongside stocks during fear. Other times, its ‘digital gold’ narrative comes to the forefront, attracting investors seeking an alternative store of value outside traditional systems. Johnson’s observation suggests that in the recent conflict, Bitcoin leaned more towards demonstrating resilience rather than succumbing to panic selling, perhaps indicating a growing confidence in its role as a non-sovereign asset. 2. Federal Reserve Monetary Policy: The Fed’s stance on interest rates and quantitative easing significantly impacts liquidity and investor sentiment globally. A hawkish Fed, implying higher rates and tighter liquidity, generally makes riskier assets less attractive as borrowing costs rise and safer investments (like bonds) offer better returns. Cryptocurrencies, often viewed as high-beta risk assets, have historically been sensitive to Fed policy. However, Bitcoin’s ability to remain resilient despite the current hawkish signals could suggest that its price action is increasingly being driven by factors beyond just liquidity, such as fundamental adoption, long-term holding conviction, or specific market structure dynamics. Analyzing these macro factors crypto correlation is complex and constantly evolving. Bitcoin’s narrative shifts between being a speculative tech asset and a long-term store of value, influencing how it reacts to different external stimuli.

Elliot Johnson’s assertion that it will be difficult for the “psychological support level of $100,000 to collapse” is a bold statement, especially considering Bitcoin has not yet reached that price point. However, it speaks to the significance of price levels in market psychology and the potential for strong support once a new milestone is achieved or even widely anticipated. What does a “psychological support level” mean? It refers to a price point that market participants collectively believe is significant, often due to round numbers or previous historical importance. When a price approaches such a level, buying interest tends to increase as investors see it as a potential floor or a key level to defend. While $100,000 is currently a future target, the idea of it becoming a strong support level implies several underlying assumptions: Strong Upward Momentum: Reaching $100,000 in the first place requires significant buying pressure and positive sentiment. Investor Conviction: For $100k to act as support, a large number of holders must be unwilling to sell below this price once it’s reached, viewing it as a fair value or a level worth defending. Institutional Buy-in: Increased institutional adoption and large capital flows into Bitcoin could provide the necessary demand to establish and hold higher price floors. Reduced Volatility at Higher Levels: Some argue that as Bitcoin’s market cap grows, its price volatility might decrease, potentially making it easier to maintain key support levels. Predicting exact price levels is notoriously difficult in any market, let alone one as dynamic as Bitcoin. However, the concept of $100k becoming a strong support level is tied to the broader bullish case for Bitcoin’s long-term adoption and value proposition. It suggests confidence not just in reaching that price, but in the market’s ability to consolidate and build a new foundation at significantly higher valuations than seen previously. Challenges and Opportunities for Bitcoin Despite its demonstrated resilience and bullish long-term outlooks like the potential for $100k support, Bitcoin faces ongoing challenges: Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: While progress is being made, regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies vary widely across jurisdictions and can change rapidly, posing risks. Market Volatility: Despite periods of resilience, Bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset, subject to rapid price swings that can deter risk-averse investors. Competition: While Bitcoin is the dominant cryptocurrency, the broader digital asset space is constantly evolving with new technologies and competitors. External Shocks: While resilient, extreme macro events or black swan incidents could still trigger significant downturns. Opportunities: Increasing Institutional Adoption: More companies, asset managers, and even potentially sovereign wealth funds adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets or portfolios could provide sustained buying pressure. Technological Advancements: Ongoing development on the Bitcoin network (e.g., Lightning Network) can improve scalability and usability. Growing Global Awareness: As more people understand Bitcoin’s principles and potential, adoption could increase organically. Macroeconomic Headwinds for Fiat: Continued concerns about inflation, currency devaluation, or economic instability in traditional systems could drive more people towards alternative stores of value like Bitcoin. Navigating these challenges and capitalizing on opportunities is key for investors analyzing the potential trajectory of Bitcoin’s price. Actionable Insights for Investors Given Bitcoin’s resilience and the ongoing market dynamics, what should investors consider? Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s history is marked by significant volatility. A long-term perspective, often referred to as “HODLing” (holding on for dear life), has historically been a successful strategy for many investors. Focus on the fundamental adoption trends rather than short-term price swings. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Given the volatility, regularly investing a fixed amount of money into Bitcoin, regardless of its price, can help reduce the risk of buying at a market peak and average out the purchase price over time. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Bitcoin is a high-risk, high-reward asset. Allocate a portion of your portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance. Stay Informed: Keep track of major macroeconomic indicators, regulatory news, and developments within the Bitcoin ecosystem. However, be wary of hype and sensationalism. Focus on credible sources for your crypto market analysis . Understand the $100k Narrative: While $100k is a significant psychological target and potential future support, treat it as a possibility based on bullish factors, not a guarantee. Understand the drivers that could lead to such levels (adoption, macro environment) and the risks that could prevent it. These insights are not financial advice but offer a framework for approaching Bitcoin investment in light of its unique characteristics and the external forces influencing it. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Enduring Strength Elliot Johnson’s comments underscore a crucial aspect of Bitcoin’s identity: its remarkable ability to absorb shocks from the global stage. The confluence of geopolitical uncertainty and shifting monetary policy creates a complex backdrop, yet Bitcoin continues to demonstrate resilience. This isn’t accidental; it’s a function of its decentralized nature, finite supply, and growing global acceptance. While the path to price targets like $100,000 is never linear and faces its own set of challenges, the underlying strengths that enable Bitcoin’s resilience suggest that such milestones are not merely speculative fantasy but potential outcomes driven by fundamental shifts in how the world perceives and utilizes digital assets. As the market matures and faces new tests, Bitcoin’s enduring strength remains a key factor for investors and analysts to watch.

Starting July 1, the platform will remove support for the ZKsync Era network from its aggregation feature. This decision marks a strategic move aimed at optimizing the platform’s performance and better aligning with current user needs and market dynamics. For anyone navigating the complexities of multi-chain DeFi, understanding these platform changes is crucial. What’s Happening with KyberSwap and ZKsync Era? The core of the announcement is straightforward: Kyber Network is ceasing the aggregation of liquidity sources on the ZKsync Era network within its DeFi aggregator service. This means that when users utilize KyberSwap’s aggregator to find the best trading routes and prices across various decentralized exchanges (DEXs), it will no longer include DEXs operating specifically on ZKsync Era in its search results. Here are the key details of the change: Effective Date: July 1 Affected Feature: KyberSwap Aggregator (finding best trade prices across DEXs) Unaffected Feature: KyberSwap’s cross-chain bridge functionality Reason Cited: To enhance platform efficiency and align with user demand This adjustment is part of the ongoing evolution of DeFi platforms, which must constantly adapt to the rapidly changing blockchain landscape and user activity patterns. While ZKsync Era has gained traction, KyberSwap’s data suggests that its integration within the aggregator was not meeting the desired efficiency or user interaction benchmarks compared to other supported chains. Why is KyberSwap Making This Change? According to Kyber Network, the primary drivers behind this decision are platform efficiency and user demand. Aggregating liquidity across multiple blockchains and numerous DEXs is a technically complex process that requires significant resources. By removing chains that may have lower user engagement on the aggregator or present integration challenges that impact overall performance, KyberSwap can potentially: Improve the speed and reliability of trade aggregation on the remaining chains. Allocate development resources more effectively to enhance features on more actively used networks. Streamline the user experience by focusing on the most popular and efficient trading paths. This strategic pivot allows KyberSwap to double down on optimizing the experience for the majority of its users, ensuring that the core aggregation service remains robust and competitive in the crowded DeFi market. It highlights the operational challenges faced by multi-chain platforms in maintaining seamless integration with every emerging Blockchain network. What Does This Mean for KyberSwap Users? For users who primarily trade on chains other than ZKsync Era using the KyberSwap aggregator, this change is likely to have minimal to no negative impact. In fact, they might experience a slight improvement in performance if the removal enhances overall system efficiency. However, users who frequently relied on KyberSwap’s aggregator to find the best swaps on ZKsync Era will need to find alternative methods or platforms for those specific trades after July 1. This might involve using native DEXs on ZKsync Era or other aggregators that continue to support the network. It’s crucial for users to understand the scope of this change: it only affects the DeFi aggregator . KyberSwap offers multiple services, and the delisting is specific to one of them. Users should verify which feature they utilize before making assumptions about their access to ZKsync Era via KyberSwap. Which Blockchains Remain Supported? Despite the removal of ZKsync Era from the aggregator, KyberSwap maintains support for a robust list of other major blockchains. This ensures that users still have access to a wide array of trading opportunities across popular networks. The platform will continue to aggregate liquidity on approximately 15 different chains. Key supported chains include: Ethereum Base Arbitrum Optimism Polygon BNB Chain Avalanche Fantom Cronos Polygon zkEVM Linea Scroll ImmutableX zkSync Lite (Note: This is different from ZKsync Era) And others… This extensive list demonstrates KyberSwap’s continued commitment to being a multi-chain platform, focusing its aggregation efforts on networks with significant liquidity and user activity. Beyond Aggregation: KyberSwap’s Continued Support for ZKsync Era An important point highlighted in the announcement is that the delisting is *only* from the aggregator service. KyberSwap’s cross-chain feature, which allows users to move assets between different blockchains, will continue to support ZKsync Era . This means users can still use KyberSwap to bridge assets to and from the ZKsync Era network. This distinction is vital for users who rely on KyberSwap for bridging rather than just finding the best swap price on a single chain. The continued cross-chain support indicates that KyberSwap still sees value in enabling connectivity to ZKsync Era, even if its aggregation performance didn’t meet internal thresholds. Navigating the Ever-Changing Crypto News Landscape This move by KyberSwap is a reminder of the dynamic nature of the Crypto News cycle and the DeFi space. Platforms are constantly evaluating their integrations and strategies based on technical performance, user behavior, and the evolving market. For users and participants in the ecosystem, staying informed about these changes is key to navigating DeFi effectively. Understanding why a platform makes such a decision—be it for efficiency, security, or strategic focus—provides valuable insight into the operational realities of building and maintaining complex multi-chain protocols like a DeFi aggregator . It underscores the fact that support for a blockchain isn’t static and can change based on various factors. Conclusion: Adapting to KyberSwap’s Aggregator Update KyberSwap’s decision to delist ZKsync Era from its aggregator on July 1 is a strategic step aimed at enhancing the platform’s efficiency and optimizing the user experience on its core supported chains. While it means users will need to find alternative methods for finding best swap prices specifically on ZKsync Era via KyberSwap, the platform continues to offer robust aggregation services across 15 other major networks and maintains cross-chain support for ZKsync Era. This development is a pertinent piece of Crypto News that highlights the ongoing evolution and adaptation within the DeFi ecosystem, emphasizing the importance of platform efficiency and targeted user demand in shaping service offerings.

According to QCP, on the macroeconomic front, the FED kept interest rates steady in line with expectations. However, the policy committee maintained its hawkish stance, stating that short-term inflation expectations remain high. The statement stated that customs duties stand out as a significant upward risk. Authorities reiterated that they will continue with a “wait-and-see” strategy until the course of inflation becomes clearer. On the other hand, markets no longer react as sensitively to geopolitical developments, especially the Israel-Iran tensions, as they used to. Related News: Big Bull Anthony Scaramucci Drops a Bold Prediction: “I Think It Will Surpass Ethereum” However, QCP states that the risk of a trade war is starting to come back to the agenda. The expiration of the European Union’s tariff suspension period against the US on July 9 stands out as a significant turning point in this regard. The US has only been able to reach an agreement with one of its more than 195 potential trading partners. While negotiations have reached a deadlock, the market’s lack of reaction to the leaked news and gradual tariff steps is striking. QCP Capital listed the upcoming critical dates as follows: July 14: EU expected to begin imposing retaliatory tariffs on US August 12: China-US 90-day tariff truce ends August 31: Long-term tariff exemptions for Chinese imports expire These dates could trigger periodic pullbacks in risk assets. Still, QCP says its baseline scenario is optimistic: Given the overlapping interests between China and the US, negotiations are more likely to reach a stable conclusion, which could support a rally in risk assets. Finally, it is stated that the hedging trend in the markets continues and short-term correction expectations are maintained. *This is not investment advice.

The announcement, published in a June 19 blog post, positions Kraken alongside a growing wave of institutions leveraging Babylon’s staking infrastructure. Kraken customers can now use Babylon’s protocol to assign their Bitcoin ( BTC ) to proof-of-stake blockchains while still keeping complete ownership of their assets. Kraken’s strategy avoids the trade-offs associated with traditional staking solutions, which often require wrapping or bridging Bitcoin to other networks. The underlying Bitcoin is never lent out or rehypothecated. Instead, it stays on the Bitcoin blockchain. Through Babylon’s smart contract-based delegation mechanism, staked assets help to secure PoS networks. In return, users receive rewards in BABY, Babylon’s native token. The service features a seven-day unbonding period, transparent reward tracking, and cryptographic penalties for bad actors. You might also like: Kraken launches Kraken Prime, a brokerage service for institutional crypto clients Kraken’s global head of consumer, Mark Greenberg, described the launch as an opportunity to put idle BTC to productive use. “A substantial amount of Bitcoin currently sits idle on our exchange,” he said. “Clients can now earn a return while strengthening the infrastructure of emerging PoS blockchains.” Kraken joins other platforms like Binance and BitGo that have embraced Babylon’s infrastructure to offer native Bitcoin yield opportunities. Over 57,000 BTC, worth over $5.6 billion, have already been staked on Babylon’s Genesis mainnet since it launched in April 2025, demonstrating growing institutional interest in Bitcoin-native decentralized finance protocols. Until now, less than 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply is involved in DeFi, primarily due to the technical complexity and security risks of bridging BTC to other chains. By enabling trustless delegation from Bitcoin to PoS networks, Babylon’s approach reduces those frictions while extending BTC’s utility in the broader crypto ecosystem. Kraken’s new staking service is now live across all interfaces, including Kraken Pro. Staking yields up to 1% APR, with weekly BABY rewards, though rates may vary. The company noted that staking involves risk and is subject to regional restrictions. BABY token prices climbed nearly 5% decentralized finance Kraken’s announcement but has since cooled.

The update was first spotted by a Cardano-focused X page on June 19, which shared a screenshot showing Cardano ( ADA ) live in the wallet interface. This follows an official announcement from May, when Input Output, Cardano’s core development firm, and Brave Software confirmed plans to integrate full Cardano support into Brave’s browser-native crypto wallet. https://twitter.com/stakewithpride/status/1935719586202276249?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw The integration allows users to send, receive, swap, and sign transactions using Cardano assets within the privacy-focused browser. It also lets Cardano owners manage tokens like Midnight’s NIGHT, engage with decentralized apps, and participate in governance. Despite the update, which is expected to improve Cardano’s exposure massively, price action has yet to reflect a strong response. At press time, Cardano is trading at $0.6002, down 0.5% on the day and near the lower end of its 7-day range between $0.5913 and $0.6556.

Looking at the technical picture, ADA is still declining in a clearly defined downtrend, trading near its lowest level since mid-April. The price is below all significant moving averages, ranging from the 10-day to the 200-day, indicating strong bearish momentum. Cardano price analysis. Credit: crypto.news The Bollinger Bands have been narrowing, with the lower band around $0.5899 acting as nearby support. ADA is hugging this lower band, which is usually an indication that selling pressure is present. Momentum indicators, on the other hand, show a neutral to bearish picture. With a value of 32.8, the relative strength index is getting close to oversold territory but hasn’t displayed any reversal signals yet. The moving average convergence divergence is still in negative territory, while the stochastic RSI shows that ADA is deeply oversold but lacks a definite bullish divergence. Although there may be a short-term rebound indicated by the Commodity Channel Index at -124, the general trend direction is still downward. A bullish RSI crossover and fresh volume may support a sustained move above $0.63. ADA could move toward the $0.70 resistance zone if it breaks above the 20-day estimated moving average close to $0.65. Conversely, a continuation of low volume and rejection at the 10-day EMA around $0.6265 would validate the current downward trend. A deeper decline toward $0.55 might be possible if the price fails to stay above the $0.59 support.

Bitget has secured a license to operate in Georgia’s Tbilisi Free Zone, enabling it to offer spot, futures, and copy trading within a locally regulated environment. At the same time, the company has launched QR-based stablecoin payments in Vietnam, broadening crypto’s real-world utility. Meanwhile, OKX has partnered with Consensys to integrate its DEX aggregator and MEV protection tool SERVO into MetaMask, enhancing decentralized trading speed, liquidity access, and user safety. OKX and Consensys Partner to Bring High-Speed DEX Aggregator to MetaMask Global crypto exchange OKX has partnered with Ethereum software powerhouse Consensys to integrate its DEX aggregator directly into MetaMask, which is one of the most widely used wallets in the Web3 ecosystem. The integration is designed to deliver faster trade execution and reduced slippage across a multichain landscape, marking a significant advancement in decentralized trading accessibility and performance. According to a press release, the collaboration links OKX’s advanced decentralized exchange (DEX) API with MetaMask, unlocking access to liquidity from over 500 DEXs across 25 blockchains. By embedding OKX’s aggregator into MetaMask’s swap feature, the companies aim to enhance trade efficiency and asset discoverability for millions of users navigating the increasingly fragmented DeFi space. Swapping tokens using OKX DEX aggregator (Source: OKX) “MetaMask’s ambitious multichain strategy toward becoming a universal wallet for the Web3 ecosystem aligns with the connected blockchain ecosystem we’re helping to build,” said Jeff Ren, founder of OKX Ventures. “We share a vision of a more accessible blockchain ecosystem where technical barriers disappear.” Ren added that the OKX DEX aggregator connects MetaMask users to a vast network of liquidity sources, executing trades in under 100 milliseconds — a speed that rivals centralized exchanges (CEXs) and represents a milestone for DEX infrastructure. Beyond performance improvements, the partnership also includes a critical security enhancement. OKX Wallet has integrated Consensys’ SERVO, a solution developed to protect users against Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) attacks — a notorious threat in DeFi where malicious actors manipulate transaction order for profit. This is the first time SERVO has been integrated into a third-party wallet, and Consensys views it as a meaningful step toward user-aligned DeFi innovation. “MEV remains a complex challenge,” said Jason Linehan, chief strategy officer at Consensys. “OKX’s integration of Consensys SERVO reflects a strong commitment to user safety and protocol-aligned innovation.” Decentralized Trading Reaches New Heights The OKX-Consensys alliance arrives at a pivotal moment for onchain trading. With advances in aggregator speed and liquidity access, decentralized trading platforms are approaching execution parity with centralized counterparts, blurring the line between DEX and CEX performance. DEX to CEX volume ratios continue to climb, Ren noted, citing increased demand for self-custodial trading alternatives. He emphasized that the future of crypto trading will rely on a healthy interplay between DEX aggregators, specialized decentralized protocols, and centralized venues — each playing a role in liquidity optimization and ecosystem resilience. This vision resonates with a broader trend across DeFi: reducing user friction while enhancing protocol security, especially as more capital migrates to onchain markets. This isn’t the first time OKX’s DEX infrastructure has made headlines in recent months. In March, the company temporarily shut down its DEX aggregator after identifying an exploit attempt linked to North Korea’s infamous Lazarus Group. The incident occurred amid an ongoing EU regulatory probe into the role of OKX Web3 and its wallet tools in facilitating illicit transactions following the $1.5 billion Bybit hack. In response to these developments, OKX has significantly fortified its defenses. New features include real-time blocking of suspicious addresses, transaction warnings, and third-party audits from firms like CertiK, Hacken, and SlowMist. The platform has also launched a bug bounty program to proactively detect and address vulnerabilities. A New Era for Wallet-Native Trading The partnership between OKX and Consensys signals a transformative moment for Web3 wallets, which are rapidly evolving from passive asset managers into full-service financial interfaces. MetaMask’s integration with a high-speed aggregator and MEV defense layers shows the wallet’s growing ambition to become a central hub for multichain DeFi engagement. As wallets like MetaMask evolve and protocols like SERVO become standard defenses, user expectations are shifting toward CEX-grade performance with DeFi-native security and control. In this context, the OKX-Consensys collaboration is not just about aggregation — it’s about redefining what self-custody trading can look like in the next generation of Web3. Bitget Secures Regulatory Approval in Georgia, Expands Crypto Services Amid Global Growth Push Meanwhile, crypto exchange Bitget has received official regulatory approval to operate within Georgia’s Tbilisi Free Zone (TFZ), a move that marks a significant milestone in its European expansion strategy and broader global ambitions. The approval enables Bitget to offer a full suite of digital asset services, including spot trading, futures, and copy trading, in a fully compliant, locally regulated environment. In a statement issued Thursday, Bitget confirmed its status as a registered digital asset exchange and custodial wallet provider under Georgian jurisdiction, granting the platform enhanced credibility and operational leeway within a region known for its crypto-forward stance and favorable tax climate. Georgia: A Strategic Launchpad for European Crypto Expansion Bitget’s entry into Georgia underscores the country’s growing significance as a crypto hub in Eastern Europe. While the European Union continues implementing its Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) framework, Georgia offers a proactive, business-friendly regulatory landscape that enables crypto companies to operate with more flexibility. As Europe moves toward MiCA implementation, Georgia stands out as a key market providing regulatory clarity, tax advantages, and real user adoption, according to Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget. She emphasized that the move enhances the platform’s ability to serve users with secure infrastructure, including proof of reserves transparency and a dedicated protection fund for user assets. Georgia’s Innovation and Technology Agency (GITA) has also contributed to the country’s growing crypto ecosystem by offering grants and incentives to blockchain startups and digital asset firms. The government has been actively engaging with crypto companies to shape legislation that fosters both innovation and compliance. Bitget’s regulatory footprint continues to widen across the continent as MiCA legislation, which aims to unify crypto regulation across the EU, gradually comes into force. Through its affiliate Archax, Bitget holds authorization from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Additionally, it is formally registered with Italy’s Organismo Agenti e Mediatori (OAM) and operates as a virtual asset service provider (VASP) in Poland, Bulgaria, Lithuania, and the Czech Republic. Bitget’s progressive alignment with regulatory frameworks across Europe gives it a competitive edge, especially as governments across the EU move toward tighter compliance and licensing requirements. For users, this means increased trust in the platform’s custodial capabilities and greater assurance of regulatory oversight. Bitget Wallet Expands into Southeast Asia with QR Payments in Vietnam In a parallel announcement reflecting the company’s global PayFi initiative, Bitget Wallet has launched national QR crypto payment support in Vietnam, using the country’s VietQR standard to allow everyday crypto transactions. Vietnam is the first market to implement this feature, enabling stablecoin payments for goods and services with major retailers and small businesses alike. “Users in Vietnam have already used Bitget Wallet to pay with stablecoins for everyday expenses like food, groceries, and retail items simply by scanning VietQR codes,” said Jamie Elkaleh, Chief Marketing Officer at Bitget Wallet. The new feature supports payments in USDT, USDC, and other stablecoins across various blockchain networks including Ethereum, Tron, Solana, Base, TON, and BNB Chain. An upcoming update will introduce auto-swap functionality, allowing payments with any token by automatically converting it at the point of sale. The QR payment integration is made possible through a partnership with AEON’s crypto payment framework, connecting Bitget Wallet to over 55 financial institutions, including VietinBank and Vietcombank. With over 2 million merchants nationwide accepting VietQR, the move positions Bitget Wallet as a front-runner in real-world crypto utility. Bitget’s QR initiative arrives at a time of evolving regulatory clarity in Vietnam. Just days ago, the National Assembly passed the Law on Digital Technology Industry, which for the first time formally recognizes crypto assets within a legal framework. Effective Jan. 1, 2026, the law establishes distinct definitions for crypto assets and virtual assets, while also introducing cybersecurity and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements that align with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) global standards.

Things are always moving fast, especially when it comes to regulation. A significant development making waves is the latest forecast from the decentralized prediction market platform, Polymarket. Traders there are placing high odds on a major piece of Stablecoin Regulation passing in the United States. What Does the Latest Polymarket Prediction Tell Us? According to reports, traders on Polymarket are indicating a significant 89% probability that the proposed stablecoin regulation bill, known as the GENIUS Act, will officially become law in the United States. Polymarket allows users to bet on the outcome of future events, essentially pooling collective intelligence to form predictions. While not a guarantee, such a high percentage on a platform used by informed traders is a strong signal of perceived likelihood. Why is this prediction getting attention? Prediction markets like Polymarket can sometimes offer insights into market sentiment and expectations regarding specific events, especially those with clear, verifiable outcomes like legislative votes. The high confidence level suggests that many participants believe the stars are aligning for this particular bill. Breaking Down the GENIUS Act So, what exactly is the GENIUS Act, and why is it considered a potential benchmark for US Stablecoin Law ? This proposed legislation aims to establish a clear regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers operating in the United States. Here are some of its key provisions: Licensing Requirements: The bill would mandate that stablecoin issuers obtain specific licenses to operate. This is a common approach in financial regulation to ensure entities meet certain standards. 100% Reserves: A crucial part of the bill is the requirement for stablecoin issuers to maintain reserves equal to 100% of the value of the stablecoins they have issued. This aims to ensure that every stablecoin is backed by an equivalent amount of high-quality, liquid assets, making them more stable and trustworthy. Audit Requirements: For larger issuers, specifically those with a market capitalization of $50 billion or more, the bill imposes regular audit requirements. This adds a layer of transparency and accountability, allowing regulators and the public to verify that reserve requirements are being met. Regulation for Foreign Issuers: The bill also includes provisions to regulate stablecoin issuers based outside the U.S. but serving U.S. customers. This is important for preventing regulatory arbitrage and ensuring a level playing field. These provisions are designed to address concerns about stablecoin stability, consumer protection, and potential systemic risk within the financial system. If passed, the GENIUS Act could provide much-needed clarity for the industry and potentially pave the way for broader adoption of stablecoins within a regulated environment. The Legislative Journey: Where Does the Bill Stand? The path to becoming US Stablecoin Law involves several steps through the U.S. legislative system. The GENIUS Act has already cleared a significant hurdle: It previously passed the final vote in the U.S. Senate. This indicates a level of bipartisan support or at least sufficient consensus to move forward from the upper chamber of Congress. The bill is now awaiting a vote in the House of Representatives. This is the next major test. The House has its own procedures and priorities, and getting a bill passed requires navigating various committees and political dynamics. If it successfully passes the House, the final step would be obtaining President Donald Trump’s signature to officially enact it into law. While the prediction market suggests a high likelihood, the legislative process can sometimes be unpredictable, with potential delays or amendments. What Could This Mean for Crypto Regulation US ? The potential passage of the GENIUS Act is a significant event for the broader landscape of Crypto Regulation US . Stablecoins are a critical bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world, often used for trading, payments, and lending within the digital asset ecosystem. Regulating them is seen by many policymakers as a necessary step to integrate digital assets more safely into the financial system. Potential Benefits: Increased Clarity: A clear federal framework could reduce uncertainty for businesses and investors. Enhanced Trust: Reserve and audit requirements could build confidence in stablecoins among mainstream users and institutions. Foundation for Future Regulation: The GENIUS Act could set a precedent and provide a template for regulating other types of digital assets. Potential Challenges: Compliance Burden: Meeting the requirements, especially for smaller issuers, could be costly and complex. Impact on Innovation: Some worry that strict regulations could stifle innovation in the stablecoin space. Jurisdictional Issues: Regulating foreign issuers presents unique challenges. The outcome of the House vote and presidential signature will be closely watched by everyone in the crypto space, from individual traders to large institutions. Actionable Insights: What Should You Watch For? Given the high Polymarket Prediction , it’s prudent to stay informed. Here’s what to keep an eye on: House of Representatives Schedule: Monitor news regarding when the GENIUS Act is expected to come up for a vote in the House. Debate and Amendments: Pay attention to any debates or proposed amendments in the House, as these could alter the bill’s final form. Industry Reaction: Observe how stablecoin issuers and other crypto companies react to the potential passage and prepare for compliance. Market Impact: While difficult to predict, the passage or failure of the bill could potentially impact the broader crypto market sentiment. This potential move towards federal Stablecoin Regulation highlights the growing interaction between the fast-paced world of digital assets and traditional government processes. The high probability indicated by Polymarket suggests that many believe this interaction is about to result in concrete legislation. Summary The decentralized prediction market Polymarket indicates a strong 89% chance that the GENIUS Act, a bill proposing significant US Stablecoin Law , will be enacted. This bill, having passed the Senate, awaits a House vote and presidential signature. It includes key provisions like licensing, 100% reserves, and audits, aiming to create a robust framework for Stablecoin Regulation . Its potential passage is a major development for Crypto Regulation US , promising clarity but also posing compliance challenges. The high Polymarket Prediction underscores the market’s expectation of this regulatory shift, making it a critical event for the crypto community to monitor.

While familiar names like XRP, Solana, Kaspa, and TRON remain key players in the broader crypto conversation, a growing wave of investor attention is flowing toward MAGACOINFINANCE — a project increasingly seen as the next early-mover opportunity in a shifting market. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early Entries Signal Growing Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing strategic capital at a rapid pace — and for good reason. Traders are no longer just speculating — they’re positioning. The project’s early fundamentals are resonating across the crypto space, particularly among those looking for asymmetric returns ahead of broader listing activity. What’s fueling the shift: Token supply is permanently capped at 170 billion — no hidden minting risks Staking is live, giving investors passive income and deeper engagement Smart contract fully audited by HashEx, boosting trust and credibility 100% community-owned model with no VC overrides or centralized treasury On-chain behavior shows long-term holders accumulating rather than exiting Limited-time promo offer PATRIOTS100X adds an extra incentive for early entries These elements are combining to push MAGACOINFINANCE beyond meme territory and into the category of structured, growth-ready altcoins. XRP Sees Renewed Hope as Legal Finish Line Nears XRP is inching closer to regulatory resolution. The SEC and Ripple have jointly filed to release $125 million from escrow, signaling that long-running litigation may finally be nearing its end. This has re-energized investor interest, especially as speculation rises around a potential XRP ETF and institutional adoption. However, uncertainty still lingers, leading some traders to look elsewhere while final decisions play out. Solana (SOL) Maintains Strong On-Chain Activity Solana (SOL) continues to perform well under the hood. Its transaction speed, active user base, and expanding developer ecosystem keep it competitive among Layer 1s. Yet, in the absence of a new headline catalyst, SOL’s price action has remained relatively range-bound. Traders are still optimistic but are increasingly allocating capital toward newer assets with shorter feedback loops and more aggressive reward structures. Kaspa (KAS) Flies Under the Radar Kaspa (KAS) hasn’t generated major excitement recently, but that doesn’t mean it’s out of the picture. It remains a favorite among infrastructure-focused traders who appreciate its technical foundation. However, the lack of breakout narratives or momentum shifts has limited broader investor attention, prompting a shift toward tokens with more active market behavior and strategic positioning. TRON (TRX) Stays Reliable, But Slow to Move TRON (TRX) remains a stable force in the crypto world, especially in the stablecoin space. Founder Justin Sun continues to promote the ecosystem, and the network consistently ranks high in usage metrics. Still, TRX hasn’t produced the kind of movement traders seek during fast rotations, leading some to exit in favor of more immediate opportunities like MAGACOINFINANCE. Final Thoughts With Bitcoin and Ethereum stabilizing and coins like XRP, SOL, KAS, and TRX maintaining mixed signals, investors are actively seeking a stronger edge — and MAGACOINFINANCE is quickly stepping in to fill that gap. From staking to smart tokenomics, it’s earning the trust of early movers who know the value of getting in before the rest of the market catches on.

CryptoQuant Flags Historic Demand Collapse,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-crash-ahead-cryptoquant-flags-historic-demand-collapse/,"The post Bitcoin Price Crash Ahead? CryptoQuant Flags Historic Demand Collapse appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin continues to hover around $104,500, despite growing geopolitical tensions. Some analysts see this calm as a sign of a maturing market, while others warn of potential downside. CryptoQuant’s June 19 report issues the most alarming call situation in the crypto space as BTC could fall to $92,000 or even $81,000 if demand weakens further. Key indicators show ETF flows are down over 60% since April, and whale accumulation has halved. Their demand momentum tracker has hit a historic low, raising red flags. However, Glassnode isn’t sounding the alarm. Instead, they interpret the lull as a natural shift toward a more institutionalized market. On-chain activity is quiet, but large transfers remain consistent, signaling increased use by major players. Derivatives volume now outpaces spot by up to 16x, suggesting deeper, more strategic market behavior. Flowdesk, a trading firm, offers a middle-ground view. It calls the market “coiled” rather than cracking and notes growth in tokenized assets like gold-backed XAUT and RWAs. This could signal a breakout ahead, direction unknown. Institutional vs Retail: A Tipping Point The balance between institutional accumulation and retail retreat seems to be the key tension. With retail interest fading, institutional moves could drive big swings in price, up or down. Even betting markets like Polymarket are split between BTC dropping to $90K or rallying to $120K by month-end . Bitcoin's elite vs. mortal wallets are moving in two different directions as its market value sits just north of $104.3K. Wallets with 10+ $BTC : +231 Wallets in 10 Days (+0.15%) Wallets with 0.001 to 10 $BTC : -37,465 Wallets in 10 Days (+0.15%) When large wallets… pic.twitter.com/uhZf6rPYvq — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 19, 2025 According to on-chain data provider Santiment, this split in sentiment between elite investors and retail participants could be a key signal for Bitcoin’s next move. According to Santiment, large Bitcoin wallets holding 10 or more BTC have grown by 231 in the last 10 days. Meanwhile, smaller wallets, those with between 0.001 and 10 BTC, have declined by over 37,000. This classic pattern, where retail runs while whales accumulate, has often preceded bullish reversals in the past. With BTC still hovering near $104.3K, some see this as a sign that smart money may be positioning for a leg up. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Altcoin Season Delayed?

The global crypto market is experiencing a slight downturn. Bitcoin is hovering around $104,500, with other major tokens also seeing minor dips, indicating cautious investor sentiment. Why is Bitcoin price down today? Bitcoin’s price dip is largely attributed to weakened demand, a significant drop in ETF inflows, and decreased whale accumulation, as per CryptoQuant’s analysis. Geopolitical tensions also play a role. How low can Bitcoin price go during this crash? Some analysts like CryptoQuant suggest Bitcoin could fall to $92,000 or even $81,000 if demand continues to weaken. Others like Peter Schiff have predicted even lower, around $20,000, if correlation with Nasdaq holds.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-20 05:30:44

US West Texas Intermediate crude for July, which did not trade on Thursday because of a holiday, was up $0.53, or 0.7%, at $75.67 a barrel. Earlier on Thursday, prices spiked by nearly 3% after Israel struck what it called nuclear-related sites in Iran, and Iran responded with missile and drone attacks on Israel following an overnight strike on an Israeli hospital. The week-old clash between the two countries showed no signs of easing. However, gains were trimmed on Friday when the White House press secretary said President Donald Trump would decide within the next two weeks whether to commit U.S. forces to the Israel-Iran fight. “Oil prices surged amid fears of increased U.S. involvement in Israel’s conflict with Iran. However, the White House press secretary later suggested there was still time for de-escalation,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at The Price Futures Group. Iran, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, extracts about 3.3 million barrels of crude oil each day, making it the group’s third-largest producer. Roughly 18 million to 21 million barrels per day of oil and oil products pass through the Strait of Hormuz along Iran’s southern coast. Traders and analysts worry that any widening of the conflict could disrupt shipments and tighten global supplies. “The ‘two-week deadline’ is a tactic Trump has used in other key decisions. Often these deadlines expire without concrete action, which would see the crude oil price remain elevated and potentially build on recent gains,” noted Tony Sycamore, an analyst at IG. US stock futures slipped on Thursday eve US stock futures slipped on Thursday evening as investors weighed the prospect of US military involvement in the Israel-Iran war and a two-week deadline set by President Trump for a decision on entering the conflict. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell more than 0.4%, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped roughly 0.3%. Markets were closed on Thursday for Juneteenth, giving traders a pause as global news grew tense. On Wall Street, investors were also digesting remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. After the Fed kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, Powell said policymakers were not in a hurry to cut rates and would base decisions on incoming data. According to CME Group, most traders expect a rate cut by the Fed’s September meeting. President Trump renewed his criticism of Powell on Thursday, accusing him of costing the US “hundreds of billions of dollars” by keeping rates high. He added a personal attack, calling Powell “one of the dumbest, and most destructive, people in Government.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Recent events surrounding the Abstract Chain hack serve as a stark reminder of the ever-present dangers lurking in the digital realm. Reports indicate that the official X (formerly Twitter) account belonging to Abstract Chain was compromised, leading to the promotion of a fraudulent memecoin scam. What Happened During the Abstract Chain X Account Hack? According to community reports circulating online, the official X account for Abstract Chain was taken over by malicious actors. These hackers wasted no time, leveraging the account’s credibility to push a scam. The core of their scheme involved promoting a supposed new “ABS” meme coin said to be launching on the Solana blockchain. They even went so far as to share a contract address, a common tactic to lend a false sense of legitimacy to the fake token. This type of incident highlights a critical vulnerability: official social media channels. Projects invest heavily in building a following and trust on platforms like X. When these accounts are compromised, the scammers gain immediate access to a large, engaged audience who might mistakenly believe the fraudulent posts are official communications from the project team. Why Are Memecoin Scams and Solana Scams So Prevalent? The recent surge in popularity of memecoins, particularly on networks like Solana, has unfortunately created fertile ground for scammers. Memecoins are often characterized by their viral nature, community-driven hype, and sometimes, a lack of clear utility beyond speculation. This environment of rapid price swings and fear of missing out (FOMO) can make individuals less cautious than they might be with more established cryptocurrencies. Solana, known for its speed and low transaction costs, has become a popular network for launching new tokens, including memecoins. While this fosters innovation, it also lowers the barrier for bad actors to deploy scam tokens and execute rug pulls. A Solana scam often preys on the excitement surrounding the ecosystem’s growth. Common tactics in memecoin scams include: Promising unrealistic returns or guaranteed profits. Creating fake social media hype and using bots to simulate community interest. Deploying tokens with malicious code that prevents users from selling. Performing “rug pulls,” where the creators suddenly drain liquidity after attracting investments. Using compromised official accounts, as seen in the Abstract Chain hack , to lend false credibility. How to Spot a Potential Crypto Scam: Actionable Insights Protecting yourself from a crypto scam requires vigilance and a healthy dose of skepticism. Here are some actionable steps you can take: Verify Information Sources: Always cross-reference announcements. If you see something on social media, check the project’s official website, Discord, or other established channels. Does the announcement appear elsewhere? Are there official blog posts or press releases? Be Wary of Unsolicited Promotions: Be extremely cautious of sudden, unexpected announcements, especially those urging you to act quickly or send funds immediately. Legitimate projects usually have planned announcement schedules. Scrutinize Contract Addresses: Never interact with a contract address shared only on social media, especially after a reported hack. Verify the official contract address through reliable, official project documentation (like their whitepaper or official website). Use blockchain explorers to check the contract’s activity and code if you have the technical knowledge. Research the Project and Token: Before investing in any new token, especially a memecoin, research its purpose, team (if public), tokenomics, and community sentiment (beyond just hype). Look for red flags like anonymous teams, vague roadmaps, or overly aggressive marketing. Understand Memecoin Risks: Recognize that memecoins are inherently high-risk and speculative. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Not every new coin will be the next success story. Check for Social Media Anomalies: If an account suddenly starts posting content that is drastically different from its usual style, or posts about unexpected token launches, it could be a sign the account has been compromised. Look for strange links, poor grammar, or urgent calls to action. Strengthening Your Crypto Security Against Social Media Hacks Beyond spotting scams, enhancing your own crypto security is paramount. A compromised X account, while damaging to the project, can also impact users who interact with malicious links or contract addresses posted from it. Tips for users: Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): This is non-negotiable for all your online accounts, especially crypto exchanges, wallets, and social media used for crypto news. Use authenticator apps (like Authy or Google Authenticator) or hardware keys over SMS-based 2FA, which can be vulnerable to SIM swap attacks. Use Strong, Unique Passwords: Never reuse passwords. Use a password manager to create and store complex, unique passwords for each account. Beware of Phishing Attempts: Be cautious of unsolicited emails, direct messages, or links that ask for your private keys, seed phrase, or login credentials. Scammers often impersonate legitimate projects or support staff. Educate Yourself: Stay informed about common scam tactics and security best practices in the crypto space. For crypto projects and individuals managing official accounts: Implement Robust Account Security: Use the strongest available security measures on social media accounts, including mandatory 2FA for all team members with access. Limit Account Access: Restrict who has posting privileges on official accounts. Have an Incident Response Plan: Know exactly what steps to take if an account is compromised, including how to communicate the hack to the community immediately through alternative, secure channels. Monitor Accounts: Regularly check official accounts for any unauthorized activity. The Challenge of Trust in the Wake of a Social Media Hack Incidents like the Abstract Chain X account hacked situation pose a significant challenge to trust within the crypto community. When official channels are compromised, it erodes confidence in the project and the platforms used for communication. Rebuilding that trust requires transparency, swift action, and reinforced security measures. It serves as a critical reminder that even seemingly legitimate sources can be compromised. Users must develop their own robust verification processes and not rely solely on social media announcements, especially concerning financial decisions. Conclusion: Staying Safe in the Crypto Wild West The Abstract Chain hack promoting a memecoin scam on Solana is just one example in a continuous stream of malicious activity targeting the crypto space. While the potential rewards in crypto can be significant, so are the risks, particularly from scams and security breaches. By understanding how these scams operate, recognizing the red flags, and implementing strong personal and project-level security measures, we can navigate this exciting but challenging landscape more safely. Always verify, stay skeptical of easy money promises, and prioritize the security of your accounts and assets.

The healthcare tech firm plans to achieve this through equity offerings, debt financing, and cash flow, with the goal of holding 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and 42,000 by 2026. To lead the initiative, Semler appointed Bitcoin researcher Joe Burnett as director of Bitcoin strategy. While the move aligns with the broader corporate trend of accumulating Bitcoin as a treasury asset, analysts also raised concerns about potential risks if the firm’s stock declines further. Meanwhile, Kraken launched a Bitcoin staking product via Babylon Labs that will allow users to earn rewards without leaving the exchange. Additionally, XBTO and Arab Bank Switzerland introduced a Bitcoin yield product targeting institutional clients looking for non-speculative BTC income strategies. Semler Scientific Targets 105,000 Bitcoin Semler Scientific Inc., a healthcare technology firm, unveiled an ambitious plan to expand its Bitcoin holdings nearly 28-fold over the next two-and-a-half years. The company currently holds 3,808 BTC, and plans to reach 105,000 BTC by 2027. Semler plans to hold 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, increase that to 42,000 BTC by the end of 2026, and ultimately achieve its target using a mix of equity offerings, debt financing, and operational cash flow. Announcement from Semler Scientific To spearhead this strategy, Semler appointed Bitcoin researcher Joe Burnett as its new director of Bitcoin strategy. Burnett brings experience from his previous roles at Unchained and Blockware Solutions, as well as a background at Big Four firm EY. He pointed out that the movement among public companies to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset is gaining more momentum. Semler’s commitment to Bitcoin began in 2024 and already earned it the 13th spot among public companies with the largest Bitcoin holdings, based on data from BitBo. The company’s plan mirrors the growing trend of businesses prioritizing Bitcoin accumulation, sometimes even ahead of their core operations. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet, for example, also announced its goal to acquire 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. If Semler achieves its target, it will control 0.5% of Bitcoin’s fixed 21 million supply. However, this aggressive strategy isn’t without its critics. VanEck researcher Matthew Sigel recently warned that firms heavily dependent on Bitcoin purchases and at-the-market equity programs could face challenges if their stock prices fall too close to their net asset values. In such scenarios, issuing more shares could result in shareholder dilution rather than value creation. Sigel specifically pointed to Semler as it is nearing this critical point. This is because its stock declined almost 41% year-to-date and is approaching pre-Bitcoin purchase levels. Semler Scientific YTD share price (Source: Google Finance ) Despite this, Semler's Bitcoin bet has so far been profitable. On June 3, the company reported an unrealized gain of $177 million on its Bitcoin holdings, which is a 287% yield. Among public firms holding Bitcoin, Semler boasts the fourth-highest Bitcoin-per-share ratio at 0.00034. Kraken Launches Bitcoin Staking with Babylon Buying is not the only way companies are taking advantage of Bitcoins current momentum. Kraken launched a new Bitcoin staking service through an integration with Babylon Labs, offering users a way to earn rewards on their Bitcoin without relying on bridging, wrapping, or lending mechanisms. The service was introduced on 19 June, and it allows Kraken users to stake their BTC directly from the exchange. Instead of moving their assets to external wallets, users can lock their Bitcoin in a secure vault on the Bitcoin blockchain, which is then delegated via the Babylon protocol to support proof-of-stake networks. In return, participants receive rewards in the form of Babylon’s native BABY token , which saw a nearly 5% price increase after the announcement was made. Kraken’s global head of consumer, Mark Greenberg, explained that a large portion of Bitcoin on the exchange sits idle, which is a missed opportunity both for clients and the broader ecosystem. He stated that the Babylon integration makes it possible for clients to put their Bitcoin to work while also supporting emerging PoS blockchains by contributing Bitcoin’s economic weight to their security and validation processes. This initiative is part of the trend known as BTCFi, or Bitcoin-based decentralized finance, which aims to bring more utility to Bitcoin beyond its traditional role as a store of value. While early BTCFi efforts include the now-legacy Omni Layer used to move Tether before Ethereum, newer projects like Babylon are allowing Bitcoin holders to participate in staking through native, time-locked mechanisms that don’t require intermediaries. The BABY token accrues from 8% annual inflation split equally between BTC and BABY stakers. It also enables participation in governance and pays for transaction fees. BTCFi TVL growth (Source: Binance ) Other BTCFi examples include Bitcoin sidechains like Rootstock, the Liquid Network, and Bitcoin’s Lightning Network combined with Taproot Assets for tokenization. Recent developments showed that there is growing traction for these protocols. In early May, Rootstock saw a major uptick in network security and mining activity, while Binance reported in April that the total value locked in Bitcoin-based DeFi had surged over 2,700% in the past year. XBTO and Arab Bank Launch Bitcoin Yield Product Crypto investment firm XBTO recently partnered with Arab Bank Switzerland to launch a Bitcoin yield product that is tailored for the bank’s wealth management clients. The offering is an answer to the growing institutional demand for structured yield strategies that allow Bitcoin holders to generate returns without liquidating their assets. XBTO will apply its proprietary “diamond-hands” strategy, which combines the sale of Bitcoin options to collect premiums with a long-term accumulation approach during market dips. This strategy, used in XBTO’s regulated Bitcoin yield fund in Bermuda, has produced annualized returns of approximately 5% with comparatively low volatility. Javier Rodriguez-Alarcon, XBTO’s chief investment officer, shared that institutional clients are no longer satisfied with just price exposure and are looking for more sophisticated digital asset solutions. Romain Braud, head of digital assets at Arab Bank Switzerland, pointed out that their clientele has increasingly shown interest in yield-generation strategies that are implemented in a controlled risk environment. Traditionally, Bitcoin was seen only as a buy-and-hold asset, with yield generation largely inaccessible outside of speculative trading or lending. However, the maturation of the crypto market and the evolution of financial tools like derivatives and staking models allowed holders to earn income from their BTC positions. Despite the appeal, Bitcoin yield products are not without risks. As pointed out by OneSafe , these products can be impacted by impermanent loss, uncertain regulatory frameworks, high volatility, and vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Nevertheless, a number of firms are entering the space with similar offerings, including Hilbert Capital’s Bitcoin Yield Solution, Purpose Investments’ Purpose Bitcoin Yield ETF, NEOS’ Bitcoin High Income ETF, and Coinbase’s recently launched Bitcoin Yield Fund.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-20 05:49:02

This event is slightly larger than last week’s options expiry, but the impact on spot markets is likely to be minimal. They have been on the back foot all week, losing $30B since Monday, as crypto assets cool amid rising Middle East tensions. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s tranche of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 1.16, meaning that there are more short sellers than longs, but not by much. There is also a max pain point of $106,000, around $1,500 above current spot prices, which is where most losses will be made on contract expiry. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at strike prices between $115,000 and $140,000, with more than $1.7 billion at each price, as bullish speculators remain confident, according to Deribit.

In addition to today’s Bitcoin options, there are around 215,000 Ethereum contracts that are also expiring, with a notional value of $546 million, a max pain point of $2,600, and a put/call ratio of 0.68. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $3.9 billion. Crypto Market Outlook Total market capitalization has fallen a further 2% on the day to $3.37 trillion, but it remains within a range-bound channel that formed in early May. Bitcoin has been flat over the past 24 hours with a slight dip to $104,600 at the time of writing. However, it has fallen 3.8% from its weekly high of $108,770 on Tuesday, but support levels continue to hold despite the escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Ethereum prices are also holding above support at $2,500, and the asset has moved very little over the past 48 hours.

Bitcoin BTC hovered near $104,700 during Asia hours, slipping 1.2% over 24 hours, while ether ETH traded just below $2,860, down 1.8% on the day. The soft price action tracks with broader macro unease following Wednesday’s FOMC hold, where the Fed kept rates unchanged but reiterated a cautious, inflation-sensitive stance. Seasonality is starting to show Historically subdued during the June-July stretch, crypto markets have entered a lull with BTC front-end implied volumes slipping under 40%, erasing the risk premium from recent geopolitical tension, Singapore-based QCP Capital noted in a Thursday market broadcast. Open interest across BTC and ETH perps remains flat, and option markets skew negative, with puts trading at a premium to calls – a sign of traders hedging against short-term pullbacks. “There’s been no change to the technical picture, which remains supportive of another push to the topside,” said Joel Kruger, strategist at LMAX Group, in an email to CoinDesk. “BTC continues to consolidate bullishly, and a move through recent highs could set up a run toward $145,000.” Ether still lags its 2021 highs but is gaining momentum, he added. “Clearing $2,900 could bring $3,400 into play,” Kruger said. One bright spot for crypto is the U.S. Senate’s passage of a stablecoin framework, which adds another building block to what is becoming a more regulatory-friendly global environment. That’s reinforced a broader institutional conviction. “Globally, we’re seeing continued progress that promises greater clarity and a more welcoming environment for institutional crypto adoption,” Kruger added. Still, the near-term setup remains cautious. Month-end OPEX flows, systematic rebalancing, and a lack of fresh catalysts could keep BTC stuck in its $ 102,000–$ 108,000 band for now. But with H2 historically strong for crypto, some desks are already looking ahead. “The worst may be behind us,” Kruger said. “And the next leg up could catch many off guard.”",Markets|Market|Bitcoin|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-20 05:53:28

It added that a “clear divergence” has emerged between market valuation and network activity, indicating that large institutions are becoming more dominant in network activity. Daily Bitcoin transactions have dropped from peaks of over 730,000 to around 320,000 to 500,000 in 2025. This has been primarily due to a sharp decrease in non-monetary transactions such as Inscriptions and Runes, it noted. Since the start of 2025, non-monetary activity has “declined significantly, heavily contributing to the recent contraction in overall network throughput.” Despite #Bitcoin ’s elevated price, a clear divergence has emerged between market valuation and network activity. In this report, we explore activity across both on and off-chain markets, and examine how network metrics have changed this cycle. Discover more in the latest Week… pic.twitter.com/vLhL7sllKK — glassnode (@glassnode) June 19, 2025 Transaction Size Matters One of the key findings from the analysts was a change in transaction size. The economic volume settled on the network has remained historically elevated, with a yearly average of $7.5 billion settled per day, it noted. However, the average transaction size has grown to around $36,000, indicating larger entities are increasingly dominating network usage. Additionally, transactions over $100,000 now account for 89% of network volume, up from 66% in 2022. “This trend implies that larger entities continue to utilize the Bitcoin network, with the throughput per transaction rising even as overall activity by count declines.” Glassnode also reported that transaction fees have dropped, creating a historical divergence. Typically, bull markets near all-time highs see fee spikes due to network congestion, but current fee pressure remains subdued despite elevated prices. This combination of low transaction count and a heightened volume throughput suggests “large entities” are becoming increasingly dominant for on-chain activity, it stated before concluding: “This shift highlights the maturation of the derivative complex around digital assets, and a move toward more stable risk management practices.” Retail Losing Confidence Meanwhile, Santiment reported that “elite” wallet and “mortal” wallet activity are also diverging. “When large wallets accumulate as retail loses confidence, this is historically the right combination for bullish momentum to inevitably return to crypto markets,” analysts noted. Additionally, traders are showing signs of “impatience and bearish sentiment,” it noted in a separate post, adding that markets “historically move in the opposite direction of retail’s expectations.” Meanwhile, the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index, which measures market sentiment, has returned to neutral as the asset continues to trade sideways.

Analyst Forecasts $130 Retest Before Next Wave Up,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-correction-about-to-end-analyst-forecasts-130-retest-before-next-wave-up/,"Amid the geopolitical turmoil, Solana (SOL) has retraced 10% in the past week. Some analysts believe that the altcoin’s correction is about to end, but warned that a dip below a key support level might come first. Related Reading: SUI Preparing For New Highs As Falling Wedge Breakout Targets $5 Solana Eyes Key Retest Before Breakout After retesting the $168 resistance last Wednesday, Solana has fallen back to a key level fueled by the recent market pullback. The cryptocurrency has seen a 15% retracement from its monthly highs, trading around the $140 zone for the past three days. SOL has been hovering between the $145-$180 price range since its May breakout, falling to the range lows during the June market shakeouts. Since then, the altcoin has struggled to reclaim the $160-$170 mid-zone. Nonetheless, market watcher Lluciano considers that Solana “may dip a bit more, but the ultimate target is seriously huge.” The analyst highlighted SOL’s performance since April, noting that it ended its multi-month downtrend after breaking above its descending resistance at the end of March. After this price action, SOL retested the $100-$120 demand zone before breaking out to its current range in the following weeks. Now, the altcoin’s chart displays a one-month falling wedge pattern, with the upper boundary sitting around the $155-$160 area. To the analyst, a breakout from this pattern could send the cryptocurrency toward May’s $187 high resistance before propelling the price to retest the $240 mark. Similarly, trader Rose noted that SOL has been consolidating above the key $145 resistance and 50-day Moving Average (MA), signaling a potential breakout. “If confirmed, the price could rise toward targets at $165, $183, and $220,” they suggested. SOL To Underperform In Coming Months? Market watcher Crypto Bullet suggested that Solana’s correction is coming to an end. The analyst forecasted that SOL could soon lose its current range and retest the April consolidation range, around the $125-$135 area, to complete the correction. This would be followed by a bounce back into the current range before surging past the $200 barrier toward the $220-$250 targets, for “one more wave up” this cycle. Meanwhile, Altcoin Sherpa affirmed Solana won’t outperform like it did during the first half of the cycle. According to the analyst, the cryptocurrency won’t outperform Bitcoin (BTC) on any long-term timeframe “other than a few blips here and there.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Setting Up For ‘Large Move’ Amid $103,000 Retest – Key Levels To Watch He explained that the cycle’s leading altcoin isn’t “dead,” but that he doesn’t “see it having a run like it did in 2021/2024.” Notably, SOL is currently retesting its late November 2023 support levels against BTC, which previously sent it to yearly lows after failing to hold them. Altcoin Sherpa concluded that Solana will likely continue to climb against its USDT pair but continue to bleed in its SOL/BTC chart. As of this writing, Solana is trading at $145, a 12.1% decline in the monthly timeframe.

While established players like Chainlink (LINK), Polkadot (DOT), Polygon (MATIC), and Cardano (ADA) remain closely monitored, Bitcoin (BTC) continues to anchor the broader market. Against this backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging from underdog status to become a standout gainer, drawing growing interest from strategic investors across the space. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Frontrunner in 2025’s Crypto Presale Landscape MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as a leading contender in the 2025 pre-sale arena, drawing significant interest from seasoned investors. Its capped supply strengthens its appeal, while the project’s blend of meme-driven identity and practical utility sets it apart in a crowded market. All smart contracts have been successfully audited by HashEx , reinforcing security and trust. Access remains limited through the official website, with a 100% bonus available for contributions using PATRIOTS100X . Chainlink (LINK): Bullish Momentum and Price Targets Chainlink (LINK) has seen a 29% gain over the past week, trading above $16.70 and showing strong upward momentum. Analysts forecast LINK could reach $24.54–$25.67 by September 2025, with bullish sentiment supported by increased DeFi adoption. As LINK continues its steady rise, some traders are rotating profits into MAGACOIN FINANCE, seeking sharper early-stage returns. Polkadot (DOT): Interoperability and Steady Growth Polkadot (DOT) is trading near $7.56, with technical indicators pointing to a potential move above $6.00 by year-end. DOT’s unique parachain technology and growing ecosystem are attracting developer and investor interest. However, as growth moderates, traders are increasingly allocating to MAGACOIN FINANCE for higher upside exposure. Polygon (MATIC): Layer-2 Utility and Rotation Trends Polygon (MATIC) is holding steady, with forecasts for June 2025 suggesting a range between $0.22 and $0.24. While MATIC remains a favorite for Ethereum scaling, the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing capital from MATIC holders seeking early-cycle gains. Cardano (ADA): Struggling for Support as Traders Diversify Cardano (ADA) is struggling to reclaim support above $0.65, facing bearish momentum in June. As ADA’s price action remains constrained, many traders are diversifying into MAGACOINFINANCE, attracted by its scarcity-driven tokenomics and parabolic growth potential. Final Thoughts With Solana, XRP, and Bitcoin providing stability, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the breakout story of 2025. As traders rotate out of established altcoins like LINK, DOT, MATIC, and ADA, the early accumulation in MAGACOIN FINANCE signals strong conviction in its future upside.

In an X post, Sun explained that their discussion revolved around how TRON and blockchain technology could bolster US dominance in digital assets. He argued that the support for the GENIUS Act has played a key role in pushing forward essential crypto policy reforms. Sun commented, “It was a pleasure meeting Bo Hines to discuss how TRON and blockchain technology can support US leadership in digital assets. Your support for the GENIUS Act has helped accelerate much-needed progress in crypto legislation.” He also thanked the Digital Sovereignty Alliance for bringing about these important discussions and for their significant help in advancing the GENIUS Act forward. Conversations between Sun and the political influencer Hines have roused crypto enthusiasts, mainly regarding how some legislation can impact the future of blockchains within the US. Analysts believe that earning political support could accelerate growth for the TRON ecosystem, especially in altcoins like TRX, which often react strongly to ecosystem-specific news. Most crypto community members who responded to Sun’s post reacted positively to their meeting, some claiming TRON is driving real change and expect bullish results. The president named Bo Hines, a former US congressional candidate and up-and-coming star, to become the executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets. Trump wants him to create crypto-friendly regulations and roll back the Biden administration’s crackdown on the cryptocurrency industry. Hines has fast become like a crypto prince, with crypto CEOs, venture capitalists, and lobbyists wanting to meet him. During his first 30 days on the job, Hines met with over 50 industry players, such as Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Andreessen Horowitz partners Chris Dixon and Marc Andreessen. Tron’s Sun and SRM agreed on a $100 million equity investment deal Justin Sun recently announced he would take his Tron blockchain platform public in the US through a reverse merger. On Monday, SRM Entertainment , a souvenir and toy manufacturer, confirmed that they agreed on a securities purchase with the TRON founder for a $100 million equity investment. It also claimed it would issue preferred shares and warrants to raise the deal’s value to about $210 million. So far, SRM has about 17.2 million common shares outstanding. The company added that it would change its name to Tron Incorporation, with Sun joining as the advisor. Then any gains from the investment will be directed toward establishing a Tron crypto token treasury, following the model popularized by Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Strategy, now adopted by multiple firms. SRM shares spiked by over 460% after the announcement, increasing the firm’s market cap to $140 million. Eric Trump, a son of US President Donald Trump, has denied reports that he will be involved in blockchain network Tron’s intent to pursue a public offering in the United States. However, he had positive things to say about the project’s founder, Justin Sun. “I’m the biggest fan of Tron,” Trump said on social media, adding that he admires Sun and considers him a “great friend and icon in the crypto space.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",News|TRON,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-20 06:00:38

The memecoin continues to show a bearish trend, with its price falling through June. It is now hovering above a key support level at $0.00001000. A breakdown below this level could send it lower, toward $0.00000900. PEPE Faces Downtrend, Technicals Remains Bearish Technical indicators also support a bearish outlook. Short to mid-term moving averages are signaling sell, and the RSI sits at 38, indicating weak momentum but not yet oversold. The MACD and momentum indicators also reflect selling pressure. While there are minor signs of a short-term bounce, they remain weak for now. The chart continues to show a clear downtrend, dominated by red candles and low buying volume. Unless fresh momentum comes in, a strong recovery is not likely right now. PEPE Eyes Breakout as Traders Load Up Analyst Lev Arden sees a bullish cup & handle forming on PEPE’s weekly chart. A breakout above $0.000014 could quickly push it to $0.0000227. He also notes a $74M surge in open interest, which shows that traders are ready to act. Can PEPE Hit $1? Despite the recent decline, Pepe Coin remains a top choice. But reaching $1 or even $0.01 for the token is extremely unlikely given its 420 trillion supply. Hitting $0.01 would require a multi-trillion-dollar market cap, which seems unrealistic in today’s market. Nevertheless, on-chain data shows that whales are increasing their holdings, and exchange balances are falling, which are positive signs. Pepe has formed a bullish flag and double-bottom pattern, which often signal potential breakouts. If the trend continues, Pepe could witness a strong rally. How High Can Pepe Go? Key Predictions Ahead Currently, Pepe’s market cap is around $4.3 billion. According to an analysis from CoinDCX, the short-term price targets for 2025 show Pepe could trade between $0.000006 and $0.000008 on the lower end and it could reach up to $0.000024 if momentum builds. Long-term targets might push it to $0.000031 or $0.000409, but those depend heavily on market conditions and sentiment. According to CoinCodex, Pepe Coin is expected to end 2025 between $0.00000805 and $0.00000829. For 2026, it expects Pepe to trade between $0.00000800 to $0.00002771.",News|Crypto news|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|PEPE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-20 06:02:22

All eyes are shifting toward Little Pepe (LILPEPE) —a newcomer priced under $0.0015 that has already caught fire in the crypto community. While DOGE continues its sluggish attempt to $1, LILPEPE is blazing through its presale stages with a momentum that screams breakout. And with a price goal of $0.30, many early buyers believe it will leave Dogecoin in the dust long before DOGE ever touches $1. This isn’t just hype for hype’s sake. LILPEPE is doing things differently, building a real ecosystem around meme coin culture with serious tech under the hood and a loyal, rapidly growing community behind it. The DOGE Fatigue Is Real DOGE would need to rally 155% from the current price to reach the neckline at $0.568. Beyond this, theoretical forecasting methods suggest another 90% move to reach $1.088. However, the crypto market outlook remains shaky due to concerns about a Bitcoin price crash. 1-Week DOGE/USD Chart Showcasing Adam & Eve Chart Pattern Latest data from Polymarket indicates a 68% chance of a DOGE ETF approval in 2025. Even though the SEC recently delayed approval of the Dogecoin spot ETF. Holders have grown weary. There’s no significant development on the Dogecoin network, no real roadmap, and no evolving utility. The market recognizes that DOGE’s move to $1 will necessitate extraordinary macroeconomic support, which may not arrive quickly enough. Meanwhile, upstarts like LILPEPE are outpacing DOGE in both community growth and technological innovation. LILPEPE Is More Than a Meme Priced currently at $0.0012 in its third presale stage, LILPEPE is being hailed as the meme coin to beat in 2025. And the reasons are obvious. Unlike most meme tokens, LILPEPE is launching its own dedicated Layer 2 chain, tailored explicitly for the meme coin ecosystem. It will be the first blockchain built exclusively for meme coins, offering speed, near-zero gas fees, and scalability. Even more revolutionary is the project’s bot-resistant architecture, which prevents sniper bots from hijacking launches—an issue that has plagued every major meme coin presale, including PEPE and FLOKI. This feature alone is generating massive buzz across Telegram and Twitter groups, as retail investors finally feel they have a level playing field. Add to that the LILPEPE Meme Launchpad, a dedicated platform that will allow other meme coin projects to launch safely and seamlessly on the LILPEPE chain. It’s infrastructure, not just hype—and that’s what gives this project staying power. Presale Selling Out Fast: $ 1.3 M+ Already Raised The presale tells the story. Stage 1 sold out in under 72 hours, and Stage 2 ended even faster, bringing total funds raised to over $1.3 million. Now, with Stage 3 underway at $0.0012, the price is still microscopic compared to the projected post-launch target of $0.30. At current pricing, a $1,000 investment in LILPEPE could potentially yield $250,000 if the token reaches its goal. The presale is available only through the official website littlepepe.com , where users can connect their crypto wallets to purchase tokens directly. Massive $777K Giveaway Adds Firepower. Fueling even more attention is the team’s $777,000 giveaway. In this promo, 10 lucky winners will each walk away with $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens—a staggering reward structure that has made LILPEPE the talk of social media. It’s not just about the money—it’s a clear statement from the team that they’re playing big-league ball and rewarding community loyalty in ways few projects do. This giveaway, alongside the presale success and growing media attention, has already helped push the project into the top tier of trending tokens. Could LILPEPE Hit $0.30? Skeptics will say $0.30 is a stretch for a token priced at less than $0.0015. But in crypto, these are precisely the bets that make fortunes. Dogecoin did a similar jump in 2021. PEPE did a 10,000% rally in 2023. If LILPEPE can continue its trajectory, especially with exchange listings and chain launch on the horizon, a $0.30 price target isn’t out of reach—it may even be conservative. The LILPEPE team has already confirmed upcoming listings on two top-tier centralized exchanges and has hinted that all preparations are in place for a debut on the largest global exchange. If those plans come through, LILPEPE could make history in record time. Final Thoughts Dogecoin will always be the pioneer of meme coins, but Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is shaping up to be the evolution. With a dedicated chain, anti-bot technology, a presale that’s selling out faster than anyone expected, and a wildly generous giveaway, LILPEPE has all the ingredients to hit $0.30 long before DOGE sees $1. And for investors who missed the boat on PEPE or DOGE’s early days, this may just be your second shot at turning a small bag into a life-changing portfolio.

The company argued that this drop was a signal that often occurs ahead of significant volatility or trend change in Bitcoin price.

The weaker the correlation, the stronger this signal becomes.” Related News: Big Bull Anthony Scaramucci Drops a Bold Prediction: “I Think It Will Surpass Ethereum” The company noted that Bitcoin miners are the most established elements in the crypto ecosystem, and that they currently hold more BTC than all ETFs combined.

According to a June 19 report by local media Yonhap News, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) has submitted a new crypto roadmap to the Presidential Committee on Policy Planning. The plan sets the stage for launching spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and regulating stablecoins by the second half of 2025. Regulators will build the necessary legal and technical infrastructure to support the ETFs, including rules around fund structuring, custody, pricing, and investor protection. The FSC’s push aims to align the local digital market scene with global standards, following increased calls from advocates within the region who argue that without action, the country risks falling behind other major markets. You might also like: Hong Kong accelerates stablecoin licensing to tap into global market boom Earlier this year, South Korea’s newly elected President, Lee Jae-myung , pledged to legalize spot crypto ETFs as part of his campaign. He also promised to create a unified oversight system to better protect investors and increase market transparency. In addition to the ETF reforms, the commission is working on legislation to govern the issuance of Korean Won-based stablecoins . It will also tighten rules around how virtual assets are listed and disclosed, as well as how local crypto businesses and service providers operate. Another major focus of the roadmap is tougher enforcement. The FSC plans to introduce stricter penalties for misconduct, including permanent bans and heavy fines for individuals or firms involved in illegal activities. Local exchanges will also be required to cut trading fees and improve transparency by publicly disclosing and comparing fees. This aligns with President Lee’s earlier pledge to lower transaction fees from the current average of 0.05% to around 0.015%, as part of efforts to support young traders. While the roadmap marks a major step forward in the nation’s ambitions, the FSC has emphasized that none of the proposals are confirmed or finalized yet, suggesting that the plan is still in its early stages.

According to a recent blogpost by Cisco Tallos, the PylangGhost is exclusively used by North Korea-affiliated cyber threat actors to infiltrate the hardware belonging to job seekers looking for roles in the crypto industry. The PylangGhost is a new kind of Python-based remote access trojan that functions similarly to the previously documented GolangGhost RAT that was discovered by Cisco Talos back in December 2024. Most recently, the cybersecurity firm found that it has been actively used by the hacking group called Famous Chollima to infiltrate Windows systems, while continuing to deploy a Golang-based version for MacOS users. So far, open-source data indicates that most of the victims affected by the malware are based in India . Famous Chollima is also nicknamed “Wagemole” because of their repeated attempts to steal passwords and infiltrate user’s crypto wallets as well as nab other sensitive information through fake job openings online. You might also like: Printer exploit reveals new threat to cryptocurrency wallets How do North Korean hackers catch their victims? According to the report, the hacker group lures its victims in through fake job interview campaigns using social engineering. The attackers then create fake job sites that impersonate major crypto firms, including Coinbase , Robinhood and Uniswap among others. The victims are then required to take part in multiple steps, initiated by fake recruiters. They are then invited to open fraudulent skill-testing websites where their personal information is gathered. When preparing for the fake interview, the user is then tricked into enabling permission for the site to access their camera and microphone access. During this phase, the fake recruiter will ask them to copy and execute malicious commands under the pretense of installing updated video drivers. Upon command execution, the malware is able to infiltrate their device. The command enables remote control access of the infected device and grants attackers access to cookies and credentials from over 80 browser extensions. These include access to password managers and cryptocurrency wallets, including MetaMask, 1Password, NordPass, Phantom, Bitski, Initia, TronLink and MultiverseX. As previously reported by crypto in April, another North Korean hacking collective, Lazarus Group, have also used similar methods to lure in users. The attackers would deploy fake job applications with at least three strains of detected malware linked to North Korean cyber operations.

On June 17, 2025, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an official order to begin proceedings on whether to approve or disapprove the proposed rule change that would allow Cboe BZX Exchange to list and trade shares of the Franklin XRP ETF. While the commission has yet to make a final decision, Generation Infinity (@GenfinityIO) noted that this is a significant action that places the fund under detailed regulatory scrutiny and also puts pressure on the SEC to decide on the ETF. Details Behind the ETF Proposal The Franklin XRP Trust aims to issue an ETF that holds physical XRP, with Coinbase Custody Trust Company serving as custodian. If approved, the ETF would track the CF Benchmark CME XRP-Dollar Index. The fund would only hold XRP, cash, and cash equivalents, and calculate net asset value daily at 4:00 p.m. ET using the benchmark index. The process began on March 13, 2025, when Cboe BZX submitted its proposal . It was published in the Federal Register on March 19. On April 29, the SEC exercised its authority to extend the review period to June 17. By June 17, the Commission had decided to formally open proceedings to determine whether the proposal was consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act. According to Generation Infinity, the next major deadline is expected around September 9, which marks the 180-day review threshold. $XRP ETF UPDATE (June 17) The SEC has officially opened proceedings to determine whether to approve or disapprove the proposed listing of the Franklin XRP ETF on Cboe BZX.

This provision requires that exchange rules be designed to prevent fraud and manipulation and protect investors and the public interest. According to the order, the SEC will conduct additional analysis and is actively requesting written public comments . The key concern is whether the XRP market is structured in a way that supports fair pricing and can resist manipulation. Interested parties are invited to submit written comments regarding the sufficiency of the Exchange’s arguments and whether the fund should be approved. In particular, the Commission is seeking opinions on whether the proposal raises “any new or novel concerns” not addressed in past decisions. All submissions are due by the end of July. Other countries are already taking the lead, as Canada recently launched its first spot ETF . The SEC will need to expedite the process if it plans to follow Trump’s agenda of making the U.S. the global leader in cryptocurrency.

Following a June 19 motion in the Senate, House Bill 2324 is headed back to the Arizona House of Representatives for reconsideration. The measure, which had previously failed to pass the House on May 7, was brought back after a narrow 16-14 Senate vote . Republican Senator Janae Shamp, one of the lawmakers who initially voted against the bill, filed the motion to reconsider. It must now secure a majority vote from the 60-member House, where Republicans hold 33 seats, after which it will proceed to Governor Katie Hobbs’ desk for potential approval. You might also like: Arizona governor signs bill to create Bitcoin and digital assets reserve fund What is HB 2324? HB 2324 proposes the creation of a “Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund” to manage assets seized through criminal forfeiture. It updates Arizona’s existing forfeiture laws to formally include digital assets such as cryptocurrencies, expanding legal definitions to cover virtual currencies and other digital-only items with economic value. The bill outlines new procedures for law enforcement agencies to seize, access, and store digital assets, including requirements to use secure, state-approved digital wallets. Under the proposed allocation system, the first $300,000 worth of forfeited digital assets would be directed to the Attorney General’s office. Any remaining value would be split, 50% to the Attorney General, 25% to the state’s general fund, and 25% to the newly established reserve fund. HB 2324 also clarifies regulations governing property forfeiture by adding protections for innocent owners and establishing limits on when other property types, such as vehicles, may be seized. Supporters of the bill argue the changes are needed to keep pace with the growing role of digital assets in criminal investigations and economic activity. HB 2324 differs significantly from House Bill 2749, which Governor Hobbs signed into law on the same day the former was initially rejected. HB 2749 allows the state to claim digital assets that have remained unclaimed for at least three years. These assets must be transferred to the Arizona Department of Revenue in their original digital form. Unlike HB 2324, HB 2749 does not deal with criminal forfeiture or law enforcement procedures. Instead, it establishes a regulatory process for identifying and managing abandoned assets, along with a reserve fund that may receive staking rewards or airdrops. Importantly, HB 2749 prohibits the use of taxpayer money, focusing only on assets already in state possession due to abandonment. Both bills involve the creation of a “Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund,” but the funding mechanisms and purposes differ. HB 2749’s fund is sourced from unclaimed property and is subject to legislative appropriation, while HB 2324’s version is tied to seized assets from criminal proceedings. Arizona is not the only state taking steps toward integrating digital assets into public finance. Earlier this year, New Hampshire passed House Bill 302, becoming the first U.S. state to authorize its treasurer to invest up to 10% of public funds in Bitcoin and other qualifying digital assets with a market cap of over $500 billion.

While Bitcoin (BTC) remains the market’s foundation, attention is quickly shifting to high-upside altcoins backed by strong fundamentals and vibrant community support. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the dark horse of the cycle, capturing the interest of analysts and traders who see it as a potential market leader before year-end. Powerhouse Performance: MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Early Investment Surge MAGACOIN FINANCE is now positioned as a front-runner for exponential growth, emerging as a powerhouse in the altcoin presale market. The presale’s exclusivity, combined with a 100% token bonus for larger buyers using PATRIOTS100X, is creating a surge in demand. The project’s transparent token distribution and capped supply are central to its appeal. Industry leaders anticipate strong post-listing performance and sustained investor interest. Highlights of the project: Contract audited by HashEx Transparent and capped tokenomics Potential major CEX listing and bullish updates on the horizon For those seeking a strategic entry with real fundamentals and viral momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a must-watch for 2025 . Solana (SOL): Bullish Structure and Institutional Support While Solana continues to impress with robust institutional support and a price hovering near $158–$165, many traders are now diversifying into MAGACOINFINANCE, recognizing its unique blend of scarcity, transparency, and community energy as the next evolution in high-growth altcoins. As SOL eyes a breakout above $165, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly seen as a parallel opportunity for outsized returns. Toncoin (TON): Breakout and Bullish Reversal Toncoin’s technical breakout above $3.20 has caught the attention of momentum traders, but the smart investors’ interest is around MAGACOINFINANCE’s ability to capture early-stage hype and convert it into sustained growth. As TON continues its bullish reversal, savvy investors are hedging with MAGACOIN FINANCE for asymmetric upside. Optimism (OP): Uptrend and Price Forecasts Optimism’s strong weekly gains and Layer-2 leadership keep it in the spotlight, yet many OP holders are rotating profits into MAGACOINFINANCE. The project’s audited smart contracts and transparent tokenomics offer a rare combination of security and upside, making it a compelling alternative for those seeking the next big winner. Sei (SEI): Strong Uptrend and Bullish Sentiment Sei’s uptrend and expanding ecosystem are drawing attention, but MAGACOINFINANCE’s viral community and real on-chain growth are setting a new standard for early-stage success. As SEI targets $1.08, the parallel surge in MAGACOIN FINANCE participation underscores growing market conviction in its breakout thesis. Final Thoughts With Solana, Toncoin, Optimism, and Sei all making headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as the dark horse that could outpace the entire market in 2025. Its unmatched fundamentals, security, and momentum make it a top pick for bold investors this year.

This latest surge came just after the U.S. Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill aiming to create a national framework for regulating stablecoins like USDC, which Circle issues. President Trump publicly supported the bill, calling on the House to pass it swiftly. Market reaction was swift too: Coinbase stock jumped 16% , reflecting broader investor optimism around U.S.-regulated digital assets. Circle’s USDC is the second-largest USD stablecoin globally, holding a $61.4 billion market cap and accounting for 25% of all stablecoins in circulation. As banks and tech giants explore the stablecoin space, CRCL’s rise could also set the stage for upcoming IPOs from firms like Kraken and Gemini. Three key takeaways: Circle stock (CRCL) is up over 530% since its $31 IPO , now nearing $200. The GENIUS Act boosts market confidence , with strong political and investor backing.

The latest government data , published Friday, showed that core CPI rose 3.7% year-on-year in May, outpacing forecasts of 3.6% and speeding up from April’s 3.5%. Inflation has now gone over the BOJ’s 2% target for more than three straight years. That makes it harder for the central bank to delay its next move, even with Donald Trump’s trade threats clouding the economic outlook. This jump in prices isn’t being driven by fuel or fresh vegetables, it is all about food that people actually eat every day. Prices for essentials like rice have doubled since May 2024. A rice ball now costs nearly 20% more, and a simple bar of chocolate is up 27%, based on the official figures. And it doesn’t stop at goods. Inflation in services—like restaurants, haircuts, and healthcare—also ticked up to 1.4% from April’s 1.3%, showing that businesses are slowly pushing more of their labor costs onto customers. BOJ faces tariff risk as prices rise across the board The situation is messy. The BOJ already ended its huge stimulus program last year and raised short-term rates to 0.5% in January because it believed Japan was close to sustainably hitting the 2% inflation target. But now things have changed. Global risks are back on the table. Trump is back in the White House, and his renewed tariff agenda is making Japan’s export-heavy economy look fragile again. That’s why the BOJ is holding off … for now. Ryosuke Katagi, market economist at Mizuho Securities, said the central bank is being cautious: “Given heightened uncertainty over US tariff policy, the BOJ is taking a wait-and-see approach to scrutinize developments in bilateral trade talks. When looking just at price moves, conditions for additional rate hikes will likely stay in place throughout 2025.” That’s supported by a different inflation measure, one that cuts out fuel and fresh food, which climbed 3.3% in May compared to 3.0% in April. That’s the fastest increase since January 2024, when it hit 3.5%. The BOJ watches that specific number closely, since it gives a better sense of whether inflation is being driven by strong demand or just external costs. The same pattern is showing up in Tokyo. Analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the capital’s core inflation to slow to 3.3% in June, down from 3.6% in May. Tokyo’s numbers tend to be early signals for the whole country, but the drop isn’t big enough to calm the central bank. Especially not with non-fresh food prices up 7.7% from a year earlier, higher than April’s 7.0%. BOJ split on timing while economists warn of price spiral Inside the central bank, the debate is heating up. Minutes from the BOJ’s April 30–May 1 meeting showed a divided board. Some members are worried inflation will keep climbing past projections. The idea of a wage-price spiral is also being taken seriously now. A research paper published by the bank said that raising rates slowly, while raw materials stay expensive, could trigger an upward loop between wages and consumer prices. Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, said, “Inflation is overshooting expectations. The rise in food costs is particularly big and re-accelerating this year.” He also added that “firms seem keen to raise prices further.” Yoshiki expects core inflation to go below 3% in August and possibly under 2% by early 2026, but warned the slowdown might be weaker than expected. The BOJ still claims that cost-push pressure will ease later this year, and with expected wage growth, they hope to see more domestic consumption. That’s the logic they’re using to avoid another hike for now. They want inflation to hit 2% because of demand, not just because food prices are out of control. Still, patience is running out. A Reuters poll of economists found that a slight majority expect the next 25-basis-point rate hike to happen in early 2026. But with this latest CPI report, that timeline could easily get pulled forward—especially if inflation keeps jumping and Trump’s tariff agenda starts to damage exports even more.

In a new Bloomberg interview, Sacks says the passing of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) in the U.S. Senate and the potential signing of the piece of legislation into law offers “regulatory clarity and stability” for the stablecoin crypto sector. According to Sacks, the GENIUS Act could trigger massive demand for US government debt from various parts of the world. “… the [stablecoin] float is expected to grow from, call it, roughly $250 billion to trillions of dollars. And that would create more demand for the US dollar internationally. I think you could see other economies start to dollarize from the bottom up as their citizens would prefer to use US digital dollars as opposed to whatever fiat currency they’re using. And that would create potentially trillions of dollars of new demand for US treasuries.” The GENIUS Act will also spur innovation in the payments industry, according to the White House advisor. “And I think that the bill will provide the framework that will give confidence to a lot of traditional financial players to enter the space. And so I think you’re going to see new stablecoin products. And I think you will also see stablecoins being used as payments. I think this is one of the really exciting things about the bill, is that blockchain infrastructure will be used as a new kind of dollar-based payment system, that’s faster, more efficient, smoother. It’s a payment system of the future.” ?

In 2026, it will range between $0.5404 and $0.6531, with an average price of $0.5558. In 2030, it will range between $2.21 and $2.73, with an average price of $2.29. Algorand’s capabilities make it an interesting prospect for investors and developers interested in smart contracts and blockchain interoperability. A 2019 video featured Gary Gensler, former Securities and Exchange Commission chair, referring to Algorand as a great technology and using it as an example when discussing the decentralization of cryptocurrencies. Will ALGO go up? Can it reach $10? Where will ALGO be in 5 years? We explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction.

Per our technical indicators, ALGO is bearish, with the fear and greed index showing a greed sentiment among investors. Data analysis shows that activity on decentralized finance applications has stagnated, with the charts showing that it will drop further in the coming days. Recent news: Algorand foundation- TVL is not correlated with price performance Algorand researchers are attempting to answer the question of whether TVL could predict the performance of a crypto, and after analyzing over 300 cryptocurrencies from 2023 to 2024, they did not find any outperformance, regardless of how the data was adjusted for known issue. The study will be published on June 10. Why is ALGO down? ALGO is dropping from previous highs set in the last quarter of 2024, The drop could be attributed to the crypto market’s correction, which saw Bitcoin drop below $99,000. Will ALGO reach $1? Per our Algorand price forecast, ALGO will break above $1 in the period ending in 2028. Can Algorand reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $10 in the period ending in 2031. Can Algorand reach $20? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $20 in the period ending in 2031. Can ALGO reach 100 dollars? At $100, Algorand’s market capitalization has to rise above $700 billion from the current $1.2 billion. In comparison, Ethereum’s market capitalization is at $400 billion. Per our price prediction, Algorand is highly unlikely to reach $100. Is there a future for Algorand? Like most mega-altcoins, Algorand is trading at its lowest level this year. A break below 30 RSI will be crucial to sending it to previous highs. Looking ahead, ALGO will register new all-time highs in the coming years. What will Algorand be worth in 2025?

Source: CoinStats Algorand held its token sale in June 2019 at $2.40 each. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to CoinMarketCap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from its ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.64 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. So, in 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.30 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 below the $0.40 mark in January, $0.35 in February, $0.21 in March, and $0.20 in May and June.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-20 07:15:00

Le Monde reported Thursday that his clearance, which takes effect on July 10, marks the second time Durov has been allowed temporary relief from a strict judicial supervision order following his arrest in Aug. 2024. The decision comes after French authorities denied a similar request in May when Durov had planned to speak at the Oslo Freedom Forum. Unable to attend in person, he delivered his keynote speech remotely. Pavel Durov Granted Looser Court Restrictions in France Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov has been allowed to temporarily leave France starting July 10 — for up to 14 days — to visit Dubai, where his family lives and Telegram’s offices are based. Durov told the court that his… pic.twitter.com/4agQVpqwPJ — NEXTA (@nexta_tv) June 19, 2025 The Human Rights Foundation, which hosts the forum, had criticised the travel restriction, while supporters saw it as a broader signal of pressure on tech entrepreneurs facing legal scrutiny. Telegram Founder’s Arrest Sparks Global Debate on Digital Accountability Durov’s legal battle began last August, when he was arrested at Le Bourget Airport near Paris . He was later indicted on charges tied to a wider French investigation into Telegram’s alleged role in facilitating criminal activity. Authorities argue that the app’s lack of content moderation, combined with its support for encrypted communication, disposable phone numbers and crypto payments, has created a fertile ground for illicit activity. Released on a €5m ($5.75m) bail, Durov remains under judicial supervision. He must report to police twice a week and get prior approval to leave France. Although limited, the temporary approval to travel to Dubai is seen as a rare concession. The case continues to raise difficult questions about platform accountability, user privacy and free expression. Telegram Tightens Moderation as Legal Pressures Mount on Encrypted Platforms The case has attracted global attention from privacy advocates and the tech industry. Notably, figures like Edward Snowden and Elon Musk have criticised French authorities, calling the move an overreach. Since Durov’s arrest, Telegram has changed how it handles illegal content. As a result, the platform now warns users about the risks of sharing prohibited material. If they do, their IP addresses and phone numbers could be passed to authorities. This marks a big shift from Telegram’s earlier, more privacy-focused approach. Meanwhile, the episode has reignited interest in The Open Network , a blockchain project initially launched by Telegram under Durov’s leadership. Although TON was abandoned in 2020 due to pressure from the US SEC, it continues to operate as a separate ecosystem backed by the crypto community. Supporters now see Durov’s legal battle as a broader test for decentralized platforms. They are watching closely to see how far developers can be held responsible for how their technologies are used.

The move comes ahead of the region’s Stablecoin Ordinance legalization. In an exclusive interview with China Business Network, Group President of Animoca Brands Evan Auyang stated that the web3 has entered into a joint venture with Hong Kong’s Standard Chartered Bank and Hong Kong Telecom in anticipation for the region’s new Stablecoin Ordinance coming into effect. According to Auyang, the purpose of the joint venture is to open the door for Animoca Brands to pursue a stablecoin issuer license and set up an established web3-based ecosystem for users to utilize its native stablecoin. “We currently have a joint venture company through which we intend to apply for a license to issue stablecoins . The specific details will be announced at a later time,” said Auyang in his statement. The firm aims to mobilize customers into web3 through application scenarios at the same time. In order to establish an ecosystem that can drive customers to shift from web2 to web3 would require collaboration with leading companies in different industries, such as Standard Chartered and Telecom.

Animoca Brands plans to use HKD-pegged stablecoin for three purposes: to carry out transactions within the firm’s gaming and NFT ecosystems, cross-border trade settlements and to popularize HKD-backed stablecoins on an international scale. After the United States passed the GENIUS Act with the purpose of advancing its stablecoin market, Hong Kong industry players like Animoca Brands and JD.com have been preparing themselves for the issuance of a Hong Kong dollar-pegged stablecoin. The move is aimed at carving a place in the market for Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoins in an effort to combat U.S. stablecoin dominance. On June 6, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government announced that it will start implementing its stablecoin regulation, the Stablecoin Ordinance in August 2025. The new law would allow for companies to register for a license to issued stablecoins pegged to the Hong Kong dollar.

Key Takeaways: South Korea’s financial regulator has submitted a roadmap to approve spot crypto ETFs. The plan reflects President Lee’s push to modernize digital asset regulation. The FSC’s shift marks a break from its previous stance that crypto ETFs posed financial risks. The move signals a possible shift in regulatory posture under President Lee Jae Myung, who campaigned on easing restrictions around digital assets. The roadmap proposes implementation measures for spot crypto ETFs in the second half of 2025 and marks a significant departure from the FSC’s long-standing position that such products pose financial stability risks. South Korea’s FSC Previously Blocked Crypto ETFs Over Volatility Concerns Until now, the FSC had barred crypto ETFs from being issued or traded in South Korea, citing concerns over volatility and the suitability of cryptocurrencies as base assets. The change aligns with President Lee’s pledge to modernize South Korea’s financial landscape and offer more opportunities for younger investors to build wealth through regulated digital asset exposure. The roadmap also reportedly includes plans to introduce regulatory frameworks for Korean won-based stablecoins by late 2025. President Lee previously emphasized the importance of developing a domestic stablecoin market to reduce capital flight and retain liquidity within South Korea’s economy. Following the media coverage, the FSC issued a statement clarifying that the reported proposals are not finalized.

Wild this happened the 2nd day I am in South Korea. pic.twitter.com/NkXfe0AaIy — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) June 3, 2025 The commission emphasized that the roadmap remains under review, and details may change as consultations continue. Even before the latest filing, the FSC had been gradually opening the door to institutional crypto involvement. Earlier this year, it began processing phased approvals for institutional investors to gain limited access to the digital asset market. Beyond crypto, the FSC is also considering broader reforms, including a proposal to double trading hours at Korea Exchange, extending them from 6.5 to 12 hours daily. South Korea is home to one of the most active retail crypto markets globally. By the end of 2024, local investors held approximately 104 trillion won (about $75.7 billion) in digital assets, according to FSC data. South Korea’s Ruling Party Proposes Stablecoin Bill South Korea’s Democratic Party has introduced a bill to legalize stablecoin issuance by domestic firms, marking the first major crypto policy under newly elected President Lee Jae-myung. The proposal sparked a sharp rally in crypto-related stocks, with KakaoPay jumping 18% as investors welcomed the government’s apparent commitment to digital asset innovation. The bill, part of the broader Digital Asset Basic Act, would allow stablecoins backed by reserves and issued by firms with a minimum capital of 500 million won. It also calls for the creation of a Presidential Digital Asset Committee and mandates regulatory oversight by the Financial Services Commission through an approval and reporting process. Despite growing political momentum, the initiative faces resistance from the Bank of Korea. Governor Rhee Chang-yong has warned that stablecoins issued by non-bank entities could interfere with monetary policy and argues that the central bank should control any development of a won-based digital currency.

It is rightly said that history shows a rhythm in market behavior, while many claim “this cycle is different,” the data says otherwise. From BTC dominance and institutional inflows to the Altcoin Season Index hitting rock bottom, all signs point to a forthcoming shift in liquidity. In this analysis I take you through crypto analyst Tracer’s thesis on altseason. Bitcoin Is Soaring, But Alts Are Sleeping? It has been disappointing to the marketers that, despite the total market cap sitting at $3.24 trillion, altcoins are still significantly underperforming relative to Bitcoin. Data reveals that most alts remain down 80–90% from their all-time highs. This is all while BTC continues breaking new streaks. The analyst highlights that this discrepancy isn’t new, as in past cycles, altseason only kicked off after Bitcoin concreted its top. The Altcoin Season Index currently sits at 21/100, deeply into “Bitcoin Season” territory. Historically, these levels have marked the start to capital rotation from BTC into alts once Bitcoin shows signs of topping out. Institutions Are Still Going All-In on Bitcoin? Institutional behavior has tilted heavily toward Bitcoin. From Strategy’s billion-dollar buys to publicly traded firms and sovereign institutions building BTC treasuries. Coming to the M2 global money supply, a key liquidity driver, shows a strong correlation with BTC, especially with a 76-day offset. As M2 expands, Bitcoin absorbs the initial liquidity. But when this flow saturates, past actions suggest altcoins often catch the spillover, triggering the true altseason. Key Market Signals Flashing the Setup The following market indicators are pointing to a classic pre-altseason setup: Bitcoin Dominance: Currently hovering at record highs. Past patterns show that when BTC.D drops below 55% , it’s a clear sign that capital is rotating into alts. Trading Volume Divergence: BTC’s volumes have recently dipped compared to previous bull cycles from 2016 and 2021, and alt volumes remain sluggish. A simultaneous volume spike in alts, along with a BTC.D drop, will be a major trigger. Fear & Greed Index: Sitting neutral at 48 , indicating indecision, a common trait to market transitions. Also worth noting is the geopolitical tension with Iran, which has temporarily frozen liquidity. However, such geopolitical dips tend to resolve swiftly and provide golden buying opportunities. Keen on BTC’s future? Read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! FAQs When will the altcoin season start?

As ETH flirts with key resistance near $2,547, a $127m whale buy revives bullish hopes, while presale stars like Pepeto and Wall Street Ponke hint at what’s next in altcoin action. Table of Contents ETH technical outlook: $2,800 or $2,400? Blockchain bridges: Real use across chains Pepeto exchange preview + 278% APY staking rewards Another one to watch: Wall Street Ponke Ethereum ( ETH ) is trading near $2,547 at press time, and big investors are starting to move. A whale just bought over $127 million worth of ETH, 48,825 coins, at an average price of $2,605. This buy came during a price dip, showing real belief in Ethereum’s future. This isn’t just random. The same whale reportedly made $30 million in profit from past Ethereum trades. While tensions in the Middle East and over 242,000 expiring ETH options shook the market, this bold move helped bring back confidence. With a put-call ratio of 1.20 and the pain point set around $2,700, analysts are watching closely. ETH technical outlook: $2,800 or $2,400? Ethereum is moving between two important price levels : Bullish scenario: • Entry: Close above 38.2% Fib ($2,568) and 50 EMA • Stop-loss: Below $2,500 • Targets: $2,607 and $2,647 Bearish scenario: • Entry: Drop below $2,518 • Stop-loss: Above $2,540 • Targets: $2,440 and $2,300 Blockchain bridges: Real use across chains Bridges in blockchain let users move tokens and data between different networks. Think of it like sending ETH across to a BTC chain. Key bridge features: • Smooth token transfers across chains • Options for centralized or decentralized bridges • Makes crypto easier for everyone This is where Pepeto shines.

According to a June 19 article by CryptoQuant’s head of research Julio Moreno, the pace of Bitcoin ( BTC ) accumulation has notably slowed over the past few weeks following its rise toward an all-time high near $112,000 in May. Apparent demand growth has dropped to 118,000 BTC over the past 30 days, almost half of the 228,000 BTC growth observed in late May. Moreno also noted that whales and U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds have cut their Bitcoin purchases by over 50%, while short-term holders have shed 800,000 BTC since May 27, a sign that new investor participation is waning. Following Bitcoin’s failure to hold above $110,000, futures data shows a tactical shift as traders locked in profits and started new short positions. As Bitcoin fell toward the $105,000 range, there was a rise in short interest, according to CryptoQuant’s Traders’ Behavior Dominance metric. You might also like: Arizona reconsiders Bitcoin reserve plan using forfeited digital assets Darkfost, another CryptoQuant analyst, pointed out that the true problem is stagnating demand, even though realized profits are still small, less than $1 billion, and do not yet indicate a market peak. The current market is balanced, with no major profit-taking or panic selling, but also lacking the strong demand that typically fuels the next leg higher. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at about $104,707, down 6.5% from its peak of $111,814 on May 22 and nearly flat for the day. The price has fluctuated between $103,645 and $108,771 over the last week. On the daily chart, Bitcoin is trading just below the 20-day Bollinger Band midline, which is at $105,854, and faces resistance around the $108,000 zone. The Bollinger Bands are slightly narrowing, indicating decreasing volatility, while the relative strength index is at 47.75, indicating neutral momentum. Bitcoin price analysis. Credit: crypto.news Since the May high, the price has been in a short-term downward trend and has not been able to recover the upper range of the consolidation zone. Should demand weaken further, Bitcoin may test the $101,000 support, with the $92,000 level, marked by CryptoQuant’s Traders’ On-chain Realized Price, acting as the next major cushion. A breakout above $108,000 on high volume, which might re-target the $111,814 high, is necessary for a bullish scenario. On the other hand, a decline below $101,000 might indicate the start of more significant retracements.

Its holdings are now second only to those of the Ethereum Foundation. SharpLink was able to fund this acquisition partly using $79 million that it raised in May 2025. The company will use most of its ATM proceeds to grow its Ethereum (ETH) holdings, which have already yielded around 11.8% growth in ETH per share since the start of June 2025. The company is actively staking over 95% of its holdings, which contributes to the security of ETH while generating yield for the company. According to the CEO, the purchase is a strategic move that marks a major move towards institutional adoption of crypto. What This Means For Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Before the bold move by SharpLink, crypto purchases had been piecemeal for most mainstream firms. They have limited their exposure to the sector, only purchasing what they can afford to lose. This bold move could signal changing attitudes towards the crypto sector. For instance, it could inspire institutional investors to start taking a closer look at presales. So far, one of the presales that is receiving massive attention from the crypto sector is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is being discussed in crypto circles, especially on Telegram, for its potential to deliver life-changing returns for its holders. MUTM Token Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token presale is currently in the fifth phase, where tokens are selling for $0.03 each. In the current phase, the tokens are selling for a 50% discount to the planned listing price of $0.06. So far, over $10.8 million worth of MUTM tokens have been sold to around 12,200 buyers. The participation pace has recently picked up speed, with 40% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 of the presale already sold, barely two weeks after they launched. A major reason for this fast pace is the expected increase in the presale price by 16.67% in the upcoming phase 6 to $0.035 per token. Another major source of motivation is the ongoing $100,000 giveaway . In this giveaway, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will give ten lucky participants in the presale $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. To qualify for this giveaway, you only need to purchase $50 worth of MUTM tokens in the ongoing presale. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Has To Offer The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project offers users access to a decentralized, non-custodial lending protocol where they can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, they can deposit their assets in a pool in exchange for interest payments. The interest rate they receive on their assets is based on the pool utilization rate. As the number of borrowers taking assets from a pool rises, so does the utilization rate. That causes the interest rate to rise, encouraging borrowers to repay loans to avoid the higher rates. At the same time, it attracts more lenders looking to benefit from the increased yields. Over time, this lowers the interest rate, ensuring optimal capital efficiency. Lenders also get access to the full liquidity of their assets via mtTokens. When a lender deposits $2,300 worth of BNB in a pool, for instance, they get mtBNB tokens in return on a 1:1 ratio. These tokens represent the value of their deposit plus any interest accrued. Consequently, they provide a convenient means for holders to actively track their deposits in a pool. At the same time, holders do not need to actively claim or compound their gains. Since mtTokens are based on the ERC20 token standard, they can be actively traded on any exchange that accepts the standard. This allows holders to actively benefit from market opportunities in real time, while still earning interest on their deposits. To make the benefits of the Mutuum Finance protocol accessible to a wider audience, Mutuum Finance plans to expand across multiple blockchain networks. Protocol Safeguards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to offer the highest level of protection for lenders’ deposits. In line with this, all loans taken from the pools will be overcollateralized. Additionally, it will use strict parameters, such as a liquidation threshold and the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, to monitor active loan positions. If a loan falls outside of the set parameters, it will be eligible for partial or full liquidation. The liquidators will step in and purchase the debt at a discount, helping to stabilize the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a CertiK-audited project that could soon attract the attention of institutional investors. With the presale picking up speed, the current price of $0.03 per token could represent your best opportunity to ride the coming altcoin wave. Do not be left out of this massive crypto market opportunity that could deliver gains of 20x or more.

This failure to perform has put intense bearish pressure on the altcoin market as a whole, and the resulting price action has triggered what is seemingly a bear market for altcoins. Even now, the Ethereum price has not shown any signs of a bullish recovery, with expectations remaining bleak at this level, and analysts predicting further crashes. Why The Ethereum Price Is Headed Below $2,000 Crypto analyst Maddox Metrics has given the short and long-term outlook for the Ethereum price, and it seems the current market decline is nowhere near its end. In the short term, Maddox expects the Ethereum price to continue to decline and, in fact, fall below some major support levels. Related Reading: XRP Addresses Holding 1M Coins Reach 12-Year High As Experts Predict Move Above $4 As the crypto analyst explains, investors are already expecting the ETH price to actually fall lower toward the $1,900 target. And as shown in the analyst’s chart, this would actually be the second wave of the 5-wave count as Ethereum moves into its long-term potential. While there has been a lot of buying, especially among institutional investors and ETF issuers, the Ethereum price continues to trend low. The analyst attributes this to the rising war tensions in the Middle East, as fears of World War 3 grow more intense. At this level, the analyst cautions investors to look toward a more patient strategy, saying that “Money is made in the sitting, weathering volatility, not flipping in and out of trades on every bit of news and price movement.” Thus, it is better to hold positions until the market finds its stable point. ETH Still Bullish In The Long-Term Despite the wave pattern pointing to a crash below $2,000 in the short term, the analyst says the long-term outlook for the Ethereum price remains bullish. The current decline, which is a Wave 2 retracement, the analyst explains, marked the end of a motif wave at the $2,700 resistance. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Price Set To Repeat History As 2017 Playbook Returns? Why This Time Could Be Bigger This suggests that once the current wave ends, there is the next wave, which is the bullish Wave 3. Once this is underway, the analyst’s chart shows a possibility of this wave carrying through to a new all-time high just under $5,000. The 4th wave is naturally bearish and will trigger a crash, while the 5th and final wave will send the Ethereum price to $7,000. The timeline for this to happen, as shown in the chart, will be through the year 2025 and into the early months of 2026.

With traders rotating out of slow movers and into more aggressively positioned projects, MAGACOINFINANCE is beginning to emerge as a serious target for those chasing the next cycle’s big opportunity. Meanwhile, Polygon, Ethereum, Aptos, and Injective remain in the mix — each navigating different stages of growth and investor attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Quiet Build Behind the Surge While the broader market has been following Bitcoin and Solana’s strength, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quietly entered a new phase of acceleration. Early-stage investors are recognizing the timing — not just because of the capped 170 billion supply or staking feature, but because of how the community is positioning itself. The narrative isn’t being driven by influencers or marketing stunts — it’s being built on visible accumulation, low turnover, and commitment from long-term participants. What separates MAGACOIN FINANCE in this cycle is the structure beneath the momentum. The project has an audited codebase, transparent tokenomics, and no centralized gatekeeping. Those ingredients — paired with the bonus incentive currently live under PATRIOTS100X — are creating a unique environment where calculated traders feel confident stepping in early. This isn’t reactionary hype; it’s coordinated positioning with a clear view toward the next big price wave. Polygon (MATIC) Searches for a Fresh Catalyst Polygon (MATIC) has faced cooling sentiment lately as traders await major upgrades or breakout announcements. While it maintains strong fundamentals and enterprise partnerships, its on-chain activity has plateaued. The lack of volatility has prompted short-term capital to look elsewhere, with many watching to see whether upcoming technical improvements can rekindle momentum. Ethereum (ETH) Holds Strong Despite Slower Gains Ethereum (ETH) continues to attract institutional interest, particularly around ETF speculation and treasury allocations. Yet its price has remained relatively range-bound, with macroeconomic pressure and Bitcoin’s dominance slowing ETH’s independent movement. Investors remain bullish long term, but short-term focus is drifting toward smaller-cap assets offering stronger upside potential in the near term. Aptos (APT) Benefits from Ecosystem Growth Aptos (APT) is quietly climbing in rankings, thanks to increasing developer activity and network engagement. It ranks high in daily active addresses, suggesting expanding adoption. Still, its price movement has been less explosive than traders hoped for, leading some to reallocate capital toward altcoins offering clearer staking rewards or high-speed token cycles. Injective (INJ) Retains DeFi Value But Loses Market Heat Injective (INJ) remains an efficient protocol with strong integration across decentralized finance tools. However, its recent price action hasn’t kept pace with more aggressively moving altcoins. Traders appreciate INJ’s fundamentals but are increasingly reserving their short-term positions for assets with stronger retail momentum and incentive mechanics. Final Thoughts While Polygon, Ethereum, Aptos, and Injective each continue to shape the Layer 1 and DeFi narratives, it’s MAGACOINFINANCE that is quietly taking advantage of the current market setup. Backed by strong internal mechanics and the ripple effects of larger market rallies, it’s quickly being viewed as a smart early entry for those tracking the next breakout story.

The debt has surged as policymakers increased government spending and implemented stimulus measures. Head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities, Gennadiy Goldberg, said that the crux of the $37 trillion problem is that no one knows at what level the debt becomes unsustainable. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged that the U.S. government has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. U.S. spending bill threatens to increase national debt The U.S. national debt just passed $37 trillion dollars. This is unsustainable. Tick, tock. pic.twitter.com/KYIwaZaQXJ — Natalie F Danelishen (@Chesschick01) June 20, 2025 Goldberg agrees with Bessent’s argument but states that the U.S. also does not tax much compared to both the size of the country’s GDP and government outlays. He believes that either taxes have to go up, spending has to come down, or some combination of the two, but warned that it’s very complicated to figure out. The White House said on June 7 that the GOP tax bill significantly improves the country’s fiscal trajectory by including $1.7 trillion in mandatory savings, while Trump’s tax cuts will spur economic growth. Democrats have pointed to analyses showing the bill’s tax cuts will benefit wealthier Americans far more than low- and middle-income workers while also adding to the national debt. “No single piece of legislation in my time here in Congress will do more to add to the national debt than this one.” – Brendan Boyle , U.S. Representative for Philadelphia. Economists at Goldman Sachs said Tuesday the spending bill passed by House Republicans, combined with increased tariff revenue, will slightly lower the budget deficit when excluding interest payments. Goldman’s Manuel Abecasis, David Mericle, and Alec Philips believe that, coupled with borrowing costs, the bill leaves the total deficit’s course essentially unchanged. According to the Goldman team, higher real interest rates have put U.S. debt and interest expense as a share of GDP on much steeper trajectories than appeared in previous cycles. The team argued that the scale of the debt going forward depends greatly on how interest rates move over the next couple of decades. The economists highlighted that the $37 trillion accounts for more than 120% of the U.S. GDP, and that the Treasury Department borrows more just to meet the rising cost of servicing it. They also said the U.S. pays more in interest on its debt than it spends on Medicare and defense. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the version of the GOP spending bill passed by the House would increase deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade. The White House and some Republican lawmakers argue that the projection should not include the cost of extending Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire this year without the bill. Soaring interest payments push national debt past $37T According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data, the U.S. spent $1.1 trillion in interest on its debt in 2024, almost double the amount it was paying five years ago. Data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute also shows that the U.S. spends more on interest payments than on defense. An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office on June 5 revealed that those costs could surge even more under the Republican tax and spending bill now being considered in the Senate. The nonpartisan agency projected that the version of the tax legislation passed by the White House last month would increase the federal deficit by $2.4 trillion over the next decade. CBO forecasts that the surge would require the government to raise additional debt, resulting in additional interest payments of about $550 billion over the next decade. The nonpartisan think tank also estimates that by 2035, interest on the nation’s debt could reach $1.8 trillion. Chris Edwards, an expert on federal tax at the Cato Institute, said interest costs are now bigger than defense spending. He believes that the increasing federal costs will crowd out all the other priorities in the federal budget that policymakers want to spend on. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data, federal interest payments as a share of the nation’s gross domestic product stood at 3% last year. The nonpartisan Peter G. Peterson Foundation also estimates that if the current trend holds, that could rise to 4.15% of GDP by 2035. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on June 5 that Congress is spending “America into bankruptcy,” pointing to data showing that interest payments have risen from $416 billion in 2014 to more than $1 trillion in 2024. Moody’s Ratings also revealed that persistent and large fiscal deficits will increase the government’s debt and interest burden.

While BTC has been moving within a narrow range in recent days, CryptoQuant said that the risk of a very serious downside for Bitcoin continues. Accordingly, CryptoQuant analysts said that Bitcoin could drop to $92,000 if demand continues to decline. At this point, CryptoQuant analysts said on June 19 that spot Bitcoin ETF inflows have fallen by more than 60% since April. Analysts stated that in addition to the decrease in ETF inflows, whale accumulation has also decreased by half, and that this situation indicates a bearish trend for BTC. According to the data, short-term investors have also sold around 800,000 BTC since the end of May. As a result, all these indicators suggest that demand for Bitcoin is decreasing, as CryptoQuant’s demand momentum indicator has also dropped to negative 2 million BTC, making it its lowest level ever. At this point, CryptoQuant warned that if demand continues to fall, BTC could fall to $92,000, or even $81,000 if the situation worsens. *This is not investment advice.

Ripple (XRP) XRP experienced another week with flat price action, closing with a modest 1% gain. This comes after buyers failed to break the $2.3 resistance, which continues to challenge any potential uptrend. In the past month, the volume has also been declining, which eroded the momentum needed to challenge the key resistance. Should it fall further, then XRP may revisit the support at $2, where buyers showed interest in the past. Looking ahead, this cryptocurrency has been moving sideways since May without any clear signal that it will break its current market structure. For this reason, XRP is likely to remain around $2 in the short to medium term. Chart by TradingView Cardano (ADA) ADA lost its support at $0.64 this week and fell by 6%. This level will now act as a key resistance, and it may take quite a while until it is reclaimed, considering that the momentum is bearish. With that key level lost, this cryptocurrency has to find new support with good candidates at $0.55 and $0.5. This downtrend is likely to return ADA to price levels last seen in April when it briefly visited $0.51. Looking ahead, Cardano is in a difficult spot, being unable to sustain an uptrend. Since it peaked at $1.3 in late 2024, the price has been making lower highs that fueled the current bearish sentiment. Until this changes, a recovery appears unlikely. Chart by TradingView Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin tried to break the resistance at $692 in late May, but sellers rejected its attempt. This pushed the asset into a correction that continued this week as well, when it closed with a 1% loss. While this is not too concerning, the price remains in a downtrend since late May and could revisit the support at $630 and $600. It is critical for BNB to stay above $600 if it wants to retain a bullish bias on higher timeframes. With the overall market undecided, BNB could end up ranging above $600. While volume remains low, buyers could show up as soon as the price approaches $600 to push it higher again. Chart by TradingView Solana (SOL) The sentiment around Solana is deteriorating. This is made worse by its price, which is found in a downtrend after it was rejected at the $186 resistance. While the price is at similar levels to last week, the recent fall under $150 puts sellers on the offensive again. If this downtrend continues, then bears have a good shot at pushing SOL towards $130 next. If the bearish sentiment increases, then sellers have a good shot at revisiting $118 as well. Without buyers, Solana is found in a difficult position considering its tokenomics, which are inflationary. Hopefully, buying interests resumes once the price approaches $130, which would be a good candidate for a relief bounce. Chart by TradingView Hype (HYPE) The hype around HYPE appears to have vanished this week after the price broke below its uptrend at around $39. At the time of this post, the price is down by 10% this week and does not show any signs of stopping. This correction is likely to be quite significant considering the prolonged uptrend. Compared to its all-time high at $46, HYPE has now slumped by over 20% and is currently around $35. If the price continues to fall, then good support is found at $34 and $30. Looking ahead, HYPE retains a very strong fundamental basis to make new highs after this correction is over. Until then, it’s best to wait for the price to find a bottom somewhere around $30 or even lower, around $28.

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino announced today that the company is preparing to launch PearPass, a fully local, open-source password manager built without reliance on cloud infrastructure. “The cloud has failed us. Again,” Ardoino said on X, referencing a newly discovered data breach exposing 16 billion login credentials reported yesterday. PearPass aims to address the growing distrust in centralized data storage by ensuring that all user credentials are stored only on users’ devices, eliminating any external point of failure or surveillance. “Just you — and your keys, stored securely on your devices,” wrote Ardoino. You might also like: Cryptocurrency: How to Avoid a Data Breach Ardoino’s announcement follows the exposure of what appears to be the largest data breach ever confirmed. According to a Cybernews investigation , 16 billion records have been uncovered in multiple massive datasets linked to infostealer malware . These logs include login credentials for virtually every major online platform, including Apple, Facebook, Google, GitHub, Telegram, and even government services. Researchers warned that this data breach isn’t just old data resurfacing. Many of the credentials are recent, complete with tokens, cookies, and metadata. The structure of the records — URLs paired with usernames and passwords — mirrors how modern infostealers collect information, suggesting much of the data was siphoned directly from infected machines. “This is not just a leak – it’s a blueprint for mass exploitation. With over 16 billion login records exposed, cybercriminals now have unprecedented access to personal credentials that can be used for account takeover, identity theft, and highly targeted phishing ,” researchers said. The good news is that the exposure was brief. The datasets were exposed just long enough for researchers to discover them, but not long enough to identify who was behind them. However, researchers said that enormous new datasets continue to surface every few weeks.

As of writing, Ethereum ( ETH ) was trading at $2,508, representing a gain of over 70% from its year-to-date low. Its market cap stood above $300 billion. While ETH remains 32% below its 2025 peak, analysts suggest it could be approaching a significant breakout. According to pseudo-anonymous analyst Crypto GEMs, who has over 422,000 followers on social media, Ethereum appears to have reentered a multi-week parallel channel on the daily chart. Source: X/cryptogems555 The structure resembles a similar pattern from earlier this year, which preceded an 80% rally within a month. If ETH replicates that trajectory, a move toward the $5,000 level could materialize by year-end. Technical indicators appear to support this outlook. Ethereum is on the verge of forming a golden cross, with its 50-day simple moving average close to crossing above the 200-day SMA, a historically bullish signal.

ETH 50-day EMA chart — June 20 | Source: crypto.news Should bullish momentum continue, the next upside target lies near the $3,500 level, which aligns with the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement and serves as a key psychological resistance. A confirmed breakout above that level could pave the way for a rally up to $5,000, in line with the analyst’s projections. Multiple catalysts appear to be aligning in support of this outlook. Spot Ether ETFs have regained traction among institutional players. Data from SoSoValue indicates that these products have seen $860 million in net inflows so far in June, a 52% increase from May. One of the most notable contributors to this demand is BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, which has accumulated over $750 million worth of ETH since the beginning of June. BlackRock has not sold any of its holdings during this accumulation phase, which is a sign of strong institutional conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value. Further, large holders controlling between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH have ramped up accumulation, marking the highest net position increase in months despite market turbulence. GM guys! Seems like the $ETH whales don’t care about the market shakeouts. They keep adding non stop 👀 pic.twitter.com/PcFd8B57pw — Crypto Rand (@crypto_rand) June 20, 2025 On-chain signals also reinforce the bullish sentiment. Data from Santiment shows that new wallet creation on the Ethereum network has surged, with between 800,000 and 1 million new addresses being created weekly. This marks a notable rise compared to the 560,000–670,000 range seen during the same period last year. Santiment attributes this growth to improved network utility and broader ecosystem engagement. All this could continue to strengthen Ethereum’s underlying market structure, paving the way for a potential breakout.

This price consolidation, however, appears to reflect a balanced market as on-chain metrics point to neither excessive profit-taking nor aggressive accumulation. Realized Profits Stay Subdued The 7-day moving average of realized profits indicated that profit-taking activity remains subdued, with figures holding below $1 billion, comparable to levels observed during the October 2024 correction, according to CryptoQuant’s latest update . Even during Bitcoin’s surge to a new all-time high earlier this year, realized profits failed to match the peaks seen in January 2025. This was indicative of a lack of urgency among investors to cash out. Such a limited selling pressure has contributed to the current consolidation phase and signaled a cautiously optimistic sentiment. However, what’s preventing a stronger bullish breakout is the apparent weakness in demand. The ratio of newly issued supply to dormant supply (inactive for over a year) shows demand. While still positive, it has been steadily declining since the local high in May. A ratio above zero typically reflects healthy demand, but the gradual drop suggests that buying interest is cooling off. Despite this, the demand remains sufficient to absorb the existing selling pressure, which is keeping the market stable. Overall, Bitcoin appears to be in a state of equilibrium, where moderate realized profits and slowly waning demand offset each other – an environment that supports consolidation rather than a sharp directional move in the near term. While on-chain activity reflects a balanced market, sentiment indicators are beginning to tilt bearish. A Classic Contrarian Buy Signal Emerges Santiment’s latest data shows a spike in retail bearish sentiment toward Bitcoin. Interestingly, this trend often signals a potential rebound. Currently, there are just 1.03 bullish comments for every bearish one – levels not seen since April 6th, when fear peaked amid initial tariff-related market reactions. Historically, such negative sentiment among traders has preceded upward price moves, as markets tend to act contrary to retail expectations. Similar fear in early April marked a strong buy opportunity, which suggests current conditions could offer a repeat setup for crypto bulls The post Macro Uncertainty Meets Market Balance in Bitcoin’s On-Chain Activity appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-20 07:38:27

The development marks a meaningful structural shift in the current trend. According to technical analyst CasiTrades (@CasiTrades), this backtest could be a prelude to further downside movement. The chart indicates a failed attempt to reclaim $2.25. Following the breakdown, price action rebounded slightly on the back of a lower-time frame bullish divergence. This brief rally, however, encountered rejection at the former support zone, which has now flipped to resistance. The price was $2.239 at the time of her analysis, unable to break convincingly above the new ceiling. It has fallen since then and is currently trading at $2.17. Quick #XRP Update – Backtest Occurs After $2.25 Break! The $2.25 support officially broke and when backtested, it's now showing signs of resistance. That’s a key shift in structure, and it makes the deeper support levels even more likely to get tested. The slight dip… pic.twitter.com/M7e5BJHWbZ — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) June 12, 2025 Support Levels to Watch While other analysts have maintained a bullish outlook , CasiTrades expects a short-term downturn. The current market structure suggests XRP is approaching a key inflection point, and the analyst recently revealed that the market is out of time and XRP must decide on a direction. The chart highlights a converging triangle pattern, with XRP nearing the apex. A breakdown from this tightening range would likely send the asset’s price toward lower support zones. The next significant support levels lie at $2.01 and $1.90, with further potential downside toward $1.55. The Fibonacci target of 1.236 is marked at $2.0200, reinforcing the importance of the $2.01–$2.02 zone as a probable landing point should the downward pressure persist. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Momentum Divergence and RSI Pressure The relative strength index (RSI) is also approaching a wedge-shaped breakout zone. The RSI has been forming lower highs while maintaining a horizontal base; a breakout or rejection here will likely coincide with a directional price move. RSI currently hovers near the neutral 50 mark, and momentum has not reclaimed higher ground despite the earlier bullish divergence. Unless a divergence forms on higher timeframes, the rejection at $2.25 could intensify. XRP’s Next Direction With time running out before the price reaches the convergence point, XRP is poised for a decisive move. If the $2.25 level continues to act as resistance, the bearish case strengthens, particularly given the unfulfilled Fibonacci levels and the visible bearish retest pattern. Although she suggests a short-term downturn, CasiTrades noted that “this is likely a final support touch before a major breakout.” Another well-known analyst recently predicted a notable 725% rally for the digital asset, and XRP’s tightening Bollinger Bands suggest that the asset could experience a sharp rebound, invalidating the bearish move and potentially targeting new highs.

On Polymarket , a popular crypto prediction platform, the odds of approval have soared to 90%, up from 70% just weeks ago. This spike in sentiment reflects growing optimism that XRP could follow in the footsteps of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which already boast spot ETFs in the U.S. A Game-Changer for XRP? If approved, the spot XRP ETF would make the token more accessible to mainstream investors by listing it on traditional stock exchanges. This eliminates the need for digital wallets, making XRP easier to buy, sell, and hold, especially for institutions that typically avoid direct crypto exposure. The approval could usher in fresh liquidity and draw in large-scale players like hedge funds and asset managers. The Polymarket prediction contract has already seen over $95,000 in volume, signaling strong conviction among participants. The platform’s markets often react to regulatory news and broader sentiment, offering a snapshot of what traders believe could happen next. SEC Delay Keeps Market on Edge Despite the surge in betting odds, the U.S. SEC is keeping the crypto market in suspense. It recently announced a 35-day delay in its decision on Franklin Templeton’s proposed spot XRP ETF , along with a similar delay for a spot Solana ETF . The agency instead opened a public comment period, pushing any final decision into the second half of 2025. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is XRP a Good Investment Right Now? , Canada Takes the Lead While U.S. regulators stall, Canada has already taken a step forward. Canadian firms like Purpose Investments, 3iQ, and Evolve have already received approval from the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) and launched their ETFs. Purpose has even waived its management fees until February 2026, making its XRP ETF the first to offer zero fees for early investors. With $8.3 million in assets under management already, Canada’s clear and proactive regulatory stance is driving real-world product rollout, unlike the U.S., where uncertainty continues to hold back progress. XRP’s current Market Snapshot As anticipation builds around upcoming XRP ETFs, the XRP price remained surprisingly stable despite extreme market turbulence. Over 12 hours, XRP experienced an abnormal 8,466% spike in long-to-short liquidation imbalance, with over $508,000 wiped from bullish positions. Yet, XRP’s price barely moved, gaining just 0.20% and staying around $2.15. This suggests that while traders were overly bullish, possibly fueled by ETF optimism, the price itself resisted major swings, highlighting XRP’s resilience amid rising institutional interest. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

It provides traditional market exposure to XRP, potentially influencing broader crypto-related stocks if it signals wider institutional adoption of digital assets. What are the main use cases for XRP in the cryptocurrency market? XRP’s primary use cases include fast, low-cost cross-border payments, acting as a bridge currency for international money transfers, and enabling on-demand liquidity for financial institutions. The XRP Ledger also supports tokenization of assets. How much will XRP be worth if they win the lawsuit?

BCH remains close to $500, with increasing social media mentions. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is yet another ‘dinosaur’ coin to reawaken in the past few months. As BTC made new all-time highs, traders returned to BCH, renewing its narrative after years of neglect. BCH already broke above $600 during the November 2024 rally, showing it was still capable of tapping market hype. The coin added more than 10% in a day, sparking hopes for an even larger breakout. Traders also noted BCH is trying to eat through a sell wall, potentially jumping to a higher range once the selling pressure decreases. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) posted almost non-stop gains in the past month, sparking renewed social media interest after years of low mindshare. | Source: CoinGecko Currently, BCH trades just under $500, after consecutive weeks of extended gains. The coin also extended its trading volumes to a three-month peak, at over $627M. The recent Bitcoin Cash rally seems to be driven by social media hype. Mentions surged as the price began to recover, pushing it to a new peak for 2025. Based on social media metrics , BCH is having its 2025 moment. Recently, BCH even flipped SUI, one of the trending L1 chains with expanding usage and DeFi. However, until recently, BCH social media were mostly silent, as this time there were no influencers to boost the asset’s adoption. Compared to newer assets, BCH is considered a dead chain, as it has lagged behind the recent Web3 use cases. The coin retains its usage as a simple payment tool, due to the predictable fees. BCH open interest increased to a six-month high, at over $364M. The coin’s long to short ratio is balanced, with no potential for a short squeeze. Bitcoin Cash usage still lags The recent spike in BCH price activity is not reflected by on-chain metrics. Bitcoin Cash is still a niche coin, with relatively low usage. The recent price rally may increase long-term holding, in expectation of a recovery to a higher price range. Currently, only around 300K BCH change hands each day, despite the relatively low fees, moving just 1.5% of the supply. The chain carries around 55K daily active addresses, as BCH still mostly serves as a regular coin, with limited DeFi use cases and cross-chain capabilities. Formerly, the BCH team focused on solving the issues of flexible difficulty adjustment, to avoid the effects of competing BTC miners switching between chains. The BCH mining activity fluctuated between 3 and 7 EH/s in the past year. Previously, BCH was used by mining pools with spare SHA-256 capacity, as miners switched to the other chain when the rewards were more favorable. In the past year, the Bitcoin Cash hashrate has not seen any dramatic fluctuations, as BTC miners kept to their own network with sufficient profitability. Only on occasional days is the BCH hashrate slightly higher, though quickly falling to the baseline. BCH is currently profitable to mine even for older equipment, keeping the network relatively stable. Despite this, BCH mining rates have remained close to the levels of 2018, while the BTC network expanded by more than 20 times.

They’re vitally important for the health of crypto markets, yet they must engage in a delicate and intricate balancing act that few people understand. Without market makers, the liquidity in crypto would likely dry up in a matter of minutes, causing tremendous volatility that would shake the bones of even the most seasoned traders. Why Does Crypto Need Market Makers? These days, almost every new cryptocurrency project utilizes the services of market makers to ensure their tokens can be traded. In fact, they often engage with multiple market makers, for insufficient liquidity is just about the fastest way to wreck an entire token economy. Projects need to ensure there is ample liquidity to attract retail and institutional investors to their tokens. After all, people are only going to invest serious money in an asset if they’re sure there’s sufficient demand to offload it quickly when they need to. Market makers can also help token creators to boost the accessibility of their assets by listing them on multiple exchange platforms, so they can ensure it’s available to buy from any location in the world. Indeed, many of the most reputable centralized crypto exchanges require that tokens have a contract with a reputable market maker as a precondition for listing them. In addition, market makers can also help crypto teams to make the most efficient use of their treasury supply. By placing liquidity on strategic decentralized exchange platforms, they can ensure that liquidity follows the price, without exposing those critical assets to impermanent loss. How Do Market Makers Operate? Market makers utilize a number of strategies to ensure a constant flow of liquidity. Exactly how they may go about doing this differs from market maker to market maker, as each one has its own, carefully crafted algorithmic trading software. For instance, Wintermute is one of the best known market makers. It utilizes algorithmic trading software that makes use of trading bots to provide fast liquidity for exchange platforms and token creators. Another market maker, GSR , provides “bespoke” liquidity and risk management solutions for digital asset creators, while also supporting institutions that want to trade large volumes of crypto assets. ‘ Another well known crypto market maker is Kairon Labs , which uses a proprietary algorithmic trading platform that it can quickly customize to meet the unique needs of any project. It bills itself as a boutique market maker, seeing each project it takes on as a partnership. For instance, its business model is designed to ensure that it only wins when its clients also win. Although each market maker has its own approach, as a rule of thumb they generally follow the below process: Post continuous orders: The main goal of the market maker is to continuously provide two prices – the bid and the ask price – to the orderbook. These quotes are made visible to every trader, ensuring there is always a standing offer for anyone who wants to trade the asset in question. In doing this, the market maker makes sure that someone can always buy or sell the desired asset, without having to wait until another human trader is willing to match their asking price. This job means that the market maker must be ready and willing to trade at its quoted prices, fulfilling orders even when the market is quiet or imbalanced. By making sure they are always available, the market maker prevents liquidity from drying up, so traders can buy and sell smoothly at all times. Maintain inventory: For market makers to be continuously available to buy and sell, they must maintain an inventory of the asset they’re covering. So if a buyer places an order, the market maker has enough of the asset to complete that sale. Or if someone wants to sell, it must have enough of the paired asset to enable that trade to go ahead. In this way, it’s constantly adding to, and taking out capital from its inventory, and it will need to ensure it always has enough of the asset available. Absorb imbalances: A sufficiently large inventory is required to help deal with orderbook imbalances, which may occur when there is news-driven volatility. For instance, if there’s a sudden spike in demand for a crypto asset, the market maker must be able to step in on the other side and sell a large volume of the underlying asset. Alternatively, if there is a large number of sellers, the market maker must be prepared to keep buying to prevent a sudden drop in its underlying price. By doing this, market makers can help the asset to ride out volatile conditions and prevent any significant changes in its underlying price. Dynamically adjust prices: It’s important to understand that just because market makers keep prices stable, they cannot prevent the price from changing, and nor should they try to do so. Rather, their job is to ensure liquidity is available, and this requires them to keep tabs on the prevailing market conditions, including the volume of buy and sell orders, price movements and market sentiments. By analyzing these metrics, it can then adjust its bid and ask prices to reflect the market condition and effectively manage its inventory levels to ensure it can meet trader’s demands. Execute immediately: Perhaps the most important task of all for market makers is to be able to execute immediately, so that traders aren’t left waiting. After all, profitable trading requires being able to move quickly in order to take advantage of asset price swings, so traders cannot be left waiting for their orders to complete. They need them to be executed the moment they click that button, and so the market maker must be ready to do this in an instant. Ethical Market Making For crypto projects to succeed, it’s important to understand the difference between legitimate market makers and the cowboy operators that have given the industry a bad name. Ethical market makers look to ensure sufficient liquidity, whereas the cowboy operators exist simply to try and pump token prices, using manipulative strategies such as wash trading. Although their activities may look similar, there’s a stark difference in what they actually do. Pumping token prices is relatively simple, and involves using automated bots to inflate trading volumes far beyond their real level, by constantly buying and selling from one another in an effort to make it look like there’s lots of supply and demand. Legitimate market makers, on the other hand, will only make as many maker and taker orders as necessary to maintain a healthy supply of liquidity. It can be difficult to understand the difference between ethical liquidity suppliers and token price manipulators, which is why companies like Kairon Labs provide deep analytics tools for customers to audit its activities across any exchange platform. This ensures they can keep tabs on what it’s doing to ensure it’s not artificially inflating trading volumes. Market Makers Make Markets Work From this understanding of how market makers operate, it becomes clear that they are essential to create healthy, functioning crypto markets. If market makers didn’t exist, it would be almost impossible for people to buy and sell their assets instantly, making trading a much slower, more volatile and unpredictable experience. If people’s trades are constantly delayed and their transactions often fail, that’s going to dissuade a lot of investors from entering the market, leading to negative consequences for the entire crypto industry. Market makers, by narrowing the bid-ask spread and ensuring transactions are processed immediately, help to reduce costs and keep trading more predictable. They help crypto assets to ride out brief moments of volatility and enable more efficient price discovery, with prices that are a true reflection of supply and demand.",Information,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-20 07:45:29

As of June 20, 2025, XRP is trading at about $2.15, a massive jump of over 334% from $0.49 a year ago. But is XRP a good investment right now? Let’s break down the facts, recent trends, and what experts are predicting. XRP Holds Steady Despite Concerns Over the past few years, XRP’s price growth was held back by its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but its recent performance has been mixed. In March 2025, the price dropped by 2.56%, followed by a 4.84% gain in April, and a slight dip of 0.78% in May. Meanwhile, in June, XRP has been mostly flat, with prices hovering around $2.17. This shows that it’s in a consolidation phase, waiting for the next big push. However, on-chain activity is low, with active wallets dropping from 100,000 to under 20,000 since December. This shows many are holding, not using XRP — a concern for long-term utility. Key Factors to Watch Several factors influence whether XRP is a good investment: Regulatory Clarity: The ongoing settlement talks between Ripple and the SEC have helped reduce legal uncertainty, now, all eyes are on August 15 . XRP ETF Approval : The key catalyst for XRP ETF approval is its security status. Despite this, Polymarket predicts a 89% chance the XRP ETF to get approved by the end of 2025. Institutional Adoption: Ripple’s partnerships with banks and payment networks are crucial. Currently, XRP is being used in real-world payments, boosting demand. It’s now linked with Thor Chain, UAE banks like Xand Bank and Momo, and tokenized real estate. Ripple has also acquired big firms like Metaco and Hidden Road, which handle $3 trillion yearly. Expert Predictions: XRP Price Eying $14 Although crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto says XRP’s current pattern mirrors 2017. Back then, XRP stayed flat for months before soaring 1,300% to $3.38. If the same happens now, XRP could jump from $2.19 to around $14, signaling a big rally ahead. Despite the optimism, XRP’s price is still volatile. Analysts say if adoption slows or rules get stricter, it could drop or stay flat around $1.80 to $2.",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-20 07:48:16

Hold Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) and Get Ahead of the Market with Early Signals XRP Struggles Amid Market Downturn, Key Levels in Focus XRP is currently trading between $2.06 and $2.31, reflecting a period of volatility for the cryptocurrency. Recent data shows a downward trend that has captured the attention of market observers. Over the past week, XRP's price has fallen by 5.01%. The decline is more pronounced over the past month, with a decrease of 9.45%. Looking at the last six months, XRP has seen a total drop of 5.32%. This sustained downward movement suggests bearish sentiment among traders. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for XRP stands at 46.34. An RSI below 50 often indicates that an asset is losing momentum, which could lead to further price declines. The nearest support level is at $1.94. If the price falls below this point, it might signal additional downward movement. On the other hand, the nearest resistance level is at $2.45. Breaking above this level could signal a potential reversal of the current trend. However, given the recent price declines and RSI reading, XRP may continue to face challenges in the short term. Conclusion Despite recent bullish trends, established cryptocurrencies like XRP show limited potential for significant short-term growth. Market predictions for XRP reaching $5 seem less promising, and other well-known coins face similar hurdles in achieving substantial immediate gains. In contrast, Codename:Pepe crypto is generating excitement with its innovative approach to maximizing profits. By leveraging advanced artificial intelligence to analyze market trends and automate trading strategies, it offers a unique opportunity for impressive returns. Its community-driven model and strategic tokenomics position it as a promising contender in the rapidly evolving crypto market.

On June 19, the California-based med tech firm announced that it would significantly expand its Bitcoin holdings over the next two and a half years, targeting 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, 42,000 BTC by the end of 2026, and ultimately 105,000 BTC by 2027. The purchases would be funded through a combination of equity and debt financing, along with operational cash flow. Semler has also appointed Joe Burnett as director of Bitcoin strategy. Burnett, a long-time Bitcoin advocate and former market research director at Unchained, is tasked with steering the firm’s treasury expansion. Under his leadership, the company will look to establish “one of the largest corporate Bitcoin treasuries in the world,” a goal Burnett described as aligned with the company’s long-term conviction in Bitcoin as the “ultimate long-duration asset” to hold. Semler has already achieved a 287% Bitcoin yield and $177 million in unrealized gains on its BTC holdings as of June 3.

Tokyo-listed Metaplanet is one such example. The firm surpassed 10,000 BTC in holdings as of June 16, reaching its year-end 2025 target six months early. Metplanet is eyeing a more ambitious target of holding 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026 and 210,000 BTC by 2027, equivalent to 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply.

According to Schiff in a June 20 X post , silver currently offers far more realistic upside than Bitcoin ( BTC ), with significantly less downside risk. “If anyone is looking for an alternative to gold, it makes no sense to buy Bitcoin when you can buy silver,” he wrote. Schiff has long positioned himself as a gold advocate and has repeatedly dismissed Bitcoin as an asset with little to no real value. While his latest remarks shift the spotlight from gold to silver, they continue his familiar theme that Bitcoin, in his view, is all speculation and no substance. You might also like: BlackRock buys $1.4B Bitcoin over six-day streak amid ETF boom As usual, his anti-Bitcoin campaign drew pushback from crypto supporters, many of whom dismissed his comments as outdated. Some pointed out that despite years of similar warnings, Bitcoin has continued to grow, both in value and adoption, defying his long-standing criticism. All Bitcoin will disrupt is the fortunes of those who buy it. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) June 20, 2025 In a follow-up reply to a commenter, Schiff doubled down. He claimed that people are “foolishly buying” Bitcoin instead of silver, adding that all the crypto king will ultimately do is “destroy the fortune of those who buy it.” Despite the criticism, BTC currently commands a greater market share than silver. As of now, Bitcoin ranks 7th among global assets by market capitalization at approximately $2.079 trillion, just ahead of silver, which holds the 8th spot at around $2.007 trillion. Schiff’s latest remarks come as Bitcoin’s performance has softened in recent weeks, though it remains relatively steady amid rising geopolitical tensions. At the time of writing, BTC is trading just above $104,700, down approximately 3.8% from its weekly high of over $108,000.

Resistance for SOL is at $150. Support for SOL/USD is at $145. The price analysis of Solana for Solana shows that SOL tried and failed at crossing past the $160 level. The price is still trading at $145 but may retrace further. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL fails to cross past $160 Solana showed significant bearish pressure on the daily chart, as the bulls could not climb past the $160 level, and the price headed towards $140. The bulls still hold strong at the level but the exhaustion might cause SOL to retrace further. Solana price 1-day chart analysis : SOL falls to $145 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 40.76, showing room for further downwards movement across the daily charts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line dives downwards, suggesting declining bullish momentum.

SOL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish momentum halts SOL at $160 The 4-hour chart for Solana reveals a steady fall as the bulls failed to rise past the $160 price level, and SOL fell to the $143.00 mark before recovering towards the $150 level.

SOL/USDT 4-hour price chart: TradingView The Solana price analysis across the daily and 4-hour charts indicates a notable decay after rising towards the $160 price level. The 4-hour chart reinforces this downward trend with a bearish dominance in the MACD and the RSI falling into unfavorable territory, signaling potential continued downward momentum as SOL retraces to $144. The bulls find strong support at $145 suggesting the price may bounce back. The bullish market sentiment supports the notion and the increasing trade volume is also bullish. However, if the price falls below $143, the next support is at $136. Is SOL a good investment? Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform known for its scalability and speed, boasting a substantial Total Value Locked ( TVL ). The network continues to hit key development milestones. Despite a challenging month, price predictions indicate a more positive outlook, suggesting the potential for future growth. Why is SOL down?

However, the increasing bearish pressure might create a drop below $145. What is Solana going to be worth in 2025? The Solana (SOL) price prediction for 2025 suggests a minimum value of $150.06 with an average price of $331.81. The price could reach a maximum of $367.80 during the year. Will SOL reach $1,000?

Given the bullish scenario and the projected positive market sentiment and growth trend, SOL might reach $1,000 within the next five years. Can Solana reach $5,000? Reaching $5,000 is plausible but would likely take several years beyond the current forecast period. However, a snowball in the asset’s adoption might bring the moment sooner. Does SOL have a good long-term future? Yes, Solana has a good long-term future, with a promising market capitalization and exciting potential roi due to its high scalability, low transaction costs, robust ecosystem, and increasing institutional interest. Its growing adoption, strong developer community, and strategic partnerships further enhance Solana’s forecast of its potential for sustained growth.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-20 08:00:00

Yet it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s capturing the spotlight—driven by explosive presale momentum, political relevance, and rapid community expansion. Analysts are now positioning it as the altcoin with the strongest potential to echo Bitcoin’s (BTC) historic rise in this cycle. Anticipation Grows for MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Market Debut One of 2025’s most followed independent crypto analysts has identified MAGACOIN FINANCE as the top contender to outperform all memecoins and altcoins this cycle—and early market data is reinforcing that outlook. With limited access via the official website, the project continues to attract strong interest for its capped supply and bold, meme-driven branding that resonates across investor segments. Industry experts are closely tracking MAGACOIN FINANCE as it positions itself as a potential frontrunner in the altcoin space . A 100% bonus is available on all contributions using PATRIOTS100X . XRP: Lawsuit Outcome and ETF Hopes Drive Volatility XRP is trading near $0.54, up 4.6% in the last day, as the market awaits the pivotal June 16 Ripple lawsuit decision. With over $2.1 billion in daily trading volume and speculation around an XRP spot ETF, investor engagement is at a high. As XRP’s legal clarity unfolds, many traders are also diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE for early-stage upside. Bitcoin (BTC): Bullish Forecasts and Market Leadership Bitcoin continues to anchor the market, with forecasts suggesting a climb to $137,554 by June 2025 and a floor above $107,962. As BTC maintains its leadership and sets the tone for the entire sector, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing attention as the next possible breakout stories, offering a rare chance to get in early on a coin with viral momentum and strong fundamentals. Kaspa (KAS): Steady Growth but Cautious Outlook Kaspa is trading around $0.082, with a market cap exceeding $2.1 billion and mixed short-term signals. While KAS is forecast to remain range-bound between $0.077 and $0.082 through the summer, analysts see limited explosive upside compared to earlier cycles. In contrast, MAGACOINFINANCE’s presale and its strategic price point is drawing both retail and institutional capital looking for higher-multiple returns. Polkadot (DOT): Interoperability and Consistent Gains Polkadot is trading near $7.56 and has posted a 16% weekly gain, with technicals pointing to a steady climb toward $6.00–$7.00 by year-end. DOT’s interoperability focus is winning over developers and investors, but as the pace of gains moderates, more traders are rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture the kind of early-stage growth that defined Bitcoin’s ascent. Final Thoughts With Bitcoin, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE leading the narrative for 2025, the next crypto cycle could see MAGACOIN FINANCE tracking BTC’s legendary path. As live catalysts unfold for XRP, KAS, and DOT, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale momentum and analyst confidence make it a top candidate for breakout success.

Because ETH and most altcoins are still far from their previous ATHs. At this point, while investors are still waiting for a major altcoin season to come, a survey drew attention. TheBlockchainMedia recently conducted a poll asking users to vote for the altcoin they are most bullish on. The poll included Hedera (HBAR), Algorand (ALGO), Cardano (ADA), and XRP. While the survey is not yet complete, Cardano has emerged as the top performer, ahead of XRP, HBAR, and ALGO. The results quickly caught the attention of the community, and even Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson. Hoskinson backed the election and its results with the phrase “a nice poll.” Although Hoskinson's comment was brief, the community said the poll could be an early signal of a shift in investor focus and a bullish move. Experts said this vote showed strong confidence and support for ADA despite market volatility. Charles Hoskinson recently proposed swapping 100 million ADA tokens for Bitcoin. Although this proposal received backlash, Hoskinson argued that the BTC swap did not pose a risk to the ADA price.

In the post, Farina frames the negative coverage and skepticism surrounding XRP as intentional and designed to divert public attention from its underlying potential. According to his argument, these narratives are part of a broader effort to steer the general population toward Bitcoin (BTC) while keeping them uninformed about alternatives such as XRP. Farina states , “The mainstream campaign against $XRP tells you everything you need to know.” He follows this with the suggestion that public sentiment is being manipulated to focus on Bitcoin while ignoring other digital assets that, in his view, may offer superior utility or strategic relevance. He continues, “They want the masses to blindly bet their entire net worth into BTC while distracting them from the real deal.” Farina concludes the tweet with a rhetorical remark, “When was the last time the masses were right? History says this won’t end well for 99%.” His message implies that historical patterns of mass behavior often end in poor outcomes for most participants, and that the current push towards Bitcoin dominance may ultimately be no different. The mainstream campaign against $XRP tells you everything you need to know. They want the masses to blindly bet their entire net worth into BTC while distracting them from the real deal. When was the last time the masses were right? History says this won’t end well for 99%. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 18, 2025 Supportive and Critical Reactions from the Online Community The post attracted commentary from various users on the X platform, with a mix of agreement and disagreement. A user named Caspian endorsed the core sentiment, stating, “Distracting narratives favor control over clarity. Real leverage grows by understanding the system beneath the noise, and positioning yourself where lasting value is quietly built.” Caspian’s remark aligns with Farina’s comment that media and institutional emphasis on Bitcoin may be crowding out attention from lesser-publicized projects that could offer long-term value. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another user, Tara369, shared a different perspective, challenging the assumption that the general public is heavily invested in Bitcoin. She said, “I don’t think the masses care about btc. No one I know owns it. In addition the masses can’t afford their groceries I’m sure btc is the last on their mind.” Her response describes economic hardship as a more immediate concern for most individuals, implying that the conversation around digital assets may not even be relevant to large segments of the population at this time. Ongoing Market Tensions Over Narrative Control and Investment Direction Farina’s position underscores a belief held by certain segments of the XRP community that media, corporate, and financial institutions elevate Bitcoin while undermining digital assets such as XRP , which they argue possess unique technological advantages and practical use cases. While critics argue that this view lacks substantiated evidence and stems from confirmation bias, supporters continue to call attention to regulatory actions, inconsistent reporting, and market behavior that they interpret as reinforcing their stance. Farina’s commentary suggests that for retail investors, understanding the motivations behind public messaging is as important as analyzing the technical or financial fundamentals of any given asset. Whether or not the public has embraced Bitcoin to the degree claimed, his statement contributes to the ongoing discourse around trust, transparency, and the role of influence in the digital asset economy.

Mehdi Farooq, an investment partner at Hypersphere and ex-Animoca Brands exec, revealed in a post on X on Thursday that he lost a large portion of his life savings in a Zoom hack linked to the North Korean hacking group Lazarus. The scam began when Farooq received a Telegram message from Alex Lin, a professional acquaintance. Lin asked to catch up, and Farooq shared his Calendly link to schedule a call. The next day, shortly before the meeting, Lin messaged again, asking to switch the call to Zoom Business “for compliance reasons,” explaining that one of his limited partners, Kent — whom Farooq also knew — would be joining. The Zoom meeting appeared legitimate. Both participants had their cameras on, but there was no audio. In the Zoom chat, they said they were having technical issues and asked Farooq to update his Zoom client. Within minutes of installing the fake update, six of Farooq’s crypto wallets were drained. It was only afterward that Farooq realized Lin’s account had been hacked. The scheme was later linked to Lazarus, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group. “It was surreal and completely violating. But in the darkest moment, whitehat hackers stepped up — complete strangers offering help when I was at my lowest. Turns out I was compromised by DPRK affiliated threat know as dangrouspassword,” wrote Farooq.

The web3 revolution promised a decentralized utopia where users would control their assets and data in an open, borderless digital economy. Instead, we have built a maze of isolated networks, each demanding its own wallet, gas token, and operating rules. This industry-wide fragmentation can hinder innovation and deter new users from adopting the technology. Interoperability between chains is not just a technical improvement; it is the foundational layer for the mainstream future of web3. You might also like: Warning to builders: L2s are leaking value, L1 appchains are the smarter bet | Opinion The current fragmentation of web3, with its multiple networks and need for diverse wallets and tokens, hinders adoption and contradicts the promise of frictionless value exchange. However, recent initiatives such as Ethereum’s ERC-7930 and ERC-7828 standards , along with the vision of a “ meta-blockchain ” proposed by Solana’s ( SOL ) co-founder, are promising steps toward unifying the ecosystem. These and other advances promise to reduce complexity and costs, paving the way for a more seamless and interconnected user experience for a new and improved web3 generation. Web3 is currently fragmented The current multi-chain ecosystem is a usability nightmare. Users must manage multiple wallets, memorize different seed phrases, and navigate inconsistent interfaces just to interact with basic services. A DeFi enthusiast might hold Bitcoin ( BTC ) in a hardware wallet, trade Ethereum ( ETH ) tokens on MetaMask, and stake Cardano ( ADA ) assets through Lace Wallet. Each step requires manual bridging, fee calculations, and security reviews. This fragmented experience is not just inconvenient; it is a systemic failure that contradicts blockchain’s promise of frictionless value exchange. The problem goes beyond individual workflows because wallets, decentralized applications (dApps), and block explorers follow conflicting conventions: Ethereum uses hexadecimal addresses, Bitcoin uses Base58, and newer blockchains adopt proprietary formats. This inconsistency creates what Galaxy researchers call “asset fragmentation,” where identical tokens bridged across chains become non-fungible, confusing users and diluting liquidity. Without standardization, web3 will remain like a Tower of Babel, where communication between chains is more akin to translation than transaction. Transaction fees: The silent killer of UX Cross-chain transactions impose a hidden tax through cumulative transaction fees. Users pay fees for transactions on the source chain, execution on the destination chain, and relay services. With this structure, if the user is not careful, they could incur costs exceeding the value of the assets being transferred. ERC-20 token swaps on Ethereum can incur fees exceeding $10 during congestion spikes, while bridging between layer-2 networks adds further complexity. These costs are not only financial but also cognitive. New users must learn the commission dynamics of each chain, from Ethereum’s gas auctions to Solana’s fixed fees, creating a steep learning curve that discourages adoption. Layer-2 solutions, such as Arbitrum ( ARB ) and Optimism ( OP ), offer partial relief by reducing commissions by up to 95%, but introduce new fragmentation, as mentioned by Solana co-founder Anatoly Yokovenko . For example, a user bridging USDC ( USDC ) from Arbitrum to Polygon must still navigate distinct rollup architectures, completion times, and liquidity pools, a process more like exchanging currencies at a border than enjoying a seamless experience. True interoperability requires abstracting these complexities, not just optimizing them. Towards a frictionless cross-chain UX The ultimate goal is not cross-chain transactions , but chain-agnostic transactions. Users should access DeFi pools, NFT markets, and DAOs through unified interfaces that abstract underlying networks. Imagine a wallet that automatically selects the cheapest chain for swaps, routes transactions over optimal bridges, and consolidates transaction fees into a single stablecoin payment, all while maintaining self-custody and security. This level of functionality requires new technological innovations, such as DeFAI , to fully demonstrate its potential. If interchain transactions were more integrated, AI agents could already be handling most transactions in decentralized finance; however, to reach this point, there is still a long way to go. Moreover, true interoperability requires deeper integration. Smart contracts should run cross-chain without custom wrappers, while decentralized identities (DIDs) and other dApps should be ported frictionlessly between ecosystems. Interoperability developments should focus on this path to create super wallets that facilitate the use of web3 in its entirety. A call for collaborative innovation, with safety as a non-negotiable pillar Interoperability should never compromise security. Cross-chain bridges remain prime targets for attacks, with more than $2 billion stolen in 2023 alone. Centralized validators and opaque code plague many solutions, betraying the decentralized spirit of blockchain. The answer lies in new cryptographic tools, such as zero-knowledge proofs, that verify cross-chain events without the need for trusted intermediaries. The industry must adopt high security standards, ensuring that interoperability protocols meet the security guarantees of their underlying chains. For this, more cooperative initiatives must be formed to create standards, such as the Linux Foundation’s Decentralized Trust and the EEA DLT Interoperability Specification, led by Dr Weijia Zhang, a pioneer in blockchain interoperability standards. Solving the UX crisis in web3 requires collaboration across ecosystems. Developers must prioritize interoperability in base protocols, not as an afterthought. Standardization bodies must accelerate initiatives, while users must demand interoperability from wallet and dApp providers . Either we tear down the walls between chains, or we condemn users to a future of digital border controls and cognitive overload, which hurts us all as an industry. Interoperability between blockchains is a great unifier The blockchain’s potential depends on interconnection, just as TCP/IP unified computer networks on the Internet, interoperability protocols can weave isolated web3 chains into a cohesive digital economy. The technical blueprints exist, from ERC-7930 address formats and “meta-blockchain”, for example. What is lacking is collective will. As an industry, we must stop building isolated kingdoms and start laying the railroads between them. Only then will web3 transcend its niche and fulfill the promise of an open and user-centric Internet, with a user-friendly experience. The choice is clear: interoperate or stagnate.

Hackers impersonated contacts through Telegram and Zoom The phishing scheme began with a Telegram message sent to Farooq from someone appearing to be Alex Lin, a known acquaintance. After some back-and-forth, Farooq agreed to a call and shared his Calendly link to schedule a meeting. The day of the meeting, the same account messaged again, citing compliance reasons to move the conversation to Zoom Business. Farooq was told that another known industry contact, Kent, would be joining the call. The Zoom meeting appeared legitimate. The participants had their cameras turned on, but no audio could be heard. Instead, a message appeared in the meeting chat explaining there were technical difficulties and requesting Farooq to update his Zoom client. He complied, and within minutes of installing the file, all six of his crypto wallets were compromised and emptied. The attackers used malware disguised as a Zoom update to gain access to Farooq’s system. The communication and social engineering techniques employed align with previous incidents linked to Lazarus Group, a well-known North Korean hacking unit accused of multiple high-value crypto thefts in recent years . Lazarus linked through behaviour patterns and malware type The phishing attack bore several hallmarks of Lazarus operations. These include impersonation of known industry contacts, the use of malware-laced installers, and manipulation of video conferencing platforms. In this case, the attackers staged a convincing video call while disabling audio, a tactic that may have distracted Farooq from questioning the legitimacy of the situation. Farooq’s experience comes just weeks after a similar phishing attempt targeted Kenny Li, co-founder of Manta Network. In that case, attackers used identical techniques—fake Zoom calls, impersonated contacts, and malware download prompts. Li avoided falling victim by suggesting a switch to another communication platform, at which point the attackers disappeared. Security researchers believe these coordinated attacks indicate Lazarus has refined its methods and increased its focus on exploiting trust between professionals. The malware used in both incidents closely resembles code used in other Lazarus-attributed attacks, especially the “dangrouspassword” exploit noted by analysts. Multiple founders report similar tactics in recent weeks The attack on Farooq is part of a growing trend of sophisticated phishing campaigns targeting cryptocurrency executives and developers. Founders and team members from Mon Protocol, Stably, and Devdock AI have also reported receiving suspicious messages that attempted to lure them into compromised Zoom environments.

Over $50M has been taken through Telegram deals, promising a discounted price against a vesting schedule. Telegram users have reported channels where discounted offers were made for potentially trending altcoins. An estimated $50M has been taken from buyers, who were promised a sale of altcoins at a discount, while agreeing on a vesting schedule. The scammers offered altcoins with sufficient liquidity and presence on social media, promising potential rallies. The offers included SUI, NEAR, SEI, and Axelar (AXL). The offers came from Tier-1 coins, which were considered reliable and liquid, with a lower risk profile compared to memes. The scam started with the first sale rounds in November 2024, just as crypto was entering another hype cycle. The first round of coins offered 50% discount on The Graph (GRT), Aptos, SEI, WELL, and others. On-chain data showed the tokens were available in designated wallets, and the scheme built up trust. Scam revealed by Aza Ventures Bulletin on Telegram Following a few rounds of OTC sales, the deals expanded in size, again including Axelar, NEAR, GRASS, and other tokens. The last offer came on June 1, for FLUID tokens. Token teams started being aware of the potential loss, with SUI and EGold (EGLD) warning about the OTC deals. The teams explained there is no program or deal for deep discounts and vesting. Even on-chain investigator ZachXBT warned about the risk of doing deals on Telegram, offered by an unknown VC fund. Despite this, the subscribers showed trust and demand for the deals, due to the track record of some of the participants. Until recently, the team sent out excuses that the deals would go through, citing project delays and technicalities. The Azra Ventures Bulletin channel on Telegram claimed new OTC deals were coming until the last moment. | Source: Telegram In the past two weeks, the main source of deals, referred to as Source 1, disappeared from the OTC channel Aza Ventures Bulletin. The channel announced that part of the deals were in fact Ponzi schemes, while others were legitimate and some value could be salvaged. Aza Ventures is a Tier-4 crypto VC fund, with 71 investments in relatively small projects. The channel admin is now dealing with the three main originators of OTC deals, aiming to recoup the funds by the end of June. Authorities and exchanges have been notified, with the possibility to freeze funds. Up to $50M have been taken from buyers, which include whales, KOLs and other projects. The deals included multiple trending tokens, including Kava Fluid, OG, Aethir, Movement, The Sandbox, Ronin, Celestia, Wormhole, Arkham, Berachain, and more. The offers showed awareness of crypto trends, offering some of the hottest trending altcoins and projects. Scammer linked to Binance-listed crypto project One of the biggest blows against trust in crypto is the person referred to as Source 1. For now, the channel is guarding their identity, though there are claims the seller is also the founder of another significant crypto project, with a reputation and a listing on Binance. Initially, the OTC deals channel will not dox the identity of Source 1, aiming to use the leverage for recouping as much value for investors as possible. “ I want to be clear: the only reason I am not currently disclosing Source 1’s identity is because I believe keeping this confidential for now gives us the best chance to recoup both your and my investments. If, at a later stage, the community feels it is better to dox them and proceed differently, I am open to that. But at this point, disclosure could jeopardize recovery efforts,” announced the channel admin. However, Source 1 may have leaked his real personality, by trying to differentiate his social profile from the scam. Recently, Ravindra Kumar posted on X, stating he was not involved with OTC deals.

Scale of the Breach Uncovered In one of the largest known breaches of its kind, cybersecurity researchers have confirmed the exposure of more than 16 billion login credentials online, triggering serious concerns across the crypto industry and digital security landscape. The discovery follows multiple reports earlier this year about an unprotected database containing 184 million records found on a public server. However, fresh investigations suggest that initial find was only a fraction of a much larger breach. According to researchers cited by Forbes, at least 30 separate datasets have now been uncovered, each containing up to 3.5 billion records. These datasets reportedly include login credentials for a broad range of services, spanning social media, cryptocurrency exchanges, developer platforms, VPN services, and even government accounts. Crypto and Financial Platforms at Risk The potential for these stolen credentials to enable unauthorised access to wallets, exchange accounts, and DeFi platforms is of particular concern to the cryptocurrency sector. Given the irreversible nature of blockchain transactions, compromised accounts could lead to instant asset theft without any recourse for victims. The datasets were briefly accessible online via Elasticsearch databases and object storage instances, leaving them vulnerable to anyone aware of their presence. Cybernews, which reported on the breach, warns that this is not outdated or irrelevant data, but fresh, actionable information likely harvested through modern infostealer malware. Origins Remain Unclear The precise source of the leak remains unknown. Investigators believe the datasets are likely an amalgamation of information harvested from various infostealers, credential stuffing operations, and previous leaks. While there’s a chance that some of the data may have been compiled by security researchers monitoring breaches, it’s widely assumed that cybercriminal groups were responsible for aggregating much of this information. Experts note that massive troves of this nature enable cybercriminals to scale up operations ranging from identity theft and phishing attacks to account takeovers. Even a low success rate can translate to millions of compromised victims when working with billions of credentials. Crypto Security Community Urges Vigilance In light of the breach, security experts are advising crypto users and platform operators to adopt enhanced protective measures. Regularly updating passwords, using strong, unique credentials for every service, and scanning systems for malware are now considered essential. While the breach’s full impact is still being assessed, the crypto industry, which is often targeted for its financial assets and decentralised platforms, remains particularly vulnerable. As long as ownership of the leaked datasets remains unidentified, experts warn that users will have limited control over mitigating risks, underscoring the importance of proactive cyber hygiene.

The marketing documents emphasize both the security and efficiency of the ETF as a means to engage with the growth potential of XRP. SMQKE highlighted several key excerpts from the materials, which outline the ETF’s value proposition, infrastructure, and operational credibility. Official XRP ETF advertisement to institutional investors. “Invest in the future of global payments infrastructure” “A secure and efficient way to access XRP’s growth potential” “Access XRP's growth potential. Gain secure, regulated exposure to global payment innovation… pic.twitter.com/Z7McANo6B4 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 18, 2025 Regulated Access to XRP via ETF Structure According to the advertisement, the Purpose XRP ETF aims to offer investors secure and streamlined access to XRP’s performance without the complexities of directly purchasing and storing the asset themselves. The fund is described as providing “secure, regulated exposure to global payment innovation through an ETF holding XRP directly.” By structuring this exposure through a familiar investment vehicle, Purpose Investments intends to lower the barrier to entry for traditional and institutional investors who might otherwise avoid direct engagement with digital asset exchanges. The ETF is eligible for Canadian TFSA and RRSP accounts and is supported by dual custodians: Gemini Trust Company, LLC, and Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC. This dual-custodian structure is designed to bolster investor confidence by ensuring robust safekeeping standards and regulatory compliance. The fund is audited by Ernst & Young LLP, adding another layer of institutional-grade accountability. Positioning XRP as Core Infrastructure for Global Payments The promotional material asserts that XRP is more than a digital currency, describing it as a foundational element in the next generation of financial infrastructure. “With the XRP Ledger’s powerful blockchain technology and XRP’s increasing adoption by financial institutions globally,” the document states, “we believe this digital asset is poised to reshape the future of cross-border payments.” This perspective aligns with ongoing narratives in the fintech space that view XRP and its underlying ledger as viable technologies for institutional-grade financial settlements . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Data within the advertisement reinforces these claims. As of March 31, 2025, XRP stood at a market capitalization of $130 billion, compared to Bitcoin’s $1.663 trillion and Ethereum’s $217.8 billion. However, XRP leads both assets in transaction throughput, processing approximately 1,500 transactions per second at an average fee of $0.0002, according to figures cited from Coingecko and ycharts.com. The promotional material contrasts these numbers with Ethereum’s $0.3611 and Bitcoin’s $0.2760 per transaction, suggesting XRP’s cost-efficiency is a competitive advantage in high-volume environments. Comparative Simplicity for Investors A visual comparison of the materials outlines how the Purpose XRP ETF simplifies investor access to XRP. Traditional acquisition of XRP typically requires evaluating a digital marketplace, opening and funding an exchange account, creating a compatible wallet, and manually executing purchases. By contrast, investors in the Purpose XRP ETF simply buy into the ETF through standard investment accounts such as TFSA or RRSP, with the fund manager handling the direct XRP acquisition and custody process. This ease of access is likely to appeal to both institutional and individual investors who prefer indirect exposure through professionally managed vehicles. Backed by Recognized Institutions and Transparent Oversight The advertisement also lists other key stakeholders in the ETF’s structure. Purpose Investments serves as the manager, with valuation provided by CIBC Mellon Global Securities Services Company. TSX Trust Company is listed as the registrar and transfer agent. The presentation and branding underscore a concerted effort to position XRP within a regulated and familiar investment framework. The tone and content of the advertisement reinforce the message that XRP is not only viable but desirable for long-term participation in the evolving digital finance landscape.

The two companies have registered a trust called Invesco Galaxy Solana ETF, according to public records. Various firms have registered trusts, seeking SEC approval for a crypto ETF. Using trusts allows them to have the legal framework ready, and is a major signal to regulators and investors of their intent. Momentum For SOL ETF Builds Up The new developments from Galaxy and Invesco come at a time when momentum for a spot SOL ETF is building up. According to recent Polymarket data, the possibility of a Solana ETF being approved in 2025 currently stands at over 90%. This optimism is based on recent reporting that suggests the SEC could approve SOL ETFs as early as July 2025. How Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Could Benefit Amid this potential launch of a spot SOL ETF, it could open an opportunity for investors to benefit from the expected altcoin wave. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently one of the most exciting presales in the market, which has raised over $10.8 million to date. With market optimism at over 90%, a SOL ETF could send presale participation into overdrive, with the momentum expected to carry over into the token listing. Investors are keenly eying Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and are seeking to make massive gains on the token listing. Its commitment to utility and the ongoing $100,000 giveaway are some of the main drivers of the presale. The $100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has organized a massive $100,000 giveaway for presale participants. The team plans to give away $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens to ten lucky winners each. To qualify for this giveaway, all you need to do is participate in the presale with at least a $50 purchase. The giveaway is meant as a reward to early supporters of the project. In addition to the $10,000 prize, presale participants will also be ranked on a leaderboard on the presale dashboard. The top 50 participants in the presale will be eligible for bonus MUTM tokens. The MUTM Token Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of the presale, where tokens are going for $0.03 each. To participate in the presale, all you need is to connect your wallet containing one of the accepted assets. You can then buy as much or as little as you desire. The current price of the tokens is a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. This stepped increase in the token price is meant to ensure that the earliest supporters of the vision will receive the biggest rewards. So far, around 12,200 unique buyers have participated in the presale, raising over $10.8 million. The presale has been a massive success, with 40% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 of the presale already sold, barely two weeks after it launched. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. Analysts are extremely optimistic about the price of MUTM tokens once they go live. They are predicting that the token price could go up by 2,450% when the tokens go live. Based on that projection, a $1600 investment in the presale could grow to $39,200. That is a massive return that every investor wants to get hold of while the opportunity still lasts. Planned Beta Launch Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to launch a beta version of the platform on the token listing day. That event is expected to produce massive buying pressure for the MUTM tokens. The beta launch will help to convince doubters who have been on the sidelines since phase 1 of the token presale. It will act as proof of concept and allow future users to test the platform’s features for themselves. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is expected to list on top-tier exchanges, and the beta version launch could provide the last spark needed to drive prices to the stratosphere. Other elements of the projects have also excited investors, including the planned launch of a stablecoin. This stablecoin launch will further boost market participation in the MUTM protocol, helping to boost the price of MUTM tokens. With the planned expansion to multiple blockchain networks, it will ensure that as much of the market as possible can benefit from the numerous profitability opportunities offered on the protocol. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an exciting project in the presale market that has attracted the attention of investors and analysts alike. The upcoming SOL ETH launch could trigger the start of altcoin season, and MUTM tokens provide the perfect vehicle to ride this wave. At the current low price of $0.03 per token, you are getting your tokens at a 50% discount compared to those who hold their purchase until the token listing price of $0.06.

The events unfolding in this sector in 2025 have significant implications for innovation, AI development, and global tech dynamics. Let’s look at the key moments from the first half of the year. Tracking the 2025 US Semiconductor Market The year 2025 has proven eventful for the US semiconductor industry. The industry is central to the ongoing ‘AI race’, making its developments highly relevant. From leadership changes at major companies to significant policy shifts and market reactions, the landscape is constantly evolving. Navigating AI Chip Export Restrictions Export restrictions on advanced AI chip export have been a dominant theme. These rules, aimed at limiting China’s access to cutting-edge AI technology, have directly impacted major players like Nvidia and AMD. The proposed, then rescinded, ‘Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule’ by the Biden administration and subsequent guidance from the Trump administration highlight the volatile nature of this policy area. Companies are grappling with compliance while trying to maintain global market share. Intel’s Strategic Shifts and Intel Layoffs Intel, a foundational company in the US semiconductor market , has seen substantial activity. A major change came with the appointment of Lip-Bu Tan as CEO in March. His focus on revitalizing the company as ‘engineering-first’ quickly led to strategic decisions. In April, planned Intel layoffs of over 21,000 employees were announced, intended to streamline management and rebuild engineering focus. This was followed by news in June that specific layoffs, impacting 15-20% of the Intel Foundry staff, would begin in July. The company also announced spinning off noncore assets and exploring joint ventures, such as the rumored deal with TSMC in April. Nvidia AI Chips Face Export Headwinds Nvidia, a leader in Nvidia AI chips , has felt the direct impact of export controls. The H20 AI chip faced new licensing requirements in April, resulting in significant charges. In May, Nvidia reported a $4.5 billion charge in Q1 related to these rules, anticipating an $8 billion hit in Q2 revenue. By June, CEO Jensen Huang stated the company would exclude the Chinese market from future forecasts, signaling acceptance of the ongoing restrictions and their financial consequences. AMD Acquisitions Expand AI Capabilities AMD has been actively expanding its AI portfolio through strategic AMD acquisitions . In May, AMD acquired Enosemi, a silicon photonics startup, highlighting interest in advanced data transmission tech. This was followed by acquiring AI software optimization startup Brium in June, aimed at making AI software more compatible across different hardware platforms, including AMD’s. Another notable move in June was the ‘acqui-hire’ of the team behind Untether AI, specializing in AI inference chips, further strengthening AMD’s competitive position against rivals in the AI hardware space. The first half of 2025 underscores the intense competition, geopolitical pressures, and rapid technological advancements shaping the US semiconductor industry. Companies are adapting through leadership changes, strategic investments, workforce adjustments, and navigating complex regulatory environments. These developments will continue to influence the broader tech landscape, including areas relevant to the crypto and blockchain ecosystem that rely on advanced processing power.

The California-based company aims to increase its Bitcoin stash from the current 3,808 BTC to a staggering 105,000 BTC over the next two and a half years—equivalent to roughly 0.5% of Bitcoin’s total capped supply of 21 million. Semler outlined its roadmap in a statement on Thursday, revealing it plans to accumulate 10,000 BTC by the end of 2024, 42,000 BTC by 2026, and finally hit the 105,000 BTC milestone by 2027. The company said it would use a mix of equity offerings, debt financing, and operational cash flow to fund its Bitcoin strategy. Notably, it has appointed Bitcoin analyst Joe Burnett as its new Director of Bitcoin Strategy to lead the initiative. Joe Burnett to Spearhead Semler Scientific’s Bitcoin Strategy Burnett brings extensive experience in Bitcoin markets, having previously served as director of market research at Unchained and head analyst at Blockware Solutions. Prior to entering the crypto industry, Burnett worked at the accounting giant Ernst & Young. Speaking on his new role, Burnett stated, “The trend to adopt Bitcoin as part of corporate treasury is clearly accelerating.” Semler first entered the Bitcoin space in May 2024 and quickly climbed to 13th place among public companies in terms of BTC holdings, according to BitBo. Its move follows a broader trend among listed firms using Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Japan’s Metaplanet also recently unveiled a plan to acquire 210,000 BTC by 2027, signaling growing institutional appetite for digital assets. Critics Raise Concerns Amid Stock Price Dip However, not everyone is on board with Semler’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy. Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, warned that companies pursuing large-scale Bitcoin purchases risk diluting shareholder value if their stock prices fall too low. Sigel noted that while no firm has yet reached that breaking point, Semler is “now approaching parity.” Shares in Semler Scientific (SMLR) have dropped nearly 41% this year and are nearing the levels seen before its Bitcoin investments began. Despite the stock pressure, Semler has recorded a paper gain of $177 million as of June 3, thanks to a 287% yield on its Bitcoin buys. With 0.00034 BTC per share, the company now ranks fourth in Bitcoin exposure per share among 130 public firms tracked by BitcoinTreasuries.NET.

Get ready for some groundbreaking news that underscores just how quickly the digital asset world is integrating with traditional finance. A recent report from leading crypto infrastructure firm Fireblocks paints a vivid picture: institutional crypto adoption for payments is not just a future concept; it’s happening now, at scale. Institutional Crypto Adoption: The Striking Reality Imagine nearly half of the world’s major companies and financial institutions already leveraging digital currencies for their payment needs. That’s exactly what Fireblocks’ May 22 report, published on their official blog, reveals. According to their findings, a significant 49% of global institutions are actively using stablecoins for payments right now. But the momentum doesn’t stop there. An additional 41% are either in the piloting phase or actively planning their stablecoin payment strategies. This means a staggering 90% of surveyed institutions are already engaged or preparing to engage with stablecoins for transactional purposes. This isn’t just a niche trend anymore. It’s a fundamental shift in how businesses are thinking about moving value across borders and within their operations. The data suggests that the perceived barriers to entry are lowering, and the tangible benefits are becoming too compelling to ignore. Why Are Stablecoins Becoming Essential for Business Payments? The rapid move towards stablecoins for business payments isn’t happening without good reason. Stablecoins, typically pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, offer the best of both worlds: the efficiency and speed of cryptocurrencies combined with the relative price stability of traditional fiat currencies. This stability is crucial for businesses that need predictable transaction costs and value transfer. Here are some key benefits driving this adoption: Speed and Efficiency: Traditional payment systems, especially cross-border ones, can be slow, taking days to settle. Stablecoins can settle in minutes or seconds, enabling faster business cycles. Reduced Costs: Transaction fees on blockchain networks using stablecoins are often significantly lower than traditional banking fees, particularly for international transfers. 24/7 Availability: Unlike banks that operate during business hours, blockchain networks are always on, allowing businesses to send and receive payments anytime, anywhere. Transparency and Traceability: Transactions are recorded on a public or permissioned ledger, offering greater transparency and easier reconciliation. Programmability: Stablecoins can be integrated into smart contracts, enabling automated payments, escrow services, and complex financial operations. Access to New Markets: Stablecoins can facilitate payments in regions where traditional banking infrastructure is limited or costly. These advantages directly address pain points that businesses face daily, making stablecoins a powerful tool for modern finance. Cross-Border Payments Crypto: Leading the Charge One area where stablecoins are particularly impactful is cross-border payments crypto . The Fireblocks report specifically highlights strong momentum in North America, detailing the specific use cases where institutions are deploying stablecoin-based payment flows. Cross-border transfers lead the pack, with 39% of North American institutions using stablecoins for this purpose. Why is this use case so popular? International payments are notoriously slow, expensive, and opaque using traditional methods. Stablecoins offer a near-instantaneous, cost-effective alternative that bypasses complex correspondent banking networks. This is a game-changer for companies operating globally, enabling faster supply chain finance, easier international payroll, and quicker settlement with international partners. Beyond cross-border transfers, North American institutions are also leveraging stablecoins for: Use Case % of North American Institutions Using Stablecoins Cross-Border Transfers 39% Payment Acceptance 22% Merchant Settlement 18% Internal Treasury Operations 12% B2B Invoicing 9% This breakdown shows that stablecoins are finding diverse applications within the enterprise, from handling external payments (acceptance, settlement, invoicing) to optimizing internal financial flows (treasury operations). Enterprise Blockchain Payments: Fueled by Regulatory Confidence The Fireblocks report also sheds light on a crucial factor accelerating enterprise blockchain payments , particularly in North America: regulatory outlook. A striking 88% of North American respondents expressed a positive outlook on stablecoin regulations. This high level of confidence in the regulatory environment is a significant driver for institutional adoption. Regulatory clarity is often cited as one of the biggest hurdles for traditional institutions entering the crypto space. The positive sentiment in North America suggests that efforts by regulators and policymakers in the region are building confidence among businesses. As institutions feel more secure about the legal and compliance frameworks surrounding stablecoins, they are more willing to invest in and deploy these technologies for core business functions. This regulatory comfort reduces perceived risk and encourages further exploration and implementation of digital asset strategies within large organizations. The Future of Payments Stablecoins: What’s Next? With nearly half of global institutions already on board and another 41% planning their move, it’s clear that the future of payments stablecoins is bright. The trend highlighted by Fireblocks suggests we are moving towards a world where digital currencies are a standard tool in the corporate finance toolkit. What can we expect to see next? Expansion of Use Cases: Expect stablecoins to be used for more complex financial activities like tokenized real-world assets, supply chain finance automation, and even potentially for employee payroll. Increased Integration: Stablecoin payment solutions will become more seamlessly integrated into existing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and treasury management platforms. Global Harmonization (Eventual): While North America shows strong positive sentiment, regulatory clarity is needed globally to unlock the full potential of cross-border stablecoin payments worldwide. Rise of CBDCs and Other Digital Currencies: The success of stablecoins may pave the way for the adoption of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and other forms of digital money within the enterprise. The report indicates a clear trajectory towards greater digital asset utilization in corporate finance. Actionable Insights for Businesses If your business isn’t yet exploring stablecoins for payments, this report is a wake-up call. Here are some actionable steps: Educate Your Team: Understand what stablecoins are, how they work, and their potential benefits and risks. Identify Key Pain Points: Where in your current payment processes (especially cross-border) are you facing delays, high costs, or lack of transparency? Stablecoins might offer a solution. Start Small: Consider piloting stablecoin payments for a specific use case, like settling with a particular international vendor or accepting payments from a specific group of customers. Choose the Right Partner: Work with reputable crypto infrastructure providers (like Fireblocks and others) who can offer secure, compliant, and scalable solutions for institutional needs. Stay Informed on Regulation: Keep track of regulatory developments in your operating regions. Ignoring this trend could mean missing out on significant efficiency gains and cost savings. Conclusion: A New Era of Enterprise Payments is Here The Fireblocks report provides compelling evidence that institutional crypto adoption is rapidly transforming the global payment landscape. With nearly half of global institutions already using stablecoins for payments and a vast majority either using, piloting, or planning their integration, the momentum is undeniable. Stablecoins offer tangible benefits in terms of speed, cost, and efficiency, making them increasingly attractive for everything from cross-border transfers to internal treasury operations. Fueled by growing regulatory clarity, particularly in regions like North America, businesses are gaining the confidence needed to leverage these digital assets at scale. The future of enterprise payments is digital, and stablecoins are playing a pivotal role in making that future a reality today.

The breach reportedly exposed 16 billion usernames and passwords from platforms including Apple, Facebook, Google, and several government services. Ardoino shared the news via social media platform X, lambasting the security flaws of cloud-based storage. “The cloud has failed us. Again,” he wrote . “It’s time to ditch the cloud.” His statement was in direct response to the breach that experts have called a “blueprint for mass exploitation.” Tether CTO mulls new password manager Ardoino, whose company Tether issues the world’s most-used stablecoin, USDT, described PearPass as the solution to failures in cloud-based security systems. He reiterated that PearPass will be “fully local” and “open-source,” meaning users will store all their data, including passwords and encryption keys, directly on their devices rather than on remote servers. “ No cloud. No servers. No leaks. Ever ,” Ardoino remarked. Tether has not confirmed if PearPass will be integrated with any existing platforms. However, the company’s previous ventures provide some clues. The cloud has failed us. Again. 16 billion passwords just leaked. It’s time to ditch the cloud. That’s why we’ve been building PearPass — coming soon. A fully local, open-source password manager. No cloud. No servers. No leaks. Ever. Just you — and your keys, stored securely… https://t.co/FkL1wrdpCo pic.twitter.com/wynlieJ2E4 — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) June 19, 2025 In 2022, Tether partnered with Holepunch and Synonym to launch Pear Credit, a peer-to-peer financial system enabling decentralized lending. Largest credential leak exposes password hashes According to a report from Forbes , the private information dump involves login credentials harvested from several platforms and online services, the most known breach of its kind. Cybersecurity researchers have identified 30 distinct datasets linked to the breach, each containing an average of 3.5 billion records. The compromised data was supposedly stolen from social media platforms, VPN providers, developer portals, and both corporate and government accounts. Investigators noted that many of the stolen credentials appear to have been gathered as recently as early 2025 Another analysis of the dataset said it includes stolen data from infostealer malware, credential stuffing operations, and repackaged leaks from previous breaches. There is currently no reliable method to determine how many unique users have been affected due to overlapping records, but analysts confirmed that the data follows a pattern of URLs, followed by login details and a password hashes. This format is used by modern infostealers and involves malicious software that can extract sensitive data such as credentials, browser cookies, and tokens from infected devices. “ The inclusion of both old and recent infostealer logs, often with tokens, cookies, and metadata, makes this data particularly dangerous ,” researchers noted. Philosophy of security in technology The timing of PearPass’s announcement is against the backdrop of CEO Ardoino’s advocacy for technologies that function independently of centralized infrastructure. In a June 19 podcast talk with tech investor Anthony Pompliano, he explained his vision for “worst-case scenario” tools. “ If we are living in a disaster scenario, we need to be able to have technology that works locally first ,” Ardoino said. “ My mission is to prove that you can build great technology that is human-first. ” He mentioned the work of Tether’s encrypted P2P platform HolePunch, and a new artificial intelligence runtime, Tether AI, as examples of this philosophy. Tether AI is being designed as a device-agnostic, open-source AI framework that can run offline and integrate directly with crypto wallets through Tether’s wallet development kit (WDK). Outside of developing security solutions, the US Department of Justice credited the stablecoin issuer earlier this week for the seizure of roughly $225 million in USDT, linked to a global “pig butchering” scheme.

This meme coin beats SHIB, DOGE, and PEPE",https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/20/want-a-cheap-entry-to-a-100x-play-this-meme-coin-beats-shib-doge-and-pepe/,"Early to the party always has a field day in the meme coin space. First, it happened with Dogecoin, then came Shiba Inu, and Pepe Coin followed similarly. Investors who purchased these coins before the price surge experienced substantial returns. Yet today, all three carry a hefty price tag—and a thirsty market looking for the next wild ride. If you’ve been wishing for a fresh chance to catch the next meme‑coin rocket before liftoff, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) might just be the under‑the‑radar gem you’ve been waiting for. The meme token landscape: why timing matters Crypto history is littered with coins whose best days are behind them. Early Shiba holders reveled in 100,000x gains, but now, SHIB trades well above the dollar‑per‑token range retirees dream of. Dogecoin’s community remains passionate, yet its mainstream price reflects much of that optimism already baked in. Pepe Coin exploded once, but its parabolic climb came with brutal corrections. In a market where timing defines success, a lower entry point—coupled with fresh momentum—can tilt the scales in your favor. Enter Little Pepe: a Layer 2 chain built for memes Little Pepe isn’t another token slapped onto Ethereum or Solana. It’s the first blockchain designed exclusively for meme projects, running as a Layer 2 solution on Ethereum’s foundation. Little Pepe offers laughably low fees and rock‑solid security by handling transactions off the main chain. Think of it as giving every meme creator and hodler a private highway for sending frogs around the globe, without waiting in the tollbooth line or watching their ETH vanish in gas. Tokenomics that reward true believers It’s one thing to have a catchy name and bold promises. It’s another to back them with thoughtful token distribution. Little Pepe launched with a total supply of 100 billion LILPEPE tokens. Half of that came straight to presale participants, ensuring early believers share directly in any upside. Ten percent fuels liquidity pools, and another ten percent is locked for DEX listings, so when LILPEPE hits exchanges, the market won’t dry up. Marketing gets a ten‑percent slice, powering viral campaigns and influencer partnerships without draining community funds. Thirteen and a half percent goes to staking rewards, encouraging diamond‑handed loyalty. The remaining tokens bolster chain reserves, ready for smooth upgrades and ecosystem growth. Presale performance: proof in the pudding A true test for any token is how it performs before it even lists. Little Pepe’s presale wasn’t just a slow trickle—it was a tsunami. The first stage, priced at a mere $0.0011 per token, sold out in 72 hours. The second stage vanished even faster, putting over $1.18 million in the project’s coffers. Now, as the presale approaches its final chapter, latecomers can still stake a claim before LILPEPE rockets onto public exchanges. And if that weren’t enough, Little Pepe launched a $777,000 giveaway—10 lucky winners will each pocket $77,000 worth of tokens, further electrifying the community atmosphere. Roadmap to meme‑chain supremacy Little Pepe’s journey reads like an epic saga. It began in the cryptowomb, with Whales and Frog‑fans buzzing about for a presale launch. Next came the birth: listing on top decentralized and centralized exchanges, an aggressive marketing blitz, and a moon‑ready market cap target that has the community chanting “BRRRR.” As LILPEPE gains steam, the network will morph from novelty to necessity—hosting meme launchpads, onboarding developers eager to drip on its Layer 2 rails, and crowning Little Pepe as the undisputed king of meme chains. The 100x equation: cheap entry, massive potential At just $0.0011 in early presale, Little Pepe gives newcomers a chance at astronomical upside without emptying their wallets. To turn $100 into $10,000, you don’t need a top‑20 coin—what you need is a project with room to grow, a path to real usage, and a community that refuses to let the dream die. With its outstanding presale metrics, layered tokenomics, and singular focus on meme‑chain performance, LILPEPE ticks all the boxes for anyone hunting that next 100x return. Final thoughts: are you ready to hop on? Little Pepe offers a fresh narrative and a genuine technological edge in a market where everyone’s chasing last cycle’s heroes. It’s built by meme lovers, for meme lovers, combining zero taxes, lightning‑fast confirmations, and fair presale opportunities into one potent package. If you’ve ever watched the rocket launch post‑mortem and thought, “If only I’d known sooner,” this is your moment. The next golden meme age isn’t a distant prophecy—it’s unfolding right now. And Little Pepe is leading the charge. Miss this chance, and you may find yourself back on the sidelines when the froggy frenzy takes off. Buy cheap. Hold tight. Enjoy the ride.

Posting on X , CZ cautioned that even video call verifications may soon be unreliable. He urged the community to avoid installing any software from unofficial links, especially when prompted during suspicious interactions. Reason to panic? Here’s everything we know. Crypto Influencer Hacked After Deepfake Zoom Call CZ’s warning came after Japanese crypto influencer Mai Fujimoto revealed that her main X account was hacked. The breach happened after she joined a Zoom call, believing she was speaking with a trusted friend. What she didn’t know was that her contact’s Telegram account had already been compromised. During the call, a deepfaked version of the acquaintance told her to click a link to fix an audio issue. That’s when the attack happened. ‘She shared a link for audio settings adjustment, and that’s when the attack occurred,’ Fujimoto wrote. Soon after, her Telegram and Metamask accounts were also accessed, putting her crypto assets at risk. A Growing Trend of AI-Powered Scams Fujimoto’s trial is part of a disturbing pattern. On Thursday, reports surfaced of BlueNoroff , a North Korean-linked cybercrime group, targeting a cryptocurrency foundation employee with the same tactic. Over weeks of Zoom calls, the victim saw AI-generated deepfakes of company executives. A prompted download for a “microphone fix” installed a malicious extension, unleashing a keylogger, screen recorder, and crypto-stealing malware. These attacks show how AI can assist hackers in making scams, especially against crypto workers and remote employees. Zhao Urges the Community to Stay Alert CZ’s message is simple but serious: don’t trust software links from unofficial sources, and question the authenticity of video calls. As deepfake technology improves, online scams are becoming harder to detect. AI already used in new types deepfake hacking. Even a video call verification will soon be out of the window. Don't install software from a non-official link, especially NOT from your ""friends"" (they are most likely hacked). https://t.co/kfRSDPiJWb — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) June 20, 2025 For anyone in the crypto space, staying cautious is no longer optional.

Nonetheless, the token has still been a somewhat profitable investment for early adopters. Here’s how much you’d have if you’d had the foresight to invest $10,000 in SHIB back in June 2022. A $10,000 investment in SHIB in 2022 On June 20, 2022, Shiba Inu was trading at an opening price of $0.000008208, according to data from CoinMarketCap. In other words, a $10,000 investment back then would have translated to roughly 1,217,920,0002 SHIB tokens in your crypto wallet . The price at that point was the culmination of a gradual downtrend that started in October 2021. While the price had its short-term ups and downs in the following period, the token only managed to pick up some steam 20 months later, in February 2024. As a result, the price climbed to $0.00003504 on March 10, 2024. Afterwards, SHIB went on another decline. It briefly recovered in the final weeks of 2024, trading at $0.00003198 on December 8. But, as mentioned, the price started to drop continuously at the beginning of January 2025. How much SHIB would you have now? At the time of writing, June 20, 2025, SHIB price sits at $0.00001165, meaning it’s up 41.94% from its price exactly three years ago, on June 20, 2022. The 1,217,920,0002 SHIB you could’ve acquired for $10,000 three years ago would now be worth $14,189. In other words, you would’ve made $4,189, making a 41.89% return on your investment.

While that’s reassuring for long-term ETH holders, it pales in comparison to what’s unfolding around Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). With 150% potential locked into its launch structure and more than $5 million already raised, BTC-S isn’t a project investors are waiting to rise; it’s one they’re racing to join. For those who missed out on ETH early or sold BTC too soon, this might be the cleanest second chance crypto has offered in years. Ethereum Remains Solid, But Bitcoin Solaris Moves Faster Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency for a reason. It was the first to truly unlock decentralized smart contracts and continues to evolve with upgrades like staking and sharding. But even with all its influence, Ethereum still struggles with high gas fees, limited mobile accessibility, and occasional congestion. That’s where Bitcoin Solaris is gaining attention. It solves problems Ethereum still faces while building for the mobile-first world of 2025 and beyond. It’s not just Ethereum’s future rewritten. It’s a smarter, fairer, more inclusive ecosystem. Let’s compare the two: Feature Ethereum Bitcoin Solaris TPS ~15 (Layer 1) 10,000+ with 2-second finality Consensus Proof-of-Stake Hybrid Proof-of-Work + DPoS Energy Use Moderate Ultra-efficient hybrid model Smart Contract Language Solidity Rust Mining Not available Available via mobile + browser Launch Gains Organic growth Structured 150% presale ROI Validator Rotation Static 24-hour rotation for decentralization Core Highlights of Bitcoin Solaris What makes BTC-S a standout in the 2025 altcoin space isn’t just price projections; it’s the depth of the ecosystem. From high-speed architecture to real-world accessibility, here are the most exciting features: Dual-consensus model combining Bitcoin’s SHA-256 PoW with lightning-fast DPoS. Validator rotation every 24 hours to maintain decentralization and reduce collusion. Rust-based smart contracts, ideal for DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise-grade apps. Bridge infrastructure for seamless cross-chain asset transfers. Security features include zero-knowledge proof support, slashing for bad validators, and adaptive performance scoring for miners. This isn’t theory. These features are already functional or actively under development, making BTC-S one of the most advanced blockchain launches of the year. What Ethereum Promised, Bitcoin Solaris Is Actually Delivering Wealth Building Through the Solaris Nova App One of Bitcoin Solaris’s most powerful differentiators is its mining accessibility. Through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova app, users can mine BTC-S across smartphones, laptops, desktops, and even in-browser. Benefits of this model include: Real-time mining dashboards and adaptive energy-saving modes Competitive leaderboards and gamification elements for consistent engagement Smart contract-powered Mining Power Marketplace to buy or rent hash power Easy earning estimation via the BTC-S mining calculator The result is a mining system that isn’t exclusive to whales or tech experts; it’s for everyone. 150% Presale Potential And Time’s Running Out The BTC-S presale is currently in Phase 8, priced at $8. The next price jump to $9 is imminent, and the final launch price is locked at $20. That means: Over $5M raised so far 11,500+ unique users already in Only 6 weeks left until the July 31, 2025 launch What’s more, the presale is being called the shortest and most explosive in the space right now. It’s being featured across analyst channels like Crypto Show , where influencers are breaking down exactly why BTC-S has the mechanics to outperform.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin Solaris is offering a structured, verified path to 150% returns within weeks, not months. It has a clear roadmap, real-time development momentum, and a mobile-first model that invites anyone to participate. It’s not just the next big token. It’s a new way of building crypto wealth.

Back then, its community-driven fervor and low‐cost entry point made it the talk of every Twitter thread. Today, however, SHIB finds itself grappling with stiff resistance. Trading volumes have cooled from their peak, and even dedicated holders admit that sustaining those past parabolic moves will require fresh catalysts—a challenge in an increasingly crowded meme‐coin arena. The token’s supply remains vast, and without regular token burns or a surge of mainstream adoption, SHIB’s price action struggles to break through critical ceilings. Meanwhile, a new kid on the block is set to make crypto millionaires in the next bull run. The grand entry of Little Pepe Just when many assumed the meme‐coin party was slowing down, a fresh contender emerges from the swamp. Little Pepe—known by his token symbol LILPEPE —isn’t content to follow the playbook. Rather than chase social media hype alone, this baby frog is building its pond: a dedicated Layer‑2 blockchain designed specifically for memes. The goal is bold yet simple: combine ultra‑low fees with lightning‑fast transaction speeds, all wrapped in the irreverent spirit of meme culture. At its core, Little Pepe promises a platform where users can not only trade LILPEPE tokens without fearing exorbitant gas fees but also launch their meme projects using a built‑in meme launchpad. The architects behind the project—seasoned developers known for guiding previous top‐tier memes—aim to eliminate rug pulls and tax mechanics that so often sully the DeFi space. Instead, they’ve baked in zero‑tax trading and robust liquidity measures to ensure a safer, more transparent environment. A frenzied presale signals massive appetite Behind the playful branding lies a carefully engineered token structure. Half of the entire supply is set aside for presale participants—a clear nod to rewarding the believers who spotted Little Pepe before it became a household name. Little Pepe’s presale phases have showcased the community’s hunger for a truly decentralized meme coin. The initial stage sold out within seventy‑two hours, and the second phase closed even faster than anticipated. To date, the project has pulled in over $1.18 million—all before the official launch. That kind of traction speaks volumes: it’s not just hype, but tangible demand from investors eager to back a fresh narrative in the meme‐coin universe. LILPEPE currently trades at a modest $0.0011 during presale, but the real draw lies in its upside potential. With a total supply capped at 100 billion tokens, the groundwork is laid for meaningful scarcity once the token enters broader markets. Early backers are already daydreaming about the moment the presale wraps and LILPEPE appears on Uniswap and leading centralized exchanges. A roadmap written in meme magic Little Pepe’s journey is mapped out in three whimsical yet meaningful stages: Pregnancy, Birth, and Growth. During Pregnancy, the project was cooked in the “cryptowomb,” building community buzz and forging partnerships. Now, at Birth—marked by the presale’s blistering success—the baby frog is poised for liftoff, eyeing top‐tier listings and a monumental marketing blitz. Finally, Growth envisions the moment Little Pepe secures its place as a top‑100 market cap contender, cementing its Layer‑2 blockchain as the undisputed home for all things meme. This roadmap isn’t just a clever story; it’s a blueprint for execution. Each phase unlocks new utilities and network effects, transforming LILPEPE from a niche wonder to a mainstream contender. And unlike many vapor‑projects that fizzle before their first birthday, Little Pepe carries the backing of experienced developers and a clearly defined path forward. Why a 19044% surge isn’t out of the question In the crypto world, dramatic percentages tend to follow disruptive ideas. The combination of a meme‑fueled community, a dedicated Layer‑2 infrastructure, and tokenomics designed for growth gives Little Pepe the ingredients for an outsized rally. As transaction fees on Ethereum remain a barrier for many, a zero‑tax, gas‑friendly alternative crafted just for memes could redirect a flood of capital into LILPEPE. Moreover, the promise of sniper‑bot immunity—ensuring fair launches—and planned listings on major exchanges could amplify buying pressure at key moments. When nostalgia for meme culture meets the frictionless mechanics of modern DeFi, explosive moves become far more than wishful thinking. A new chapter in the meme‑coin saga Shiba Inu’s quiet stall has opened space for the next legend to rise. Little Pepe might just claim that mantle, uniting the irreverence of meme culture with genuine blockchain innovation. As 2025 unfolds, those willing to look beyond the familiar shiba silhouette might find themselves holding the very token that ushers in the Golden Meme Age—complete with blazing‑fast blocks, barely‑there fees, and the kind of breakout story that legends are made of.

This move by the top healthcare brand, which is tied directly to Donald Trump’s renewed policy focus on crypto, has triggered widespread crypto market interest. Now, analysts are taking notice of a lesser-known altcoin, FloppyPepe (FPPE) , which they believe could deliver major returns in the current market cycle. Top Healthcare Brand Backs Donald Trump-Led Strategy As Bitcoin (BTC) Nears Breakout The recent addition of Lopez, the Donald Trump insider to the top healthcare brand, Prenetics Global’s $20 million Bitcoin (BTC) strategy, underscores the company’s commitment to capitalizing on the digital asset space. The appointment of this former Donald Trump advisor coincides with a widely circulated chart comparing Bitcoin’s (BTC) price to the Global M2 Money Supply, suggesting a major breakout may be near. With M2 surging and Bitcoin (BTC) historically lagging such moves by around 100 days, analysts now forecast a potential rally to $150,000, a move this top healthcare brand appears to be strategically positioning for. Bitcoin’s (BTC) Move Sparks Altcoin Frenzy: FloppyPepe (FPPE) Emerges As Contender As Bitcoin (BTC) gains renewed legitimacy through Donald Trump’s endorsement and institutional moves like the top healthcare brand’s $20 million allocation, the spotlight is also shifting to assets with massive potential. One such crypto asset, FloppyPepe (FPPE), is quietly building the kind of real-world functionality that analysts say could trigger exponential growth. The altcoin project is deploying AI-powered platforms like FloppyX AI Agent and Meme-o-Matic that are already functional in beta , allowing users to create and monetize their content at scale. Key practical utilities already live or are in testing: AI Meme Contests that reward creators with token prizes Interactive storytelling with evolving AI personalities Automated video production tailored to current trends These tools don’t just entertain, they build economic value. By empowering users to produce, own, and trade viral content, the platform creates a functional, tokenized media ecosystem that analysts believe could deliver outsized returns. In combination with the altcoin’s low-cap valuation and a fast-growing community, FloppyPepe (FPPE) exhibits the capabilities of turning early utility into massive upside. 80% Bonus And Low Entry Backs FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Explosive Potential While top healthcare brands and other institutional buyers scoop up Bitcoin (BTC), FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) presale continues to gain momentum. Priced at just $0.00000035 , with an 80% token bonus activated using code FLOPPY80 , the project has already secured over $2,400,000 in liquidity within just a few months. Now, with the bonus still live, early participants have a rare opportunity to lock in massive token allocations at near-ground-floor prices — a setup analysts say could yield substantial returns in the coming weeks. This isn’t just hype; the altcoin’s floppynomics are specifically engineered for sustainable growth: Deflationary model with 1% annual token burn 1% redistribution to holders on every transaction 1% to charity, aligning purpose with profit Zero transaction tax for frictionless trading SolidProof-audited smart contract and locked liquidity Floppypepe (FPPE) is also preparing to roll out cross-chain bridges to Solana and Binance Smart Chain (BSC), dramatically increasing accessibility and liquidity across ecosystems. Coupled with global brand partnerships and the onboarding of top crypto influencers, this altcoin is building a scalable framework to support its meteoric rise. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Low Entry Presale Is Where Massive Upside Lives Bitcoin’s (BTC) value proposition as digital gold is solidifying, with figures like Donald Trump guiding its treasury role, as top healthcare brand Prenetics makes its latest move. However, despite Donald Trump’s backing and Bitcoin’s (BTC) increased institutional capital inflow, sharp analysts believe the altcoin space is where exponential upside lives and FloppyPepe (FPPE) is quickly becoming the standout candidate. The ongoing presale discount at $0.00000035 , bolstered by the 80% bonus code: FLOPPY80 , presents a rare early-stage opportunity to acquire tokens before Tier 1 exchange listings and major AI platform launches. As the presale window narrows, the risk isn’t just in waiting; it’s in missing the breakout moment of this altcoin. Projects with this level of early momentum, tech backing, and deflationary structure don’t stay under the radar for long, making their current phase one of the most lucrative early entries in this bull market.

46404132,https://invezz.com/?p=2771065,1750412801,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Bitcoin Pepe price outlook as $4B BTC and ETH expiries near,https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/20/bitcoin-pepe-price-outlook-as-4b-btc-and-eth-expiries-near/,"Bitcoin, Ethereum exhibited resilience on Friday as a massive $4.11 billion in BTC and ETH options contracts are set to expire today, June 20, 2025. The expiry is expected to have a short-term impact on the cryptocurrency prices. Amid this expected volatility, Bitcoin Pepe is emerging as a contender with its unique offerings. BTC and ETH show resilience At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $105,936.96, gaining over 1% in the last 24 hours . Ethereum was around $2,549.94, also posting similar gains in the time period. BTC and ETH have been facing slight selling pressure in the last hour. The expiring options include $3.5 billion in Bitcoin contracts and $565.13 million in Ethereum contracts, leading market participants to anticipate potential volatility. According to data from Deribit, the current Bitcoin options expiration involves 33,972 contracts, an increase from 27,959 contracts last week. For Ethereum, 224,509 contracts are expiring, which is a decrease from 246,849 contracts the previous week. For Bitcoin, the expiring options have a maximum pain price of $105,000 and a put-to-call ratio of 1.00. This ratio suggests a relatively even distribution between bearish (put options) and bullish (call options) positions among traders. However, an examination of call and put open interests indicates a slight prevalence of put options, which could suggest a mild bearish sentiment or hedging activity. Conversely, Ethereum’s expiring options show a lean towards bullish sentiment, with a put-to-call ratio of 0.69 and a maximum pain price of $2,600. The maximum pain point is a metric that indicates the price level at which the majority of options contracts would expire worthless, potentially resulting in the largest financial loss for traders. Ethereum is trading below its maximum pain level, which might align with the observed bullish outlook and a higher concentration of call options, indicating bets on price increases. Bitcoin is currently trading above its maximum pain level, showing increased buyer activity. Markets typically stabilise after options expirations as traders adjust to new price conditions. Given the high volume of today’s expiration, a similar outcome could occur, potentially influencing broader crypto market trends into the weekend. Bitcoin Pepe continues momentum Bitcoin Pepe is carving a unique niche in the crypto market by combining meme appeal with tangible real-world functionality. Unlike typical meme tokens that thrive solely on hype, Bitcoin Pepe distinguishes itself with a clear technical roadmap and a focus on infrastructure development. The investors are rewarding the token as the project has successfully raised more than $15 million through its ongoing presale. The team has announced that Bitcoin Pepe’s native token, BPEP, will soon be listed on MEXC and BitMart. These listings are anticipated to significantly boost the token’s visibility, liquidity, and credibility as it prepares for a wider launch. The team has also released images showing the work they are doing to ensure the project is up to high standards. The project team is set to make a listing announcement on June 30. The team is taking time to secure additional partnerships with centralised cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs), aiming for a more impactful launch for the BPEP token. In a move to reward early supporters, all existing investors who have already purchased BPEP tokens will also receive a 30% bonus on their holdings.

For institutions looking to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the opportunities within crypto, the landscape is becoming increasingly sophisticated. A major development is the launch of institutional restaking vaults by Renzo Protocol in partnership with Concrete finance, built on the innovative EigenLayer network. What are Renzo’s Institutional Restaking Vaults? Renzo Protocol, known for its liquid restaking solutions, has teamed up with Concrete finance, an infrastructure provider, to create a dedicated pathway for institutional participation on EigenLayer . These new Institutional Restaking Vaults are not just another crypto product; they are specifically tailored for major players in the financial world. Imagine a secure, customizable gateway designed for: Asset issuers Financial institutions Curators Networks These vaults offer a structured way for these entities to engage with liquid restaking opportunities available through EigenLayer, as initially reported by PR Newswire. It’s about providing a compliant and familiar framework for sophisticated investors to access the yield and security benefits offered by restaking. Why is Institutional Restaking a Game Changer? The introduction of specialized vaults for institutions marks a pivotal moment. Historically, DeFi participation for large financial entities has been challenging due to regulatory uncertainty, operational complexities, and the need for tailored solutions that meet their specific risk and compliance requirements. Institutional restaking addresses many of these hurdles. By providing a dedicated channel, Renzo and Concrete are essentially building a bridge. This bridge allows institutions to: Access novel yield-generating strategies on EigenLayer . Participate in securing various decentralized networks. Manage their exposure within a framework designed for their scale and needs. This move is expected to unlock significant capital and expertise from traditional finance, potentially accelerating the growth and maturity of the entire restaking ecosystem. Exploring the Benefits of These Vaults for Institutions What makes these vaults particularly attractive to institutional players? The benefits are numerous and directly address the pain points institutions face when entering DeFi: 1. Tailored Compliance and Structure: Unlike public DeFi protocols, these vaults can be customized to adhere to specific regulatory requirements and internal compliance frameworks that institutions must follow. Concrete finance’s infrastructure plays a key role here. 2. Enhanced Security Measures: Institutional capital requires the highest level of security. These vaults are built with additional layers of security protocols and operational safeguards designed to protect large asset bases. 3. Customizable Restaking Strategies: Institutions have diverse investment goals and risk appetites. The vaults allow for tailored strategies regarding which Actively Validated Services (AVSs) on EigenLayer they interact with, enabling them to optimize for specific yield or security profiles. 4. Operational Efficiency: Managing restaking across multiple protocols can be complex. These vaults streamline the process, providing a single point of access and management for institutional-scale liquid restaking . 5. Access to Unique Yield Opportunities: Restaking on EigenLayer offers yields derived from providing security and services to various decentralized protocols. These vaults provide institutions with structured access to these potentially attractive, uncorrelated yield sources. 6. Partnership with Established Players: Working with Renzo Protocol and Concrete finance offers institutions the confidence of engaging with known entities building on the robust EigenLayer framework. This structured approach is crucial for institutions accustomed to regulated and predictable financial environments. It lowers the barrier to entry while maintaining necessary standards. Are There Challenges or Considerations for Institutional Restaking? While the benefits are compelling, institutions considering institutional restaking should also be aware of potential challenges: Regulatory Evolution: The regulatory landscape for crypto and DeFi is still evolving globally. Institutions must navigate this uncertainty and ensure their participation remains compliant with current and future regulations. Smart Contract Risk: Like all DeFi protocols, restaking involves smart contract risk. While audits and security measures are in place, the possibility of bugs or exploits cannot be entirely eliminated. Market Volatility: The underlying assets and yields in DeFi can be highly volatile. Institutions need robust risk management frameworks to handle potential fluctuations. Operational Complexity: Although the vaults aim to simplify things, integrating DeFi operations with existing institutional systems can still present technical and operational challenges. Understanding and mitigating these risks is paramount for successful institutional restaking participation. Examples and Use Cases for Institutional Restaking Vaults How might institutions actually use these vaults? The possibilities are diverse: Asset Managers: Could use vaults to allocate a portion of their portfolio to gain exposure to DeFi yields generated through liquid restaking on EigenLayer , potentially enhancing overall fund performance. Treasury Management: Corporations holding significant crypto assets could utilize vaults for treasury management, generating yield on otherwise idle assets. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): Large DAOs with substantial treasuries might use these vaults for diversified yield generation or to support specific protocols building on EigenLayer. Custodians: Could integrate vault access into their services, allowing their institutional clients to participate in restaking through a trusted provider. These examples highlight how institutional restaking can be integrated into various financial strategies, offering new avenues for growth and participation in the decentralized economy. Actionable Insights for Institutions and Protocols For institutions watching this space, the launch of these vaults by Renzo Protocol and Concrete finance is a signal that the infrastructure for serious participation is maturing. It’s time to move beyond just observing and begin exploring: Evaluate your internal readiness for engaging with DeFi technologies. Assess the potential benefits of liquid restaking yields within your existing investment strategies. Engage with providers like Renzo and Concrete to understand the specific features and compliance frameworks of their institutional restaking solutions. For protocols and AVSs building on EigenLayer , the increased institutional access means a potential influx of significant capital and a greater need for robust, well-documented, and secure services that meet institutional standards. Conclusion: A New Era for Institutional DeFi on EigenLayer The collaboration between Renzo Protocol and Concrete finance to launch institutional restaking vaults on EigenLayer represents a significant step forward in bringing traditional finance and DeFi closer together. By offering tailored, compliant, and secure solutions, they are lowering the barriers for asset issuers, institutions, curators, and networks to participate in the innovative world of liquid restaking . While challenges remain, the benefits in terms of accessing unique yields and contributing to decentralized network security are clear. This development is poised to drive further institutional adoption, bringing more liquidity, stability, and legitimacy to the restaking ecosystem and the broader DeFi landscape. It signals a new era where the lines between traditional and decentralized finance are increasingly blurring, opening up exciting opportunities for growth and innovation.

The California-based company first entered the Bitcoin market in May 2024 and has since significantly ramped up its treasury strategy. With its current holdings already among the highest in the corporate world, Semler is now positioning itself to become one of the most aggressive institutional Bitcoin accumulators globally. Semler Scientific’s bold treasury transformation Semler Scientific’s Bitcoin strategy marks a significant shift from its traditional focus on healthcare technology. In a press release on June 19, the company confirmed its three-year roadmap to accumulate over 100,000 BTC through a combination of equity financing, debt instruments, and cash flow from operations. The firm’s updated plan aims to hold 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, scale up to 42,000 BTC by the end of 2026, and ultimately reach 105,000 BTC before the close of 2027. According to its latest disclosures, Semler currently holds 4,449 BTC, valued at approximately $464 million at prevailing market prices. This recent figure reflects the company’s continued commitment to growing its Bitcoin reserves, having started its accumulation journey just over a year ago. Joe Burnett appointed to head the Bitcoin Strategy To guide this bold transformation, Semler Scientific appointed Joe Burnett as its Director of Bitcoin Strategy. Burnett, a well-known figure in the Bitcoin ecosystem, previously worked at Unchained as Director of Market Research and held earlier roles at Blockware Solutions and EY. Under his leadership, Semler’s treasury strategy will be anchored in a deep conviction that Bitcoin is the “ultimate long-duration asset.” Burnett has emphasised that this strategy is not a short-term bet but rather a long-term position designed to deliver lasting shareholder value. He also pointed to a broader shift in corporate finance, where an increasing number of firms are adopting Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. Semler has registered notable gains from its BTC investment Semler Scientific has already reported impressive results from its Bitcoin investments. As of June 3, the company recorded a 287% Bitcoin yield, with an unrealised gain of $177 million on its BTC holdings. Despite ongoing losses in its core healthcare operations, the company’s Bitcoin strategy has driven overall portfolio gains and market attention. According to BitcoinTreasuries.net , Semler has one of the highest Bitcoin-per-share ratios among public companies, currently standing at 0.00034 BTC per share. This ratio highlights the exposure each investor receives through equity ownership, a metric that is growing in importance among Bitcoin-focused stock traders. The price of Semler Scientific shares jumped upon the announcement Following the June 19 announcement, shares of Semler Scientific surged by more than 11% to close at $28.53 and were up +2.26 (7.08%) to $34.20 in the pre-market today at press time, signalling strong investor interest in the firm’s bold pivot. Semler Scientific stock price |Source: Google Finance However, the plan has not been without criticism or concern from market analysts and institutional players. Matthew Sigel, a crypto analyst at VanEck, warned that firms relying heavily on at-the-market equity programs to finance Bitcoin purchases may face share dilution risks. He noted that if stock prices fall too close to net asset value, companies like Semler may struggle to justify continued equity issuance. Despite these warnings, Semler remains firm in its commitment to Bitcoin, framing its strategy as a calculated and accretive move for long-term holders. The growing trend among public firms Semler’s aggressive expansion mirrors a rising trend among public companies choosing to allocate treasury reserves to Bitcoin. Japan’s Metaplanet has also announced plans to hold 210,000 BTC by 2027, equivalent to roughly 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Semler, on its part, is aiming for 0.5% of the total Bitcoin supply, underscoring the magnitude of its goal. With market conditions favourable and institutional appetite rising, Semler Scientific’s vision to become a major Bitcoin (BTC) treasury player is rapidly taking shape.

RXS Set to Soar After Listing on MEXC, BitMart & LBank appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Rexas Finance (RXS) is firing on all cylinders as it launches on three big-name crypto exchanges, including MEXC, BitMart, and LBank. Some investors now believe that a 20x rally may be in the cards, given that the launch of the token is occurring at just $0.25 following a hugely successful presale. Exchange Listings to Boost Liquidity and Exposure According to the announcement, RXS is launched on June 19, 2025, and listed on top exchanges, including BitMart, MEXC and LBank. These exchanges rank among the largest centralized crypto exchanges in daily trading volume. The platforms are highly liquid and have millions of users. It is anticipated that such exposure will cause high demand in RXS by both retail and institutional traders. Greater access by these exchanges also yields a good foundation of price discovery. There is a tight supply, as 499 million RXS tokens out of the 500 million presale allocation have already been sold, raising over $55.9 million. This represents a 99.9% completion rate for the presale. The launch price of $0.25 offers early buyers a built-in 25% gain before RXS even hits the open market. From $0.03 to $0.25—A 600% Presale Growth RXS started at just $0.03 in its first presale stage and has grown to $0.20 in its final phase that marking a 600% increase. This steady increase has been driven by good fundamentals, investor demand and a vision to see real world assets such as real estate, gold and art tokenized. As opposed to meme coins and hype-driven tokens, RXS has real use cases. The token can enable a fractional ownership of assets and makes accessing of traditional markets by investors easy using blockchain technology. Further, the launch of RXS staking provides a fresh utility layer for token holders ahead of the exchange debut. Will RXS Deliver a 20x Return? A 20x increase in the RXS presale price would leave RXS at $5. Although it may seem like a lofty goal, it is not unrealistic considering the structure of tokens, favorable presale returns, and future exchange listings. According to analysts, the expanding interest in asset-backed crypto products and institutional interest in tokenizing real-world assets (RWA) are factors that will likely drive the price of the coin in the future. An audit by CertiK is driving its positive reputation and community support. In addition, it’s simple to use token creation tools and one million token giveaways are creating the buzz. Conclusion As RXS becomes available on MEXC, BitMart, and LBank on June 19, a significant price pump may happen in a few days. Based on the scarcity of tokens, established utility, and increased exposure, Rexas Finance is one of the strongest candidates to gain 20x during the current bullish cycle.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized non-custodial lending protocol, is offering more than just price speculation—it’s offering a full financial ecosystem where users can earn passive income and unlock new utility with every deposit. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already making waves in its presale, having raised over $10.8 million in Phase 5 with more than 12,200 holders onboard. And while DOGE holders wait for the next hype cycle, early adopters of MUTM are positioning themselves for a more sustained and scalable opportunity. With the current price set at just $0.03, an investment of $1,000 now would turn into $15,000 if the token rises 15x to $0.45—a figure that doesn’t sound far-fetched considering the extensive roadmap, smart tokenomics, and innovative features being implemented. Smart Lending and mtTokens Power Passive Income At the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lies a robust P2C (peer-to-contract) lending model. This system allows anyone to become a lender by depositing assets like ETH, DAI, or AVAX into liquidity pools and earning interest that adjusts based on market demand. When borrowing demand is high, utilization increases, causing interest rates to spike and drawing in more lenders. This self-balancing mechanism incentivizes participation on both sides, creating dynamic earning opportunities without centralized control. Depositors don’t just sit idle either—they receive mtTokens, such as mtDAI or mtETH, representing their stake in the pool along with accrued interest. These mtTokens can be traded, held, or even staked within Mutuum’s safety module to earn additional MUTM tokens. Unlike DOGE, which relies primarily on community sentiment and social media triggers, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) allows users to actively generate returns through smart contract interactions. The platform will also introduce a passive dividend system, distributing a portion of protocol revenue to users who stake their mtTokens. These distributions are fueled by buybacks of MUTM on the open market, creating consistent upward pressure on price while directly rewarding long-term supporters. Over time, this cycle of buyback and reward will help deepen protocol liquidity and establish stronger price floors. Scalable Design, Strong Tokenomics, and CertiK Security Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just a high-yield opportunity—it’s also a deeply considered technical solution to some of DeFi’s biggest pain points. The protocol is being built with Layer-2 integration, ensuring faster, lower-cost transactions and higher scalability. For the average user, this means fewer fees and better usability—a welcome shift from the congestion issues seen on traditional Ethereum-based dApps. A decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin is also in the works. Unlike USDT or USDC, which rely on centralized fiat reserves, Mutuum’s stablecoin will be backed by assets held directly in its protocol. This system will allow minting based on on-chain collateral, enhancing transparency and reducing third-party risk. Additionally, interest from borrowing this stablecoin will funnel back into the protocol’s treasury, supporting sustainability while giving MUTM holders more utility and yield-generating options. From a security perspective, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already undergone a CertiK audit—the gold standard in DeFi smart contract review. With a Token Scan Score of 80.00, and methods including both manual review and static analysis, the audit reinforces confidence in the protocol’s design and execution. This commitment to security is essential, especially for a protocol aiming to handle significant volumes of user deposits and lending activity. Beta Launch, $100K Giveaway, and a Path Toward 15x Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not operating on promises—it’s delivering on its roadmap. The team plans to launch a beta version of the platform by the time the token goes live, giving early users access to core features such as lending, borrowing, staking mtToken for testing. This rollout will help create early liquidity, user feedback, and a functioning use case for MUTM from day one. Alongside development, the project is running a $100,000 giveaway campaign to expand its reach and reward the growing community. These strategic incentives are aimed at both increasing visibility and building a loyal user base ready to interact with the protocol upon launch. With a total supply of 4 billion MUTM and a listing price of $0.06 on the horizon, the upside for early investors is highly attractive. Based on the ongoing momentum and depth of utility, a 15x increase to $0.45 is within reach. A $2,000 investment at $0.03 would then be worth $30,000—demonstrating why smart investors are looking past DOGE and toward real DeFi builders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is setting a new standard for what a DeFi protocol can be. With smart yield mechanics, passive income options, scalable infrastructure, and a roadmap aligned with delivery, it offers a compelling opportunity for anyone seeking returns beyond the next meme-driven pump. In an industry flooded with noise, Mutuum is delivering signal—and the time to listen is now.

Understanding the broader landscape of geopolitical risk is crucial for any investor, and recent intelligence warnings regarding the Iran nuclear program highlight just how quickly stability can be threatened. Understanding the Latest Intelligence on the Iran Nuclear Program According to recent reports citing senior U.S. intelligence officials via the New York Times, a significant shift in Iran’s nuclear posture could be triggered by specific, critical events. The assessment suggests that Iran might move towards pursuing a nuclear weapon Iran has long claimed it doesn’t seek, under two potential scenarios: An attack by the United States on its uranium enrichment facility at Fordo. The killing of its supreme leader by Israel. This isn’t just a hypothetical exercise; it’s a high-stakes evaluation of red lines that, if crossed, could fundamentally alter the security landscape in the Middle East and beyond. For those monitoring global stability, which is intrinsically linked to market sentiment and thus, indirectly, to assets like cryptocurrencies, this intelligence is a somber reminder of underlying vulnerabilities. Why is the Fordo Facility So Critical? The Fordo facility is not just any nuclear site in Iran. Its location and design make it particularly significant and controversial: Location: It is built deep inside a mountain near the city of Qom, making it heavily fortified and difficult to attack with conventional weapons. This inherent protection has long been a point of international concern. Purpose: Fordo is primarily used for enriching uranium. While Iran states this is for civilian purposes, the level of enrichment achieved here (previously up to 20%, and more recently even higher under specific circumstances) is a key step towards weapons-grade material. Symbolism: For Iran, Fordo represents a point of national pride and a symbol of its nuclear capabilities. For the international community, particularly the U.S. and Israel, it represents a potential breakout site for rapid enrichment towards a weapon. An attack on such a deeply buried and symbolically important site would likely be seen by Tehran as a direct assault on its core national security interests and its sovereign right to pursue nuclear technology, regardless of international agreements or inspections. This is why U.S. officials believe it could be a trigger for Iran to abandon any remaining pretense and actively pursue a nuclear weapon Iran has previously stated is against its religious principles. The Weight of Leadership: The Supreme Leader Scenario The second trigger identified by U.S. intelligence is the killing of Iran’s supreme leader by Israel. This scenario highlights the deeply personal and ideological dimensions of the conflict between Iran and Israel. The supreme leader holds ultimate authority in Iran’s political and religious system. His death, particularly at the hands of a perceived enemy like Israel, would be viewed as an existential attack on the regime itself. Such an act would likely provoke an extreme response, potentially including the most drastic step available: seeking a nuclear deterrent. This scenario underscores that the potential for a nuclear weapon Iran possesses is not solely tied to technical capabilities or facility security, but also to the highest levels of political and religious leadership and the intense regional rivalries at play. The Long Shadow of Iran US Tensions These specific triggers exist within a broader, long-standing context of Iran US tensions . Relations between the two countries have been fraught for decades, marked by: The 1979 Islamic Revolution and the hostage crisis. Decades of mutual suspicion and proxy conflicts in the Middle East. The controversy surrounding Iran’s nuclear activities and international sanctions. The U.S. withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the 2015 nuclear deal. Increased military posturing and incidents in the Persian Gulf. The U.S. intelligence assessment about Fordo and the supreme leader is a direct reflection of the high level of distrust and potential for miscalculation that defines Iran US tensions . Both sides operate with a deep awareness of the other’s capabilities and potential actions, constantly evaluating red lines and potential responses. This dynamic creates a persistent state of geopolitical risk that global markets must contend with. Geopolitical Risk: How Global Tensions Impact Markets (Including Crypto) While this news might seem distant from your crypto portfolio, it’s essential to recognize the interconnectedness of global events. Significant escalations in geopolitical risk can have profound effects: Market Uncertainty: Increased tensions create fear and uncertainty, often leading investors to move away from riskier assets. Oil Prices: The Middle East is critical to global energy supply. Conflict or instability can send oil prices soaring, impacting inflation and economic stability worldwide. Sanctions and Economic Fallout: Further escalation could lead to new or stricter sanctions, disrupting global trade and financial systems. Safe Haven Flows: In times of crisis, traditional safe havens like gold or certain fiat currencies (e.g., USD) often see inflows. This can draw liquidity away from other markets, including crypto. Supply Chain Disruptions: Major conflicts can disrupt shipping lanes and supply chains, impacting businesses globally. For the crypto market, which is still relatively young and sensitive to macroeconomic shifts and global sentiment, a significant increase in geopolitical risk stemming from the Iran nuclear program or Iran US tensions could lead to increased volatility and potential price corrections. While Bitcoin is sometimes touted as a digital safe haven, its performance during geopolitical crises has been mixed, demonstrating that it is not immune to global shocks. Challenges and Potential Consequences The intelligence warning highlights several significant challenges and potential consequences: Escalation Risk: Any attack on Fordo or targeting of the leader carries an immense risk of rapid and unpredictable escalation. Proliferation Threat: If Iran decides to pursue a nuclear weapon Iran has the technical knowledge to build, it would fundamentally alter the regional power balance and could trigger a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Diplomatic Deadlock: This intelligence complicates already difficult diplomatic efforts to revive the nuclear deal or find a de-escalatory path. Regional Instability: Increased tensions between Iran, the U.S., and Israel fuel proxy conflicts and instability across the region. Navigating this complex landscape requires careful statecraft and a clear understanding of the potential triggers and red lines identified by intelligence assessments like this one. Actionable Insights for the Aware Investor While you can’t directly influence geopolitical events, being aware of intelligence like this can inform your approach to markets: Stay Informed: Monitor global news, not just crypto-specific headlines. Understand the major sources of geopolitical risk . Assess Risk Tolerance: Understand how potential global shocks align with your personal risk tolerance and investment strategy. Diversification: Consider the benefits of a diversified portfolio that isn’t solely concentrated in one asset class, acknowledging that even crypto is subject to macro factors. Long-Term Perspective: Geopolitical events can cause short-term volatility. A long-term perspective can help weather temporary storms. The potential for the Iran nuclear program to escalate is a stark reminder that global stability is fragile and influences all markets. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture The U.S. intelligence assessment regarding Iran’s potential pursuit of a nuclear weapon Iran has long disavowed, contingent on attacks on the Fordo facility or the killing of its leader, represents a critical warning. It underscores the severe consequences of crossing certain red lines in the ongoing Iran US tensions and the broader regional conflict. This news is a powerful illustration of significant geopolitical risk that has the potential to impact global security, economic stability, and financial markets, including the world of cryptocurrencies. Staying informed about such developments is not just about understanding international relations; it’s about recognizing the forces that shape the environment in which all assets, digital or otherwise, operate.

Here’s What History Says,https://timestabloid.com/can-solana-beat-ethereum-this-cycle-heres-what-history-says/,"Remittix (RTX) has emerged as a strong contender in the crypto space, drawing comparisons with legacy networks like Ethereum and Solana. Built for fast and affordable cross-border payments, Remittix has already raised over $15.8 million at $0.0781 per token. As new blockchains battle for dominance, RTX is carving out its own niche in the payment sector with real-world adoption. Solana’s Speed Advantage Is Real Solana is making headlines for its unmatched speed and affordability. With a 400ms block time and fees under $0.01, it’s a clear leader in performance over Ethereum, which averages 12 seconds per block and charges over $1 in gas fees. Data from CoinTrust shows that Solana’s monthly new address growth (100M+) now dwarfs Ethereum’s. Its DEX volume has also hit $90B in 30 days, outpacing Ethereum’s $66B. However, the latter still leads in total value locked and ecosystem maturity. Ethereum Holds Its Institutional Crown Despite Solana’s user metrics, Ethereum remains the heavyweight when it comes to institutional trust. It dominates with over 54% of all TVL and has solidified its role as the home for DeFi and NFTs, according to OKX . Source: TradingView Backed by ETF listings and tokenized financial instruments, Ethereum enjoys the confidence of major financial institutions. As noted in ICOHolders , Ethereum may not grow the fastest, but its foundation is the deepest. Remittix Disrupts The Payment Layer While Solana and Ethereum fight for the smart contract crown, Remittix is winning quietly in real-world use cases. Freelancers in Asia and Africa are already using RTX to receive international payments without delays or excessive fees. With a planned wallet launch in Q3 and fast-growing community support, RTX is being tipped by some analysts as the next breakout project in crypto payments. CryptoNews expects RTX to become a preferred asset for global remittances due to its low cost and fast transactions. Conclusion: Is Flippening Coming? Solana might win this cycle in terms of price appreciation and retail traction. But Ethereum’s grip on institutions and DeFi remains solid, as reinforced in Standard Chartered’s outlook . The flippening is not off the table, but it’s far from guaranteed. While Solana and Ethereum race for the crown, Remittix is quietly becoming the go-to crypto for real-world payments. If you’re looking beyond speculation and into adoption, RTX might be your smartest move this cycle.

DOGE’s price has consolidated at around $0.16-$0.18, but a major price swing could be incoming. Ripple’s XRP is also showing signs of approaching volatility, as the Bollinger Bands have recently squeezed. What’s New Around Pi Network? The controversial crypto project, which introduced its Open Network in February, recently celebrated its first 100 days since its launch. The team outlined some important developments that happened within that timeframe, such as the launch of Pi Network Ventures – a $100 million investment program designed to support startups and companies focused on expanding PI’s real-world use and accelerating its adoption. They also noted the introduction of new games to users, which are “at the intersection of several key strengths – social interactions, the attention economy, and virtual goods.” Recall that less than a month ago, Pi Network launched FruityPi – a game application integrated with multiple products within the ecosystem, including the native cryptocurrency, Pi Wallet, and Pi Ad Network. Additionally, the team mentioned the Pi Day 2025 event, which took place from March 14 to March 21 and was the first PiFest after the Open Network saw the light of day . The event garnered serious engagement from the community, with more than 125,000 registered sellers and over 1.8 million Pioneers taking part. Meanwhile, the price of PI remains in deep red territory on a monthly scale, and its future dynamics heavily depend on several vital factors. Those curious to explore that matter in detail can check our dedicated article here . How’s DOGE Doing? The largest meme coin in terms of market capitalization has been trading within a tight range of $0.16-$0.18 over the past week. However, the renowned analyst on X, Ali Martinez, envisioned a major 60% price swing if this consolidation ends. He argued that the direction of the move is yet to be determined: a breakout beyond $0.22 would benefit the bulls, while a plunge below $0.16 would mean good news for the bears. Other industry participants who have recently shared their thoughts on the matter include Crypto ELITES and Kamran Asghar. The former set a price target of $5, while the latter thinks DOGE “is going straight to the moon” due to the potential approaching of a golden cross. XRP Volatility Incoming? Ripple’s cross-border token has also registered slight price fluctuations over the past few days, currently trading at around $2.17. The squeezing Bollinger Bands on its chart, however, indicate that a significant move could be incoming, as X user xoom recently warned. This metric is used to spot overbought or oversold conditions, potentially signaling a shift in trend. When the bands narrow, it reflects low market volatility, often hinting that a significant pump or drop could be on the horizon. The indicator has been a precursor of a major bull run on a couple of occasions in the past. The bands squeezed in December 2024 when XRP was worth around $2.10, whereas a few weeks later, the valuation almost matched its all-time high of $3.40. Meanwhile, Glassnode recently estimated that a rising number of XRP investors have started offloading their holdings since the beginning of June, with an average realized profit of almost $70 million per day. This heightened selling pressure could reinforce the case for a short-term bearish scenario.

John Deaton Predicts Huge Buyout, Names 11 Crypto and TradFi Giants appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Could one of XRP’s biggest backers be getting scooped up? A bold tweet from pro-Ripple lawyer John Deaton is stirring speculation that crypto exchange Uphold could be acquired – and if that happens, it might be one of the most strategic deals in the XRP ecosystem yet. In a recent tweet, Deaton suggested that Uphold could be bought by a major player. His list? It’s the who’s who of crypto and traditional finance powerhouses. “I put on Uphold being acquired by a major player,” Deaton tweeted . He tagged names like Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, Robinhood, Binance, Ripple , and TradFi giants JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Fidelity, Citi, and PayPal . So what makes Uphold such a hot target? XRP Is the Backbone of Uphold Uphold isn’t just another crypto platform listing XRP, but is built around it. According to the latest transparency report, XRP makes up nearly 70% of Uphold’s total reserves, holding $4.54 billion out of $6.61 billion. The numbers get even more interesting: Uphold has processed over 26 million XRP transactions, and just this week, it launched USDC support on the XRP Ledger, showing its deep commitment to the XRP ecosystem. Add to that a fully-backed model with 100.6% reserves, and it’s clear that this is a platform built with XRP utility in mind. Strategic Shake-Up Already in Motion Is this just Deaton shooting arrows in the dark? Well, no. Uphold’s own CEO, Simon McLoughlin, recently confirmed the exchange is exploring an IPO or a potential sale. The company brought on FT Partners to weigh its options. While no valuation has been officially disclosed, a source close to the matter says the target could go north of $1.5 billion. That’s not hard to imagine – Uphold’s revenue is expected to hit over $300 million in 2025, up from just $80 million in 2022, thanks to partnerships with firms like IG Group and a German bank. One Big Variable: The CEO’s XRP Belief There’s one twist that could complicate a buyout. McLoughlin is a massive XRP fan and a true believer in the XRPFi vision. That personal conviction could mean he’s unlikely to sell unless the buyer shares his vision or is willing to pay a steep premium. Still, the interest is real and the timing couldn’t be more aligned. XRP is gaining momentum, institutions are circling, and Uphold sits at the center of that growing demand. Whether it goes public or gets picked up, Uphold isn’t staying quiet for long. And if Deaton’s instincts are right, this could be a defining move in the next phase of XRP’s rise.

Launched on May 19, 2025, at block height 6,624,500, this upgrade marks the Odyssey phase, a pivotal moment of technical breakthroughs and community-driven growth. With a robust suite of technical advancements, generous Airdrop rewards, enhanced ME Pass 3.0 features, and a lineup of high-profile 2025 events, Meta Earth is inviting users worldwide to join its transformative journey. Here’s why ME Network 2.0 marks a pivotal shift—and what it means for those looking to participate. ME Network 2.0: A Technical Powerhouse ME Network 2.0 introduces a modular architecture that decouples the execution layer (RollApp), settlement layer (ME-Hub), and data availability layer (ME-DA), delivering unmatched scalability, security, and ecosystem compatibility. This three-layer design enables sovereign Rollup chains to process transactions in parallel with customizable virtual machines (EVM/WASM), slashing storage costs by 98% through data availability sampling (DAS) and 2D erasure coding. The result is skyrocketing throughput, optimized costs, and rapid iteration for decentralized applications (DApps). The network’s economic model is equally revolutionary. MEC, the native token, unifies all layers, with cross-chain mappings (MEC-CI for RollApp gas fees and governance, MEC-DA for the data layer) replacing native tokens to create a closed value loop. Users pay only local RollApp gas fees, while Sequencers handle cross-layer costs, streamlining transactions. The decentralized Sequencer network, powered by CometBFT consensus, enhances security with slashing mechanisms for malicious nodes, fraud proofs, and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) compression via the Groth16 algorithm, cutting gas costs by 90%. A Watch Relayer monitors anomalies in real time, ensuring robust protection. Cross-chain communication is another standout feature. The Multi-Blockchain Communication (MBC) protocol addresses Optimistic Rollup pain points, enabling instant withdrawals through market maker prepayments and incentivizing fraud detection. EVM compatibility, via Ethermint integration, supports Solidity 0.6.0–0.8.17 and tools like MetaMask, while dual EVM/WASM virtual machines bridge Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. A DID-based identity system stores only certificate hashes on-chain, encrypting private data off-chain for privacy and enabling cross-chain verification. Additional improvements include dynamic gas pricing to counter Sybil attacks, optimized relayers for trustless communication, and enhanced security requiring two-thirds honest nodes. The ME-DA layer’s initial validator nodes, staked with 552,900 MEC from regional treasuries (India, China, ME_EARTH, USA), underscore community-driven governance, with future allocations guided by transparent DAO proposals. These advancements position ME Network 2.0 as a scalable, secure foundation for the next generation of Web3 applications.

ME Network 2.0: A Technical Powerhouse ME Network 2.0 introduces a modular architecture that decouples the execution layer (RollApp), settlement layer (ME-Hub), and data availability layer (ME-DA), delivering unmatched scalability, security, and ecosystem compatibility. This three-layer design enables sovereign Rollup chains to process transactions in parallel with customizable virtual machines (EVM/WASM), slashing storage costs by 98% through data availability sampling (DAS) and 2D erasure coding. The result is skyrocketing throughput, optimized costs, and rapid iteration for decentralized applications (DApps). The network’s economic model is equally revolutionary. MEC, the native token, unifies all layers, with cross-chain mappings (MEC-CI for RollApp gas fees and governance, MEC-DA for the data layer) replacing native tokens to create a closed value loop. Users pay only local RollApp gas fees, while Sequencers handle cross-layer costs, streamlining transactions. The decentralized Sequencer network, powered by CometBFT consensus, enhances security with slashing mechanisms for malicious nodes, fraud proofs, and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) compression via the Groth16 algorithm, cutting gas costs by 90%. A Watch Relayer monitors anomalies in real time, ensuring robust protection. Cross-chain communication is another standout feature. The Multi-Blockchain Communication (MBC) protocol addresses Optimistic Rollup pain points, enabling instant withdrawals through market maker prepayments and incentivizing fraud detection. EVM compatibility, via Ethermint integration, supports Solidity 0.6.0–0.8.17 and tools like MetaMask, while dual EVM/WASM virtual machines bridge Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. A DID-based identity system stores only certificate hashes on-chain, encrypting private data off-chain for privacy and enabling cross-chain verification. Additional improvements include dynamic gas pricing to counter Sybil attacks, optimized relayers for trustless communication, and enhanced security requiring two-thirds honest nodes. The ME-DA layer’s initial validator nodes, staked with 552,900 MEC from regional treasuries (India, China, ME_EARTH, USA), underscore community-driven governance, with future allocations guided by transparent DAO proposals. These advancements position ME Network 2.0 as a scalable, secure foundation for the next generation of Web3 applications.

With Ethereum priced at $2,498.97 and Dogecoin at $0.1690, large holders are catching their breath. Meanwhile, smaller altcoins like Aura and Pi Network are absorbing fresh capital and so is one fast-rising project called Remittix. Investors Shift Focus from Ethereum to New Utility-Based Projects The keyword this week is rotation. In spite of Ethereum having a market capitalization of $301.6 billion, its volume is lower by 28.73% in trading. Dogecoin’s volume also fell 34.06% , although the price moved a little higher. Institutional wallets seem to be searching for the next breakout plays and they’re discovering them in smaller, real-world-utility tokens. Projects like Aura, Pi Network and Remittix (RTX) are accumulating more hype due to their real-world impact and faster market momentum. Remittix Emerges as the Leading Crypto This Week Among these altcoins, Remittix is quickly standing out from the crowd. Designed to facilitate cross-border payments, it allows users to transfer cryptocurrency like BTC, ETH and XRP directly to bank accounts in real-time. Priced at $0.0781 per token, with over 545 million+ tokens sold and $15.8 million+ in funds raised, Remittix is seeing explosive traction. The project is still available with a 50% token bonus, with the goal of reaching its $18M softcap and interest is growing by the day. Investors are especially optimistic about the Q3 release of the Remittix wallet, which will offer faster, easier crypto-to-fiat transactions in a number of territories. Why Remittix Might Fuel the Next Rotation Wave Unlike meme coins or DeFi tokens that are speculative in nature, Remittix solves a legitimate real-world problem: simpler and faster worldwide money transfers. That places it squarely in the middle of a $190 trillion payments market. Analysts have already started calling Remittix a stellar project, comparing it to early Ripple and Stellar with more near-term utility. The platform simplifies complexity, introduces speed and bridges traditional finance and the blockchain something Ethereum and Dogecoin aren’t actively solving. With Ethereum whales heading to the sidelines, smart money appears to be searching for the next high-utility play. And to many, that play is Remittix. While the Giants Sleep, New Contenders Take the Stage Ethereum and Dogecoin may still capture headlines, but investor funds are moving elsewhere. New players like Pi Network, Aura and Remittix are quickly stealing the show. With growing momentum, a Q3 wallet release imminent and a growing investor base, Remittix (RTX) is beginning to look like one of the more intriguing altcoins of 2025. As savvy investors rotate into assets with utility, Remittix continues to be front and center and for good reason.

This calm has confused the traders, suggesting either an underlying strength or a position on a fault line. Bitcoin has printed green on the 7-day time frame despite being down by just 0.23% over the last 30 days. Analyst suggests that low volatility, tight price action, and fading retail interest might mean that whales are now settling down the tone. Retail out, whales in According to Santiment data, Bitcoin’s elite and mortal wallets are moving in two different directions as the biggest crypto hovered around the $104k-$105 zone. It highlighted that the market added 231 wallets holding more than 10 BTC in the last days (approx. 0.15% surge). On the other hand, wallets holding 0.001 to 10 Bitcoins saw a drop of around 37,465 wallets over the 10 days. Data mentioned that when large wallets accumulate and retail investors loses confidence, it leads to a historically known combination for bullish momentum to return to the crypto markets. CryptoQuant’s data reported that short-term holders now have 4.5 million BTC. It has been down by 0.8 million since 27 May. It added that demand momentum has dropped to 2 million BTC, which is said to be the worst on record. This suggests that new money is drying up in Bitcoin. New money is drying up in Bitcoin. Short-term holders now hold 4.5M BTC, down 0.8M since 27 May. Demand momentum sinks to –2M BTC, the worst on record. pic.twitter.com/ollWBXHdll — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 20, 2025 Spot ETF demand is still rising, but lagging far behind trend lines. Despite hitting straight 9 days of inflows, the influx has dropped by almost 60% since April. US Spot BTC ETFs have recorded an inflow of $1.02 billion last week and $1.39 billion before the prior week. Big transfers dominate Bitcoin Glassnode data hints that beneath Bitcoin’s strong holding over $100k, something surprising is happening as its on-chain activity is unusually quiet. It mentioned that throughout 2023 and 2024, daily Bitcoin transactions surged while peaking at 734k per day. Meanwhile, since the start of 2025, that number has fallen sharply, now ranging between just 320k and 500k transactions per day. It turns out non-monetary transactions like inscriptions, ordinals, and other blockchain-based data activity have collapsed since January. These were a major driver of last year’s transaction boom. It added that even though fewer transactions are happening, the Bitcoin network is still settling massive amounts of value, averaging $7.5 billion per day. However, it peaked at $16 billion when BTC hit its older ATH last November. The average value per transaction now sits around $36,200. It is a clear signal that high-value players are continuing to use the network. On-chain data further shows that large transactions over $100K have grown to dominate the network. These big-ticket transfers accounted for 66% of all Bitcoin volume in late 2022, but now they make up about 89% of it. Bitcoin price saw a sudden spike over the last 24 hours as it surged to regain the $106k level from the $104k zone. BTC is trading at an average price of $106,029 at press time. Its 24-hour trading volume is still down by 18% to stand at $37.4 billion. The cumulative crypto market cap posted a marginal jump over the last day to stand at $3.29 trillion with a trading volume of $86.5 billion.

In a tweet, SMQKE stated, “Ripple is positioned for Fedwire interoperability via ECS Fin partnership.” The tweet was accompanied by two images sourced from ECS Fin’s official materials, outlining their technical framework and partnerships, with Ripple explicitly listed among supported payment technologies. RIPPLE IS POSITIONED FOR FEDWIRE INTEROPERABILITY VIA ECS FIN PARTNERSHIP This is documented. pic.twitter.com/xMGr7HxVtR — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 18, 2025 Documents Show Ripple Support within ECS Fin’s IMS Payments System The first image is a datasheet for ECS Fin’s IMS Payments platform, which provides an end-to-end enterprise payment solution for banks and financial institutions. It supports numerous external channels, including mobile, web, host-to-host, and third-party APIs. The platform complies with various gateways and standards, such as ACH, SWIFT , CHIPS, and ISO 20022. Notably, Ripple and blockchain are listed alongside these protocols, indicating ECS Fin’s readiness to integrate distributed ledger technology solutions. The datasheet further explains that IMS Payments enables banks to digitize payment operations through a built-in microservices architecture. It manages workflows across the entire transaction lifecycle, from pre-payment tasks like validation and compliance to final settlement and reporting. Ripple’s mention in this infrastructure highlights its role as a supported protocol within a system that is already being used by financial institutions preparing for large-scale modernization. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 ECS Fin’s Direct Engagement with the Federal Reserve The second image is from ECS Fin’s official website under the “Partners” section. It references its involvement with the Federal Reserve Banks’ initiative to adopt the ISO 20022 messaging standard for Fedwire. ECS Fin is described as a software provider working directly with the Federal Reserve to support this transition, offering solutions and dedicated connections for FedWire, FedACH, and FedNow. This positioning underscores ECS Fin’s integral role in helping financial institutions modernize payment operations in line with U.S. central banking infrastructure. The inclusion of Ripple as a supported protocol in ECS Fin’s platform suggests that Ripple is, by extension, positioned for potential interoperability with Fedwire once institutions begin leveraging ECS Fin’s systems in full compliance with ISO 20022. Public Reactions Reflect Frustration with Price-Utility Disconnect Responding to SMQKE’s post, an X user named TcfRTB expressed appreciation for the research but also voiced concern over XRP’s market performance. He commented , “Your work is so appreciated. I do not post much but with all of this positive information on xrp… how in the world is the price at 2 dollars…. that is what I’m struggelling with….” The images shared by SMQKE show that Ripple is a documented component of ECS Fin’s IMS Payments platform, which is actively engaged with the Federal Reserve’s Fedwire modernization. While there is no direct statement that Ripple is being used within the Federal Reserve’s systems, its presence in ECS Fin’s ecosystem—which is ISO 20022-compliant and connected to U.S. payment rails—demonstrates technical readiness for future interoperability.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/the-company-that-has-been-silent-in-the-cryptocurrency-world-for-a-long-time-is-returning-to-the-market-here-are-the-details/,"Jump Crypto, which has been silent in the cryptocurrency world for a long time, is coming back to the public after years of low-profile work. Jump Crypto Breaks Silence: “We Are Ready to Rebuild and Share” In its new statement, the company emphasized that it never stopped building infrastructure despite the difficulties experienced in the past, and gave the message that “we are ready to build the next frontier of crypto technology.” While Jump Crypto is still viewed by many as a major market maker and high-frequency trader, it now wants to position itself as a serious infrastructure developer. “It would be incomplete to see us as just a trader. We are building more,” the company said in a statement. Jump Crypto attracted public attention in 2021 with its association with the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin. In December 2024, the company’s subsidiary Tai Mo Shan, which was accused of misleading investors during the UST’s short-dollarization in May 2021, signed a $123 million settlement agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Jump Crypto was also the subject of criminal investigations for allegedly manipulating the price of UST alongside Terra. The company also suffered major financial losses following the collapse of FTX and the collapse of the Terra ecosystem. One of the most notable incidents was the hacking of its own cross-chain protocol called Wormhole in February 2022. While the attackers caused a loss of $325 million, Jump Crypto had to pay $320 million in compensation to cover this loss. After these negativities, Jump Crypto had largely withdrawn from the public. However, its new statements show that the company has presented a new vision. Jump Crypto, which highlights its developer identity, states that it will focus on areas such as decentralized infrastructure, interchain interoperability and secure protocols in its future roadmap. The company, which wants to regain trust in the crypto markets, emphasizes that it has learned from the mistakes of the past and that this time it will act with the principles of transparency and responsibility. *This is not investment advice.

The Bitcoin options market is gearing up for a significant event this week. A massive chunk of Bitcoin (BTC) options, valued at nearly $3.57 billion , are scheduled to expire. This event, set for 08:00 UTC on June 20, is a key moment that traders and analysts watch closely for potential market impact. Understanding the dynamics of this Bitcoin options expiration is crucial for navigating the coming days. What’s Happening with This Bitcoin Options Expiration? According to data from the crypto options exchange Deribit, the impending expiration involves a substantial amount of open interest. Specifically: Bitcoin (BTC) Options: Nearly $3.57 billion worth are set to expire on June 20 at 08:00 UTC. The put/call ratio for this expiration is 1.01 . The max pain crypto price for this specific BTC expiration is calculated at $105,000 . Simultaneously, the Ethereum (ETH) market will also see a notable expiration: Ethereum (ETH) Options: Around $567 million worth will mature at the same time on June 20. The put/call ratio for this Ethereum options expiration is 0.69 . The max pain crypto price for the ETH expiration is $2,600 . These figures provide a snapshot of the market’s positioning leading into the expiration event. Understanding the Key Terms: Put/Call Ratio and Max Pain For those new to the crypto options market , these terms might seem technical, but they offer valuable insights: Put/Call Ratio: This ratio compares the number of open put options (contracts giving the holder the right to sell at a specific price) to the number of open call options (contracts giving the holder the right to buy at a specific price) for a specific expiration date. It’s often used as a sentiment indicator: A ratio above 1 suggests more puts than calls, potentially indicating a bearish sentiment among options traders for that period. A ratio below 1 suggests more calls than puts, potentially indicating a bullish sentiment. A ratio around 1 indicates a relatively balanced or neutral sentiment. For the upcoming Bitcoin options expiration , a ratio of 1.01 is very close to neutral, suggesting a near-even split between bullish and bearish bets placed via options for this expiry. Max Pain Price: As the input mentions, the max pain crypto price is the strike price at which the largest number of options contracts (both puts and calls) will expire worthless, causing the maximum financial loss for options holders and, conversely, potentially the maximum gain for options writers (those who sold the options). While not a guaranteed price target, some market participants believe the underlying asset’s price can be drawn towards the max pain point as expiration approaches, especially by those with large options positions looking to minimize their losses or maximize gains. The max pain calculation considers the total open interest across all strike prices for a given expiration date. It identifies the price point where the aggregate value of outstanding put and call options is minimized if the underlying asset settles at that price. It’s a complex calculation involving summing the potential losses for every strike price. Why Does a Large Options Expiration Matter? Large options expirations, particularly for major assets like Bitcoin, can sometimes correlate with increased market volatility. Here’s why: Hedging Adjustments: Traders and institutions who sold options (writers) often hedge their positions in the spot or futures market. As expiration nears, they may need to adjust these hedges, which can involve buying or selling the underlying asset, potentially influencing price. Position Unwinding: Traders holding options positions may choose to close them before expiration, either taking profits, cutting losses, or avoiding settlement procedures. This unwinding can add trading volume and price pressure. Psychological Impact: The sheer size of a multi-billion dollar expiration can create anticipation and speculation about potential price movements, leading to increased trading activity. Max Pain Influence Debate: While debated, the theory that prices might gravitate towards the max pain point can influence short-term trading decisions for some market participants. It’s important to note that the impact of options expiration is rarely a standalone market driver. It interacts with macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, spot market sentiment, and overall trading volume. However, it adds another layer of potential dynamics to consider. Comparing the BTC and ETH Expirations Let’s look at the key figures side-by-side: Metric Bitcoin (BTC) Expiration Ethereum (ETH) Expiration Expiration Date/Time June 20, 08:00 UTC June 20, 08:00 UTC Value Expiring ~$3.57 Billion ~$567 Million Put/Call Ratio 1.01 (Neutral/Slightly Bearish) 0.69 (Bullish) Max Pain Price $105,000 $2,600 The size difference is significant, with the BTC expiration being over six times larger than the ETH one. This suggests the potential impact from the Bitcoin options expiration might be more pronounced, though the ETH expiration is still substantial. The differing put/call ratios also indicate distinct sentiment biases among options traders for each asset leading into this specific expiry. Is Max Pain a Reliable Trading Signal? The concept of max pain crypto price is a fascinating one, but its reliability as a direct predictor of price movement is subject to debate. Critics argue that: The spot market, driven by overall supply and demand, institutional flows, and macro events, is the primary price driver. While options writers might try to influence price, their ability to do so is limited by the much larger volume and liquidity of the spot and perpetual futures markets. Max pain is a historical calculation based on current open interest, not a forward-looking prediction. Supporters suggest that while not a guarantee, large options positions held by sophisticated traders can exert some gravitational pull on price, especially in less liquid conditions or when other market catalysts are absent. Regardless of whether it’s a target or just a reflection of positioning, knowing the max pain price provides context about where significant options contracts are concentrated. Considering Your Options Trading Strategy Around Expiration For those engaged in options trading strategy or simply trading the underlying assets, the upcoming expiration warrants attention: Increased Volatility Awareness: Be prepared for potential choppy price action leading up to and immediately after 08:00 UTC on June 20. Monitor Price Action: Watch how BTC and ETH prices behave as the expiration time approaches. Do they seem to be influenced by the max pain levels? Context is Key: Consider the expiration alongside other market factors – recent news, overall market sentiment, technical analysis levels, and trading volume. Risk Management: If you hold options positions expiring on June 20, understand how the settlement price will affect their value. If you are trading the spot market, be mindful of potential sudden moves. Don’t Rely Solely on Max Pain: Use the max pain price and put/call ratio as indicators of options positioning, but not as the sole basis for trading decisions. Understanding these dynamics is part of developing a robust options trading strategy that accounts for various market forces. The Bigger Picture: The Growing Crypto Options Market The fact that billions of dollars in Bitcoin and Ethereum options are expiring highlights the significant growth and increasing sophistication of the crypto options market . Once a niche activity, options trading on platforms like Deribit, CME, and others has become a major component of the crypto derivatives landscape. This growth brings both opportunities for hedging and speculation, as well as potential complexities for market stability. The evolution of the market means that events like a large Bitcoin options expiration are becoming more impactful and require careful analysis by all market participants. Conclusion: Navigating the Expiration Event The upcoming June 20 expiration of nearly $3.57 billion in Bitcoin options and $567 million in Ethereum options is a notable event on the crypto calendar. While the exact impact is difficult to predict, understanding the concepts of the put/call ratio (1.01 for BTC, 0.69 for ETH) and the max pain crypto prices ($105,000 for BTC, $2,600 for ETH) provides valuable context regarding current options positioning. Traders should be mindful of potential volatility around the expiration time and integrate this information into their broader market analysis and options trading strategy , rather than viewing it in isolation. The continued growth of the crypto options market underscores its increasing relevance in the overall digital asset ecosystem.

BTC struggled to build momentum and reclaim $105,000, with the price marginally down, trading around $104,591. Recent macroeconomic developments and geopolitical tensions have dampened investor sentiment for the flagship cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, ETH is marginally down over the past 24 hours but has held above $2,500, indicating buyers are absorbing the selling pressure at that level. Ripple (XRP) is also marginally down, while Solana (SOL) is down 0.50%, trading at $145. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down over 1%, while Cardano (ADA) is down 1.20%, trading around $0.597. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Litecoin (LTC) , Hedera (HBAR) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines. However, Toncoin (TON) bucked the market trend and registered a marginal increase over the past 24 hours. DOJ Seizes $225M In Crypto Linked With Pig Butchering Scam The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced the seizure of $225 million in crypto linked to so-called “pig butchering” scams that have led victims to lose billions. The seizure is the largest linked to such scams. Federal prosecutors filed a civil forfeiture action targeting over $225 million in crypto. The assets were linked with a complex web of fraudulent investment platforms. Victims of the “pig butchering” scam were led to believe they were investing in legitimate crypto ventures, only to be scammed by criminals operating overseas. Shawn Bradsheet, special agent in charge of the US Secret Service’s San Francisco Field Office, stated, “This seizure of $225.3 million in funds linked to cryptocurrency investment scams marks the largest cryptocurrency seizure in U.S. Secret Service history.” According to the authorities, the network was connected to nearly 400 suspected victims, including dozens in the US. According to FBI data, crypto frauds were responsible for over $5.8 billion in losses last year. ARK Invest Continues Circle Stock Dump Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest continued its Circle stock dump, offloading nearly $100 million in two days. According to a market notification, the crypto-friendly investment firm dumped an additional 300,108 shares from its funds for almost $45 million. The sale came as Circle’s stock fell 1.3% from a peak of $165 to close at $149, according to data from TradingView. The decline came despite positive market developments, with the US Senate passing the GENIUS Stablecoin bill. The latest stock sale included transactions from three ARK funds, including the ARK Innovation ETF (ARRK), ARK Next Generation ETF (ARKW), and ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF). ARKK, the largest fund, sold 208,654 Circle (CRCL) shares, while ARKW and ARKF sold 65,320 and 26,134 shares, respectively. The sale accounts for nearly 14% of ARK’s 4.49 million CRCL purchase. ARK Invest bought the shares on June 5 for $373.4 million. North Korean Hackers Targeting Crypto With New Malware North Korean threat actors are targeting job seekers in crypto with a new malware designed to steal passwords for crypto wallets and password managers. According to a report by Cisco Talos, North Korean hackers were using a new Python-based remote-access trojan (RAT) called PylangGhost, linked to a hacking collective called “Famous Chollima” or “Wagemole.” The hacking group primarily targets job seekers and employees with crypto and blockchain experience, primarily in India. Attackers carry out an elaborate ruse through fake job interviews and skill tests, often using social engineering to target individuals. “Based on the advertised positions, it is clear that the Famous Chollima is broadly targeting individuals with previous experience in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies.” The attackers created fraudulent job sites impersonating legitimate companies like Coinbase, Robinhood, and Uniswap, with targets guided through a multi-step process, including interviews and contacts with fake recruiters. Candidates are then redirected to skill-testing websites where information is harvested. The victims are then tricked into enabling video and camera access during fake interviews. Here, the hackers trick the victims into copying and executing malicious commands, compromising their devices. According to Cisco Talos, PylangGhost is a variant of the previously documented GolangGhost RAT and shares similar functionality. South Korea To Reduce Exchange Fees South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) is preparing to investigate transaction fees charged by domestic crypto exchanges, indicating a shift towards user protection and cost transparency. The move is part of President Lee-Jae-myung’s pro-crypto agenda, which focuses on easing the financial burden on retail investors. According to reports, the FSC will survey domestic exchanges, their fee structure, charging methods, and revenue generated from transaction fees. The primary goal of the exercise is to determine and benchmark local fees against global standards. An FSC official stated during a policy briefing to the State Affairs Planning Committee, “We need to examine whether the current fees of domestic exchanges are an excessive burden on consumers and whether they are at an appropriate level compared to overseas cases.” However, no fee caps or targets have been set as yet. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market registered a drop on Thursday amid rising global trade concerns, geopolitical tensions, and a hawkish Fed. The flagship cryptocurrency fell to a low of $103,915 on Thursday before reclaiming $104,000 and settling at $104,631. The current session sees BTC marginally up as it consolidates. Traders remain positive about bullish price action resuming, with one pointing out that a move above recent highs could see BTC surge towards $140,000. BTC’s subdued price action contrasts with Tuesday and Wednesday when it encountered selling pressure and volatility. Price action has been muted since the FOMC meeting, which kept rates unchanged, reiterating a cautious, inflation-sensitive approach. Investors and analysts are divided on whether BTC could surge to a new all-time high or slip below $100,000, especially with the broader market trading sideways. BTC hasn’t fallen to $94,000 since May 6 but has struggled in recent sessions, losing momentum after crossing $110,000. The decline was primarily attributed to escalating geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty, which dampened market and investor sentiment. Broader financial markets are also trading sideways, with the S&P 500 down 0.48% over the past five trading days. Strategy (MSTR) shares have also dropped over 2% in the same period and nearly 11% over the past 30 days. However, US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs have registered inflows, recording $388.3 million Wednesday. While crypto bulls like Michael Saylor are confident a bear market will not return for BTC, other analysts do not share his confidence. Prominent crypto trader Rekt Capital disagreed with Saylor, stating, “People think #BTC will never see another Bear Market because it is now mainstream & too mature of an asset. One will likely occur after this Bull Market.” BTC ended the previous weekend in positive territory, closing at $105,791. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price rallied, rising over 4% to cross the 20-day SMA and $110,000 to $110,247. BTC fell to an intraday low of $108,325 on Tuesday but recovered to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,258 after a marginal increase. Sentiment changed on Wednesday as BTC fell 1.43%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $108,686. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC fell nearly 3%, falling below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,826. The price plunged to an intraday low of $102,854 on Friday as selling pressure persisted. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $106,000 and settle at $106,106, ultimately registering a marginal increase. Source: TradingView Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC registered a drop of 0.59% on Saturday before registering a marginal increase on Sunday and settling at $105,561. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC raced to an intraday high of $108,939. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $106,808, ultimately registering an increase of 1.18%. Bearish sentiment returned on Tuesday as the price fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to $104,519. Price action remained muted on Wednesday, rising 0.35% before registering a marginal decline on Thursday and settling at $104,631. BTC is up nearly 1% during the ongoing session and has reclaimed $105,000. If bulls retain control and break above $106,000, BTC could move beyond $110,000, potentially setting a new all-time high. However, if sellers regain control and BTC slips below $103,000, a drop to $100,000 or lower could be on the cards. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) price action has been subdued since Friday as it struggles to push above the 20-day SMA and $2,600. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has struggled since losing momentum after reaching an intraday high of $2,878 on Wednesday (June 11). With buyers overwhelmed at upper levels, the price plunged, dropping to a low of $2,441 on Friday before stabilizing around $2,500 and moving to current levels. Despite volatility and selling pressure, ETH has held firm above $2,500, suggesting that markets are absorbing the selling pressure. This is backed by growing institutional interest in the asset, with prominent institutional holders dominating Ethereum’s strategic reserves. According to data from the Strategic ETH Reserve Website, these strategic reserves grew to 1.190 million ETH. The reserves, worth almost $3 billion, account for 1% of ETH’s total supply. Top holders include The Ethereum Foundation, with 269,431 ETH, followed by SharpLink, a Nasdaq-listed gaming company that purchased 176,271 ETH, staking around 95% of it. ETH started the previous week on a bullish note, rising nearly 7% to cross $2,600 and the 20 and 200-day SMAs to settle at $2,680. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as the price rose over 5%, crossing $2,800 and settling at $2,816. ETH raced to an intraday high of $2,878 on Wednesday but lost momentum after reaching this level. As a result, it fell 1.56%, slipping below $2,800 and settling at $2,772. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price fell nearly 5%, falling below $2,700 and settling at $2,645. ETH plunged to an intraday low of $2,441 before rebounding to reclaim $2,500 and settle at $2,579, ultimately registering a decline of 2.48%. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Saturday as ETH fell almost 2% to $2,542. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, ETH recovered on Sunday to register a marginal increase and settle at $2,548. ETH raced to an intraday high of $2,680 on Monday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and fell to $2,544 after a marginal decline. Price action remained bearish on Tuesday, falling 1.31% to $2,511. Buyers prevented a drop below $2,500 as the price recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.57% to $2,525. ETH registered a marginal decline on Thursday but is up nearly 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $2,565. Buyers will look to retain control and push the price past $2,600. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) has recovered over the past two sessions despite facing selling pressure, indicating that sellers may have run out of steam. SOL has struggled to regain momentum since dropping from $168. The price fell below the crucial $150 mark at the beginning of the week as bearish sentiment intensified after a brief weekend rally. Bullish sentiment could return as anticipation that regulators may approve a Solana ETF in the US grows. SOL started the previous week with a stunning rally, rising nearly 6% to cross the 50-day SMA and $160 and settle at $161. The price continued to push higher on Tuesday, rising 2.44% and settling at $165 despite selling pressure. Sellers regained control on Wednesday as SOL fell 2.48%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $161. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as the price plunged over 5%, dropping below $160 and settling at $152. The price fell to an intraday low of $140 on Friday. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $148, ultimately registering a drop of 2.48%. Source: TradingView Price action remained bearish on Saturday as SOL fell nearly 3% to $144. Despite the overwhelming bearish sentiment, the price recovered on Sunday, rising almost 6% to reclaim $150 and settle at $153. SOL raced to an intraday high of $158 on Monday. However, it could not stay at this level and fell 1.52% to $150. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell over 2%, slipping below $150 and settling at $147. SOL declined on Wednesday, settling at $146 after dropping nearly 1%. Selling pressure persisted on Thursday as the price fell to a low of $143. It recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and move to $147. The current session sees SOL up 0.53%. Buyers will look to maintain control and push the price beyond $150. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) is bracing for an important decision after Ripple and the SEC filed a renewed motion seeking to lift the ban on XRP sales and reduce a $125 million fine. A favorable ruling could prompt Ripple and the SEC to withdraw their appeals, boosting hopes for a spot XRP ETF. However, pro-crypto lawyer Bill Morgan warned a quick ruling could indicate another rejection by Judge Torres. “It only took 7 days for Judge Torres to reject the last joint motion to modify the judgment to reduce the fine and dissolve the injunction. Less than 7 days to decide the current joint motion may not be the best sign she will grant it.” XRP traded in positive territory on Monday (June 9), rising above the 50-day SMA and settling at $2.32. However, it lost momentum on Tuesday, dropping nearly 1% to $2.30. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 1.54%, slipping below the 50-day SMA and settling at $2.27. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as XRP fell 3.54%, falling below the 20-day SMA and settling at $2.19. The price dropped to an intraday low of $2.08 on Friday as selling pressure intensified. It rebounded from this level to settle at $2.14, ultimately registering a drop of 1.91%.

The altcoin has traded downwards since Wednesday (June 11), losing momentum after reaching an intraday high of $4.35. DOT registered a notable increase of 3.23% on Monday (June 9) and moved to $4.15. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as the price surged 3.37%, crossing the 20-day SMA and settling at $4.29. Despite the positive start to the week, DOT lost momentum on Wednesday, falling 2.56%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $4.18.

Selling pressure persisted on Friday as JUP plunged to an intraday low of $0.388. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $0.40 and settle at $0.417, registering a drop of 2.59%. Sellers retained control on Saturday as JUP fell 1.31% to $0.411. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, it rebounded on Sunday, rising 4.99% and settling at $0.432.

Launched on May 19, 2025, at block height 6,624,500, this upgrade marks the Odyssey phase, a pivotal moment of technical breakthroughs and community-driven growth. With a robust suite of technical advancements, generous Airdrop rewards, enhanced ME Pass 3.0 features, and a lineup of high-profile 2025 events, Meta Earth is inviting users worldwide to join its transformative journey. Here’s why ME Network 2.0 marks a pivotal shift—and what it means for those looking to participate. ME Network 2.0: A Technical Powerhouse ME Network 2.0 introduces a modular architecture that decouples the execution layer (RollApp), settlement layer (ME-Hub), and data availability layer (ME-DA), delivering unmatched scalability, security, and ecosystem compatibility. This three-layer design enables sovereign Rollup chains to process transactions in parallel with customizable virtual machines (EVM/WASM), slashing storage costs by 98% through data availability sampling (DAS) and 2D erasure coding. The result is skyrocketing throughput, optimized costs, and rapid iteration for decentralized applications (DApps). The network’s economic model is equally revolutionary. MEC, the native token, unifies all layers, with cross-chain mappings (MEC-CI for RollApp gas fees and governance, MEC-DA for the data layer) replacing native tokens to create a closed value loop. Users pay only local RollApp gas fees, while Sequencers handle cross-layer costs, streamlining transactions. The decentralized Sequencer network, powered by CometBFT consensus, enhances security with slashing mechanisms for malicious nodes, fraud proofs, and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) compression via the Groth16 algorithm, cutting gas costs by 90%. A Watch Relayer monitors anomalies in real time, ensuring robust protection. Cross-chain communication is another standout feature. The Multi-Blockchain Communication (MBC) protocol addresses Optimistic Rollup pain points, enabling instant withdrawals through market maker prepayments and incentivizing fraud detection. EVM compatibility, via Ethermint integration, supports Solidity 0.6.0–0.8.17 and tools like MetaMask, while dual EVM/WASM virtual machines bridge Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. A DID-based identity system stores only certificate hashes on-chain, encrypting private data off-chain for privacy and enabling cross-chain verification. Additional improvements include dynamic gas pricing to counter Sybil attacks, optimized relayers for trustless communication, and enhanced security requiring two-thirds honest nodes. The ME-DA layer’s initial validator nodes, staked with 552,900 MEC from regional treasuries (India, China, ME_EARTH, USA), underscore community-driven governance, with future allocations guided by transparent DAO proposals. These advancements position ME Network 2.0 as a scalable, secure foundation for the next generation of Web3 applications.

Launched on May 19, 2025, at block height 6,624,500, this upgrade marks the Odyssey phase, a pivotal moment of technical breakthroughs and community-driven growth. With a robust suite of technical advancements, generous Airdrop rewards, enhanced ME Pass 3.0 features, and a lineup of high-profile 2025 events, Meta Earth is inviting users worldwide to join its transformative journey. Here’s why ME Network 2.0 marks a pivotal shift—and what it means for those looking to participate. ME Network 2.0: A Technical Powerhouse ME Network 2.0 introduces a modular architecture that decouples the execution layer (RollApp), settlement layer (ME-Hub), and data availability layer (ME-DA), delivering unmatched scalability, security, and ecosystem compatibility. This three-layer design enables sovereign Rollup chains to process transactions in parallel with customizable virtual machines (EVM/WASM), slashing storage costs by 98% through data availability sampling (DAS) and 2D erasure coding. The result is skyrocketing throughput, optimized costs, and rapid iteration for decentralized applications (DApps). The network’s economic model is equally revolutionary. MEC, the native token, unifies all layers, with cross-chain mappings (MEC-CI for RollApp gas fees and governance, MEC-DA for the data layer) replacing native tokens to create a closed value loop. Users pay only local RollApp gas fees, while Sequencers handle cross-layer costs, streamlining transactions. The decentralized Sequencer network, powered by CometBFT consensus, enhances security with slashing mechanisms for malicious nodes, fraud proofs, and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) compression via the Groth16 algorithm, cutting gas costs by 90%. A Watch Relayer monitors anomalies in real time, ensuring robust protection. Cross-chain communication is another standout feature. The Multi-Blockchain Communication (MBC) protocol addresses Optimistic Rollup pain points, enabling instant withdrawals through market maker prepayments and incentivizing fraud detection. EVM compatibility, via Ethermint integration, supports Solidity 0.6.0–0.8.17 and tools like MetaMask, while dual EVM/WASM virtual machines bridge Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. A DID-based identity system stores only certificate hashes on-chain, encrypting private data off-chain for privacy and enabling cross-chain verification. Additional improvements include dynamic gas pricing to counter Sybil attacks, optimized relayers for trustless communication, and enhanced security requiring two-thirds honest nodes. The ME-DA layer’s initial validator nodes, staked with 552,900 MEC from regional treasuries (India, China, ME_EARTH, USA), underscore community-driven governance, with future allocations guided by transparent DAO proposals. These advancements position ME Network 2.0 as a scalable, secure foundation for the next generation of Web3 applications. Airdrop Rewards: Embarking on the Odyssey ME Network 2.0 Odyssey isn’t just about technology—it’s about empowering users. Meta Earth’s Airdrop reward system, accessible via ME Pass, offers six ways to earn MEC, catering to both novices and veterans: Unconditional Basic Income (UBI): Users who complete KYC for their ME ID receive 1 permanently staked MEC, yielding daily passive income at 12.5% APY. Verification must be completed in ME Pass to begin earning. Daily Check-In Rewards: Users can check in daily to earn MEC—starting at 0.0001 MEC (gas-free for the first check-in), increasing by 0.0001 MEC/day to a cap of 0.003 MEC/day (30x). Missed check-ins can be made up within 7 days for a small fee. Staking Rewards: MEC can be staked in ME Pass’s “Assets” section, with a 360-day lock offering up to 25% APY. Flexible lock periods are also available for tailored returns. Community Rewards: Joining any Meta Earth node community for a one-time 0.01 MEC reward, enabling users to integrate into the broader ecosystem. Referral Rewards: By sharing a ME Pass invite link, users earn 0.1 MEC per new user who completes KYC. Monthly Airdrop: ME ID holders automatically receive 0.01 MEC monthly, deposited directly into their ME Pass wallet. These rewards make participation rewarding and inclusive, encouraging users to grow their MEC holdings while fueling ecosystem expansion. ME Pass 3.0: The Gateway to Web3 ME Pass 3.0, the cornerstone of user interaction, has been revamped to enhance the Web3 experience. Its sleek new UI offers seamless navigation, while bolstered security features, including multi-factor authentication and passkey setup, protect users' assets. Users can now manage NFTs—displaying, transferring, and browsing collections—directly in the app. Cross-chain transactions between the ME-Hub and RollApps streamline asset movement, and a new “Explore” section introduces ME Mini-Programs and an app marketplace for richer content discovery. Community features like real-time messaging, large group chats, and end-to-end encryption foster engagement, making ME Pass 3.0 a powerful tool for Web3 exploration. 2025: Discovering Meta Earth Offline Meta Earth is taking its vision global with a series of high-profile offline events in 2025, offering opportunities to connect with the community and explore ME Network 2.0 firsthand: Istanbul Blockchain Week (June): Attendees can join the event in Turkey for insights into Web3 innovation.

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced on Wednesday that it planned to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4.25-4.5%, arguing that it was the most suitable level to achieve both maximum employment and controlled inflation. Trump slammed the decision on his social media platform Truth Social, calling Powell “an American disgrace.” “‘Too Late’ Jerome Powell is costing our Country Hundreds of Billions of Dollars. He is truly one of the dumbest, and most destructive, people in Government, and the Fed Board is complicit. Europe has had 10 cuts, we have had none. We should be 2.5 Points lower, and save BILLIONS on all of Biden’s Short Term Debt. We have LOW inflation!” The S&P 500 is down 0.031% in the past day and 0.61% in the past five days, while the Nasdaq Composite is trading roughly even in the past 24 hours but is down 0.55% in the past five days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1% in the past day and 1.29% in the past five days. Powell met with Trump last month following a barrage of insults from the president. The Fed, however, noted in a statement following the meeting that Powell did not discuss interest rate expectations with the president. “At the President’s invitation, Chair Powell met with the President today at the White House to discuss economic developments, including for growth, employment, and inflation. Chair Powell did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook. Finally, Chair Powell said that he and his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective, and non-political analysis.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Unlike typical hype-driven tokens, Pepeto combines viral appeal with real utility. These are tools, staking rewards, and a cross-chain bridge. The project's presale recently raised $5.421 million, close to its set target of $5.676 million. With the current token price at $0.000000135, Pepeto is drawing attention from long-term buyers seeking more than short-term spikes. While many projects fizzle post-launch, Pepeto’s roadmap and token distribution suggest a design made for sustainability. At the same time, $PEPE is making headlines again, not for its price, but because whales are accumulating in bulk. This convergence of new contenders like Pepeto and renewed whale interest in $PEPE could shift momentum in the meme token market. Whales Circle Back to PEPE Over the last 24 hours, whale accumulation in $PEPE surged from 1.2 trillion to 1.92 trillion tokens. This is not an action haphazardly taken, but a strategic indicator. Whales are transferring the tokens to their wallets, which is usually a sign of a massive upsurge. On the one hand, the price continues to stagnate at the level of $0.0000114, but on the other hand, the derivatives market is providing a different picture. There is an increase in future open interest, which indicates the confidence of advanced traders. It is in a consolidation phase, but based on the build-up, a breakout may be happening soon as early as the third quarter. Investors should pay special attention to the appearance of volume spikes and sharp candles as they are one of the rally leaders. Pepeto Brings Structure to the Meme Coin Space Pepeto sets itself apart by offering more than speculative value. The 30 trillion tokens are already staked on its staking system, which provides a maximum of 280% a year. These rewards occur regularly in each Ethereum block, meaning that it is easy to determine the proceeds. Additionally, a real cross-chain bridge is in operation, and a meme-oriented exchange is under construction. Pepeto presale has so far raised over $5,437,678.79 million. 📣 Announcement 📣 : PEPETO EXCHANGE DEMO VERSION IS READY, SET TO BE DISPLAYED IN PEPETO OFFICIAL SOCIALS, IN LESS THAN ONE WEEK - APPLICATION FOR LISTING VIA OFFICIAL WEBSITE WILL RESUME AFTERWARDS - Comment - $PEPETO is the God of all frogs- if you are all set up and ready… pic.twitter.com/29jey8Oqrg — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) June 6, 2025 The supply of the tokens is capped at 420 trillion tokens; the allocation depicts a balance of 30-30-20 in terms of staking, presale, and marketing. The other 20% serves as a booster of liquidity and development. With a current token price of $0.000000135 and strong presale backing, Pepeto is gaining traction for its utility-driven approach. Stability in Utility: The Future of Meme Coins? Unlike many meme coins that fade post-launch, Pepeto offers a long-term vision. It also has a clear roadmap with identifiable stages, which include development to exchange release, and transparency in funds utilization. There is additional assurance in smart contract auditing and frequent updates. Meanwhile, $PEPE is regaining attention thanks to aggressive whale positioning. This is an indication that large players are anticipating a recovery. Combined with growing interest in structured projects like Pepeto, the meme coin space may be entering a new chapter. When both volume and sentiment sync up, the two tokens would experience considerable movement even before the end of Q3. ABOUT PEPETO Pepeto is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency project blending the playful spirit of memecoins with a powerful, utility-driven ecosystem. It features a zero-fee exchange, a cross-chain bridge for seamless swaps, and staking rewards designed to support the next generation of tokens.

Bringing tangible utilities to the meme coin ecosystem, it offers tools, staking rewards, and cross-chain capabilities, supported by a robust $5.421 million presale achievement. The meme coin market is notorious for its volatility, but Pepeto's approach could herald a new era of stability and growth, drawing interest from investors looking for longevity in their crypto assets. Meanwhile, PEPE's recent whale activities hint at a resurgence, potentially reinvigorating interest in what many considered a dormant asset. Understanding the Surge in Whale Investments in PEPE Recent data reveals a sharp increase in large-scale acquisitions of $PEPE, with an uptick from 1.2 trillion to 1.92 trillion tokens within a 24-hour period. This spike in whale transactions is propelling the meme coin back into the spotlight and might indicate upcoming price movements. Despite a static price at $0.0000114, such interest could be precursors to a significant uptrend, especially with derivatives markets indicating rising future open interest. The Unique Proposition of Pepeto The launch and strategy of Pepeto are not just about capitalizing on the meme frenzy but about creating a sustainable ecosystem. The platform has successfully locked 30 trillion tokens in staking mechanisms, offering up to 280% annual returns. Its plans further include a meme-oriented exchange and an operational cross-chain bridge, enhancing its appeal and utility within the cryptocurrency domain. PEPE and Pepeto: Indicators of a Meme Coin Revival? While Pepeto introduces structural innovations to the meme coin market, PEPE's renewed whale interest could signal a broader trend of recovery and innovation within this niche. The convergence of Pepeto's planned utilities and PEPE's market movements might set the stage for a redefined meme coin landscape, impacting investor strategies and market dynamics significantly before the end of the fiscal quarter.

While XRP still commands attention among long-term holders especially as crypto prices reflect stagnation across several large-cap assets. In contrast, a new cryptocurrency priced under $0.03, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is capturing growing interest from investors seeking stronger upside potential. Mutuum Finance’s low entry point and DeFi-driven model have helped position it as a standout in recent crypto news. As questions around what crypto to invest in gain urgency amid market indecision, Mutuum Finance is increasingly emerging as a contender for the next crypto to explode, particularly among early adopters tracking presale momentum and upcoming utility launches. Mutuum Finance Presale at Phase 5 as Investor Demand Soars Mutuum Finance is already gaining traction in the DeFi world with the successful start of the Phase 5 presale, this reveals increasing interest by investors in their future plans. In contrast to meme coins built on hype, Mutuum Finance is a scalable composable financial infrastructure that is inflation-free and sustainable at the same time. Having gathered more than 12,200 early adopters and over $10.8 million already, the project is quickly becoming one of the most promising DeFi launches of 2025. With the current price of $0.03, Phase 5 introduces an important chance to the early investors. Regarding the operations that have been taking place, the current participants have a chance to potentially multiply their investment at launch with a planned listing price of $0.06 that will work as a short-term benefit and a stepping stone to the future value. Dual-Lending Model: Flexibility with Ownership of Assets at 100 percent The core of Mutuum finance is an awareness protocol with a non-custodial model that allows the users full control over their assets and still participates in decentralized lending. Its innovative power lies in the dual-lending mechanism that combines both the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mechanism. Popularly referred to as the P2C model, lending pools on it are handled using smart contracts, with a dynamic interest rate, which changes in real-time according to the state of the market. This will bring about a stable, automated, and transparent atmosphere to lenders and borrowers. P2P model eradicates the middleware thereby leaving users to strike deals amongst themselves. It is especially beneficial in terms of lending or acquiring unstable assets, where it is important to specify special conditions and the possibility of changing existing ones. The combination of these systems brings a convenient, safe, and genuinely decentralized lending experience like never before, introducing a new standard in the decentralized finance (DeFi) environment, way beyond the results of traditional or centralized lending options. CertiK-Verified Security Stablecoin and USD-Pegged Stablecoin Besides its fundamental lending innovations, Mutuum Finance will launch a fully collateralized, Ethereum-based, USD-pegged stablecoin. This stablecoin is designed to be resilient and not depegging on market volatility like other algorithmic models are likely to be because it provides a safe medium of exchange and a stable store of value. To further reaffirm the trust and transparency, the smart contracts and platform of Mutuum Finance have been audited thoroughly by CertiK which is arguably one of the best blockchain security. The certification does not only validate the integrity of the codebase but also shows the determination of the team to create a long-term, safe, and reliable DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance is stealing the spotlight, raising over $10.8 million from 12,200+ investors as Phase 5 nears completion. At just $0.03, buyers can lock in a 100% gain at the $0.06 launch, and long-term upside could reach 45x. Secure your tokens before the next price jump.

With its price lingering around $2.23 and facing regulatory challenges, the interest from the cryptocurrency community has somewhat waned. Investors are now scouting for assets with robust growth prospects, leading to a shift towards newer and dynamic cryptocurrencies. Among the emerging stars in the cryptocurrency arena is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a project priced under $0.03. This new entrant in the DeFi space is generating considerable buzz, drawing attention for its potential to provide substantial returns to its early backers. An Insight into Mutuum Finance’s Current Market Position Currently in its fifth presale phase, Mutuum Finance has successfully captivated the DeFi community, amassing over $10.8 million from more than 12,200 early investors. The presale price of $0.03 per token presents an enticing opportunity, with the expected listing price at launch being $0.06. This forecasted price suggests significant short-term gains for early investors. Breaking Down the Dual-Lending Model of Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance is not just another new cryptocurrency. It brings to the table an innovative dual-lending model that combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending mechanisms. This model allows for real-time dynamic interest rates and direct transactions between users, enhancing both transparency and user autonomy in financial dealings. The P2C system utilizes smart contracts to manage lending pools, ensuring stability and automated operations. On the other hand, the P2P model allows users to directly negotiate terms, ideal for handling more volatile assets. Ensuring Security and Stability with CertiK Verification and a Stablecoin Launch Security and stability are paramount in the adoption of any DeFi system. Mutuum Finance addresses these concerns head-on with a CertiK-audited platform. Furthermore, it plans to introduce a USD-pegged stablecoin built on Ethereum, designed to maintain its peg even during market volatility. The combination of a transparent, secure platform and the launch of a stable medium of exchange positions Mutuum Finance as a potentially transformative force in the DeFi sector.

Weeks after the United States led a high-profile freeze of $26 million in Tether ( USDT ) assets tied to sanctioned Russian crypto exchange Garantex, a new investigation suggests the enforcement may have only scratched the surface. A report from blockchain analytics firm Global Ledger, found that more than $15 million in additional reserves remain untouched across Ethereum , Bitcoin , and BNB Chain networks. These assets appear to be active, and in some cases, already on the move. While the official Tether freeze targeted Garantex’s USDT holdings, the exchange reportedly has exposure well beyond that. As Global Ledger wrote in the report shared with crypto.news, the exchange also handled Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and a range of other tokens ERC-20, BEP-20, and even a ruble-pegged stablecoin called A7A5. The sanctions freeze, coordinated with Germany and Finland, took place over three days in early March. On March 6, Garantex publicly acknowledged the enforcement action. That same day, an Ethereum wallet linked to Garantex suddenly came back online, the report points out. It had been quiet for months. Now, it was aggregating 3,265 ETH or roughly $8.6 million. Then the laundering began. Between May 22 and June 4, more than $2.25 million worth of ETH was gradually routed through Tornado Cash , an Ethereum-based mixing protocol. Global Ledger says the wallet sent 844.99 ETH to the mixer in batches, making it harder to trace. The firm flagged these as part of what it calls “coordinated liquidity outflows.” Calculated decision The activity didn’t stop there. On May 30, for example, 206 ETH — about $280,000 — was mixed through Tornado Cash. Just days later, on June 4, another 30 ETH was sent through. As of that date, the wallet still held over 2,334 ETH, or roughly $6.1 million. “These patterns strongly suggest an intentional money laundering effort to obscure links to Garantex. The activity is ongoing, with real-time alerts continuing to track fresh outflows from this same reserve.” Global Ledger The situation with Bitcoin was strikingly similar. In early March, Global Ledger identified an aggregation of 19.39 BTC, again from dormant addresses. Over the next few weeks, that number grew to 30.04 BTC, worth about $3.17 million. Some of that Bitcoin didn’t stay on the same chain for long. In early May, 2.2 BTC was bridged to the TRON ( TRX ) network and partially sent to Grinex, a suspected successor to Garantex. According to Global Ledger CEO Lex Fisun, the move to TRON likely reflects a calculated decision to take advantage of the network’s speed and low cost. “TRON is cheap, liquid, and fast,” Fisun told crypto.news. “If your end goal is to swap BTC into stablecoins, bridging straight into the chain that already dominates those flows is the path of least resistance.” “Transfers [on TRON] cost less than what you’d pay on Bitcoin or Ethereum. Even non-subsidised tokens still cost fractions of a cent, and for USDT, moving value is literally free, with recent gas-free upgrades.” Lex Fisun Whether or not Grinex is acting as the successor to the sanctioned exchange remains to be confirmed, but Global Ledger doesn’t appear to have much doubt. The firm noted that all of Garantex’s assets were immediately withdrawn after the March freeze and sent directly to Grinex-linked wallets. You might also like: Garantex co-founder Aleksej Besciokov arrested by Indian authorities: report No big red button The BNB Chain also played a quiet but curious role. Unlike Ethereum or TRON, BNB Chain doesn’t support Tether. That means Tether has no power to freeze assets there. As it turns out, funds on BNB Chain stopped moving the same day Garantex announced its suspension: March 6. But there were no burns, no swaps, and no withdrawals. As of June, Global Ledger estimates the BNB-based reserves at around $4 million, still unspent. Fisun noted that this creates a strategic blind spot for sanctions enforcement. “There’s no ‘big red button,’ so enforcement on BNB Chain relies on off-chain actors,” he said, pointing out that in practice, freezing assets on BNB Chain is slower and more uncertain. “It took nearly two years with the PopcornSwap scam,” Fisun emphasized. The Global Ledger CEO also added that while BNB Chain is more opaque, its limited share of dollar-pegged stablecoins makes it less critical overall. “ only about $5 billion in USDT circulates on BNB Chain versus $73.8 billion on TRON. Also, using BNB Chain requires an extra wrapping/bridging step that traders and bad actors would rather skip when TRON already offers deeper books and zero fees.” Lex Fisun All told, the analytics firm estimates that at least $15 million in Garantex-linked crypto remains outside U.S. enforcement reach. And that figure doesn’t include any new tokens or potential stealth wallets that haven’t been traced yet. It’s not just about the numbers. The bigger concern might be what these patterns represent: a loophole in multi-chain enforcement. While token-level freezes — like the one imposed on Tether — can be effective on paper, they’re far less useful when entities move assets between chains, or into stablecoins not issued by U.S.-based companies. As Global Ledger says, Garantex’s “on-chain manoeuvring underscores the growing challenge of enforcing asset freezes. When asked about USDC exposure, Fisun said Global Ledger had tracked assets that moved just before the freeze. “The blocked Garantex wallets still hold 73,283 USDC,” he said, adding that on March 4, more than 290,000 USDC went from “blocked Ethereum wallets to one of the top 10 exchanges’ deposit addresses.” He added that smaller holdings might have flown under the radar, noting that the likely reason the addresses weren’t frozen was the relatively small balances involved, and that it may have simply come down to the numbers.

Recent observations based on Santiment data highlight a fascinating divergence among Bitcoin holders : large entities are increasing their holdings, while smaller wallets appear to be reducing theirs. This pattern, according to market intelligence platform Santiment, could be signaling a significant shift in the prevailing crypto market trends . What Are Bitcoin Holders Telling Us Right Now? Think of the Bitcoin ecosystem as an ocean teeming with different sizes of marine life, each representing a different class of holder. On one end, you have the majestic whales – these are the large players, often holding substantial amounts of BTC. On the other, you have the schools of smaller fish, representing the everyday retail investors with more modest holdings. Santiment’s recent analysis, shared by analyst Brianq, points to a clear separation in behavior over the past ten days. While Bitcoin has been trading around the $43,000 mark (note: original text says $104,300, which seems like a typo for current market conditions; assuming $43,000 is a more relevant figure for recent data context), two distinct groups of Bitcoin holders are moving in opposite directions: Large Wallets (holding 10+ BTC): This group, often associated with institutional players or wealthy individuals – the ‘whales’ and ‘sharks’ of the Bitcoin ocean – has seen an increase of 231 wallets in just 10 days. This indicates active accumulation. Smaller Wallets (holding between 0.001 and 10 BTC): This segment, largely representative of retail investors , has seen a decrease of 37,465 wallets in the same period. This suggests a significant number of smaller holders are either selling off their entire balance or reducing their positions below the 0.001 BTC threshold. This divergence isn’t just a random fluctuation; it’s a pattern that on-chain analysts pay close attention to. The question is, what does this specific behavior among Bitcoin holders potentially signify for the market’s future direction? Deep Dive into the Santiment Data : The Great Divergence Explained The numbers provided by Santiment offer a clear snapshot of current market dynamics from an on-chain perspective. Let’s break down the significance of the figures: Over a 10-day window: Wallet Size Category Change in Number of Wallets Implied Action 10+ BTC (Large Holders/Whales) +231 Accumulation / Buying 0.001 – 10 BTC (Smaller Holders/Retail) -37,465 Distribution / Selling This data from Santiment isn’t measuring the amount of BTC being moved by these groups, but rather the *number* of wallets within these size ranges that are entering or exiting those categories. An increase in wallets holding 10+ BTC means more addresses are crossing that threshold, likely by accumulating more Bitcoin. Conversely, a decrease in wallets holding between 0.001 and 10 BTC means many addresses are dropping below the 0.001 BTC mark, suggesting they have sold most or all of their holdings. Brianq’s observation highlights that this specific divergence – large holders accumulating while smaller ones exit – has historically preceded periods where bullish momentum returned to the market. This makes the current Santiment data particularly compelling for those trying to gauge market sentiment and potential price movements. Why Are Bitcoin Whales Accumulating? The actions of Bitcoin whales are often seen as a proxy for smart money or institutional sentiment. Their accumulation during periods where retail investors are exiting can suggest several possibilities: Confidence in Future Price: Whales typically have a longer-term investment horizon and deeper pockets. Their buying suggests they believe the current price level is attractive and that Bitcoin’s value is likely to increase significantly in the future. Buying the Dip: If the market has experienced a downturn or consolidation, whales might view this as an opportunity to acquire more BTC at a discount before a potential rebound. Strategic Positioning: Large players might be positioning themselves ahead of anticipated positive catalysts, such as further institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, or macroeconomic factors favoring scarce assets. Lower Risk Tolerance (Relative): While still volatile, a position in Bitcoin might be seen by large investors as a calculated risk with high reward potential compared to other asset classes, especially in uncertain economic times. The consistent accumulation by Bitcoin whales shown in the Santiment data indicates a strong underlying belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition, despite any short-term market volatility or negative sentiment that might be driving smaller holders away. Why Are Retail Investors Exiting? On the flip side, the decrease in wallets holding between 0.001 and 10 BTC points to potential capitulation or frustration among retail investors . Several factors could be at play: Fear and Uncertainty: Market downturns or prolonged periods of sideways price action can lead to fear, prompting less experienced or risk-averse investors to sell to cut losses or avoid further declines. Short-Term Focus: Many retail investors might enter the market with a short-term trading mindset. If quick profits don’t materialize, or if positions go underwater, they might exit. Liquidity Needs: Economic pressures or personal financial needs might force some smaller holders to sell their crypto assets. Frustration with Volatility: The inherent volatility of the crypto market can be emotionally taxing. Smaller holders might exit simply due to burnout or frustration. Switching Assets: Some might be selling Bitcoin to move into other cryptocurrencies or asset classes they perceive as having better short-term potential. The significant number of wallets dropping out of the 0.001-10 BTC category, as revealed by the Santiment data , paints a picture of retail fatigue or capitulation occurring concurrently with whale accumulation. This dynamic is often observed at potential market bottoms or during periods preceding significant upward moves. Historical Context: What Does This Divergence Usually Signal for Crypto Market Trends ? On-chain analysts, including those at Santiment, often look for divergences between different holder cohorts because they can act as powerful indicators. The pattern of large holders accumulating while small holders distribute is frequently interpreted as a potentially bullish signal. Historically, periods of peak fear or capitulation among retail investors often coincide with smart money or Bitcoin whales quietly accumulating assets at lower prices. When retail sentiment is at its lowest, and prices are suppressed, whales see an opportunity to buy from those who are selling out of fear or necessity. Conversely, during market tops, the pattern often reverses: retail FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) drives prices higher, while whales begin to distribute their holdings into this retail-driven demand. The current Santiment data shows the opposite scenario – whales buying as retail sells – which aligns with patterns seen before significant upward price movements in past cycles. While no single metric is a guarantee, this particular divergence is considered a notable signal within the broader landscape of crypto market trends and on-chain analysis. It suggests that despite the prevailing sentiment among smaller holders, those with significant capital are betting on Bitcoin’s future appreciation. Navigating the Waters: What Does This Mean for You? Understanding the actions of different Bitcoin holders through Santiment data provides valuable context, but it’s essential to interpret it wisely. Here are some actionable insights: Data is Not Destiny: On-chain data is powerful, but it’s one piece of a complex puzzle. Macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, technological developments, and overall market sentiment also play significant roles in shaping crypto market trends . Whales Can Be Wrong: While whales are often considered ‘smart money,’ they are not infallible. Their accumulation doesn’t guarantee a bullish outcome, and they can also exit positions quickly. Consider Your Own Strategy: Don’t blindly follow the actions of others. This data should inform your perspective, but your investment decisions should align with your own risk tolerance, financial goals, and research. Look for Confirmation: See if other on-chain metrics (like exchange flows, miner behavior, stablecoin supply ratio) or technical analysis indicators support the potential bullish signal suggested by this holder divergence. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: The accumulation by Bitcoin whales is often indicative of a long-term view. If you are a short-term trader, this signal might be less relevant than for a long-term investor. This Santiment data offers a compelling look under the hood of the Bitcoin market, suggesting that beneath the surface of retail apprehension, significant accumulation is underway by larger entities. It’s a pattern that has historically preceded positive shifts in crypto market trends , offering a potential glimpse into what might be on the horizon.

Achieving CertiK Certification The integrity of FUNToken's smart contract has been rigorously verified by CertiK, the leading security-focused ranking platform to audit blockchain protocols. The meticulous scrutiny ensures the excellence of security standards, supported by CertiK Skynet which continuously monitors and secures the FUNToken framework in real-time. Implementing a Permanent Supply Cap In a decisive move toward transparency and reliability, FUNToken has introduced a permanent cap on its token supply. This definitive action not only enhances the token's economic stability but also positions it as a deflationary asset within the crypto space, a feature that is increasingly valued among investors seeking reliable investment opportunities. Promoting Decentralization and Community Empowerment With these updates, FUNToken emphasizes its commitment to decentralization. By making its contract immutable, FUNToken vests the operational control largely in the hands of its user community, reducing the potential for central manipulation and enhancing user trust. Securing the Foundation for Future Growth The strategic shift in FUNToken's operational model is not merely structural. Its integration into an expansive network of gaming platforms and the creation of a robust community ecosystem underscore its potential for substantial growth within the competitive Web3 space. Why These Changes Matter The culmination of these efforts positions FUNToken as a pioneer in the Web3 domain, with definitive security, an unchangeable supply, and an unwavering focus on community empowerment. The innovations introduced are expected to propel FUNToken from a promising digital asset to a leader in decentralized gaming.

46409151,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=751166,1750420411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46409151.jpeg,Thai SEC begins consideration to allow CEXs to their own tokens,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/thailand-sec-to-allow-cex-launch-coins/,"Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has launched a public consultation on a proposed rule change on digital asset listing, which could allow licensed centralized exchanges (CEXs) to issue and list their own utility tokens. The consultation process, open until July 21, will gather feedback from the public through the SEC’s website, the central legal system platform, or via email. The proposed regulatory changes are part of a government initiative to strengthen Thailand’s crypto framework and promote responsible use of the digital asset ecosystem. Proposed rule changes listing standards and transparency According to a statement released following a June SEC board meeting, the regulatory body is considering amendments that would expand listing allowances for digital assets while imposing tighter transparency requirements on exchanges. One of the proposals under review would allow crypto exchanges operating under SEC licenses to list utility tokens issued by themselves or affiliated entities. These tokens must serve a functional purpose within blockchain-based ecosystems, like enabling transaction fees or platform governance, rather than serving purely as speculative investments. Alongside the relaxed restrictions, the SEC is requesting exchanges to reveal the identities of individuals connected to each listed digital asset. Per the security regulator, this will uphold transparency and prevent conflicts of interest, particularly where tokens are issued by the trading platforms themselves or their partners. The proposed rules would also mandate that all existing listed tokens disclose such information within 90 days of the rules taking effect. Additionally, exchanges would be required to implement system alerts that allow the SEC to monitor insider trading in real time. Thailand speeds up efforts to become a digital asset hub The Thai government is seemingly making an effort to position the Southeast Asian country as a global digital asset hub. In recent months, the Thai government has introduced several tax incentives and regulatory updates intended to attract crypto investors, support innovation, and clarify market oversight. On June 16, the government announced a five-year exemption from capital gains tax on profits earned from cryptocurrency trading through licensed exchanges. The policy took effect on January 1 and will last until December 31, 2029. Deputy Finance Minister Julapun Amornvivat reiterated the government’s commitment to the sector, stating, “ Full speed ahead! The Thai government is accelerating efforts to position Thailand as a global digital asset hub .” In addition to tax relief measures, Thailand’s Revenue Department is currently working to implement the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)’s Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework. These reforms also come in the wake of Thailand’s recent enforcement actions targeting unauthorized digital asset service providers. On June 28, the SEC, under the authority of the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society, will begin blocking access to five international crypto exchanges, Bybit, 1000X, CoinEx, OKX, and XT.COM. All five platforms have been accused of operating in Thailand without the appropriate licenses and offering trading services to local users in violation of the Digital Assets Business Emergency Decree. As reported by Cryptopolitan, crypto exchange KuCoin is among the licensed platforms to operate within the jurisdiction. It recently launched “KuCoin Thailand,” a fully licensed digital asset trading platform operating under the oversight of the SEC Meanwhile, the Thai SEC is hinting at the approval of locally issued Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for listing on Thai exchanges. This consideration follows increased global interest in crypto-backed ETFs, championed by the US, and its desire to be competitive in international financial markets.

The Graph price is expected to go as high as $1.00 in 2025. GRT price with a potential surge could reach a maximum of $3.54 by 2030. AI may be taking center stage in today’s tech revolution, but behind every smart application lies the challenge of accessing and organizing reliable data. That’s where The Graph (GRT) steps in—an innovative indexing protocol transforming how blockchain data is queried. As interest in The Graph surges, especially after its major 2025 upgrades and the launch of substreams-powered subgraphs, the question on everyone’s mind is: Can GRT price reach $1? In this article, we break down its technical potential, rising developer adoption, and market sentiment in our detailed The Graph Price Prediction 2025–2030 . Table of contents Story Highlights Overview GRT Price Forecast 2025 GRT Coin Price Prediction 2026-2030 The Graph Price Targets 2026 GRT Coin Price Prediction 2027 The Graph Token Price Prediction 2028 GRT Crypto Price Projection 2029 The Graph Price Prediction 2030 What Does The Market Say? FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency The Graph Token GRT USD Price $ 0.08512981 1.00% Market Cap $ 840,674,837.1254 Trading Volume 9,875,210,669.5851 Circulating Supply $ 26,096,721.9780 All-time high $2.88 on 12th February 2021 All-time low No Data GRT Price Forecast 2025 The Graph Network is mostly used by developers and data consumers who pay to query data. The network’s performance of The Graph can be assessed by its growth in the volume of queries and the accrual of query fees. Recently, a report from Messari showed that query volume shot upto 6.1 billion in Q1 2025, and the updated Q2 2025 query volume per its official website highlights that it has reached 11.5 billion, reflecting robust developer adoption. Also, the Graph protocol’s on Dune highlights that since their network has migrated to Arbitrum, their network is growing fast in 2025. The query fees generated by data consumers of The Graph have reached an all-time high on Arbitrum at 6.2 million. Meanwhile, the network holds 168,560 delegators who are contributing to securing the network and 6,921 active curators who signal useful subgraphs that should be indexed by the graph network. Overall, the Dune metrics show the growing ecosystem, which directly means strength increasing on fundamental levels, which is the core element for mass adoption to come in the future. Apart from fundamentals, the GRT token’s price has been on a muted journey, from the 2024 peak, it is down 82%, but from the 2021 peak, it is 97% down, which has become a topic to discuss as its fundamentals are doing well, yet the price stays below. On breaking it down, its daily chart highlights key findings that represent a significant trend it is following. It is observed that in the past years after the 2021 crash, it has been in a range of $0.08 to $0.49, where after every multi-month period of correction, the breakout is strong every time it reaches $0.08 while correcting. This time also, the GRT price has been spending a lot of months in correction, also the price action in Q2 2025, the GRT price has reacted to the $0.08 level again, which is the same support block that has shown strong demand before. If in June or July of 2025 GRT price succeeds in breaking a declining trendline, representing the current multi-month correction, then a humongous surge is awaiting that could lead to a parabolic rise to $1, but a $0.55 high is a must for its price to reach that level. If not, then only consolidation would continue in its price action.

However, its meteoric growth is something investors are seeking to replicate in newer opportunities. Enter Ruvi AI (RUVI), which analysts predict could deliver an astounding 13,500% return on investment (ROI), reminiscent of Binance Coin’s early success. With its utility-driven model, structured growth, and massive return potential, Ruvi AI has captured the attention of smart investors looking to seize the next big thing in crypto. Why Analysts See Early Binance Coin Potential in Ruvi AI Binance Coin achieved its early fame and high ROI by being integral to the Binance exchange ecosystem. But while its primary function remains discounts and staking within Binance, Ruvi AI offers a far wider horizon of possibilities. By integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology, Ruvi AI is designed to provide scalable solutions in marketing, entertainment, and finance industries. This diversified utility anchors its value beyond speculative trading, creating opportunities for sustained demand. Ruvi AI’s structured growth model is another reason for investor confidence. Currently priced at $0.015 per token during Phase 2 of its presale, the token will climb to $0.07 after the presale, ensuring an almost 5x return before entering public trading. Analysts predict that Ruvi AI could achieve $1 per token, turning a presale investment into a potential 13,500% ROI. This calculated trajectory positions Ruvi AI as a highly lucrative option for both early and long-term investors. Presale Success Reflects Bright Outlook Ruvi AI’s presale is already a resounding success, with over $1.8 million raised and more than 1,600 holders on board. These numbers demonstrate strong confidence in Ruvi AI’s vision and execution, further solidifying its market credibility. Unlike many speculative tokens that leave investors guessing, Ruvi AI’s clear roadmap and the guaranteed $0.07 post-presale valuation provide a level of transparency that’s rare in the volatile crypto market. It offers stability and predictable returns, which are critical for investors looking to safeguard their portfolios. VIP Investment Tiers Enhance Returns A standout feature of Ruvi AI’s presale is its VIP investment tiers, tailored to reward early investors with impressive bonuses. Here’s a breakdown of the tiers and their associated returns: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680.

Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers incentivize early participation, amplifying returns significantly for those who commit early in the presale phase. Built on Trust and Transparency One of Ruvi AI’s distinguishing factors is its commitment to security and transparency. The project is undergoing a third-party audit by CyberScope, a highly reputable blockchain auditing firm. This ensures that Ruvi AI’s platform is both secure and credible, vital for earning the trust of cautious investors. Additionally, its partnership with WEEX Exchange guarantees post-presale liquidity, ensuring that investors can trade RUVI tokens seamlessly after presale completion. This collaboration reinforces Ruvi AI’s credibility, making it a reliable choice for those looking to enter the crypto market with confidence. Real-World Utility Underpins Token Value What sets Ruvi AI apart from many other projects, including Binance Coin in its early stages, is its focus on real-world applications.

The rise in betting interest followed the US Senate’s 68–30 vote in favor of the legislation earlier this week, with President Donald Trump urging the House to pass it quickly. At the same time, the market is signaling similar optimism, as shares of stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group have soared over 530% since its June 5 IPO. Crypto Bets Surge as Trump Pushes GENIUS Stablecoin Act Toward Passage The cryptocurrency community is closely watching Capitol Hill — and betting on it. Following a decisive 68–30 vote in the US Senate earlier this week, online speculators on prediction platform Polymarket are putting their money where their convictions are: 89% of bettors believe the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, will pass through Congress and be signed into law before the end of 2025. Betting on the GENIUS Act as of Thursday (Source: Polymarket ) The bill’s progress marks a watershed moment for the US approach to regulating payment stablecoins. Designed to offer a clear framework for issuing and using fiat-backed digital assets like USD-pegged tokens, the GENIUS Act could legitimize and open the floodgates for widespread corporate and institutional adoption of stablecoins. President Donald Trump has emerged as a strong proponent of the GENIUS Act. In a public statement, he called on lawmakers to “get it to [his] desk” and signaled his willingness to approve the bill without any additional amendments. This statement appears to have been a turning point for market sentiment. According to Polymarket data, betting interest spiked less than 24 hours after the Senate vote, reinforcing confidence among traders that passage through the House and final presidential approval are both increasingly likely. But while Senate approval marked a major milestone, the bill now faces new political hurdles in the House of Representatives. Although Republicans currently hold a narrow majority, it's unclear whether the GENIUS Act will pass unaltered or if Democratic lawmakers — and even some Republicans — will push for amendments that address potential conflicts of interest, including Trump’s family’s alleged links to World Liberty Financial and its stablecoin, USD1. A similar amendment aimed at scrutinizing these ties was defeated in the Senate before the final vote. Potential Ripple Effects on Tech and Finance If passed into law, the GENIUS Act could dramatically reshape how value moves in the digital economy. Analysts and insiders suggest that major US companies — including Apple, Google, and Meta — are monitoring the bill closely. Senators have already sent formal inquiries to Meta regarding whether the company would consider reviving its stablecoin ambitions if the regulatory path becomes clear. Some in the crypto industry have even gone so far as to call the GENIUS Act a potential “New York Stock Exchange moment” for stablecoins. The bill’s legal clarity could allow tech giants and financial institutions to issue their own tokens for settling transactions, payroll, and cross-border payments — with the US dollar remaining at the center of it all. Adding further intrigue to the week’s legislative developments, the House is also preparing to consider the CLARITY Act, which is a companion bill that outlines which federal agencies will have jurisdiction over various classes of digital assets. That legislation, which passed out of committee last week, may be bundled into negotiations over the GENIUS Act or serve as a framework for broader crypto regulation should stablecoin adoption skyrocket. The GENIUS Act, in its current form, limits stablecoin issuance to regulated entities, requires full collateralization of token supplies, and subjects issuers to oversight by either the Federal Reserve or state-chartered banking authorities. Critics argue that without additional consumer protections, the law could create loopholes for political or financial manipulation — particularly given Trump’s vocal support and familial connections to the industry. Betting on Policy — Not Just Prices While platforms like Polymarket are not crystal balls, they do offer a glimpse into collective expectations from crypto-savvy users. And with an 89% probability priced in, it’s clear that the community is largely betting on passage and presidential approval within the next 18 months. However, these bets also show the broader financialization of politics in the crypto era, where traders are not just speculating on tokens, but on the outcome of congressional votes and regulatory decisions. Polymarket, itself a subject of regulatory scrutiny following a controversial $7 million wager on a Ukraine mineral extraction deal, has remained popular among crypto users for its real-time, market-based assessment of major geopolitical and financial events. If the House votes in favor and Trump follows through on his promise, the GENIUS Act could mark the single most significant legislative milestone for digital assets in US history — and an inflection point for the stablecoin industry globally. Circle Stock Soars 530% Since IPO as GENIUS Act and Stablecoin Momentum Fuel Investor Frenzy Just over two weeks since its much-anticipated initial public offering, Circle Internet Group (NASDAQ: CRCL) has become the breakout star of 2025’s public markets. The stablecoin issuer’s shares closed Wednesday at $199.59, a stunning 33.8% daily jump from its prior close and a jaw-dropping 530% surge from its IPO listing price of $31 on June 5. The company also posted record-breaking volume of 63.5 million shares traded, according to Yahoo Finance , and climbed an additional 6% in after-hours trading. The price rally is being fueled by a perfect storm of bullish developments for the digital asset sector — chief among them the US Senate’s recent passage of the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill to regulate fiat-backed digital currencies like Circle’s USDC. The legislation has ignited a new wave of investor enthusiasm not only for Circle but for the broader stablecoin and crypto-fintech industries. Circle Emerges as Market Bellwether for Stablecoin Sector Founded in 2013, Circle is best known for issuing USD Coin (USDC), the world’s second-largest dollar-pegged stablecoin behind Tether’s USDT. With a market cap of $61.4 billion, USDC now accounts for roughly 25% of the $243 billion stablecoin market. USDC’s footprint continues to expand. The token recently launched on the XRP Ledger , a move expected to boost cross-chain liquidity and access for Ripple users. In parallel, Coinbase Derivatives, a close institutional partner of Circle, revealed plans to support USDC as collateral for US crypto futures trading by 2026. “ Circle is becoming the Apple of stablecoins,” said one analyst at Galaxy Digital. “Their visibility, compliance-first approach, and expanding utility make them the most institutionally trusted stablecoin issuer — and the GENIUS Act could solidify their moat.” The stock’s incredible post-IPO performance appears to reflect this sentiment. CRCL is not just trading like a hot tech stock — it’s becoming the benchmark for institutional confidence in crypto’s regulated future. The Senate’s 68–30 approval of the GENIUS Act on Tuesday is widely seen as a regulatory watershed moment. The legislation would define clear standards for US stablecoin issuers, mandate full collateralization of tokens, and establish federal or state-level licensing requirements. While debate in the House remains ongoing — with concerns about Trump-linked firms like World Liberty Financial and its USD1 token — the market is treating the Act’s momentum as a signal that US policymakers are finally serious about supporting blockchain-based financial innovation. The ripple effects were immediate. Alongside Circle’s rally, Coinbase stock (COIN) also surged 16% on Wednesday, likely due to its close ties with USDC and its own efforts to grow stablecoin integrations across products. The IPO Floodgates May Be Opening Circle’s success may do more than lift its own valuation — it could set the stage for a wave of crypto companies eyeing US public markets. Digital asset exchange Kraken and fintech firm Gemini have both hinted at IPOs in 2025, and Circle’s spectacular debut will likely strengthen their cases to institutional investors and regulators. Meanwhile, interest from non-crypto giants is also on the rise. Retail titans Amazon and Walmart are rumored to be exploring their own stablecoin initiatives, potentially using a GENIUS Act framework to create branded digital dollars for supply chain payments and consumer rewards programs. Even geopolitical finance has become intertwined with the stablecoin surge: according to a prior report from The Block, World Liberty Financial’s USD1 token was used to settle a $2 billion investment from an Abu Dhabi sovereign fund into Binance, underscoring how stablecoins are now intermediating massive global deals.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-20 11:56:56

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/us-state-of-arizona-decides-how-to-evaluate-confiscated-bitcoins-here-are-the-details/,"The Arizona State Senate has approved a bill that would create a Bitcoin and Digital Asset Reserve Fund for confiscated crypto assets. Arizona Senate Approves Bitcoin Bill for Crypto Reserve Fund: All Eyes on House The bill, HB 2324, known as the “Bitcoin Reserve Bill,” is advancing toward a final vote in the House of Representatives, having passed by a vote of 16-14. The bill, which was first introduced in February and gained early support in both chambers, failed in a final vote in parliament last month. However, lawmakers brought it back to the agenda with “reconsideration” motions in both chambers. State-Managed Reserve Fund for Confiscated Cryptos If HB 2324 becomes law, it would create a management mechanism under the supervision of the Arizona State Treasury that would include options for crypto assets seized as a result of criminal investigations to be stored in state-approved wallets, sold on licensed crypto exchanges, or held in their local form depending on market conditions. The bill also updates Arizona’s forfeiture laws to include digital assets and establishes the regulatory framework for asset safekeeping. Several states across the US have begun to introduce similar legislation, in line with crypto regulation efforts that have accelerated since President Donald Trump’s return to power, with Arizona being one of the most active states on the issue. Earlier this year, Governor Katie Hobbs signed Arizona’s first successful digital asset bill, HB 2749, which established a reserve fund for unowned digital assets. HB 2387 also introduced consumer protection regulations for crypto ATMs. But Hobbs vetoed two more aggressive bills: SB 1025 called for 10% of state treasury and pension funds to be invested in crypto. SB 1373 aimed to establish a reserve fund for both confiscated and legislatively allocated cryptocurrencies. Governor Hobbs opposed these proposals, stating that crypto investments were too risky, especially for public pension systems. Next Step: Parliament Vote HB 2324 now awaits a final vote in the House of Representatives. If approved, Arizona would be one of the few U.S. states where crypto assets are legally and regulated under state oversight. This development could further strengthen cryptocurrencies’ position in U.S. government structures. *This is not investment advice.

Just ten years ago, the debt stood at $18 trillion. Now, it has more than doubled, raising serious worries about inflation, currency devaluation, and the long-term stability of the economy. Meanwhile, some experts believe Bitcoin and even stablecoins might offer some real solutions. Let’s see how! U.S. Double Down On Debt The U.S debt is growing by about $4.27 billion every day, and it has reached $37 trillion so far. If nothing changes, experts warn that interest payments alone could swallow up the entire budget, leaving little for things like Social Security, defense, or public services. Recently, Elon Musk on X said the U.S. is on the edge of “de facto bankruptcy,” with interest payments alone eating up 25% of government revenue. If this continues, America goes de facto bankrupt and all tax revenue will go to paying interest on the national debt with nothing left for anything else. https://t.co/lJ1RgywhGG — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 16, 2025 Meanwhile, economist Peter Schiff went a step further, claiming the U.S. is already bankrupt —it’s just not obvious yet. Why Bitcoin Is the Only Solution? Analysts are now calling Bitcoin a protective asset, especially as each U.S. citizen indirectly holds over $106,000 in national debt. That number shoots up to $323,000 per taxpayer. With a federal deficit of $2 trillion and spending of $7.1 trillion. However, over the past decade, when U.S debt doubled down, Bitcoin price has jumped from under $500 to more than $111,000. For many, this isn’t just a price chart; it’s proof that Bitcoin is becoming a financial lifeline. The US National Debt is now over $37 trillion. Our govt is spending $7.1 trillion The US govt budget deficit is over $2 trillion We are spending 25% of all US govt revenue on interest payments for the national debt. pic.twitter.com/I8UqhmMKDf — Wall Street Mav (@WallStreetMav) June 20, 2025 Raoul Pal, founder of Real Vision, compared Bitcoin to a “life raft” in these uncertain times. As central banks print more money, Bitcoin’s fixed supply becomes even more attractive. Pal believes Bitcoin not only protects against inflation but also grows in value as more people adopt it. Stablecoins: A Surprising New Ally? While Bitcoin acts as a hedge, stablecoins may play a different role — one that could help reduce the debt itself. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently suggested that Stablecoins are backed by U.S. Treasury bonds. As the stablecoin market grows, so will the demand for these bonds, possibly lowering government borrowing costs. The GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate stablecoins and mandate Treasury bond holdings, has passed the Senate and awaits a House vote.

Some analysts believe Shiba Inu has reached a bottom and could be gearing up for a massive rally. These Memes Might Thrive The X account Shibarium Updates recently warned about the inevitable arrival of a white swan event that will most likely negatively impact the cryptocurrency sector. The team, however, claimed that investors holding Shiba Inu (SHIB) and other meme coins, part of its ecosystem, such as BONE, LEASH, TREAT, and SHEB, might be protected and could actually benefit. “Because not everyone will ride it. Only the ones who stayed building in silence – and holding the right tokens,” the alert reads. A white swan event refers to a relatively predictable crisis that is likely to send shockwaves throughout the financial and crypto markets. On the contrary, black swan events in all financial markets, including crypto, come out of the blue and usually cause major setbacks. The self-proclaimed Dogecoin-killer (Shiba Inu) has not been immune to such incidents. In May 2022, for instance, its price saw a substantial drop following the collapse of Terra (LUNA) and its algorithmic stablecoin (UST). A similar downtrend was observed in November 2022, when the once-prominent crypto exchange FTX experienced a liquidity crisis and was unable to honor its clients’ withdrawal requests. Shortly after, its problems intensified , and its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), resigned while the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. SHIB’s Next Potential Targets Despite plunging by almost 20% on a monthly scale, Shiba Inu remains the subject of optimistic price predictions. Earlier this week, a popular X user claimed that the asset “is pretty much at the bottom” and appears to be approaching an important support zone. “If it really hits that support, it’ll likely move sideways for a while before the next growth phase. Stay confident and keep holding or even buy more SHIB,” they added. Prior to that, CryptoELITES opined that “everything is just getting started for SHIB,” envisioning a whopping 17x increase in the near future . Such a rally would position the price at an all-time high of roughly $0.00023.

The announcement comes just after researchers uncovered a major data breach exposing over 16 billion login credentials. Tether Enters Privacy Tech Race With PearPass, Aiming to Secure Crypto Users Password Post-Leak Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino shared the news on X, revealing that the company is preparing to launch PearPass, a fully open-source password manager built to run without servers or remote storage. “The cloud has failed us. Again,” Ardoino wrote. “16 billion passwords just leaked. It’s time to ditch the cloud. That’s why we’ve been building PearPass.” The cloud has failed us. Again. 16 billion passwords just leaked. It’s time to ditch the cloud. That’s why we’ve been building PearPass — coming soon. A fully local, open-source password manager. No cloud. No servers. No leaks. Ever. Just you — and your keys, stored securely… https://t.co/FkL1wrdpCo pic.twitter.com/wynlieJ2E4 — Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) June 19, 2025 The data breach, uncovered by the Cybernews research team , includes stolen credentials from major online platforms such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Telegram, and GitHub. Many of the datasets were compiled using info-stealer malware and other techniques, some containing over 3 billion entries alone. Cybernews warned that the breach poses a severe threat to digital identity and crypto asset security, calling it “a blueprint for mass exploitation.” The structure of the data, including recent login tokens, cookies, and credentials, makes it especially dangerous for crypto users. In response, Ardoino said Tether had been quietly building PearPass to help address the risks posed by centralized storage. Unlike most popular password managers, PearPass will not rely on the cloud or external servers. “It’s a fully local, open-source password manager,” Ardoino wrote. “No cloud. No servers. No leaks.

Just you — and your keys, stored securely on your devices.” PearPass mood and product https://t.co/1ZKqkYtJXZ pic.twitter.com/JoWj0L5nnT — Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) June 20, 2025 The tool is designed to eliminate the single point of failure that comes with remote servers. All password data and encryption keys will be kept on users’ personal devices, reducing the risk of third-party exposure or surveillance. While the full extent of the recent leak is still being analyzed, researchers confirmed that much of the exposed data is fresh and likely harvested in recent months. Several sets were linked to specific platforms, including a Telegram-related dump with 60 million records and another linked to Russian sources with over 450 million. The records were mostly found on unsecured Elasticsearch and cloud storage systems . Though these databases were exposed only briefly, researchers were able to download their contents. The origin of the leak remains unclear, but experts suspect cybercriminal involvement. According to Cybernews, new credential dumps have been surfacing every few weeks, signaling an ongoing threat. The scale and recency of the latest breach has raised concerns across the crypto and digital asset community. PearPass is expected to be released soon, as Tether continues to position itself at the center of data privacy and digital asset security conversations. For now, Ardoino’s message to the public is clear: trust in the cloud is eroding fast, and users may need to take control of their own keys. Tether Unveils Plans for Decentralized AI Platform with Built-In Crypto Payments Tether is expanding beyond stablecoins and into artificial intelligence with the upcoming launch of Tether AI , a decentralized, open-source AI platform designed to run on peer-to-peer networks. Unveiled by CEO Paolo Ardoino on May 5, Tether AI will support direct payments in USDT and Bitcoin, and will operate without centralized servers or API keys. It’s described as a modular AI runtime capable of running on any device, offering developers greater privacy, autonomy, and security. At its core is a concept called “Personal Infinite Intelligence”, suggesting customizable AI agents tailored to user needs and hardware. Tether’s in-house AI models are already powering tools like a translation service, voice assistant, and Bitcoin wallet assistant, according to Ardoino. The move comes as Tether reported over $1 billion in Q1 2025 operating profit , fueled by strong returns from its $120 billion U.S. Treasury exposure, per its latest attestation by BDO. Tether’s USDT remains the leading stablecoin globally with a $150 billion market cap and a 66% market share, according to Nansen.

He expects XRP to usher in a new financial age and points to an eventual future where a three-digit XRP valuation is inevitable, provided investors are patient . Such projections come at a time when market sentiment is mixed. Regulatory uncertainty in the U.S., geopolitical instability, and fluctuating institutional interest continue to affect confidence. Still, Ripple’s ongoing global expansion, its deep ties to cross-border payment infrastructure, and the anticipated regulatory clarity following the imminent conclusion of its legal battle with the SEC have led many to view XRP as a viable candidate for significant growth. By the end of summer things are about to get crazy in crypto, specifically for $XRP . $XRP will own this 'Cycle' as you can now tell by the narratives… Wall Street will soon smash down the doors, & retail will be priced out immediately as we see a $13 XRP in a heart beat.… — Ripples (@Ripplesinwales) June 18, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Responses Some users aligned with the projection that XRP could hit $13 this year. Doppler Finance referred to the upcoming months as “the season of XRP yield,” while another community member said he’d be “quite happy” with a $13 valuation. However, some skeptics shared their opinions on the asset’s future, with some dismissing the forecast entirely, suggesting such predictions are designed only to keep speculation alive. Can XRP Realistically Reach $13? From a technical standpoint, the path to $13 would require a significant breakout past key psychological and historical resistance levels. XRP recently saw significant growth, rising from around $0.55 to $3.39 between November 2024 and January 2025. This remarkable performance renewed investors’ hope in the digital asset’s growth potential. Other experts believe XRP’s current price of $2 presents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for accumulation before a rapid rise to $100 or more. While some skeptics point to its market cap or other macroeconomic factors, investors who know XRP’s capability are holding in anticipation of a massive breakout.

Price predictions for 2025 range from $1.95 to $9.00. NEAR price may reach a high of $71.78 by 2030. As altcoin momentum intensifies, Near Protocol (NEAR) is rapidly emerging as a standout contender in the crypto space. Fueled by strong fundamentals and recent bullish market trends, NEAR’s rise has caught the attention of both retail and institutional investors. With NEAR now bridging to Solana and TON via Chain Signatures, the future looks promising. Wondering where it’s headed next? Dive into our in-depth NEAR Price Prediction 2025 – 2030 to uncover the possibilities.

CoinPedia’s NEAR Price Prediction FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency NEAR Protocol Token NEAR Price $ 2.18104587 0.64% Market Cap $ 2,678,477,884.2704 Circulating Supply 1,228,070,402.00 Trading Volume $ 125,357,496.7865 All-time High $20.42 on 17th January 2022 All-time Low $0.526 on 04th November 2020 NEAR Price Prediction 2025 After a $9 peak in Q1 of 2024 Q1 it slipped to $3.5 from sell pressure, but Donald Trump winning the election in Q4 boosted the altcoin sector that benefited NEAR. The hopes wer higher for a new ATH and even crossing the psychological $10 mark but NEAR price only uplifted to $8.2, due to encountering a strong supply level. This supply level gave a hard time to its price action in Q1 2025, even $3.5 multi-month support was breached and turned into a resistance by dipping to a low of $1.8. However, in Q2, recovery was seen, but it remained brief, lasting until mid-May. At present, in the third week of June, it is following an ascending wedge, and NEAR is at the lower border’s support, which aligns close to April’s swing low’s support range. If it falls from here, then the $1.8 would be its short-term defense line; further break below will magnify investors’ fears. Under this possible condition, if NEAR price succeeds in destroying the $1.8 support, then it will aim for the $1.0 mark. However, by the last week of June or July, if the bullish factors reawaken, then a short-term rise could be seen. This might push for a retest of the $3.5 resistance. Additionally, if the adoption and institutional interest rise, followed by improved geopolitical conditions, then the entire altcoin market could be nourished. There is a pretty high chance that, like last year, NEAR price may aim to retest the $8 to $9 supply range by 2025 end, but for that, it must give a weekly close over $3.5 in June or July, and must register a Change of Character (ChoCh) above $4.345 in the following months for long-term bullish confirmation.

Weaker retail interest and market uncertainty slowed ETH’s momentum. Firm still believes ETH can revisit previous all-time high. Bitwise’s Head of Research recently shared a mid-year update on the firm’s 2025 price predictions for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. At the start of the year, Bitwise shared bold targets for these top cryptocurrencies, expecting a strong market rally. Now, six months later, the expert returned to discuss what’s changed, what’s holding steady, and how the current market conditions have impacted those forecasts. On the Milkroad podcast, Ryan Rasmussen said that while the price predictions are never exact, the firm is still confident about Bitcoin reaching $200,000. “We’re holding strong on Bitcoin,” he confirmed. However, Bitwise has revised its earlier targets for Ethereum and Solana. The firm had previously predicted $7,000 for Ethereum, but now expects it to reach its previous all-time high of just over $4,500 by year-end.

These Are the 4 Best Cryptos Right Now to Catch Up!,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-bitcoins-rally-these-are-the-4-best-cryptos-right-now-to-catch-up/,"The way we think about money has shifted due to crypto’s rise. As blockchain keeps changing, more coins are offering fresh tools and growth chances. Whether you’re just getting started or want to mix up your holdings, the best cryptos right now bring real potential in 2025. These picks each tackle different crypto challenges, and many are also easy for beginners to use. Let’s break down why these coins matter, starting with BlockDAG, which has drawn attention for making things simple for first-time users. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG) BlockDAG has caught a lot of attention for its easy-to-use approach. Its X1 Miner App works through a “tap-to-earn” setup, which helps people mine coins without needing any tech background. BlockDAG makes the process simple and low-risk, unlike old-style mining with high energy and setup costs. Over 2 million people now use the X1 App, most of them new to crypto or Web3. The app is available on mobile, making entry into crypto smooth and not overwhelming. The presale has already pulled in $313.5 million, and 22.8 billion coins have been sold. The price for Batch 29 is now $0.0276, and early supporters have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since Batch 1. Still, there’s a limited-time price offer of $0.0018 open till June 20. The GO LIVE reveal has already happened, and 20 exchange listings have been confirmed. With its easy user path and strong early numbers, BlockDAG (BDAG) ranks high among the best cryptos right now. 2. Monero (XMR) Monero is a top choice when it comes to privacy. What makes it stand out is how it keeps all transaction details hidden. This includes both the sender and receiver, thanks to advanced coding techniques. It’s a strong pick for people who are serious about keeping their financial data private. Though not as widely known as Bitcoin, Monero has built a loyal user base focused on security. With more people worried about data misuse, Monero is becoming more important. 3. Aave (AAVE) Aave is a leading name in the DeFi sector. It gives users a way to lend and borrow crypto directly, skipping banks or other middlemen. You can earn interest by lending or borrowing funds using your crypto as backup. Running on Ethereum, Aave’s system uses liquidity pools, and it offers tools like flash loans. These features have made it a go-to option in the DeFi area. With more people turning to DeFi, Aave keeps gaining attention as one of the best cryptos right now. 4. Celestia (CEL) Celestia brings a new solution to a common issue: blockchain scaling. Its system is modular, meaning it splits the core parts, like consensus and execution, into different layers. This lets it process more transactions smoothly and store data better. Developers benefit too. They can build apps without facing the usual problems of older systems. This smart setup gives Celestia a performance edge and helps it handle future demands better. Final Take! Crypto is always changing, but these top picks offer solid value for all levels of users. BlockDAG stands out with its beginner-friendly app and strong early performance. Monero leads in privacy, Aave boosts DeFi use, and Celestia improves blockchain scaling. As the market grows, these names continue to show strong promise. Whether you’re new or building a broader crypto profile, these are some of the best cryptos right now to watch for solid returns and useful features. The post Missed Bitcoin’s Rally?

Retail comment threads have turned caustic, he notes, because price has slipped from last autumn’s spike and then “done nothing for months.” Yet such fatigue is precisely what bull-market retracements are meant to produce: “A lot of people are getting really bitter about Doge … that’s exactly how higher highs and higher low type situations are supposed to get you all frustrated. This is still a bull trend until proven otherwise.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Looks Like ‘It Wants To Play Dead’—Again At the highest zoom level, Dogecoin is tracing what he calls “still a cup and … still a handle until proven otherwise.” The first thrust of that handle halted almost exactly at the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement of the 2022–24 bear range—“a very important fib level here.” Because initial attempts rarely pierce that resistance, he expected rejection. What matters is where the pullback found support: “In the case of Dogecoin, it decided to go all the way down to 0.382, which is nothing unusual … this is actually a pretty important zone of this nice Adam-and-Eve double bottom.” The market is therefore testing, not violating, an historically powerful neckline. Zooming to the monthly chart, Dogecoin sits beneath what the analyst calls “a pretty thick Ichimoku cloud.” Two breakout attempts have failed, producing a pair of wicks that look ominous to casual chart watchers. Cantonese Cat disagrees: “We had a little bit of a false breakout here on the monthly … I think a third time is going to be the charm.” Beneath the cloud, six consecutive monthly candles have nested entirely inside the tall green bar printed last November. He interprets the formation—six inside bars—as latency building for a violent move: “You’re talking about consolidation with six inside candles forming a lot of energy here.” That compression is mirrored on the weekly time frame: “If you also look at the weekly here, you can also see that you have six inside candles over here too … that tells me that there is not much bearish energy necessarily left anymore. I think we’re closer to the bottom than the top.” Key structural support is supplied by a rising 20-month simple moving average, now at $0.1737. Price currently ticks below it, but the slope is still positive. Historically, such combinations resolve in favour of the trend: “If you have a 20-month moving average that is up-sloping, most likely this is just going to be a wick.” He cites an earlier cycle when Dogecoin wicked beneath the same metric before staging a dramatic reversal. Price action, he argues, is meaningless without context. “If I end up looking at Doge here on Coinbase and I pull up the volume here, you can also see that there is no selling volume here at all.” Binance, the world’s deepest Dogecoin market, shows identical inertia. “The selling volume is essentially non-existent,” he says, concluding that supply overhang has vaporised and only demand is required to propel a reversal. Twice before—in July 2023 and February 2024—identical volume droughts preceded V-shaped rallies: “Low selling volume over here, reversal once volume comes in … low selling volume over here, reversal once volume comes in.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Shows Signs Of Life With Bottoming Signal Daily-chart oscillators are beginning to corroborate the structural read. Dogecoin has just registered what Cantonese Cat labels a “treasure bottom”—his term for a localised capitulation whose candle body is far smaller than its wick. More formally, the relative-strength index has exhibited bullish divergence: price has etched lower lows while RSI turns higher. “Last time when you have some bullish diversions was right here … that was the local bottom right there,” he says, pointing to the October 2023 reversal. The pattern repeated in March 2024 and appears again today: “I think that we might be experiencing a trend change here relatively soon.” DOGE Price Targets Should volume arrive and price claw back through the 0.5 and 0.618 retracements, Cantonese Cat’s Fibonacci ladders flag successive targets. From the Binance dataset, “$1.60, $2.26 and $4.13, all of these are possibility for Dogecoin.” A composite feed of multiple exchanges tweaks the numbers to $1.50, $2.27 and $3.94. What he does not foresee is a reprise of 2021’s parabolic blow-off, when Dogecoin tagged the 2.272 extension and briefly suggested a trajectory towards $23. “I think that $23 doge is insane … I don’t think that doge is going to end up becoming, you know, like anything like $3 trillion market cap.” A quarter- to half-trillion-dollar capitalisation, however—roughly the price zone between three and four dollars—remains “something to think about” given current monetary expansion. Cantonese Cat interprets the community’s malaise as a contrarian gift: “The market makers are giving us more time to buy while the sentiment is extremely, extremely poor.” Inside-bar ranges serve as a simple trigger. A close above the six-month range high would, in his reading, unlock the primary up-trend’s next leg. Conversely, a close below the 20-month average might delay—but not necessarily invalidate—the thesis, provided the moving average itself keeps rising. Across every lens—the macro cup-and-handle, the Adam-and-Eve neckline test, Ichimoku resistance, 20-month moving average support, volume exhaustion, daily bullish divergence—the weight of evidence converges on a bullish outcome. Timing, he concedes, is unknowable: “When is that going to be? I don’t know.” Yet none of the data justify capitulation. He closes with the maxim he repeats three times in the broadcast: “The trend is your friend, and the trend is up.” If that view holds, Dogecoin’s dormant coil may eventually unwind toward the analyst’s most ambitious extension at $4.13—a level unthinkable to today’s demoralised sellers, and precisely for that reason, he argues, still within reach. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.171.

Investors are now wondering which of the two meme coins will be at the forefront of the next meme coin surge, even though both have sparked interest in the erratic 2025 cryptocurrency market. Under-the-radar but steady interest is also building in a lesser-known but hugely practical token Remittix. Meme Coin Popularity vs Performance Potential The meme coin market has always been driven by hype, community and sudden surges. Shiba Inu, with a market cap of $6.78 billion, still enjoys strong backing, but its daily trading volume is down by over 25%, signaling waning momentum for now. Pepe , on the other hand, has fared a little better in the near term. It boasts a $4.32 billion market cap and over $690 million in trading volume. That suggests more robust speculative activity than SHIB, despite being the newer coin. Yet neither of these meme coins offers any actual utility yet which is why so many investors are shifting attention to real-world tokens like Remittix (RTX). Where Remittix Differs Unlike trend-following meme coins, Remittix is tackling real problems. The project facilitates the sending of crypto like BTC, ETH and XRP directly to traditional bank accounts globally, in minutes. With over 544 million tokens sold, having already amassed $15.8 million+, and at a price of $0.0781 at the time of writing, Remittix is no longer flying under the radar. Investors are attracted to not only the project’s fast-growing community but also its real-world use case in the $190 trillion payments sector globally. The upcoming Remittix wallet launch in Q3 will propel the ecosystem even more. The wallet will allow for instant conversions and seamless transfers, giving RTX an enormous edge over tokens with no use case outside speculation. Bonus Offers and Strategic Momentum Remittix is also offering a 50% token bonus as it works towards its $18 million soft cap. That’s a nice incentive for investors who want to get in on the ground floor of a token that’s clearly making progress. This development rush and investor confidence place Remittix in a different class compared to meme coins. SHIB and PEPE could still explode if market sentiment shifts, but smart money is increasingly shifting towards utility-focused assets. Final Thoughts: Meme Coin Fireworks or Real-World Utility? Shiba Inu and Pepe can lead short-term pumps but have no use case, while Remittix combines hype and utility and that’s the game-changer in a maturing crypto market. As meme coin fatigue sets in, RTX is a coin with potential to not just survive the next pump but outperform it entirely.

The exchange announced a temporary deposit withdrawal suspension for the Siacoin SC cryptocurrency, citing a network issue as the reason. This move, while potentially inconvenient for users, is a standard procedure exchanges follow to protect user funds and maintain system integrity when underlying blockchain networks face technical difficulties. What Prompted Upbit’s Siacoin SC Suspension? According to the official announcement released by Upbit , the decision to halt Siacoin SC deposits and withdrawals was made effective immediately. The core reason provided was a detected network issue affecting the Siacoin blockchain itself. Crypto exchanges like Upbit operate by interacting directly with the native blockchain network of each supported cryptocurrency. When a network experiences instability, delays, or other technical problems, it can become unsafe or impossible for the exchange to reliably process transactions (deposits and withdrawals) for that specific asset. Common types of network issue s that can trigger such suspensions include: Blockchain Syncing Problems: The exchange’s wallet nodes may struggle to keep up with the latest state of the blockchain. Transaction Processing Delays: Transactions might get stuck or fail to confirm properly on the network. Wallet Software Issues: The specific wallet software used by the exchange for the asset might encounter bugs or require updates due to network changes. Consensus Mechanism Glitches: Problems within the network’s validation or mining process. By suspending services, Upbit prevents potential loss of funds or irreversible errors that could occur if users attempt to deposit or withdraw Siacoin SC while the network is unstable. It’s a precautionary measure taken to safeguard user assets and the exchange’s operational stability. Immediate Impact of the Deposit Withdrawal Suspension For individuals holding Siacoin SC on the Upbit platform, the most direct consequence is the inability to move their tokens on or off the exchange. This means: You cannot send Siacoin SC from an external wallet or another exchange to your Upbit account. You cannot send Siacoin SC from your Upbit account to an external wallet or another exchange. It is absolutely crucial that users refrain from attempting to initiate Siacoin SC transfers to their Upbit deposit addresses while the suspension is active. Any SC sent to Upbit during this period may not be credited and could potentially be lost, as the exchange’s systems are not configured to handle incoming transactions for the suspended asset under these conditions. It is important to note that in most cases of a temporary deposit withdrawal suspension due to a network issue , trading of the affected asset on the exchange continues as normal. Users can typically still buy, sell, or trade their Siacoin SC holdings against other cryptocurrencies or fiat pairs available on Upbit . The suspension only affects the movement of tokens into and out of the exchange’s ecosystem. Actionable Steps for Upbit Siacoin SC Holders If you are an Upbit user with Siacoin SC , here are the key actions you should take: Stay Informed: Regularly check Upbit’s official website and announcement channels. This is where they will provide updates on the status of the network issue and the eventual resumption of deposit and withdrawal services. Avoid relying on unofficial sources for critical information. Do Not Attempt Transfers: As mentioned, do not try to deposit or withdraw Siacoin SC until Upbit officially announces that services have resumed. Assess Your Needs: If you urgently need to move your Siacoin SC off the exchange, you will unfortunately have to wait for the suspension to be lifted. If your need is to trade, confirm if trading is still active on the platform. Understand the Risk: This event highlights the inherent risks associated with holding cryptocurrencies on an exchange. While convenient for trading, it means you are reliant on the exchange’s operational status and its ability to interact with the underlying blockchain networks. The Role of a Major Crypto Exchange Like Upbit Upbit is one of the largest and most influential crypto exchange platforms, particularly in the South Korean market. Operating such a large exchange involves managing thousands or even millions of user wallets across numerous different blockchain networks. Each network has its own technical requirements, update schedules, and potential vulnerabilities. Therefore, exchanges like Upbit must constantly monitor the health and stability of every blockchain they support. When a network issue arises for an asset like Siacoin SC , the exchange’s technical team must diagnose whether the issue impacts their ability to safely process transactions. If it does, a temporary deposit withdrawal suspension is the responsible action to take. This protects both the exchange from potential technical or financial liabilities and, more importantly, prevents users from losing funds by sending them into a system that cannot currently process them correctly. While inconvenient, these suspensions demonstrate that the exchange is actively monitoring the networks and taking steps to ensure the integrity of user assets. A lack of action during a known network problem could be far more detrimental. Broader Implications: Network Health and User Confidence Events like the Siacoin SC suspension on Upbit serve as a reminder of the technical complexities underlying the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The performance and reliability of individual blockchain networks are paramount not only for their intended use cases (like decentralized storage for Siacoin) but also for their accessibility and tradability on exchanges. For users, such incidents underscore the importance of diversifying where they hold their assets and understanding the difference between holding crypto on an exchange (where the exchange controls the private keys) and holding it in a self-custody wallet (where the user controls the private keys). While exchanges offer liquidity and trading convenience, self-custody offers direct control and isn’t subject to exchange-specific suspensions or issues. A temporary deposit withdrawal suspension due to a legitimate network issue is generally viewed differently than a suspension due to exchange-specific problems (like solvency issues or security breaches). When the reason is external (a blockchain network issue ), it often indicates the exchange is acting prudently. However, prolonged suspensions or poor communication can erode user confidence. What to Expect Next? The duration of the Siacoin SC deposit withdrawal suspension on Upbit will depend entirely on how quickly the underlying network issue with Siacoin is resolved. The process typically involves: The Siacoin network developers identifying and fixing the root cause of the problem. The network stabilizing and operating normally for a sustained period. Upbit ‘s technical team verifying the network’s health and ensuring their wallet systems can reliably interact with it again. Internal testing by Upbit to confirm deposits and withdrawals function correctly. An official announcement from Upbit confirming the resumption of services for Siacoin SC deposits and withdrawals. Users should exercise patience during this period and rely solely on official communications from Upbit regarding the resumption timeline. Conclusion: Navigating Temporary Service Disruptions The temporary suspension of Siacoin SC deposits and withdrawals by Upbit is a direct consequence of a network issue affecting the Siacoin blockchain. This measure, while inconvenient, is a standard safety protocol implemented by the crypto exchange to protect user funds and ensure operational integrity during periods of blockchain instability. For affected users, the crucial steps are to avoid attempting transfers and to monitor Upbit ‘s official channels for updates on the resumption of services. Events like these highlight the interconnectedness of exchanges and the underlying blockchain networks they support, as well as reminding users about the different considerations between holding assets on an exchange versus in self-custody.

Bitcoin has broken through the historical high of $110,000, Ethereum has shown new potential after the Pectra upgrade, and XRP is experiencing an unprecedented wave of institutional adoption - more than 50 international banks and payment companies around the world have integrated XRP into cross-border settlement networks. However, market volatility remains a huge challenge for ordinary investors. In early June, the price of XRP fluctuated by more than 12% in a single day, and traditional currency holding strategies could not cope with such violent fluctuations. In this context, the ETHRANSACTION cloud mining platform has attracted XRP holders seeking stable passive income with its unique advantages. Through the innovative cloud mining model, investors can convert their XRP holdings into digital assets that continue to generate income without having to deal with hardware equipment or technical problems. XRP market status and investor dilemma In the wave of digitalization of the global financial system, XRP is quietly reshaping the international payment landscape. Behind this change is the increasingly close cooperation between Ripple and Asian and European banks, which has significantly increased the practical application of XRP in cross-border transactions. Compared with the traditional SWIFT system, XRP not only significantly reduces processing fees, but also shortens transaction time from days to seconds. However, investors' dilemmas are hidden under the surface prosperity of the market. Data from June 2025 showed that the price of XRP fluctuated by more than 45% within 30 days, and short-term investors faced huge risks. At the same time, the regulatory environment remains complex. Although the long-term lawsuit between the US SEC and Ripple has come to an end, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission is considering introducing virtual asset derivatives trading for professional investors and plans to issue a second policy declaration on the development of virtual assets. These policy changes have added uncertainty to the market. The traditional mining model is even less friendly to XRP holders. The cost of mining machines remains high. An efficient Bitcoin mining machine costs more than $6,000. Coupled with high electricity and maintenance costs, ordinary investors are discouraged. Faced with market fluctuations and the limitations of traditional investment channels, XRP holders are in urgent need of a stable income channel. They need a solution that can not only utilize their XRP assets but also avoid drastic market fluctuations. ETHRANSACTION cloud mining service platform has become the rational and best choice in this context. ETHRANSACTION platform core advantages Founded in the UK in 2017, ETHRANSACTION is a global leading cloud mining platform. It has been certified by the UK regulator and has more than 8 million users in more than 180 countries and regions. The platform has designed a safe, stable and efficient income system for XRP holders. Security and compliance protection Financial institution-level protection: The platform adopts a multi-level security architecture, including SSL encryption, L&G insurance and a 24/7 all-weather monitoring system to ensure the security of user funds and information. All user assets are protected by insurance companies, which is rare in the cloud mining industry. Regulatory compliance: ETHRANSACTION holds a UK financial regulatory license and strictly complies with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. This compliance allows institutional investors to participate with peace of mind. Transparent operation mechanism: The platform's investment income is settled daily, users can view daily profit details in real time, and all capital flows are transparent and traceable.

Stable operation guarantee: Globally deployed cloud servers ensure 100% uptime of the platform, and any technical problems are handled immediately by 24/7 online technical support. Transparent and stable returns Unlike the volatile cryptocurrency market, ETHRANSACTION provides fixed-rate contracts. After users invest XRP to purchase a mining contract, they can obtain the agreed returns regardless of whether the market rises or falls the next day. Diversified contract plans and flexible participation methods ETHRANSACTION has designed a tiered contract plan for XRP holders of different fund sizes, from a novice experience of $19 to a professional-level investment of $570,000, all of which provide clear and transparent return expectations. Each contract on the platform is clearly priced like a financial product, with no hidden fees or complex terms. This transparency is particularly valuable in the cryptocurrency field. · Contract investment price $100, contract term 2 days, daily income $9, total income $100+$18. · Contract investment price $600.00, contract term 5 days, daily income $7.5, total income $600.00 + $37.5. · Contract investment price $1300, contract term 14 days, daily income $16.9, total income $1300 + $236.6. The common advantage of all contracts is that profits are automatically settled every 24 hours. When the account balance reaches the threshold of $100, users can choose to withdraw to a crypto wallet or reinvest to purchase more contracts. Registration and rewards: New users will receive a $19 bonus upon registration, and can earn $0.9 income by logging in daily to purchase a $19 trial contract. XRP top-up: Deposit XRP directly through a supported wallet, and the platform will automatically convert it into mining computing power. Contract selection: Choose a suitable plan based on risk preference and fund size, and purchase with one click. Sit back and enjoy the benefits: The system runs automatically and starts to generate profits the next day. Users can check the income data at any time. Affiliate program: a participation path without investment For users who are temporarily unwilling to invest funds, the platform provides an innovative affiliate referral program. By promoting new users, participants can receive commissions of up to $370,000.

However, while the two sides have continued exchanging missiles, the crypto news of the $90M hack on Nobitex, by the pro-Israel hack group Predatory Sparrow, has put a new look on the crisis. While there is no actual crypto news linking the crypto attack to the Israeli government, the message attached to the transactions included words like “F*ckIRGCterrorists”. From the crypto news gathered, the attack started by draining the Nobitex hot wallet, from which the stolen assets were moved to multiple vanity addresses . To complete the attack, the hackers ensured the vanity addresses are computationally impossible to access, effectively burning off the $90M permanently. Why This Crypto News Continues To Raise Concern One point that has stood out in the crypto news is the attention it brings to how hackers are gradually opening up access to crypto, a tool for state weaponization. Also, the burned Bitcoin, Ethereum and Doge now enter the book as a hack beyond the regular hack for profit, with the destructive action. This crypto news also raises interest in how crypto exchange security is approached, with concern now on investors.

A June 19 case study by cryptocurrency payment processor CoinGate , shows that 12% of all crypto payments on NordVPN , its partner platform, are made using Litecoin ( LTC ) and TRON ( TRX ), which accounted for 5.7% and 5.4% of all transactions, respectively. Bitcoin ( BTC ) dominates, with 40.9% of the NordVPN user base relying on it as their go-to choice. Tether ( USDT ) takes the silver, supporting 29.1% of all cryptocurrency payments. Most often used cryptos at NordVPN. Source: CoinGate Altcoin VPN payments The popularity of alternatives like LTC and TRX highlights a clear shift in user preferences for networks that offer lower fees and better scalability. Actually, the trend reflects the overall increasing popularity of altcoins. For example, CoinGate reported that TRON was the most-used blockchain on the platform in 2024, largely due to its strong support for USDT and low-cost architecture. Memecoins are not to be ignored either. Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), for instance, saw a 61.6% increase in payment volume on CoinGate in 2024, propelled by its availability on Polygon (POL, formerly MATIC ) and Binance Smart Chain ( BSC ). All in all, while it is probably unlikely that stablecoins are getting dethroned any time soon, the payment flexibility provided by altcoins is hardly negligible, and their prominence is only expected to rise in the future.

Animoca Brands , a well-known name in blockchain gaming and Web3 investments, is making a significant move into the stablecoin arena. They’ve joined forces with two giants: Standard Chartered Bank, a global banking leader, and HKT (Hong Kong Telecom), a major telecommunications provider. This powerful trio is forming a joint venture with the explicit goal of preparing for the launch of a Hong Kong dollar-pegged stablecoin. This news, initially reported by National Business Daily, signals a strong commitment from key players to bridge traditional finance and the burgeoning world of Web3 right in the heart of Hong Kong. Why is an HKD Stablecoin a Big Deal for Hong Kong Crypto ? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to minimize price volatility, typically by being pegged to a stable asset like a fiat currency (like the US dollar or, in this case, the Hong Kong dollar), gold, or another cryptocurrency. An HKD stablecoin , specifically tied to the Hong Kong dollar, holds unique importance for several reasons: Local Relevance: It provides a stable digital asset directly tied to the local economy, making it intuitive for Hong Kong residents and businesses to use. Bridging Fiats and Digital Assets: It acts as a crucial on-ramp and off-ramp between the traditional financial system and the digital asset space within Hong Kong’s regulatory framework. Facilitating Local Transactions: An HKD stablecoin could streamline payments, remittances, and other financial activities domestically and potentially internationally for users dealing in HKD. Boosting the Local Ecosystem: It can serve as foundational infrastructure for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications, NFT marketplaces, and Web3 platforms operating within or targeting the Hong Kong market, thereby fostering the growth of Hong Kong crypto activities. This initiative aligns perfectly with Hong Kong’s stated ambitions to become a leading hub for virtual assets and Web3 innovation. By developing a locally-pegged stablecoin, this joint venture could provide the necessary digital rails for significant economic activity in the digital realm. The Power Trio: Animoca Brands , Standard Chartered , and HKT The strength of this joint venture lies in the diverse expertise brought by each partner. Let’s break down their potential roles: Partner Core Expertise Potential Contribution to Stablecoin Project Animoca Brands Web3, Blockchain Gaming, NFTs, Digital Property Rights Driving Web3 integration, identifying use cases in gaming/metaverse, digital asset strategy, community building. Standard Chartered Traditional Banking, Financial Services, Regulatory Compliance, Global Network Ensuring financial stability, regulatory adherence, potential banking rails for issuance/redemption, treasury management. HKT (Hong Kong Telecom) Telecommunications, Local Market Reach, Consumer Services, Infrastructure Leveraging existing customer base, exploring payment integration, infrastructure support, understanding local user needs. This combination is particularly interesting. Animoca Brands brings the native understanding of the digital asset space and potential demand from Web3 users. Standard Chartered provides the crucial financial backbone, regulatory know-how, and trust associated with traditional banking. HKT adds local market penetration and potential distribution channels. This synergy is vital for successful stablecoin development that can navigate both the technical and regulatory landscapes. Exploring the Potential of Stablecoin Development in Hong Kong The development of an HKD stablecoin opens up a world of possibilities for users and businesses in Hong Kong and beyond. Beyond simple value transfer, consider these potential use cases: Seamless Payments: Faster and cheaper cross-border remittances or even domestic payments compared to traditional methods. DeFi Accessibility: Providing a stable, local currency base for participation in decentralized finance protocols without foreign exchange risk for HKD holders. NFT & Metaverse Commerce: Enabling smoother transactions for digital collectibles and virtual goods within Animoca Brands’ ecosystem and other Web3 platforms. Payroll & E-commerce: Potential for businesses to pay employees or accept payments using the stablecoin. Programmable Money: The ability to integrate the stablecoin into smart contracts for automated processes, escrow services, and more. Successful stablecoin development isn’t just about the technology; it’s about building trust, ensuring regulatory compliance, and fostering adoption. The involvement of a major bank like Standard Chartered and a local powerhouse like HKT alongside a Web3 native like Animoca Brands significantly increases the likelihood of addressing these critical factors. What Challenges Lie Ahead? While the prospects are exciting, the path to launching and scaling a successful stablecoin is not without its hurdles. The joint venture will need to navigate: Regulatory Approval: Obtaining the necessary licenses and complying with Hong Kong’s evolving regulatory framework for stablecoins will be paramount. Maintaining the Peg: Ensuring the stablecoin consistently holds its value against the HKD requires robust reserve management and transparency. Adoption: Convincing individuals and businesses to use the stablecoin over existing payment methods or other digital assets. Competition: The global stablecoin market is competitive, and other fiat-pegged stablecoins (like USDT or USDC) are already widely used, even in HKD-denominated markets. Technical Implementation & Security: Building a secure, scalable, and reliable blockchain infrastructure for the stablecoin. The collaboration between such established entities suggests a serious approach to tackling these challenges, leveraging their combined experience and resources. A Step Forward for Hong Kong Crypto Ambitions This joint venture between Animoca Brands , Standard Chartered , and HKT represents a concrete step towards realizing Hong Kong’s vision as a Web3 and virtual asset hub. The development of a robust, locally-pegged stablecoin is often seen as foundational infrastructure for a thriving digital economy. By bringing together expertise from the Web3, traditional finance, and local market sectors, this partnership is well-positioned to contribute significantly to the future of Hong Kong crypto and its integration with the global digital landscape. The announcement is just the beginning, focusing on preparation for the launch. The details regarding the specific blockchain used, the reserve management strategy, and the exact timeline will be crucial to watch as this ambitious project progresses. Nevertheless, it’s a powerful signal of increasing institutional interest and collaboration in building the necessary infrastructure for the next phase of digital asset adoption in Asia.

The Pi Core Team recently shared a 100-day update since the Open Network launch, which gave Pi Coin a slight lift after its recent price struggles. Despite the update, Pi remains down over 12% this week and nearly 29% this month. Most technical indicators show bearish signals. The price is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle, narrowing between $0.54 and $0.74. A breakout above $0.74 with a successful retest could lead to a major rally. Risks Ahead: Token Unlock & Sell Pressure However, risks remain high. Exchange wallet balances are rising, which shows that investors may be preparing for sell-offs. Besides, a large number of tokens are set to hit the market in June and July, which could put more pressure on Pi’s already struggling price. June 28: Make-or-Break Moment With Pi Day approaching on June 28, the community is eagerly waiting for key updates, especially on the GCV, a community-driven idea valuing 1 Pi at $314,159. If the Core Team announces the open mainnet or addresses GCV, it could spark major price action. But if they stay silent, it may trigger mass sell-offs and a loss of trust, with many users losing interest. Will Pi Coin Rise to $10 or Crash to $0.40? Analyst Mr. Spock believes that a few clear updates on or before Pi Day could push Pi into the spotlight and drive it towards the $5–$10 range. Right now, what Pi Network needs most is clear, public confirmation of its massive momentum. Just a few key updates before or on Pi2Day (June 28th, 2025) could light the spark that pushes 𝛑 toward mainstream recognition and that $5–$10 target. One Major Update Could Shift… pic.twitter.com/glRCpJ4ZUv — Mr Spock 𝛑 (@MrSpockApe) June 18, 2025 Analyst Dr. Altcoin warns that without a major update, Pi could fall to $0.40 by August. But as token unlocks slow down by late August, selling pressure may ease, opening the door for a possible recovery. By the end of this week, Pi Coin is expected to trade between $0.60 and $0.74, according to CoinDCX. A clean breakout and retest near $0.74 could spark a strong rally if sentiment improves ahead of Pi2Day. Pi Coin Outlook for Late June If Pi breaks above $0.74, the price could rally to $0.85–$0.90. But if it fails to hold $0.60, it may drop toward $0.52, if there are no major updates or exchange listings before the next token unlock on July 1. Pi Coin is expected to trade between $1.20–$1.80 for most of July, with high volatility in the final week. CoinCodex predicts Pi Coin could drop to $0.37–$0.43 in the near term. In July, the trend may shift slightly positive, with prices hovering around $0.40–$0.43.

The abduction near Paris, which resulted in the loss of a cryptocurrency hardware wallet and a sum of fiat money, was followed by a kidnapping attempt in Normandy, foiled by the French police at the last minute. French couple targeted by violent crypto kidnappers A 23-year-old man has been kidnapped and held captive in the latest of a string of attacks on crypto owners and entrepreneurs in France. The criminals released the victim only after his partner fulfilled their demands for ransom. The assault, which highlights a worrying phenomenon that French authorities have been struggling to deal with, took place in Maisons-Alfort, a commune in the Val-de-Marne department of the Grand Paris metropolitan area. Last Tuesday morning, the young couple left their home to do errands. They split when the man remained in the car to find a parking spot, the Le Parisien daily detailed in a report on Thursday, quoted by the French crypto news outlet Journal du Coin. A few moments later, while still shopping, his girlfriend received a message from her partner explaining he won’t be able to join her due to an unforeseen professional matter. Then she returned home alone, where the true reason for his disappearance became apparent. The woman accepted a video call from her boyfriend’s phone number, but instead of him talking, another man appeared on the screen, stating that her boyfriend would only be released if she followed his orders. Then the criminal told her to put a Ledger wallet in a bag, supposedly holding an undisclosed amount of cryptocurrency, along with €5,000 in cash ($5,750) and wait outside her home. According to a source close to the investigation into the “kidnapping and unlawful confinement by an organized crime,” launched by the Val-de-Marne police, the perpetrators were very well informed about the couple’s finances and routines. The unnamed official also revealed: “Violence was used to make him talk.” Later in the afternoon, an accomplice of the kidnappers came to the house and collected the bag. The abducted man was able to call his girlfriend around 5 p.m. on his way home after he had been released in the neighboring town of Créteil. “This is a sensitive case,” added the source familiar with the kidnapping case, which is not the first one in France lately, but declined to provide more information about the victim or the extorted cryptocurrency. France is plagued by daring crypto kidnappings The report about last week’s incident in the Greater Paris area coincided with the news of another crypto-related kidnapping attempt in Normandy, thwarted only thanks to the timely intervention of law enforcement officers who arrested five suspects before they could fulfil their plan. On June 18, the French radio broadcaster Europe 1 unveiled that a month earlier, a 22-year-old cryptocurrency trader and his 46-year-old mother alerted the French police about a disturbing message indicating they were being followed by the would-be kidnappers. Investigators were able to establish that their home had been placed under surveillance while their car had been tracked with a GPS device by a criminal group that intended to abduct them and force the young man to empty his digital wallet. The two attacks against ordinary French citizens follow a series of similar assaults on prominent crypto figures in the past few months, including the kidnapping of Ledger co-founder David Balland and the failed abduction of the daughter and grandson of crypto exchange Paymium’s CEO. To deal with the crisis, French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau summoned crypto bosses in mid-May to discuss their security, and French lawmaker Paul Midy submitted a bill aimed at improving their privacy. Despite charging 25 people so far and the arrest of an alleged mastermind in Morocco, the French government has yet to explain and put an end to the criminal trend.

On-chain signals and technical indicators alike are pointing to an inflection point for XRP. With speculation rising around XRP ETFs, global partnerships, and Ripple’s growing integration into evolving financial systems, many in the crypto community are curious about how high can XRP go once legal clarity sets in? In this analysis I take you through the potential price targets XRP could hit. Are Whales Stacking XRP? As per Santiment , in June 2025, XRP recorded its highest number of whale transactions over $1 million this year. This spike suggests that institutional players and high-net-worth individuals are positioning for a major price move, which I believe could likely be in anticipation of a favorable legal outcome. Historically, such activity comes before strong rallies or reversals in market trends. The behavior of these large holders indicates strong conviction and serves as a bullish signal that smart money sees long-term upside. Transaction Volume Crosses $8.5 Billion Another notable metric is XRP’s transaction volume in USD, which recently crossed $8.5 billion, its highest level since February. This surge reflects growing utility and interest in the XRP Ledger. Which is potentially tied to cross-border payment use cases and investor repositioning around the SEC lawsuit timeline. It is worth noting that, the high transaction volumes typically accompany rising demand and market activity. And when aligned with whale accumulation, they often validate bullish trends forming behind the scenes. Ripple XRP Price Analysis On the weekly chart, XRP price is consolidating just above $2.17, sitting within a tightening Bollinger Band pattern. Widely known as Bollinger squeeze, this pattern often comes before significant price moves. Successively, the RSI sits at 51, indicating neutral momentum, but with room for upward move. If the bullish momentum continues, XRP price could test a potential high of $3.20, with an average price around $2.50 in the short-to-mid term. On the downside, strong support exists at $1.85, acting as the potential floor barring any unexpected negative news. A breakout above $2.75 could unlock upside targets closer to $4, particularly if backed by legal clarity and ETF tailwinds.

If so, you need to be aware of a growing threat. Experts are sounding the alarm about a disturbing trend: a significant surge in crypto crime , fueled by a perceived lack of effective oversight and enforcement. This isn’t just about isolated incidents; some are calling it a ‘crypto crime supercycle,’ indicating a period of accelerated criminal activity within the digital asset space. Understanding the ‘Crypto Crime Supercycle’ What exactly constitutes this ‘supercycle’ of crypto crime ? According to reports, several factors are converging to create a fertile ground for illicit activities. These include: Promotions of speculative assets like memecoins by public figures, potentially drawing in unsophisticated investors. A general environment of lax enforcement against known bad actors. Instances where regulatory bodies or governments have dropped crypto-related lawsuits, potentially signaling a retreat from pursuing offenders. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT, a prominent voice in the crypto security community, has highlighted how this regulatory void has emboldened malicious actors. He specifically pointed out that the lack of consequences makes it easier for influencers to promote questionable projects or outright scams to their followers. The result? A significant uptick in various forms of digital asset fraud and theft. Why is Effective Crypto Regulation Still a Challenge? The call for robust crypto regulation has been persistent, yet implementing it effectively remains a global challenge. The decentralized and borderless nature of cryptocurrencies makes traditional regulatory frameworks difficult to apply. Different countries are adopting vastly different approaches, creating loopholes that criminals can exploit by simply moving operations. Furthermore, the rapid pace of technological innovation in the crypto space often outstrips the ability of regulators to understand and legislate it effectively. This creates a continuous game of catch-up. The political landscape also plays a role, with debates around whether crypto should be treated as a security, commodity, or currency adding layers of complexity. The recent instances of the U.S. dropping certain crypto-related lawsuits are seen by some as a setback in the fight against illicit activity, potentially sending a signal that enforcement is not a high priority in all cases. This perceived weakness in crypto regulation is a key ingredient fueling the current surge in crime. Identifying Common Crypto Scams and How They Operate The landscape of crypto scams is constantly evolving, but several types are particularly prevalent and contribute significantly to the overall losses reported. Understanding these can help users protect themselves. Here are some common tactics used by scammers: Influencer Scams: Promoted heavily by individuals with large social media followings, these often involve shilling questionable or non-existent tokens, often with promises of guaranteed high returns or exclusive access. Once enough people invest, the promoters and project creators disappear. Phishing Attacks: These involve impersonating legitimate entities (like exchanges, wallets, or projects) through fake websites, emails, or messages to trick users into revealing private keys, seed phrases, or login credentials. A common tactic is a fake security alert or a prize notification. Rug Pulls: A specific type of scam prevalent in decentralized finance (DeFi) and new token launches. Project developers raise funds by selling a token, but then suddenly withdraw all liquidity from decentralized exchanges, causing the token’s price to crash to zero, and disappear with the investors’ funds. Black Hat Hacking: Direct attacks on exchanges, protocols, or individual wallets to steal funds. This can involve exploiting vulnerabilities in smart contracts, software, or even social engineering tactics to gain access. Fake Exchanges/Wallets: Malicious apps or websites designed to look like legitimate crypto platforms. Users who deposit funds or enter private information into these platforms lose their assets. Romance Scams: Scammers build relationships online, often over months, before eventually steering the conversation towards investing in a fake crypto platform they control, leading to significant financial loss for the victim. These crypto scams thrive because transactions are often irreversible, and the pseudonymous nature of blockchain can make tracing funds and identifying perpetrators difficult without specialized tools and international cooperation. Protecting Yourself: Essential Blockchain Security Measures While regulatory efforts catch up, individuals must take proactive steps to safeguard their digital assets. Implementing strong blockchain security practices is the first line of defense against many common threats. Consider the following essential measures: Use Hardware Wallets: For storing significant amounts of cryptocurrency, hardware wallets (like Ledger or Trezor) offer the highest level of security by keeping your private keys offline. Secure Your Seed Phrase: Your seed phrase is the master key to your crypto. Never share it with anyone, never store it digitally (on your computer, phone, or cloud), and ideally, store a physical copy in a secure location. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Use 2FA on all exchanges and wallets whenever possible. Authenticator apps (like Google Authenticator or Authy) are generally more secure than SMS-based 2FA. Be Wary of Unsolicited Offers: High-return investment schemes, free crypto giveaways, or urgent security alerts received unexpectedly are almost always scams. Verify Addresses Carefully: Always double-check the recipient’s wallet address before sending crypto. A single wrong character can result in irreversible loss. Research Projects Thoroughly: Before investing in any new token or project, do your own research (DYOR). Look for red flags like anonymous teams, vague whitepapers, or unrealistic promises. Use Reputable Platforms: Stick to well-established and audited exchanges and decentralized protocols. Educate Yourself: Stay informed about the latest scam techniques and security best practices. Knowledge is a powerful tool in blockchain security . The Financial Toll: Tracking Crypto Losses The consequences of this surge in illicit activity are significant, primarily measured in substantial crypto losses for individuals and institutions. Reports indicate that over $2 billion was lost to crypto crime in the first quarter of the year alone. This staggering figure highlights the scale of the problem and the urgent need for action. Taylor Monahan, a lead security researcher at crypto wallet provider MetaMask, emphasized the low risk profile for scammers. She noted that fraudsters face minimal legal, financial, or social consequences for their actions, making crypto fraud a highly attractive and profitable endeavor. This low-risk, high-reward dynamic is a major driver behind the increasing volume of crypto losses . Monahan also drew a connection between crypto and other forms of cybercrime, stating that if crypto were to disappear, ransomware groups would be among the hardest hit. This underscores the utility of cryptocurrencies for criminals seeking to extort payments while attempting to maintain anonymity. Beyond the direct financial impact, these losses erode trust in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. This can hinder mainstream adoption and attract negative attention from regulators, potentially leading to more restrictive measures that impact legitimate users and businesses. Conclusion: Navigating the Storm The warning signs are clear: the current environment, characterized by insufficient oversight and enforcement, is allowing crypto crime to flourish. The rise of sophisticated crypto scams , from influencer-backed rug pulls to cunning phishing attacks, is resulting in billions in crypto losses annually. While the path to effective crypto regulation is complex and ongoing, individuals cannot afford to wait. Strengthening personal blockchain security practices is paramount. By staying informed, being vigilant, and adopting robust security measures, users can significantly reduce their risk and help navigate the challenges posed by this dangerous supercycle of digital asset crime.

Blockchains are often praised for transparency, but centralized exchanges have largely remained a black box. On Friday, June 20, Binance announced a set of new features aimed at changing that by bringing greater transparency to its platform. #BinanceBuild presents the new Concentration Indicator! See how concentrated a token’s market is with a simple score, higher means fewer users hold more supply on Binance. 🔸 Score from 0 to 100 🔸 Powered by real Spot & Margin holdings 🔸 Understand token distribution… pic.twitter.com/WOLzNfsfgv — Binance (@binance) June 20, 2025 One update will allow users to view how many of a project’s tokens are locked, offering insights into vesting schedules. This helps verify that project teams can’t immediately dump their holdings. Another key addition is a token concentration indicator. It will show how much of a token’s supply is controlled by the team, including those held on Binance itself, which were previously hidden from public view.

Binance hopes to set a new standard in transparency Yi He, co-founder of Binance, said the changes were made in response to user feedback. The company hopes the new features will set a benchmark for transparency among centralized exchanges and encourage broader industry adoption. “We are committed to our users and continuously work to set the bar for furthering transparency in the market for them. Our Locked Addresses and Concentration Indicator features are examples of that and our response to our community’s demand for more transparency and better tools to understand the tokens they’re trading. Through token transparency and user education, our goal is to also further market integrity and help the industry grow in a more sustainable way.” He said. Token concentration and lockup data are critical to evaluating a project’s tokenomics. High concentration increases the risk of sell-offs or rug pulls, while locked tokens help align team incentives with long-term development.

On Friday, the Thailand Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a public consultation to gather opinions on whether local crypto exchanges should be allowed to list self-issued utility tokens. Public feedback will be open until July 21, 2025. This move could reshape Thailand’s crypto landscape, especially for platforms looking to expand their digital asset offerings. SEC’s Focus: Innovation and Investor Protection The SEC is revising the criteria for listing digital assets on local exchanges. According to the official statement: “The SEC Board, at its June 2025 meeting, resolved to revise the criteria for selecting digital assets to be provided on the exchange to be in line with the context of the digital asset industry.” Key points of the proposal include: Allowing crypto exchanges to list their own utility tokens Strengthening investor protection with stricter disclosure requirements Exchanges will be required to disclose individuals involved in each crypto project and activate alerts in SEC monitoring systems to help prevent insider trading. Existing tokens must also disclose the names of all related parties within 90 days of the regulation taking effect. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Putin and Xi Propose New BRICS Investment Platform to Boost Global South , Thailand Is Positioning Itself as a Global Crypto Hub Thailand’s latest crypto initiatives are helping it emerge as a leading destination for blockchain innovation.

Lucie, the pseudonymous marketing lead for the popular meme coin, has issued a clear warning: scams are rising fast, especially on X, and investors need to be cautious. With prices swinging wildly and emotions running high, her message is a timely reminder for the SHIB community and the broader crypto space to protect their funds. Scam Tokens Are On the Rise – Don’t Fall for Quick Gains In a recent post on X, Lucie pointed to a growing number of scam tokens being launched by bad actors looking to take advantage of market uncertainty. These low-quality tokens often promise quick returns- but are designed to steal from investors. In these brutal market conditions, the only ones enjoying it are the malicious actors and clout chasers — milking lies just to monetize their platforms.

Lucie urged investors to double-check websites, avoid making emotional decisions, and do proper research before putting money into any project.

She called it a “paradise for chaos,” where deceptive projects thrive and investors are easily misled. To counter this, she said the SHIB ecosystem remains focused on user safety and is working to protect its community from these rising threats. Her message was not just for SHIB holders but for anyone navigating the crypto world on social platforms. Shiba Inu Holds Strong Amid Rising Threats Even with growing scam threats and a weak market, Shiba Inu continues to hold steady. SHIB remains the 19th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, outperforming rivals like Litecoin, even as its own price action remains muted. In a related warning, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao also sounded the alarm about deepfake scams powered by AI. He noted that fraudsters are now using advanced technology to trick investors with fake videos and manipulated content.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As memecoin mania heats up ahead of the next crypto rally, low-cap tokens like Neo Pepe, Volt Inu, and KiboShib are quietly positioning for breakout growth under $2b valuations. Table of Contents Hidden gems on verge of explosive growth Why investors are pouring into low-cap memecoins in 2025 Neo Pepe’s strategic design for major market upside Three memecoins set for multi-billion-dollar valuations Is this leading memecoin contender ready to breakout? Neo Pepe: Beyond meme status Conclusion As the crypto market braces for its next major rally, savvy investors are meticulously scanning for undervalued memecoins poised for astronomical growth. While mainstream tokens like Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) dominate headlines and capture widespread attention, a fresh wave of memecoins, with market caps comfortably below $2 billion, are quietly and effectively building strong communities, pioneering innovative features, and strategically positioning themselves for significant long-term gains. Hidden gems on verge of explosive growth Among these rising stars for possible best memecoin, Neo Pepe Coin (NEOP) has quickly emerged as a standout project. Its presale is rapidly gaining impressive momentum, with over $1.3 million already raised, reflecting intense investor enthusiasm. Currently priced attractively at $0.08 per token in Stage 4, Neo Pepe offers investors an enticing entry point. Built on the widely-used Ethereum blockchain, NEOP ensures seamless compatibility with major decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and wallets. Neo Pepe upholds fully decentralized ownership with absolutely no developer-controlled wallets. Volt Inu continues to capture investor attention through aggressive cross-chain exposure and highly effective deflationary tokenomics. Meanwhile, KiboShib is tapping effectively into the thriving Asian meme crypto community by launching engaging gamified decentralized applications (dApps). Why investors are pouring into low-cap memecoins in 2025 As the crypto market continues to mature and evolve, high-risk capital increasingly gravitates towards low-cap meme coins offering exceptional growth potential. Investors are particularly drawn to the accessible price points, dynamic and enthusiastic communities, and potential for viral momentum. Meme tokens with market values under $2 billion are uniquely positioned, providing ample liquidity while simultaneously offering significant upside potential. Community-driven narratives and viral marketing campaigns fuel excitement, creating a potent environment where speculative capital thrives, especially in meme assets that deliver genuine innovation, tangible utility, and compelling cultural narratives. Neo Pepe’s strategic design for major market upside Neo Pepe is deliberately structured to fully capitalize on broad market bullish conditions. Utilizing Ethereum’s extensively adopted ERC-20 standard, Neo Pepe guarantees widespread interoperability with leading DeFi platforms, exchanges, and wallets. Unlike meme tokens relying solely on short-lived hype, Neo Pepe ensures robust decentralized ownership by distributing its entire token supply exclusively via a structured presale and community-led governance model. Neo Pepe’s total supply is strictly capped at 1 billion tokens. Additionally, its transparent, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)-managed governance includes mandatory timelocks on all significant protocol decisions. This foundational sustainability places Neo Pepe ideally to benefit significantly from bullish market trends in the altcoin ecosystem. Three memecoins set for multi-billion-dollar valuations These meme tokens, each positioned under a $2 billion market cap, offer substantial upside potential: Neo Pepe (NEOP) : Distinguished by its innovative real-time gamified presale, structured DAO governance featuring transparent and secure voting, and genuinely decentralized ownership. Volt Inu : Notable for its aggressive deflationary measures and strategic cross-chain exposure, ensuring sustained value appreciation and wide adoption. KiboShib : Successfully targeting the expansive Asian market through engaging, gamified decentralized applications, bolstering community activity and engagement.

Neo Pepe seems to transcend the typical memecoin paradigm, it embodies a profound, community-driven movement supported by robust technical infrastructure. Governance is securely implemented via the NEOPGovernor smart contract. Major decisions undergo mandatory timelocked execution periods. This differentiation is one consideration for how Neo Pepe Coin could be considered one of the leading crypto presales to emerge of late. This meticulous design, coupled with the absence of any developer-controlled wallets, makes Neo Pepe exceedingly attractive to sophisticated investors seeking both considerable upside potential and stringent protocol security. As memecoin investors increasingly prioritize structural integrity, transparency, and meaningful governance over transient hype, Neo Pepe unmistakably emerges as an exemplar of credibility, potential, and innovation in the crypto landscape. Neo Pepe: Beyond meme status Rejecting the usual scripted crypto cheerleading, Bull Run Angel recently delivered a refreshingly sharp critique of Neo Pepe, unpacking what truly sets this project apart. In their latest analysis, Angel praises Neo Pepe’s meticulously planned presale as more than mere marketing, it’s a thoughtful blueprint designed to build genuine community momentum and sustainable growth. Even more impressive to Angel is Neo Pepe’s built-in auto-liquidity mechanism, which they emphasize isn’t a superficial gimmick but a tangible safeguard for investors. While fully aware of the memecoin sector’s volatility, Bull Run Angel carefully highlights how Neo Pepe’s decentralized governance via DAO elevates it beyond fleeting hype. Conclusion The ongoing Neo Pepe Presale, currently in Stage 4, has already raised over $1.3 million at an accessible token price of $0.08.

Internationally, South Korea is weighing a won-based stablecoin amid a push for crypto-friendly reforms under President Lee Jae-myung. Arizona Revives Bitcoin Reserve Bill Arizona’s efforts to incorporate Bitcoin and digital assets into state policy recently picked up momentum again, with House Bill 2324 now back in play after a Senate vote to reconsider the legislation. It was initially defeated in the Arizona House on May 7, but the bill is now slated for another vote after the Senate passed a motion 16-14 to bring it back for review. The motion was filed by Republican Senator Janae Shamp, one of the lawmakers who previously opposed the bill. This is a procedural requirement for reconsideration. The bill seeks to establish a “Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund” for managing criminally forfeited digital assets and sets out specific allocations : the first $300,000 of assets would go to the Attorney General’s office, and any amount exceeding that would be split 50% to the Attorney General, 25% to the state’s general fund, and 25% to the new reserve fund. Sponsored by Republican Senator Jeff Weninger, the bill will also expand the state’s asset forfeiture laws to explicitly include digital assets. It outlines scenarios under which Arizona could seize digital assets, like cases involving deceased or deported individuals, fugitives, or where ownership cannot be verified despite due diligence. The legislation now requires a majority vote in the 60-member Arizona House to move forward to Governor Katie Hobbs for final approval. This latest development follows a mixed approach from the governor on cryptocurrency legislation. On May 7, Hobbs signed HB 2749 into law , which allows the state to retain unclaimed digital assets and establish a reserve fund, all without using taxpayer money. Under this law, Arizona’s custodians can stake crypto holdings to earn rewards or receive airdrops, which will contribute additional resources to the fund. Hobbs’ explanation for veto (Source: State of Arizona Office of the Governor ) However, Hobbs was more cautious in other areas. She vetoed Senate Bill 1025, which proposed allowing the state treasurer to invest up to 10% of state holdings in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, due to concerns over exposing retirement and general fund assets to volatile digital investments. Hobbs also rejected SB 1373, which proposed a Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Fund, also because of concerns about crypto volatility. Overall, Arizona’s path forward is still cautious and politically divided. Ohio House Passes Pro-Crypto Bill Ohio also recently took a major step toward becoming one of the most crypto-friendly states in the US after its House of Representatives passed the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act (House Bill 116) in a 68-26 vote . The legislation received unanimous bipartisan support in the House’s Technology and Innovation Committee earlier the same day, and now heads to the Senate. The bill was championed by Republican Representative Steve Demetriou, and its main goal is to simplify the use of cryptocurrencies for everyday payments and protect crypto mining operations from excessive government intervention. One of the bill’s core provisions is a tax exemption for cryptocurrency transactions under $200. This threshold will adjust annually based on inflation, indexed to the Consumer Price Index and rounded up to the nearest $5. The state’s tax commissioner will be barred from decreasing the limit in subsequent years. The bill also prohibits state agencies from creating rules that restrict residents from accepting cryptocurrency as payment. To try and support digital asset infrastructure, the legislation includes clear protections for crypto miners. It allows individuals to mine cryptocurrency in residential zones, provided they comply with local regulations, and enables mining businesses to operate freely in areas zoned for industrial use. The bill also prevents the state from singling out crypto mining operations with laws that don’t apply to comparable industries. If local governments attempt to rezone land in ways that could harm crypto businesses, affected operators will have legal recourse to challenge the decisions in court. The Ohio Blockchain Basics Act also tackles regulatory clarity around several key blockchain functions. It specifies that people and businesses do not need a money transmitter license to engage in mining, staking, operating blockchain nodes, swapping one cryptocurrency for another, or developing decentralized applications. It further asserts that crypto mining and staking services should not be considered securities or investment contracts. This is a key distinction that challenges the regulatory stance that was taken by federal agencies under the Biden administration. Finally, the bill gives Ohioans the right to self-custody their digital assets through hardware or self-hosted wallets without interference from the government. Looking ahead, Ohio lawmakers are also considering separate legislation to establish a state-level Bitcoin reserve fund. States considering crypto legislation (Source: Bitcoin Laws ) With over 160 crypto-related bills introduced across 40 US states this year, Ohio’s proactive approach puts it at the forefront of state-led efforts to embrace blockchain innovation. Korea Weighs Won-Based Stablecoin Progress is also being made in other parts of the world. South Korea may be open to the idea of launching a won-based stablecoin, but the country’s central bank is still cautious due to concerns over foreign exchange management. At a press conference, Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong acknowledged that issuing a stablecoin pegged to the Korean won could potentially make it easier for users to swap it for US dollar-backed stablecoins. This, he warned, could inadvertently boost demand for dollar stablecoins and complicate the central bank’s efforts to manage foreign exchange markets. Rhee’s remarks come as South Korea's foreign currency reserves continue to shrink, dropping from $415.6 billion at the end of December to $404.6 billion by the end of May. Meanwhile, the newly elected administration under President Lee Jae-myung is pushing forward with a pro-crypto regulatory framework. On June 10, the ruling Democratic Party introduced the Digital Asset Basic Act , a bill that is designed to legalize stablecoin issuance for companies with at least $368,000 in equity capital. Under the proposal, issuers must maintain adequate reserves and get approval from the Financial Services Commission, South Korea’s primary financial regulator. The Financial Services Commission is also conducting an investigation into local crypto exchanges, focusing on the transaction fees they charge users. This initiative is part of President Lee’s broader campaign promise to reduce trading costs and make crypto more accessible, particularly for younger investors. (Source: Cointelegraph) Globally, stablecoins are dominated by US dollar-backed assets like Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USDC, with market caps of $156 billion and $61 billion respectively. However, the momentum behind non-dollar stablecoins is beginning to grow. Circle’s euro-pegged EURC, for example, saw its market cap surge to $203 million this year, which is a 156% increase since January. This growth coincides with optimism in the stablecoin sector, especially after US lawmakers indicated they would advance the GENIUS Act.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-20 13:18:45

The financial landscape in Thailand is potentially set for a significant shift concerning digital assets. The Thailand Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has initiated a crucial public consultation process aimed at overhauling the existing crypto listing rules for local digital asset exchanges. This move signals Thailand’s ongoing efforts to refine its approach to crypto regulation Thailand , adapting to the dynamic nature of the digital asset space. Why is Thailand SEC Crypto Regulation Under Review? For some time, the rules governing which cryptocurrencies and digital tokens can be traded on regulated platforms in Thailand have been subject to specific criteria. These rules are designed to protect investors and maintain market integrity. However, as the market evolves, regulatory frameworks often need updates to remain relevant and effective. The SEC’s current consultation suggests they see areas for improvement, particularly concerning the types of tokens that can be listed and who can list them. The core of the proposed revisions, as reported by The Block, centers around a notable change: potentially allowing digital asset exchanges to list utility tokens that are issued by the exchanges themselves or their affiliated entities. This specific proposal is a significant departure from previous limitations and has sparked considerable discussion within the Thai crypto community and among international observers. Exploring the Proposed Crypto Listing Rules Changes Let’s break down the key element of the proposed changes being considered by the Thailand SEC crypto regulators: Current State (Implied): Generally, there have been restrictions or complexities preventing exchanges from easily listing tokens they or their related companies issue, likely to avoid conflicts of interest. Proposed Change: Explicitly permit digital asset exchanges regulated in Thailand to list utility tokens that have been issued by the exchange itself or any entity considered an affiliate of the exchange. Mechanism: The SEC is seeking public feedback through a consultation process before finalizing any new regulations. This allows stakeholders – exchanges, investors, developers, and the public – to voice their opinions and concerns. This particular revision focuses specifically on ‘utility tokens,’ which are typically defined by their use case within a specific ecosystem or platform, as opposed to security tokens which represent ownership or investment in an asset. What Does This Mean for Thai Crypto Exchanges and Utility Tokens? If these revised crypto listing rules are implemented, the implications for Thai crypto exchanges and the broader market could be substantial. Here are some potential effects: Increased Innovation: Exchanges could potentially launch their own platform tokens (often utility tokens offering trading fee discounts, governance rights, or other benefits) and list them directly, fostering ecosystem development. Enhanced Liquidity: Listing exchange-issued tokens on their own platform could provide immediate liquidity for these tokens, making them more accessible to users. New Business Models: This could open up new revenue streams and engagement models for exchanges, potentially allowing them to compete more effectively globally. Growth of Utility Token Ecosystems: It might encourage the development and adoption of utility tokens within Thailand’s digital asset landscape. However, it’s crucial to consider the potential downsides and challenges associated with this change under the evolving crypto regulation Thailand . Potential Challenges and Concerns While the proposed rule change could spur innovation, it also raises important questions and potential concerns that the public consultation will likely address: Conflict of Interest: An exchange listing its own token could prioritize it over others, potentially influencing trading volume and price in a way that benefits the exchange rather than market fairness. Market Manipulation Risks: Concerns about wash trading or other manipulative practices designed to artificially inflate the trading volume or price of an exchange’s own token. Investor Protection: Ensuring that investors understand the risks associated with trading tokens issued by the platform they are using, and that adequate safeguards are in place. Regulatory Oversight: The SEC would need robust mechanisms to monitor trading activities involving exchange-issued tokens to prevent abuse. Addressing these concerns through clear guidelines, stringent oversight, and transparency will be vital if the rule change proceeds. The Importance of Public Consultation in Crypto Regulation Thailand The fact that the Thailand SEC crypto body is conducting a public consultation is a positive sign. It indicates a willingness to gather feedback from various stakeholders before making a final decision on the crypto listing rules . This process allows the SEC to: Understand the potential impacts from different perspectives (exchanges, investors, experts). Identify unforeseen issues or risks associated with the proposed changes. Gather data and arguments that can help refine the final regulations. Foster transparency and build trust within the digital asset community. Stakeholders interested in the future of Thai crypto exchanges and the broader crypto regulation Thailand landscape should actively participate in this consultation process to ensure their voices are heard. Looking Ahead: What’s Next? The public consultation period will have a defined timeframe during which submissions are accepted. Once the consultation concludes, the SEC will review the feedback received. Based on this input, they will decide whether to proceed with the proposed revisions to the crypto listing rules , modify them, or potentially withdraw the proposal. Any finalized changes would then be officially published and implemented. This development is a key indicator of how regulators globally are grappling with the nuances of digital assets, particularly the role of platforms that list and trade these assets. The outcome of this consultation in Thailand could set a precedent or provide insights for other jurisdictions considering similar rule adjustments. Conclusion: A Step Towards Evolving Crypto Regulation Thailand Thailand’s SEC is taking a proactive step by reviewing its crypto listing rules . The proposal to allow Thai crypto exchanges to list their own utility tokens is a significant point of discussion. While it holds the potential to foster innovation and growth within the local digital asset market, it also necessitates careful consideration of potential conflicts of interest and investor protection measures. The ongoing public consultation is a critical phase, allowing for a balanced discussion on how best to shape the future of crypto regulation Thailand to support a healthy, secure, and innovative ecosystem.

According to market analyst Crypto King, “Avalanche has seen a sharp rise in on-chain activity, with the 7-day moving average of transactions surpassing 1 million — its highest level in over a year.” By reaching a 1-year high in terms of transactions, Avalanche’s significant recovery and growth in network usage cannot go unnoticed. This development suggests that the AVAX network is continuously maturing. One of its unique features is the Avalanche Consensus, which enables scalability without sacrificing security or decentralization. Furthermore, this network enables developers to build custom blockchains called subnets based on their governance models, tokens, and rules. Avalanche also supports Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which allows developers to easily port over Ethereum-based smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Is Avalanche Forming a Bullish Reversal Pattern? According to market insights provider Pinnacle Charts, “AVAX is bouncing from a strong support zone, forming a potential falling wedge — a bullish reversal pattern. The price is near the 0.786–0.618 Fib zone (golden pocket) and appears oversold, with signs of an early breakout. Targets are around $20.20 – $21.17 if momentum builds.” Source: Pinnacle Charts At the time of this writing, AVAX was hovering around the $18.00 zone with the 17th-largest cryptocurrency showing renewed spirits for a bullish run to the psychological price of $20. Meanwhile, Avalanche’s adoption continues to tick, given that FIFA is tapping into its network since the world’s football governing body intends to build its blockchain, which will aid in creating new products for its vast user base.",Cryptocurrency|News|Avalanche|AVAX,EN,0,0,AVAX|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-20 13:22:07

Instead, youth are turning more towards digital assets as a money escape from economic stagnation. Talking at German Blockchain & AI Week, Anzaetek’s CPO Eli Ilha Yune, said South Korean crypto traders aren’t motivated by a desire for Web3. “The motive isn’t coming from believing in Web3 like in the West,” he asserted . “But desperation.” Over 16 Million Crypto Users—and Growing More than 16 million South Koreans, or more than 30% of the population, were exchanging on cryptocurrency exchanges by late March, a figure increased in part by Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential election victory. But this bubble disguises a deeper economic reality, particularly for those under the age of 30. 2025 Korea Wealth Report shows that younger richer South Koreans have three times as much crypto as their elders. However, Yune claims this is not a result of belief in blockchain potential. A Lost Generation South Korea’s youth unemployment rate was 6.6% in May—almost twice the nation’s 2.7% average. GDP per capita in 2021 was at its high point, and good-paying job prospects have become increasingly and more, more constricted. Yune argued that South Korean youths are members of the generation who came of age in a high-growth economy that has slowed down significantly. “They don’t get much returns on the stock market,” he said, and real estate is even more out of their reach. In Seoul, the price of apartments on average has increased more than twice in half a decade to over 1 billion won ($689,000). The price-to-income ratio in the capital stands at 15.2, rendering home ownership a fantasy for most. “They cannot afford houses anymore,” Yune said. “Even renting is out of their reach. So their only option is to do crypto.” Government Moves Toward Crypto Integration President Lee Jae-myung’s administration is pushing for greater institutional integration of crypto into South Korea’s economy, including potential issuance of a national stablecoin. The central bank also said that it was willing to have a Korean won-backed digital currency. Despite government support, Yune said that a majority of young traders were not even knowledgeable about crypto. “They’re not really interested in crypto,” he said. “They’re seeking easy money.”.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-06-20 13:26:14

A CHF-USD carry trade is unattractive due to the CHF’s long-term appreciation against the USD, which lost 81% of its value vs. CHF since the 1970s. Borrowing CHF to buy BTC assumes Bitcoin’s continued appreciation and low SNB rates, with BTC historically showing a ~50% CAGR in USD terms from 2015-2025. Bitcoin’s speculative nature remains a key risk, only (maybe) suitable for CHF-exposed Bitcoin bulls; those without CHF exposure or bearish on Bitcoin should avoid it. The Swiss National Bank [SNB] just cut its interest rates to 0%. This is the first major bank in a developed country to revert to a Zero Interest Rate Policy [ZIRP] since 2021, with rates that are now lower than even those in Japan , at 0.50%. In this article, I will present the somewhat provocative case for a “Carry Trade” consisting of borrowing cheaply in Swiss Francs ( CHF:USD ) to buy Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). As I will outline in my risk and disclaimer sections, this is a trade that could make sense primarily for people that gain in Swiss Francs, either in the form of a wage, a pension or assets generating CHF (for example, Swiss real estate or Swiss corporate bonds). Obviously (but importantly), it is also a trade that only makes sense as long as whoever decides to carry it believes in the long-term potential and appreciation of Bitcoin. Why A CHF - USD Carry Trade Would Be A Bad Idea While this article concerns Bitcoin, I think it’s important to spend a few words explaining why I wouldn’t enter a carry trade between the CHF and the USD. On paper, this more “traditional” trade could make more sense (and be safer) t han a carry trade with a cryptocurrency . It could even resemble the carry trades involving the Japanese Yen ( USD:JPY ) that took place in the last decade (and are still going). Those profited from a very expansive BoJ monetary policy, driven by the Japanese demographic collapse and stagnant productivity. Traders could safely bet that the BoJ had to keep interest rates low to support its economy, while the healthy state of the US economy warranted permanently higher rates. However, anyone familiar with currency fluctuations in the slightest will know this parallel wouldn’t work with the Swiss Franc. The CHF is undergoing a secular appreciation trend against the USD , as shown by the chart below. CHF - USD Long term FX Rate (Wikimedia Commons) In the 1970s, 1 American dollar could buy more than 4 Swiss Francs. Today, the US dollar is weaker than the Swiss Franc, with 1 USD buying only about 0.82 CHF at the time of writing this article. In other terms, the USD lost approximately 81% of its value against the Swiss Franc in roughly half a century. The reasons behind this dynamic are many, and go beyond the scope of this article. In short, it has to do with the Swiss Franc being considered a global “safe haven” asset, behind the resilience of the Swiss economy and its fiscal rigor (note that, paradoxically, one of the reasons behind the recent SNB cuts is exactly the excessive appreciation of the CHF, which puts a strain on the Swiss economy). What matters for the sake of this exercise, is that the 4% - 5% “risk-free” yields that investors could get from US debt in USD are hardly enough to justify a carry trade with a currency that lost 10% against the other in 2025 YTD alone. The Assumptions Behind A CHF - Bitcoin Carry Trade A traditional carry trade would see borrowing in a currency with a low-interest rate and invest in a currency or asset offering a higher interest rate, aiming to profit from the differential. The main difference between a traditional carry trade between two fiat currencies and one involving Bitcoin is that Bitcoin does not produce any yield . As a cryptocurrency that is not subject to the monetary policy of any central authority, there is no “cost of money” in Bitcoin terms. There is also no concept of “risk-free” Bitcoin yield. The financial products that today provide a yield on Bitcoin do so artificially, and are from being risk-free (in the traditional definition, i.e. debt issued by entities that can issue the same currency the debt is denominated in). Examples of products that generate a BTC Yield are MicroStrategy Incorporated's ( MSTR ) new preferred stocks or the YieldMax Bitcoin Option Income Strategy ETF ( YBIT ). For this reason, borrowing in CHF to buy BTC rests on two simple, yet substantial, assumptions: Bitcoin will permanently appreciate in CHF terms. The SNB will maintain rates that will always be significantly lower than the CAGR of Bitcoin in CHF terms. Bitcoin has historically appreciated in USD terms at a CAGR of ~ 50% between 2015 and 2025. Note that I am choosing a 10-year timeframe since the first 5 years of life for Bitcoin skew results as the cryptocurrency rapidly grew from being worth close to nothing to a multi-billion dollar asset. Even with the USD depreciating against the CHF, Bitcoin has performed well also in CHF terms, with a CAGR just slightly below that of the USD, at ~45%, according to my own calculations (sadly I could not find third-party research on the CAGR of BTC between 2015 and 2025). Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future results. That’s why in the next section I won’t be taking a ~50% CAGR as the base for my exercise. How A CHF - BTC Carry Trade Could Look Like The fact the Swiss National Bank has cut rates to 0% does not necessarily mean investors can easily borrow Swiss Francs at a 0% interest. Of course, the exact rates will depend on the person or legal entity asking, the time frame and the bank(s) involved. Being based in Switzerland, I know personal loans for retail customers in the country still go for north of 4% yearly, and even interest rates for home mortgages currently range from 0.8% to 1.3% yearly - significantly above the 0% reference rate. The reference rate I will use for this exercise is that of Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. ( IBKR ), my broker of choice. For an account funded with CHF 1 Million, IBKR currently charges just above 1% of yearly interest (see image below). I find Interactive Brokers offers very competitive rates on margin loans, even if of course high net worth individuals may very well manage to get a loan in CHF for 0.5% yearly interest or less. IBKR.com With that in mind, the question becomes what is the difference between this ~1% rate and the return investors can expect from Bitcoin? To establish that, one could refer to CAGR figures from Michael Saylor - which estimates Bitcoin will see average yearly returns of 29% for the next 20 years. Other research suggests a 22.5% CAGR until 2030. The truth, I think, is that the exact differential does not matter. First, because for this trade to work one has to believe in Bitcoin maturing as a global reserve asset and appreciating for the foreseeable future. Second, because if we grant that first assumption as true, the differential would be enormous no matter the exact figures . It would be the best carry trade ever conceived: borrowing at the cheapest rate in fiat currency terms to purchase the global reserve asset. And here lies my “provocation” for this article: Bitcoin believers do not need to be told that borrowing in fiat to buy Bitcoin makes sense. What is more interesting, I believe, is how bad a traditional carry trade with another fiat currency (the USD) looks like against a carry trade with Bitcoin. The (many) limits Of A CHF - BTC Carry Trade Idea A fair counterargument to my CHF - BTC carry trade idea is that investors could probably benefit almost equally from borrowing in USD as in CHF. While rates are significantly higher in USD, in a scenario where Bitcoin matures into a global reserve asset, that difference may be somewhat negligible. In a context where Bitcoin were to grow at a 20% to 30% CAGR for the next 5 to 10 years, paying 1% of 5% for a loan would not represent a massive difference in returns, especially when accounting for a likely higher CAGR in USD terms (BTC is also far more liquid and traded in USD than in CHF). Another important risk to this carry trade idea is the fact that anyone performing such a trade without being exposed to the CHF in any way would be indirectly exposed to a carry trade between the CHF and their currency of reference. For example, someone earning in USD and taking a loan in CHF would need to repay their loan in an ever-appreciating currency against their base currency. Curiously, this is exactly what happened to Polish and Greek citizens that decided to open loans denominated in CHF in the early 2000s, as this became possible thanks to new EU regulations and Pan-European treaties. Of course, as long as Bitcoin appreciates in CHF terms, this theoretically would not matter. But it compounds the risk involved. This implied carry trade within the carry trade is the reason why I would discourage anyone not exposed to the CHF to ever consider the idea of borrowing in CHF to buy Bitcoin. Investors that are either earning a wage, a pension or receive a yield from rent or Swiss bonds would be better covered, as they could always cover their loan with CHF. In other terms, this trade makes sense for investors whose base currency is the Swiss Franc, or those that have significant exposure to the Swiss Franc. However, the main risk of my thesis of course concerns a bearish case for Bitcoin. Bitcoin remains a highly speculative bet at the time of writing, in my view. While I am personally very bullish on it - having covered it multiple times on Seeking Alpha - I recognize that Bitcoin still has a long way to mature as a global reserve asset. In a scenario where BTC never gets there, this carry trade idea would make no sense and result in significant losses. Regardless of the fact that historically BTC has always massively appreciated against all fiat currencies, CHF included. Conclusion In writing this article, the thing that most surprised me is not “how good” a BTC - USD carry trade may (or may not) be, but rather how it still makes incredibly more sense than a carry trade with the USD. Even readers who are not bullish on Bitcoin should realize this says a lot about the current state of the US economy and the trust in the USD when a carry trade with a cryptocurrency that did not exist 18 years ago makes much more mathematically sense than trading in USD. Ultimately, I am not really recommending anyone to take a “cheap” loan in CHF to buy BTC. Bitcoin bulls do not need to be told that selling fiat for BTC makes sense.

By 2028, ADA/USD could decline and reach $3.11. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $9.86 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.6005 Market Cap $21.23 Billion Trading Volume (24-hour) $456.4Million Circulating Supply 35.35 Billion ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.6059 24-hour Low $0.5886 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 7.84% 50-day SMA $ 0.718958 14-Day RSI 34.51 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 61 (Greed) Green Days 13/30 (40%) Cardano ADA recovers slightly ADA price analysis 1-day chart ADA/USD 1-Day Chart Based on the 1-day chart on June 20, Cardano (ADA) is currently exhibiting bearish momentum. The price is trading below the mid-Bollinger Band ($0.6536) and nearing the lower band at $0.5829, suggesting continued downward pressure. RSI is at 33.26, approaching oversold territory, indicating weakening buyer interest. If ADA breaks below the $0.5829 support level, further decline toward the $0.55 or even $0.50 zone is possible. A short-term recovery would require a bounce above $0.6536 with increased volume and RSI climbing above 40. Overall, the trend remains bearish unless key resistance levels are reclaimed and market sentiment shows signs of reversal. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart ADA/USD 4-hour Chart Based on the 4-hour chart, Cardano (ADA)maintais a bearish posture. The price is trading below the mid-Bollinger Band at $0.6058 and approaching the lower band support around $0.5851, signaling continued downward pressure. The MACD remains in negative territory, with a weak histogram and no sign of a bullish crossover. Additionally, the Balance of Power indicator stands at -0.37, reflecting dominant selling activity. If ADA breaks below the $0.5850 level, further decline toward $0.56 or lower may follow. To reverse this trend, ADA must reclaim the mid-band and show momentum via MACD recovery and volume confirmation.

On the daily chart, ADA is trading below the mid-Bollinger Band ($0.6536) and nearing the lower band at $0.5829, with RSI at 33.26 indicating near-oversold conditions. The 4-hour chart aligns with this sentiment, showing price beneath the mid-band ($0.6058) and pressing against lower support around $0.5851. MACD remains negative and Balance of Power at -0.37 confirms selling dominance. If ADA breaks below $0.5829, further downside toward $0.55 is likely. A reversal would require reclaiming the mid-bands with improving volume and bullish indicator shifts. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. What will Cardano be worth in 2025? ADA might reach a maximum price of $0.9665, with an average trading price of about $0.8824 and a minimum price of $0.8475. What will Cardano be worth in 2030? In 2030, ADA’s average forecast price could be $5.82. Its minimum and maximum trading price is expected to be $5.63 and $6.75, respectively. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more, if the cryptocurrency market continues to expand and Cardano establishes itself as a leader in blockchain technology. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. In a bullish scenario, ADA could reach $50 to $100 or even higher if it becomes a dominant blockchain platform with real-world utility in finance, governance, and enterprise solutions. However, in a bearish scenario where adoption stagnates or regulations hinder growth, ADA could remain below $10. The price will depend on mass adoption, technological advancements, global regulations, and overall cryptocurrency market trends over the coming decades. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Based on our analysis, Cardano is likely to surpass $5 by 2030, with a forecasted range of around $6.75. This projection is driven by Cardano’s continued technological advancements, growing adoption, strategic partnerships, and increasing market confidence, indicating a positive long-term growth trajectory for the cryptocurrency market. Will Cardano reach $10? ADA is predicted to reach $10 by 2031. By this time, the coin is expected to attain a maximum price of $9.8 to $10 Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano is trading around $0.69, with an all-time high of $2.80 in early 2021. While not impossible, reaching $50 in the next few years is highly uncertain. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. Predictions indicate that by 2030, Cardano could see significant growth, with estimates suggesting a rise to around $6.75. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges.

But as software engineer and digital assets expert Vincent Van Code warns, that control can become a curse if you pass away without a plan. If your loved ones can’t access your XRP after you’re gone, your holdings could be lost forever, buried in the blockchain with no way to retrieve them. Van Code recently issued a powerful reminder to XRP holders on X: self-custody means responsibility, and that responsibility must extend beyond your lifetime. Crypto is unlike any traditional asset. There’s no customer support number, no forgotten-password feature, and no institution to contact. If no one knows how to access your private keys, your XRP dies with you. The Risks of Cold Wallets While cold wallets—hardware or paper wallets stored offline—are among the most secure ways to hold crypto, they’re also the most difficult to recover without proper instructions. Van Code stresses that it’s not enough to simply own a Ledger device or write down your seed phrase. The real risk lies in whether anyone else knows how to find and use that information when you’re no longer around. If your loved ones can’t access your crypto after you die, it might as well die with you. Crypto is only truly yours if you control the keys — but that control becomes a liability if no one else knows how to access them when you're gone. Cold wallets, while secure, are… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) June 20, 2025 Without guidance, heirs are often left with a device they don’t understand, locked away by passwords they can’t guess, guarding tokens they may not even know exist. Leave a Clear, Accessible Trail Van Code urges XRP holders to create a detailed, easy-to-understand access plan for their loved ones. This document should clearly explain where the wallet is stored, how to unlock it, what the assets are, and how to manage or liquidate them. Don’t assume your heirs understand blockchain basics. Write the guide as if you’re explaining crypto to a complete beginner. This information should be kept somewhere secure but accessible—such as a fireproof safe, safety deposit box, or encrypted digital vault—with clear instructions in your legal documents referencing its location. Choose the Right Executor Appointing a capable executor is just as crucial as documenting access. Van Code advises choosing someone who either understands crypto or can be trusted to follow technical instructions precisely. If no one in your personal network fits the bill, consider naming a professional fiduciary who specializes in digital assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Legal Backing for Digital Assets From a legal standpoint, it’s vital to formally include your crypto holdings in your estate plan. That could be through your will or a separate letter of instruction. But as Van Code points out, never include private keys or seed phrases directly in your will—wills become public documents during probate. Instead, reference the existence and secure location of your access instructions in the legal paperwork. In some cases, a digital asset trust may be the best option. These trusts offer enhanced privacy and a smoother transition of ownership without exposing sensitive information. Test Your Plan and Keep It Updated A plan is only useful if it works. Van Code recommends walking a trusted person through a “test run” to ensure they can realistically access and manage your XRP. Just as importantly, revisit and update your instructions any time you change wallets, passwords, or custodial arrangements. Outdated information could render your entire plan useless. Vincent Van Code’s message is a crucial wake-up call to XRP holders and the wider crypto community. True ownership doesn’t end with securing your tokens—it includes ensuring they live on after you. Without a plan, your digital wealth could disappear into the blockchain abyss. But with foresight and careful preparation, you can make sure your legacy—and your XRP—endure.

The Lisk DAO is putting a massive proposal to a community vote: whether to burn 100 million LSK tokens. This isn’t just a small adjustment; it’s a decision that could reshape the future economics of the Lisk crypto token. Understanding the Lisk DAO Token Burn Proposal At the heart of this crucial vote is a proposal to permanently remove 100 million LSK tokens from existence. These specific tokens were minted during Lisk’s strategic migration to become an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network. While the migration aimed to enhance interoperability and access within the broader DeFi ecosystem, it resulted in the creation of these additional tokens. The proposal, detailed in an official forum post, asks the Lisk DAO community to decide the fate of this significant token stash. Burning tokens is a common practice in the crypto world, often aimed at reducing supply and potentially increasing scarcity, which can have various effects on the token’s value and ecosystem dynamics. The Potential Impact: LSK Supply Reduction Explained If the community votes ‘Yes’ to the LSK token burn, the implications are substantial. The 100 million tokens would be permanently removed from the total supply. Considering the current total supply, this burn would represent a significant 25% reduction, bringing the new total supply down to 300 million LSK tokens. A reduction in supply, especially one of this magnitude, is a form of LSK supply reduction that can influence market dynamics. Fewer tokens in circulation, assuming constant demand, can theoretically lead to increased scarcity. This is a core principle behind many crypto token burn mechanisms – aiming to benefit existing token holders by making their share of the total supply proportionally larger and potentially more valuable over time. Conversely, if the proposal is rejected, the 100 million tokens won’t disappear. Instead, they are planned to be vested over a period from 2027 to 2033. Their usage during this vesting period would be determined by future proposals and decisions made through the Lisk DAO governance process. This alternative path keeps the tokens available for potential ecosystem development, grants, or other initiatives, subject to community approval. Comparing the Outcomes: Burn vs. Vesting Let’s look at the two potential paths: Outcome Fate of 100M LSK Impact on Total Supply Future Use Approved (Burn) Permanently destroyed Reduced by 25% (to 300M) None (tokens removed) Rejected (Vesting) Vested 2027-2033 Remains higher (400M initially) Determined by future DAO proposals Lisk Crypto and the Migration to Ethereum To fully appreciate the significance of this LSK token burn proposal, it’s helpful to understand Lisk’s journey. Originally its own blockchain platform focused on enabling developers to build decentralized applications using JavaScript, Lisk recently underwent a major strategic shift. The project decided to migrate its native LSK token to the Ethereum network, relaunching it as an ERC-20 token. This migration was intended to integrate Lisk more closely with the vast and active Ethereum ecosystem, including its established DeFi protocols, wallets, and developer tools. The 100 million tokens in question are a direct result of this migration process, created as part of the token swap or conversion mechanism. How Does the Lisk DAO Governance Work? This vote is a prime example of decentralized governance in action. The Lisk DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) empowers LSK token holders to have a direct say in key decisions affecting the network and its treasury. Proposals like the crypto token burn are submitted, discussed by the community, and then put to a formal vote using on-chain mechanisms. The vote on the 100M LSK burn was originally planned for an earlier date but was postponed to July 1st. This delay was a deliberate move to allow the community more time for discussion, debate, and engagement with the DAO governance process. It highlights the project’s commitment to ensuring token holders are well-informed and have ample opportunity to participate in shaping Lisk’s future. Active participation in DAO votes is crucial for the health and decentralization of projects like Lisk. It allows the community’s collective will to guide development, resource allocation, and fundamental token economics. Benefits and Challenges of a Crypto Token Burn Implementing a significant crypto token burn like the one proposed by the Lisk DAO comes with potential benefits and challenges: Potential Benefits: Increased Scarcity: Reducing the total supply makes each remaining LSK token a larger percentage of the whole, potentially increasing its value proposition if demand remains constant or grows. Positive Market Sentiment: Token burns are often viewed favorably by investors as a sign that the project is focused on long-term value and managing token inflation. Alignment with Community Interest: If the community votes for the burn, it shows strong alignment between the project’s actions and the desires of its token holders. Potential Challenges: Loss of Potential Resources: If the tokens were not burned, they could potentially be used for future ecosystem grants, marketing, or development initiatives, funded through the DAO. Burning them removes this possibility. Execution Risks: While usually straightforward, the technical execution of a large token burn must be flawless to avoid errors. Ensuring Fair Representation: DAO votes rely on participation. Ensuring a broad and representative portion of the community votes is key to a legitimate outcome. What Happens After the Lisk DAO Vote? The outcome of the July 1st vote will set a clear path forward for the 100 million LSK tokens. If approved, the burn process will be initiated, permanently removing the tokens from circulation and solidifying the new, lower total supply of 300 million LSK. If rejected, the focus will shift to managing the vested tokens from 2027 onwards. The Lisk DAO will then be responsible for evaluating and voting on future proposals detailing how these tokens should be utilized to benefit the ecosystem. Regardless of the outcome, this vote underscores the power of decentralized governance and its role in determining the fundamental characteristics and future direction of projects like Lisk. A Monumental Decision for Lisk The upcoming Lisk DAO vote on the 100 million LSK token burn is more than just a procedural step; it’s a monumental decision with tangible economic implications for the Lisk crypto token and its community.

Pattern From 2017 Reveals How It Will Happen,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-2026-pattern-with-2017/,"The XRP price is currently trading well below $3; however, a crypto expert believes that in less than two years, this popular altcoin could enter the double-digit territory, marking a historic moment in crypto. The analyst has forecasted a potential surge to $27, pointing to a re-emerging pattern from 2017. With over six months left before 2026 begins, the expert has outlined a clear roadmap of how XRP could reach this bullish target if it completely mirrors the historic fractal. XRP Price Prediction For 2026 A new technical analysis by X (formerly Twitter) market expert Egrag Crypto suggests that XRP has yet to see its biggest breakout. The trajectory of the analyst’s chart mirrors the same technical path that XRP followed before hitting its 2018 peak and current all-time high of $3.84. Related Reading: XRP To End 7-Month Consolidation After 700% Surge – Is A Major Move Coming? Egrag Crypto highlights that XRP is on the verge of an explosive rally that may extend into 2026, with current market behavior echoing the conditions and buildup that preceded its 2017 breakout. Notably, the analyst’s price chart shows that the XRP monthly candle structure went through six candles of consolidation before it launched into a parabolic rise in late 2017. Now, the cryptocurrency has consolidated for seven monthly candles, highlighted by the green triangle in the chart. If the eight completes, the analyst expects a dramatic “KABOOM phase” to follow—one that could propel XRP to price levels not seen before. The bullish projections point to a possible blow-off top somewhere between $22 and $27, aligning with the highest blue arc on the chart. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.15, meaning a surge to $27 would represent a whopping 1,156% in less than two years. With July 2025 highlighted as the potential trigger month, Egrag Crypto believes that the breakout could extend its momentum toward the end of 2025 and peak in 2026. The formation, known as the RGB Arcs, presents a visual roadmap of this projected bullish path—reinforcing the possibility that XRP is preparing to repeat history—only bigger. XRP To Reach $4 Before $27 Target In his analysis, Egrag Crypto’s chart spanned from 2013 through 2017, connecting XRP’s peaks to a series of colored parabolic curves. The red arcs in the chart represented the macro support line, while the green arc marked historical resistance levels—reached in 2018, and now projected for 2025-2026. Related Reading: XRP Price Enters Perfect Setup After Buy Retest – Next Stop $3.7 Notably, the analyst predicts that XRP’s first breakout zone lies between $4 and $5. Once this target is hit, the cryptocurrency is expected to move into the upper green and blue arcs, positioning it for a stronger surge toward the forecasted $27 peak. Egrag Crypto has described this initial target as a measured move, where the final outcome is solely based on historical price patterns rather than pure speculation. He urges the broader XRP community to remain strong and patient until the cryptocurrency progresses toward these levels.

Semler initially aims to accumulate 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025. Joe Burnett has been appointed as director of Bitcoin strategy and will be tasked with providing expertise to inform the treasury strategy. The roadmap for the treasury strategy will include a 42,000 BTC signpost by the end of 2026 and 105,000 BTC by the end of 2027. Publicly listed companies have taken an interest in Bitcoin as a store of long-term value. They are racing to accumulate enough cryptocurrency to give their companies a strategic advantage. Semler made a public announcement about the treasury strategy so that investors would be better informed about their company. The treasury would utilise Bitcoin as its primary reserve asset. They outlined their accumulation roadmap, reaching fulfillment in 2027 if the strategy goes according to plan, with a treasury holding of 105,000 BTC. Semler will finance its Bitcoin acquisitions through various financial methods. Bitcoin trading expert Joe Burnett will direct the strategy and use his expertise to ensure a smooth treasury funding process. The company’s announcement revealed that Semler started its Bitcoin treasury in May 2024. The company has already amassed useful profits with the Bitcoin they have accumulated. Eric Semler, Semler chairman, expressed confidence in Burnett’s ability to use his extensive expertise to execute the strategy successfully. Eric Semler stated that Burnett was a thought leader regarding Bitcoin investments and the right person for the job. The Bitcoin treasury of Semler Scientific currently amounts to 4,449 BTC valued at around $462 million, nearly halfway to their 2025 target of 10,000 BTC. A treasury strategy is in vogue with many corporations creating reserve Bitcoin treasuries to take advantage of the asset’s long-term value. Semler, however, still has a long way to go to meet their targets. The company is currently ranked within the top 15 corporate Bitcoin holders. A few trends concerning digital assets are circulating in the business world, including an uptick in stablecoin use and demand for Bitcoin treasuries. Around 230 companies across the globe have used Bitcoin to boost their treasury holdings. Semler hopes to get ahead of the pack and embrace what is described as a groundbreaking financial innovation. Joe Burnett, Bitcoin researcher, has been hired by Semler Scientific to head the Bitcoin treasury department. Burnett has been titled ‘director of Bitcoin strategy’ and will ensure the treasury roadmap is on track. Burnett has an appropriate resume for the position, including a role as director of market research for Unchained, head analyst at Bitcoin mining firm Blockware Solutions, and a position at accounting firm EY. Burnett is committed to working in the Bitcoin industry as a full-time career move. He will benefit greatly from his new role with Semler Scientific because he has the opportunity to manage what will hopefully become one of the largest Bitcoin treasuries in the world. However, this week, Matthew Sigel, crypto researcher from VanEck, warned companies to beware of Bitcoin treasury strategies if their stock price drops dramatically. Sigel argued this week that shareholder value could be drastically diluted if the stock price falls below net asset value. He reasons that this could be a problem for many companies that use share issuance methods to fund a Bitcoin treasury. The warning comes as companies look at the upside of a Bitcoin treasury and do not consider the risks involved. Sigel pointed out that no company has reached this stage yet, but Sigel Scientific is nearly dropping below its net asset value. The event may trigger unintended consequences, according to Sigel, and may prove to be a drawback for the treasury method.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-20 13:34:02

That said, as of June 20 — at the time of writing — the price had already pulled back a bit after the recent run-up. So, what’s the deal with the Sky price prediction in the short and long term? Let’s break it down. Table of Contents What is Sky? Sky coin price prediction: general outlook Sky price prediction 2025 Sky price prediction 2030 What is Sky? Sky is the revamped version of MakerDAO, one of the first and most influential DeFi platforms in crypto. The big rebrand was rolled out in August 2024 as part of MakerDAO’s bold “Endgame” plan to take the project to the next level. As part of the changes, the DAI stablecoin was renamed to USDS, and the old MKR governance token was replaced with a new one called Sky ( SKY ). But this wasn’t just a name swap. The idea behind Sky is to make the whole system more user-friendly and community-driven. It introduces smaller, purpose-specific sub-DAOs called Sky Stars, each with its own role and rewards. The goal? To make governance simpler, the platform more scalable, and the overall experience better for users. In short, Sky is building on MakerDAO’s legacy — but with a fresh, more modern approach to DeFi. What will the Sky crypto price prediction be for the near future and beyond? Is Sky a good investment? Sky coin price prediction: general outlook As of June 20, Sky is trading at around $0.08, down 1.16% over the past 24 hours and 6.2% over the past week. On June 16, the token briefly surged to $0.0949, while its most recent all-time high was $0.1014 back in December 2024 during a broader crypto market rally. SKY 1-day price chart, June 2025 | Source: crypto.news The latest price increase has been largely driven by the launch of Sky Protocol’s much-anticipated staking rewards program, which allows users to earn attractive yields by locking up their SKY tokens. In addition to the staking rollout, the token’s recent deflationary shift — halting new emissions and implementing a buyback-and-burn model — has helped boost investor confidence. The ongoing conversion from MKR to SKY has also reduced circulating supply, further supporting upward price pressure.

What does the future hold for SKY? Let’s take a closer look at the Sky price prediction. Sky price prediction 2025 According to CoinCodex’s Sky price forecast, the token might see a short-term dip of around 25%, possibly falling to $0.0615 by July 18, 2025. That said, their 12-month outlook suggests Sky could swing anywhere between $0.0564 and $0.2251 — so in the best-case scenario, it could more than double its current all-time high. As of June 19, the overall vibe is still pretty bullish. Out of 19 technical indicators, 16 are pointing up, while only 3 are showing bearish signals, which suggests there’s still a lot of positive momentum behind the token. DigitalCoinPrice shares a similarly positive view in its SKY price prediction, projecting that the token could break past its previous all-time high and stabilize between $0.17 and $0.18 sometime in 2025. Will Sky go up or down in five years? Sky price prediction 2030 According to CoinCodex’s Sky price prediction for 2030, the token’s price could range from $0.11 to $0.348, depending on market conditions and overall crypto performance. DigitalCoinPrice’s projections for SKY suggest that the token could trade between $0.38 and $0.44 by the end of the decade, reflecting steady long-term growth potential. Should you invest in Sky? The coin has some strong fundamentals backing it — like the recent rebrand, staking rewards, a deflationary model, and the push toward sub-DAOs. While the token saw a slight pullback, it followed a solid rally, and overall expectations for SKY remain fairly optimistic. Still, it’s crypto — so if you’re thinking of investing, make sure it fits your risk tolerance and long-term goals.

But just when things appeared to be wrapping up, a new twist has emerged: both sides are now asking the court to change some of the penalties that were already decided. So, what’s behind this move, and why is the case still not over? Ripple SEC Push to Modify Penalty Recently, Ripple and the SEC jointly filed a motion that caught the attention of the XRP community. They’re asking for what’s called an “indicative ruling, ” which means they want the judge to consider changing part of the final judgment, especially the relief and penalties. Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel explained that both parties are now trying to revise the $125 million penalty and the injunction that prevents Ripple from making similar unregistered sales in the future. Interestingly, Ripple added a follow-up letter, arguing that dissolving the injunction wouldn’t exempt them from following securities laws. They still agree to comply with the law, even without court enforcement. Who’s Causing the Delay—Ripple or the SEC? The situation has left many in the crypto community wondering, who is actually causing the delay? Interestingly, XRP lawyer Bill Morgan responded by saying it’s not the SEC dragging its feet, it’s Ripple that’s asking for more. He pointed out that the SEC has shown a willingness to cooperate, especially in dissolving the injunction. Marc Fagel added that the charges were brought under previous SEC leadership, not Gary Gensler, and the case is now waiting on a judge’s decision, not stalled by the SEC. SEC Appeal Changes Ripple’s Strategy According to Morgan, the SEC’s recent shift in enforcement strategy has made Ripple bolder. He suggested that if the judge agrees to the joint request, a final settlement could happen within weeks. But now, Ripple sees an opportunity to push for better terms. The appeal gave Ripple a reason to aim higher, hoping for a more favorable outcome. Until then, all eyes are on Judge Torres as the court decides whether to grant the relief modification and bring this high-profile case to a close. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

While many focus on the exciting movements in cryptocurrency, understanding the broader macroeconomic landscape, including traditional Forex markets, is vital. Major shifts in global finance, often triggered by macroeconomic and geopolitical events, can influence everything from investor sentiment to capital flows, indirectly impacting the crypto space. Recently, a significant call from a major institution like Bank of America has caught the attention of market watchers, suggesting a notable shift in Forex trading strategy. This involves moving away from buying the AUD JPY pair towards favoring the USD JPY pair. Let’s dive into why this recommendation is being made and what it means for the markets, especially concerning geopolitical risk Forex exposure. Understanding the Bank of America Forex Recommendation Bank of America, a prominent voice in global financial analysis, has put forward a view that traders and investors should consider altering their positions in specific currency pairs. The core of their recommendation is a strategic shift: sell AUD/JPY positions or avoid initiating long positions in this pair, and instead, look for opportunities in the USD/JPY pair. This isn’t just a technical trading call; it’s rooted in fundamental analysis, heavily influenced by the prevailing global economic and political climate. Why this specific switch? The rationale provided by Bank of America centers on the differential impact of rising geopolitical tensions on the Australian Dollar (AUD), the Japanese Yen (JPY), and the US Dollar (USD). The AUD is often seen as a ‘risk-on’ or commodity-linked currency, sensitive to global growth prospects and commodity prices, particularly those influenced by China. The JPY traditionally functions as a ‘safe-haven’ currency, tending to strengthen during times of global uncertainty or market stress as investors seek refuge. However, its safe-haven status has been complicated by the Bank of Japan’s ultra-loose monetary policy. The USD is the world’s primary reserve currency and also acts as a significant safe haven, benefiting from capital flight during crises due to the depth and liquidity of US financial markets and the perceived stability of the US economy and political system (relative to extreme global turmoil). Bank of America’s analysis suggests that current geopolitical risks are creating an environment where the USD’s safe-haven qualities are amplified, while the JPY’s safe-haven status is potentially undermined by monetary policy divergence, and the AUD is vulnerable to any downturn in global growth or commodity demand triggered by instability. Why Geopolitical Risk Forex Exposure Matters Now Geopolitical risk isn’t a new concept in Forex trading, but its prominence fluctuates. Currently, several factors are converging to elevate its importance: Increased Global Instability: Ongoing conflicts, political uncertainty in key regions, and rising tensions between major powers create an environment of unpredictability. This encourages investors to reduce exposure to assets perceived as risky and increase holdings in traditional safe havens. Impact on Supply Chains and Inflation: Geopolitical events can disrupt supply chains, impact energy prices, and contribute to inflationary pressures. This forces central banks to navigate a complex path, influencing interest rate differentials and currency valuations. Policy Divergence Amplified: In times of stress, the reaction function of different central banks becomes critical. The US Federal Reserve’s stance compared to the Bank of Japan’s, for instance, creates significant interest rate differentials that can attract or repel capital, further influencing pairs like USD JPY. Capital Flows: Fear and uncertainty drive capital towards perceived safety. This means flows into US treasuries and USD-denominated assets, strengthening the dollar. Currencies tied to global trade or less stable economies may see outflows. Understanding this geopolitical risk Forex dynamic is key to appreciating Bank of America’s view. They likely see the current environment favoring currencies that benefit from capital flight (USD) or are less exposed to global growth slowdowns, while penalizing those more sensitive to risk sentiment (AUD) or facing unique domestic policy challenges (JPY’s struggle with ultra-low rates). Analyzing the USD JPY Pair: Why it’s Favored The USD JPY currency pair is one of the most actively traded globally, often reflecting the interplay between US and Japanese economic conditions, monetary policies, and global risk sentiment. Bank of America’s preference for buying USD JPY (meaning going long the pair, expecting its value to rise) stems from several factors: Monetary Policy Divergence: The significant gap between the US Federal Reserve’s interest rates and the Bank of Japan’s near-zero or negative rates makes holding USD-denominated assets more attractive than JPY-denominated ones from a yield perspective. This interest rate differential is a powerful driver for the USD JPY exchange rate. While the BOJ has made some minor policy adjustments, the fundamental gap remains wide. Safe-Haven Appeal of USD: As mentioned, during periods of heightened geopolitical risk, the US Dollar typically strengthens. Global investors and central banks hold large reserves in USD, and in times of crisis, demand for USD assets like Treasury bonds increases, boosting the dollar’s value. Relative Economic Outlook: While global growth faces headwinds, the US economy has often shown relative resilience compared to other developed nations, further supporting the case for the dollar. Bank of America’s call suggests they believe these factors, particularly the geopolitical backdrop amplifying the USD’s safe-haven status and the persistent monetary policy gap, will continue to support or drive the USD JPY higher. Examining the AUD JPY Pair: Why the Switch is Recommended The AUD JPY pair is often considered a proxy for global risk appetite and growth expectations, especially those tied to Asia and commodity markets. Australia is a major exporter of commodities like iron ore and coal, heavily reliant on demand from countries like China. Japan, while a major economy, has monetary policy focused on stimulating inflation, keeping rates very low. Bank of America’s recommendation to move away from AUD JPY likely considers the following points: Sensitivity to Global Growth: The AUD is vulnerable to slowdowns in global economic activity, which geopolitical instability can trigger or worsen. If global trade or commodity demand falters due to conflicts or political tensions, the AUD is likely to weaken. Commodity Price Volatility: Geopolitical events can cause spikes in certain commodity prices (like oil), but a general risk-off environment can weigh on demand for industrial commodities crucial to Australia’s exports. JPY’s Complicated Safe-Haven Status: While the JPY is a traditional safe haven, its strength during risk-off periods has been less consistent than the USD’s, largely due to the Bank of Japan’s persistent commitment to ultra-loose monetary policy, which keeps yields low and makes JPY less attractive from an investment perspective over the long term compared to higher-yielding currencies. In extreme risk-off events, JPY might still see inflows, but perhaps less reliably or strongly than the USD, especially against currencies like the AUD which are more directly exposed to growth risks. The combination of AUD’s vulnerability to risk-off sentiment and global growth concerns, coupled with the JPY’s monetary policy headwinds, makes the AUD JPY pair less attractive in an environment dominated by geopolitical uncertainty, according to Bank of America. What Does This Mean for Your Forex Trading Strategy? A recommendation like this from a major institution isn’t a guarantee, but it provides valuable insight into how large players are viewing the market landscape. For individual traders, it suggests several considerations: Re-evaluate Exposure: If you hold positions in AUD JPY, consider whether the potential risks highlighted by BofA align with your own analysis and risk tolerance. Consider USD JPY Opportunities: If you were looking for trading opportunities, USD JPY might present a setup that aligns with the macro view of capital flowing into safe-haven USD amidst global uncertainty. Focus on Fundamentals: This call underscores the importance of understanding the fundamental drivers of currency movements – not just technical charts. Geopolitics, central bank policy, and economic growth outlooks are critical. Risk Management is Paramount: Trading based on macro themes requires careful risk management. Geopolitical situations can change rapidly, leading to sudden market reversals. Use stop-losses and manage position sizes appropriately. Stay Informed: Keep track of global news headlines related to geopolitical developments, central bank statements (especially from the Fed and BOJ), and economic data releases. Implementing a Forex trading strategy based on such macro themes requires patience and a willingness to hold positions for longer periods, as these fundamental drivers unfold over time. It also means being prepared for volatility driven by news events. Potential Challenges and Counterarguments No market call is without its potential challenges or counterarguments. While Bank of America’s analysis is compelling, traders should consider alternative scenarios: De-escalation of Geopolitical Risks: A sudden improvement in global political stability could quickly reverse safe-haven flows, weakening the USD and potentially strengthening currencies like the AUD. Shift in Central Bank Policy: An unexpected hawkish turn from the Bank of Japan or a dovish pivot from the Federal Reserve could significantly alter interest rate differentials, impacting USD JPY dynamics. China’s Economy: A stronger-than-expected rebound in China’s economy could boost commodity demand, supporting the AUD regardless of global risk sentiment. Market Positioning: If a trade idea becomes too popular, the market can become crowded, increasing the risk of sharp pullbacks if sentiment shifts. Therefore, while Bank of America’s view provides a strong framework, it’s essential to conduct your own analysis and remain flexible. Bringing it Together: The Strategic Shift Bank of America’s recommendation for a strategic shift from buying AUD JPY to buying USD JPY highlights the current dominance of geopolitical risk Forex drivers in the currency markets. They see the US Dollar benefiting from its safe-haven status and yield advantage, while the Australian Dollar is vulnerable to global growth concerns and the Japanese Yen’s safe-haven role is complicated by domestic monetary policy. For those involved in Forex trading, this serves as a powerful reminder that macro factors, particularly geopolitical ones, can override other influences in the short to medium term. It underscores the need for a robust Forex trading strategy that incorporates fundamental analysis alongside technical indicators. Whether you choose to follow this specific recommendation or not, understanding the reasoning behind it provides valuable insight into the forces currently shaping the global currency landscape. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of global events and financial markets, a lesson equally relevant to understanding volatility in markets like cryptocurrency, which are also influenced by global liquidity and risk sentiment.

It’s real. And it could break Bitcoin within five years or even sooner, some experts say. If the Bitcoin network doesn’t adapt its cryptography in time, it risks losing everything it’s built over the last 16 years. What’s Happening? Bitcoin runs on elliptic curve cryptography. That type of math protects your private key, like a digital signature only you can create. It’s what keeps your coins safe from being stolen. But quantum computers don’t play by the same rules. They can solve problems in parallel instead of one step at a time, which makes them lethal to traditional encryption. This isn’t some distant threat. Microsoft’s Majorana chip was a breakthrough. The U.S. government is preparing to go quantum-secure by 2030. There are already about 100 quantum computers in the world, and that number could hit 5,000 by the end of this decade. That’s a big problem. About 30% of all Bitcoin is sitting in old addresses that are easy pickings for quantum attacks . Hack just one high-profile wallet, and the trust in Bitcoin could collapse overnight. So, What’s Being Done About It? Not enough. Proposals like BIP-360 and other “quantum-resistant” schemes are still theoretical. Upgrading Bitcoin’s cryptography would likely require a hard fork, a major change to the network’s rules. But in Bitcoin circles, “hard fork” is almost a curse word. The community values stability over speed. It has always moved slowly, and that’s a feature, not a bug. But that same caution could be Bitcoin’s downfall. There are other ways forward: hybrid solutions, smarter key management, and layered defenses that don’t disrupt the network. They exist, but they would require a lot of real adoption. Because once “Q-Day” hits, the day quantum computers crack modern encryption, it will be too late to react.",Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|SPONSORED|FORKS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-20 13:42:57

The new group will be created after a reverse merger with the locally listed biotech firm Bridge Biotherapeutics. Pataraxis Holdings has announced a reverse merger with the South Korean public company Bridge Biotherapeutics. The deal was closed at a price of 25M Korean won ($18.5M). After the merger, the new public company will be traded as Parataxis Korea. The merged company will become the South Korean version of Strategy and Metaplanet, launching a BTC treasury campaign. “ Inspired by the growing interest in BTC treasury strategies seen in companies like Strategy in the US and Metaplanet in Japan, we believe institutional interest in this space is increasing globally. We see South Korea as an important market in the evolution of BTC adoption. Our intent is to support institutional access to BTC exposure while emphasizing sound corporate governance and disciplined capital management,” said Andrew Kim, Partner at Parataxis Capital. The firm joins a growing list of companies announcing upcoming or already finished BTC purchases , even for minimal treasuries. Building a reserve has drawn attention to multiple new buyers, who have not previously shown any interest in crypto-related services. Parataxis Capital switches to BTC maximalism Parataxis Holdings is an affiliate of Parataxis Capital, a multi-strategy investment company with an interest in crypto projects. The firm is categorized as a Tier-4 investment fund, participating in just nine funding rounds. The last investment of Parataxis was in ZTX, a Web3 metaverse project. Based on its previous forays into older Web3 trends such as governance and NFT marketplaces, Parataxis achieved minimal returns on its investments. Following the recent trend of reverse mergers and equity-financed BTC treasuries, Parataxis found a suitable public company, though for now without announcing any plans for equity or debt issuance. Bridge Biotherapeutics was distressed before the acquisition Bridge Biotherapeutics shows a similar trading story to Eyenovia , an ophthalmology company that pivoted to a BTC treasury strategy. Bridge Biotherapeutics saw its stock crash in April, erasing over 76% of its value. The company faced a significant reduction in revenues, losing 96.7% of income on one of its leading licensed drugs. Parataxis acquired the distressed Bridge Biotherapeutics, aiming to spark a recovery as a BTC treasury company for the South Korean market. | Source: Google Finance The biotech firm was founded in 2015 and became public in 2019. The company has a relatively risky model with clinical-stage drugs, focusing on development and commercial distribution of specialized drugs. A total of 131 public companies and 29 private firms hold BTC in dedicated treasuries. However, not all public companies follow the Strategy playbook. BTC acquisitions depend on the availability of liquidity and demand for buying the company’s stock. In the case of Bridge Biotherapeutics, the stock price rallied in the past 30 days, rising rapidly following the shift to a BTC strategy. Despite this, the stock price remains near its all-time low and is still far from the recent peak valuation. Building a BTC strategy is no guarantee for sustainable stock growth, despite the rapid short-term gains.

According to insights from Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital, shared via their official Telegram channel, global financial markets, including crypto, are currently in a pronounced ‘wait-and-see’ mode. This isn’t just random market noise; it’s a direct response to mounting geopolitical risks and the anticipation of potential volatility across asset classes. What’s Driving the “Wait-and-See” Crypto Market? The primary driver behind this cautious stance in the Crypto Market Update is the complex global geopolitical landscape. Heightened concerns, particularly surrounding potential U.S. involvement in the Israel–Iran conflict, are creating ripples of uncertainty across financial markets. Investors are naturally hesitant to make aggressive moves when the political outlook is unpredictable. This type of macro uncertainty often leads to risk-off sentiment, where assets perceived as riskier, like cryptocurrencies, tend to consolidate or decline. Beyond the immediate geopolitical flashpoints, other factors contributing to the cautious Crypto Market Update include: Ongoing inflation concerns and central bank monetary policy uncertainty. Regulatory developments in major jurisdictions. Lack of a clear, strong positive catalyst within the crypto space itself. This confluence of external pressures means market participants are holding their breath, waiting for clearer signals before committing significant capital. Bitcoin Price Action: Stuck in Sideways Mode? Despite the significant macro and political noise, the Bitcoin Price has remained remarkably stable, albeit trading largely sideways. This lack of directional momentum might seem counterintuitive given the turbulent external environment, but it underscores the current equilibrium between buying and selling pressure. Sentiment among general crypto investors appears muted, reflecting the prevailing uncertainty. Bitcoin, often seen as a barometer for the broader crypto market, is currently acting more like a stable anchor than a volatile risk asset. Why is the Bitcoin Price not reacting more sharply? Several factors could be at play: Market Maturity: The crypto market is more mature than in previous cycles, with institutional participation potentially providing some underlying support. Conflicting Forces: Geopolitical risk (negative) might be offset by factors like anticipation of future rate cuts (positive for risk assets) or continued belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Liquidity Positioning: Large players might be positioned defensively, reducing the likelihood of sharp moves in either direction based on news. For many, this sideways action presents a challenge, making trading difficult, but for long-term holders, it might simply be viewed as a period of accumulation or consolidation before the next move. Decoding Sentiment: What Are Ethereum Options Telling Us? While spot markets like the current Bitcoin Price might seem calm on the surface, the derivatives market often tells a different story about underlying sentiment and positioning. QCP Capital specifically highlighted the options market for both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). A key takeaway from their analysis is the strong demand for downside protection. This is evident in the pricing of options contracts, where investors are willing to pay a premium for ‘put’ options (which profit if the price falls) compared to ‘call’ options (which profit if the price rises). This demand is particularly noticeable for contracts expiring in June and September, suggesting investors are bracing for potential negative price movements over the medium term. Interestingly, QCP Capital also noted a specific dynamic in Ethereum Options : short-dated implied volatility has fallen below longer-dated tenors. What does this mean? Typically, implied volatility (IV) reflects the market’s expectation of future price swings. Higher IV means the market expects more volatility. When short-dated IV is lower than long-dated IV, it suggests that traders who were hedging against very near-term, specific events (like a potential immediate geopolitical escalation) might have reduced those hedges. They are still cautious about the future (hence higher long-dated IV and demand for puts), but perhaps feel the most immediate, event-driven risk has slightly subsided, or they have adjusted their strategies. Analyzing Ethereum Options and Bitcoin options provides valuable insight into how professional traders are positioning themselves, and currently, that positioning leans towards caution and a desire to hedge against potential drops. What Could Break the Crypto Volatility Lull? The current state of muted sentiment and sideways trading can’t last forever. Markets are constantly seeking direction. So, what potential catalysts could reignite Crypto Volatility and pull the market out of its ‘wait-and-see’ phase? Potential catalysts include: Geopolitical Developments: A clear de-escalation or, conversely, a significant escalation in global conflicts could provide a strong directional impulse. Macroeconomic Data: Key inflation reports, employment figures, or signals from central banks about interest rate policies could shift market expectations dramatically. Regulatory News: Major announcements regarding crypto regulation in the U.S., Europe, or Asia could significantly impact sentiment and market structure. Institutional Activity: A surge or withdrawal of institutional capital, perhaps related to new Bitcoin ETFs or other investment products, could move the needle. Significant Network Updates: While less likely to cause immediate macro shifts, major protocol upgrades (like potential future Ethereum developments) can impact specific assets and overall sentiment. Until one of these factors provides a decisive signal, the market is likely to remain range-bound, characterized by periods of low Crypto Volatility punctuated by brief, sharp moves triggered by news events. Navigating Geopolitical Risk in Crypto The emphasis on Geopolitical Risk Crypto markets face is a reminder that this asset class does not exist in a vacuum. While often touted as uncorrelated, in times of extreme global stress, crypto can behave like other risk assets, being sold off alongside stocks and commodities. For investors, understanding and navigating Geopolitical Risk Crypto exposure is crucial. This isn’t about predicting the unpredictable, but rather about managing potential impacts. Here are some actionable insights: Risk Management: Ensure your portfolio is appropriately sized for your risk tolerance, especially considering external uncertainties. Observe Key Levels: In a sideways market, identifying support and resistance levels for assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum becomes particularly important for potential entry or exit points. Watch Derivatives Data: Pay attention to metrics like options open interest, funding rates, and implied volatility, as they can signal shifts in professional positioning and sentiment. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of both crypto-specific news and major global events, as they can unexpectedly influence market dynamics. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For long-term investors, periods of sideways trading can be opportunities for consistent, small purchases, averaging out your entry price. The challenge lies in the inherent unpredictability of geopolitical events. Unlike scheduled economic reports, conflicts and political decisions can emerge rapidly, causing swift market reactions. This makes the current environment particularly challenging for short-term traders. Conclusion: Patience is the Play In summary, the crypto market, as observed by firms like QCP Capital, is clearly operating under a cloud of caution driven by significant geopolitical uncertainty. The Bitcoin Price is consolidating, sentiment is muted, and derivatives data points to a market actively seeking downside protection, particularly for Ethereum. While the market awaits a definitive catalyst to break the current lull in Crypto Volatility , understanding the impact of Geopolitical Risk Crypto markets face is paramount. This period of ‘wait-and-see’ isn’t a time for complacency, but rather for careful observation, risk management, and strategic positioning based on potential future developments. Patience, it seems, is the most valuable asset in the current market climate.

The price has been ranging between key support and resistance zones, with multiple failed attempts to break above the $2,700–$2,800 region. Despite the lack of immediate trend continuation, on-chain fundamentals such as exchange reserves hint at significant structural shifts. This sets the stage for potential volatility ahead as the market prepares for its next directional move. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, ETH remains inside an ascending channel, consistently finding support around the $2,400 area while struggling to break above the $2,800 mark. The upper boundary of this channel, combined with the 200-day moving average and a key order block formed in February, is acting as a heavy resistance element. Each test of this level has led to a rejection, but so far, the structure hasn’t broken down, indicating that bulls are still in control for now. Momentum, however, is weakening. The RSI hovers around the midline at 51, reflecting indecision and a lack of strong directional drive. If ETH can reclaim the upper range and flip the $2,700–$2,800 area into support, it could initiate a new leg higher toward $3,000 and above. On the flip side, a breakdown below $2,400 would shift the bias bearish, exposing the $2,150 support zone. The 4-Hour Chart Zooming in on the 4H chart, ETH is still grinding within the same rising channel. After the recent drop from $2,875 to $2,430, the price retraced into the 0.5–0.618 Fibonacci zone, but has been rejected to the downside and is now consolidating below it. This area, between $2,600 and $2,700, has repeatedly acted as a supply zone, rejecting bullish attempts multiple times. For short-term traders, this remains the key level to flip. Until this resistance breaks, ETH may continue its range-bound behavior. The RSI has recovered slightly from oversold conditions, now sitting near 52. While this suggests a slight uptick in momentum, there’s still no clear sign of bullish dominance. If the bulls fail to break above this key fib zone soon, another drop toward the lower boundary of the channel near $2,400 is likely. Sentiment Analysis One of the most important long-term signals for Ethereum remains the consistent downtrend in exchange reserves. Currently sitting at 18.8 million ETH, this is one of the lowest levels in recent history. Exchange reserve data indicates how much ETH is held on centralized trading platforms, meaning a downtrend signals that coins are being withdrawn into self-custody, staking, or cold wallets. Historically, sustained drops in exchange reserves suggest a supply squeeze narrative building beneath the surface. Fewer tokens on exchanges reduce the available selling pressure and can lead to explosive upside when demand rises. Even as ETH struggles to break out technically, this silent accumulation phase shows confidence among long-term holders. If this trend continues, it may act as a powerful tailwind once technical resistance levels are finally breached.

Even a video call verification will soon be out of the window. 😨😱 Don't install software from a non-official link, especially NOT from your ""friends"" (they are most likely hacked). https://t.co/kfRSDPiJWb — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) June 20, 2025 Per Fujimoto’s report, attackers posed as one of her acquaintances in what appeared to be a normal Zoom video call. During the 10-minute meeting, the impersonator raised concerns over her audio quality and shared a link to an alleged software update. After she clicked it, the hackers gained unauthorized access to her systems, accessing sensitive data and taking over her official X, Telegram, and Metamask accounts. “When I opened the Zoom link, her face appeared, so I didn’t suspect anything,” she explained, adding, “If I had known about this kind of attack, I might not have clicked the link. I want everyone to be aware of this and take caution to prevent similar incidents.” You might also like: Fake Aave ads appear at the top of Google search results, prompting fears of phishing attacks Fujimoto’s experience closely mirrors another incident reported earlier by former Animoca exec Mehdi Farooq, who described being targeted in a nearly identical Zoom scam. In his case, the attackers used deepfakes of two of his acquaintances. Like Fujimoto, Farooq was asked to update his app during the call due to complaints about his audio quality. Minutes after installing the fake update, six of his crypto wallets were drained, resulting in the loss of most of his savings. Founders from Manta Network , Mon Protocol , Stably , and Devdock AI have also reported similar phishing attempts, raising alarm about what appears to be a coordinated wave of attacks. Security analysts have tied the scheme to known tactics used by the North Korea-backed hacker group Lazarus , a notorious hacking syndicate that has repeatedly targeted the crypto industry and is responsible for some of the biggest breaches and thefts. A recent Bitget report revealed that AI-generated deepfake impersonations of government officials, billionaires, and celebrities accounted for 40% of “high-value frauds” in 2024, urging the industry to adopt stricter security measures and remain on high alert.

The broader market remains uncertain, with spot and derivatives data suggesting mixed sentiment. As the weekly close approaches, the price action is squeezed between dynamic supports and a persistent supply zone. This phase could precede a significant breakout or breakdown depending on how liquidity behaves in the coming sessions. By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, BTC has formed a triangle pattern, with almost equal lows near $100,000 and lower highs marking sustained selling pressure. The key trendline support from March remains intact, keeping the price inside the larger ascending channel. The asset is currently attempting to stabilize near $106K, with the RSI hovering around 51, a neutral level indicating a balanced momentum. If the buyers fail to push above the descending resistance and the $110K supply zone, downside liquidity below $100K may become a target. The 100 and 200-day moving averages are rising and converging for a bullish crossover, indicating the long-term bullish structure remains intact. However, the fact that BTC has been rejected multiple times from the $110K area makes that zone a critical decision point. A daily close above it would shift the structure bullish again, while a breakdown below the orange trendline support may accelerate a move toward the lower boundary of the large channel. The 4-Hour Chart In the 4H chart, BTC has rebounded from a local low of $103K, leaving a significant pool of liquidity behind. The price is now pushing back into a fair value gap (FVG) in the $106K zone, which is now acting as a supply barrier. Moreover, the RSI is trending higher at 55, showing mild bullish momentum, but the bearish trendline overhead still caps any impulsive move. A breakout above the FVG with strong volume could open the path to retest $110K. Otherwise, if sellers defend this area again, we may see a sweep below $103K, aiming for the $102K and even $100K liquidation zones. The short-term structure leans slightly bullish, but the market remains range-bound between liquidity pools. Spot Sentiment Analysis Spot Taker CVD The Spot Taker CVD chart over the 90-day view shows a return to aggressive buying dominance (green), following a long period of neutral and sell pressure. This shift indicates that market buyers are stepping back in with confidence, absorbing sell orders at current prices. Historically, when CVD flips green after extended red or grey phases, it precedes upward continuation. This renewed spot demand suggests that large buyers are positioning themselves during this range phase. If this behavior continues while the price holds above key supports, it could lead to a strong breakout. However, if the CVD starts to flatten or turn red again without price advancing, it may indicate exhaustion and foreshadow another sweep of downside liquidity or even a full-blown bearish reversal.

Stablecoins, especially USDC, could revolutionize global payments, offering instant settlement, low fees, and broad accessibility—potentially capturing a multi-trillion-dollar market. Circle's dominant transfer volume and regulatory compliance give it a strong edge, but risks include heavy revenue sharing with Coinbase, competition, and yield dependency. Despite a high valuation and notable risks, I rate CRCL a buy and recommend accumulating shares on dips for long-term exposure to this transformative sector. Thesis Summary Congress just passed the GENIUS Act, laying the groundwork for stablecoin regulation and implementation. Circle ( CRCL ) , which recently went public and is the company behind USDC ( USDC-USD ), one of the most dominant stablecoins, could be a significant winner from this legislation. Stablecoins could potentially revolutionise payments, and even a small slice of this large market could be worth trillions. Though the stock has already rallied a lot since its IPO, this one is worth holding for the long term, although there are meaningful risks investors should consider I rate CRCL a Buy, and suggest getting some exposure while leaving plenty of dry powder to add to the dips. The GENIUS Act The United States Senate has just passed the GENIUS Act, which means that dollar-backed stablecoins like USDC will not operate under federal supervision. The GENIUS Act lays out the basic rules for stablecoins, like maintaining full 1:1 reserves and keeping transparent bookkeeping. This is something USDC was already doing, unlike Tether ( USDT-USD ). This new bill will now move over to the House, where it may also be merged with other crypto legislation like the STABLE Act. It is likely that the bill will become law sometime before August. Why Stablecoins Matter While a lot of people may see stablecoins as just another crypto-adjacent fad, nothing could be further from the truth. Stablecoins represent the net evolution of fiat money, which is very different from crypto or Bitcoin. Stablecoins offer significant potential advantages over today’s digital money. Instant settlement No intermediaries Near-zero fees No chargebacks Easy Programmability And most importantly, no barriers to entry. Through USDC, almost anyone in the world can get instant access to the USD, Treasuries and any app, product or investment that can be linked to it. This has already been proven in many ways, with USDC and Tether operating for years now, and various DeFi products offering yield on these coins. The next big step will be for stablecoins to offer a better alternative to payment processors and credit cards. This is likely why, while Circle rallied yesterday, we saw Mastercard ( MA ) and Visa ( V ) take a big hit. How Circle Fits In Circle is by some measures the most dominant player in the Stablecoin market. In terms of market share, it holds 26%, second to Tether. Stablecoin Market Sare (Artemis) However, it is the largest stablecoin in terms of transfer volume, accounting for around 58% of the market. Circle has issues around $60 billion in USDC, and it generates income by generating yield on the Treasuries that back up the stablecoin. Circle Income statement ( Circle Q1) Back in 2024, the company generated around $1.5 billion in interest on a $60 billion supply of USDC. However, we can see that a big chunk of this went to distribution and transaction costs. A big chunk of this is due to an agreement with Coinbase ( COIN ), which receives 50% of the revenues USDC generates. More on that later. Growth Forecast: Trillion Dollar Opportunity According to a report from Standard Chartered and Zodia Markets, stablecoins represent around 1% of the total US Money Supply and FX transactions. The report also speculates that this could grow to around 10% of the total supply. If this can happen, which seems reasonable based on all the advantages of stablecoins and USDC can reach a dominant market share, say 50%, which make sense if we look at transaction volume, and the fact that USDC is the only real large “legitimate” player, since USDT does not follow the current regulations, then this is a possible forecast for revenues. Circle Forecast (Author's work) By 2035, USDC could have over $1 trillion in circulation, with revenues reaching around $26 billion, which implies an effective return rate of 2.5%. This also implies a CAGR of nearly 30% over the next decade. This would put Circle in the revenue ballpark of Visa, which commands a $600 billion valuation. Risks With a look at the table above, Circle looks like a screaming buy, but there are at least three very important risk factors to consider Coinbase Partnership As it stands right now, 50% of Circle’s revenues go to Coinbase. This agreement seems to be open-ended, but it could be renegotiated. This deal made sense initially, as Coinbase was a key strategic partner, but this could change as the balance of power shifts. The deal will automatically renew in August 2026 , but Circle could look to renegotiate the terms then. Competition USDT is also a big player that could still de-throne USDC and even take market share. And where there’s money to be made, there will be plenty of new competitors. I like the fact that USDC is already established and has regulatory compliance though. In some ways, I see USDT and USDC as the Visa and Mastercard of the future. Yields Most of USDC’s business, right now, relies on receiving interest from yields. As yields come down, earnings will decrease. Whereas a company like Visa commands a 70% EBITDA margin, Circle’s margins are much smaller once we account for costs and the revenue share. Arguably, a quick move down in yields in the next year could even make the company unprofitable again. Final Thoughts The stablecoin market is on the verge of making a major disruption to money and finance. Not only for FX transactions, but potentially for so much more, including potentially the whole payment market, worth over $5 trillion by 2030 . USDC is very well positioned to benefit, but the valuation is already very high for a company that has to pay out half its revenue to Coinbase and is very dependent on yields. Nonetheless, I want some exposure to this company, and will be looking to buy further as the stock dips.",CRCL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|USDC,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-20 14:00:00

Renowned as a pioneer in crypto regulation, Wyoming is home to many forward-thinking policymakers and entrepreneurs who recognize the incredible potential of the technology. Wyoming’s commitment to innovation is both visible and extensive. The state has enacted over 30 crypto-specific laws, ranging from the formal recognition of digital assets as property, to the establishment of a dedicated fintech sandbox, to protections against compelled disclosure of private keys. This trail-blazing approach to crypto regulation quickly caught our attention and put the Equality State on the map as a crypto hub. These innovative laws also inspired our early investment in Wyoming’s growing digital asset ecosystem. In 2021, to celebrate our 10th anniversary, we awarded a $300,000 grant to the University of Wyoming in support of educational initiatives preparing students for the fast-growing crypto economy. Wyoming U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis and Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi We have also sponsored the Wyoming Blockchain Stampede and Hackathon at UW, helping turn the campus into a hotbed of real-world crypto experimentation. These investments in the state crypto ecosystem have further deepened our presence in Wyoming. Building on that foundation, last year we co-hosted the first-ever Wyoming Blockchain Symposium in Jackson Hole. The event brought together 250 leading builders, investors, and policymakers to catalyze forward-thinking crypto regulation, foster institutional understanding of the asset class and create a more decentralized financial system. Wyoming’s pro-crypto environment made it a uniquely well-situated backdrop for these important conversations. Now, almost four years after our initial interest in Wyoming, it’s time to further deepen our local presence by setting down roots in Cheyenne. This move doesn’t change our globally distributed and remote-first workforce, it is recognition of the pro-crypto policymakers and constructive regulations that have made us feel at home. From Senator Cynthia Lummis’ tireless advocacy on behalf of Bitcoin and the crypto industry, to the numerous state laws that drive responsible innovation, Wyoming has proven there is no state better suited for Kraken’s headquarters. “Wyoming has been at the forefront of digital asset policy for nearly a decade and has created the perfect environment for digital asset companies to thrive,” said Lummis. “Kraken’s decision to relocate to the Equality State is a testament to Wyoming’s forward-thinking approach and reinforces Wyoming’s position as America’s premier crypto hub.” Stay tuned as we continue to innovate, evolve, and redefine the future of money and finance, now from Cheyenne, Wyoming.

While analysts are divided on the direction of this explosion, the Bitcoin community is also divided. Bitcoin: $94K or $114K? According to a recent poll by crypto analyst Matthew Hyland, the community is divided between $94,000 and $114,000 for the Bitcoin price. According to the survey results, where the community is almost evenly divided, 50.2 percent of respondents expect a decrease to $94,000, while 49.8 percent expect an increase to $114,000. Bitcoin is trading at around $104,460, according to CoinMarketCap data. According to the survey results, a drop to $94,000 for Bitcoin means a 0% decrease, while a rise to $114,000 means a gain of approximately 9%.

According to a Reuters report published Wednesday, Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong said issuing a won-denominated stablecoin could unintentionally drive up demand for dollar-based stablecoins, complicating the country’s efforts to manage its forex balance. “Issuing won-based stablecoin could make it easier to exchange them with dollar stablecoin rather than working to reduce use of dollar stablecoin,” Rhee said during a press conference. “That in turn could increase demand for dollar stablecoin and make it difficult for us to manage forex.” The comments come at a sensitive time for South Korea’s economy. Data from the Bank of Korea shows that the nation’s forex reserves dropped by $11 billion in just six months — from $415.6 billion at the end of December 2023 to $404.6 billion at the end of May 2024. South Korea President Lee Advances Pro-Crypto Regulatory Framework Rhee’s remarks follow a broader national shift toward crypto innovation under South Korea’s newly elected president, Lee Jae-myung. Fulfilling campaign promises, President Lee’s administration is actively pursuing regulatory reforms to establish South Korea as a more crypto-friendly jurisdiction. On June 10, the ruling Democratic Party introduced the Digital Asset Basic Act. The bill proposes allowing firms with at least $368,000 in equity to issue stablecoins, provided they maintain adequate reserves to support redemptions and receive approval from the Financial Services Commission (FSC). The FSC is also reviewing the fee structures of local exchanges as part of Lee’s initiative to reduce trading costs, especially for younger retail investors. These regulatory moves aim to promote local stablecoin alternatives while safeguarding against financial instability and capital outflows. Global Stablecoin Market Still Dollar-Dominated Globally, the stablecoin market remains heavily skewed toward U.S. dollar-backed tokens. Tether (USDT) leads with a market cap of $156 billion, followed by Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) at $61 billion, according to DefiLlama. Still, alternatives are gaining ground. Circle’s euro-backed stablecoin, EURC, has seen a surge in interest, with its market cap rising 156% since the start of 2024 to reach $203 million. Circle’s momentum received an additional boost after U.S. lawmakers signaled likely approval of the GENIUS Act — a bill aimed at regulating the stablecoin industry.

In a strongly worded letter seen by the Financial Times , the broadcaster demands that Perplexity halt all scraping of BBC articles, erase any existing copies, and submit “a proposal for financial compensation.” Failure to comply, the BBC says, will result in an injunction to stop the startup from using its material. BBC demands an injunction from Perplexity This is the first time the BBC has formally moved to defend its content against an AI outfit. Perplexity , based in San Francisco, doesn’t build its own language models like OpenAI or Google. Instead, it taps into existing ones, serving as a front‑end that pulls data, sometimes verbatim, from sites across the web. The BBC insists that Perplexity’s “default AI model” has been trained on entire chunks of its journalism, crossing from legitimate innovation into copyright infringement. “Perplexity’s tool directly competes with the BBC’s own services, circumventing the need for users to access those services,” said the BBC in their letter to the AI firm. “It is therefore highly damaging to the BBC, injuring the BBC’s reputation with audiences — including UK licence fee-payers who fund the BBC — and undermining their trust in the BBC.” BBC letter. Addressed to Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, the BBC’s missive reveals evidence suggesting wholesale copying of BBC text into the startup’s AI training sets. The broadcaster wants the scraping to stop right away and for the firm to delete any cached BBC content. If Perplexity does not comply, the BBC says it will pursue a court‑ordered injunction, and possibly damages for unauthorized use of its intellectual property. Perplexity has pushed back, calling the BBC’s claims “manipulative and opportunistic.” The startup argues it merely provides an interface for existing models and points the finger at model providers rather than itself. In its statement to the FT, Perplexity accused the BBC of misunderstanding technology , the internet and IP law. BBC joins other publishers clashing with AI firms The BBC’s legal threat arrives as UK regulators consider a so‑called “opt‑out” regime that would allow AI firms to scrape copyrighted work unless publishers explicitly object. Media leaders, including BBC Director‑General Tim Davie, have warned that such a system would drain the £125 billion creative industry of its value. “We need to protect our national intellectual property.” Davie. “If we drift on, we will be in crisis,” Davie proclaimed at a recent conference. Other publishers are already taking a stand. In October, the New York Times (NYT) issued a cease‑and‑desist order to Perplexity, demanding it stop using NYT content in its AI models. Dow Jones, owner of The Wall Street Journal, filed a lawsuit accusing Perplexity of “massive illegal copying” and “free‑riding” on its journalism. The BBC itself has begun registering its news site content in the United States to claim statutory damages for unauthorized use. In response to mounting pressure, Perplexity launched a revenue‑sharing program, but many argue it comes too late. Major outlets like the Financial Times, Axel Springer, Hearst and News Corp have all signed licensing deals with OpenAI. Reuters agreed terms with Meta, while the Daily Mail’s parent struck a pact with ProRata.ai. Perplexity, however, remains without such formal arrangements. At the heart of the debate is a fundamental question: should AI developers freely mine the web for data, or must they pay for every byte of protected content? Proponents of open scraping argue that AI advancement depends on unfettered access to online information. Critics counter that unlicensed data harvesting undermines the viability of professional journalism. As the BBC and Perplexity prepare for what could become a landmark court fight, the outcome may rewrite the rules of engagement between AI and content owners.

Ever wonder who holds large stashes of cryptocurrencies for the long haul, not just for trading? We’ve got some interesting news straight from the heart of the Ethereum ecosystem that highlights a significant trend. Recent reports, initially shared via Cointelegraph on X, indicate that a group of 38 specific entities holding strategic ETH reserves have collectively seen the value of their holdings surpass the remarkable mark of $3 billion. This isn’t just idle news; it points towards growing confidence and long-term strategic positioning within the Ethereum network. What Exactly Are Strategic ETH Reserves? When we talk about strategic reserves in the context of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, we’re generally referring to significant amounts of the asset held not for immediate trading or liquidity provision, but for longer-term purposes related to the network’s health, development, or the entity’s specific mission. These aren’t your average individual investor’s holdings. Think of them like a company’s treasury reserves or a government’s gold reserves – assets held for stability, future investment, or as a store of value. For Ethereum, these reserves can be held by various types of entities: Foundations: Like the Ethereum Foundation itself, which uses ETH to fund development, research, and ecosystem growth. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): Many DAOs hold native tokens, including ETH, in their treasuries to fund operations, grant programs, or future protocol upgrades. Corporations: A growing number of companies are exploring or already holding crypto, including ETH, on their balance sheets as a treasury asset. Investment Funds/Trusts: While some funds trade actively, others accumulate and hold for long-term appreciation or strategic influence. The key differentiator is the intent: holding for strategic, long-term goals rather than short-term profit taking. Why Do Entities Accumulate Strategic Reserves? There are several compelling reasons why foundations, DAOs, and other entities choose to build up strategic reserves of Ethereum: Funding Development & Ecosystem Growth: For entities like the Ethereum Foundation or protocol DAOs, ETH reserves are crucial for funding core development, security audits, research, and grants for projects building on Ethereum. It’s the fuel for future innovation. Long-Term Alignment: Holding ETH aligns the entity’s financial interests with the long-term success and value appreciation of the Ethereum network. Participation in Governance: While Ethereum’s core protocol governance isn’t token-based, many related protocols and DAOs operating on Ethereum use token-based governance where holding ETH (or related tokens) can provide influence. Store of Value: Recognizing Ethereum’s position as a leading blockchain platform, some entities may hold ETH as a digital store of value, similar to holding Bitcoin or gold. Future Operational Costs: Reserves can be used to cover future operational expenses, legal costs, or unexpected challenges. Staking Yield: With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake, holding ETH allows entities to participate in staking, earning yield that can further fund their activities or grow the reserve. These reasons collectively contribute to a picture of entities committed to Ethereum’s future, backing that commitment with significant capital. Over $3 Billion: What Does This Mean for Ethereum? The fact that 38 entities now hold over $3 billion in Ethereum strategic reserves is highly significant. Here’s why: Signal of Confidence: It demonstrates strong, long-term confidence in Ethereum’s technology, its ecosystem, and its future prospects from a substantial number of key players. These aren’t small amounts; they represent serious commitments. Reduced Selling Pressure: Assets held strategically are typically not intended for immediate sale. This removes a significant amount of ETH from potential circulating supply that could otherwise be traded, potentially reducing sell pressure on the market. Ecosystem Health Indicator: The ability of foundations and DAOs to build and maintain large treasuries suggests a healthy and well-funded ecosystem capable of supporting ongoing development and innovation. Validation of Ethereum’s Role: Surpassing the $3 billion mark across these entities underscores Ethereum’s established position as a foundational layer for the decentralized web and a key asset in the digital economy. This milestone isn’t just a number; it’s a barometer reflecting the conviction within the ecosystem and beyond regarding Ethereum’s enduring value. Implications for the Institutional Crypto Landscape The growth in institutional crypto holdings, particularly in assets like Ethereum, is a major narrative in the current market cycle. While the 38 entities mentioned might include native crypto organizations (like DAOs), the trend towards significant strategic reserves is closely linked to the broader institutional interest. As more traditional institutions, corporations, and even sovereign funds explore or enter the crypto space, understanding how large entities manage and hold crypto assets becomes crucial. The strategic reserve model is one way this is happening. Consider the parallels: Corporate Treasuries: Companies holding Bitcoin or Ethereum on their balance sheets. Investment Funds: Funds with long-term mandates accumulating positions. Tech Companies: Firms building Web3 products needing significant ETH for operations or investment in the ecosystem. The $3 billion in strategic ETH reserves held by these 38 entities can be seen as a microcosm of this larger trend. It highlights that sophisticated players are not just looking at short-term gains but are positioning themselves for the long-term evolution of the digital asset space, with Ethereum as a central component. The Broader Crypto Market Impact While this news is specific to Ethereum, it has ripple effects across the entire crypto market . Large strategic holdings in a major asset like ETH signal maturity and confidence in the asset class as a whole. Here’s how it impacts the wider market sentiment: Increased Legitimacy: Significant holdings by multiple entities, especially if some are perceived as ‘institutional,’ add legitimacy to cryptocurrencies as a serious asset class. Potential for Stability: Large reserves held off-market can contribute to reduced volatility compared to scenarios where all supply is actively traded. Benchmarking: The strategies employed by these large holders can become benchmarks or indicators for other potential entrants into the crypto space. Ecosystem Interconnectedness: Ethereum’s health and funding directly impact numerous protocols and applications built on it, influencing the broader DeFi, NFT, and Web3 landscapes.

US stock market to open after holiday Source: TradingView There was no trading on the US stock market on Thursday for Juneteenth National Independence Day. Therefore, it will be very interesting to see how the market reacts to developments on the Israel/Iran situation and the latest pronouncements from the Federal Reserve FOMC meeting which wrapped up on Wednesday. The weekly chart for the S&P 500 shows the spectacular v-shaped recovery after the Trump tariffs collapse. However, having got back to the major 6,000 point resistance level, it could be that the recovery is running out of steam.

Source: TradingView In the short-term time frame for $BTC it can be seen that the price has just risen above the $106,000 resistance. If it can also pierce through the descending trendline, this would leave the path open for the bulls to attempt to lift the price above the last swing high at $109,000. This isn’t to say that the price will carry on back to the all-time high, but rather that the ‘chopsolidation’ can continue, until such time as things start to improve geopolitically or economically, or until the all-important force of global liquidity drives assets higher again.

This is hugely critical for bullish price action going forward. If, by the end of Sunday, this indicator is still posturing upwards, and better still, if it manages to cross back above the slow (orange) indicator line, positive price momentum can continue to flow into Bitcoin, potentially providing the fuel to take the price up past the $112,000 high and into further price discovery.

As market optimism heightens in anticipation of the approval of multiple altcoin-based ETFs , the bullish outlook for alternative coins has intensified. However, a market expert at Weiss Crypto suggests that market expectations might not be met in the near term as approval dates might be shifted to the final quarter of the year. Despite the possibility of an extension in approval date, the expert maintains that the coming months will be pivotal for the cryptocurrency market, particularly with the arrival of new institutional players. “ETF summer” might turn into “ETF autumn” . Either way, the next few months could reshape how institutions access crypto.” The expert wrote. According to data from the crypto ratings firm, the odds of an ETF approval in October have skyrocketed for five leading altcoins. For SOL and LTC, the odds are at 90%, while the odds for XRP, DOGE, and ADA are at 85%, 80%, and 75%, respectively. Notably, demand for SOL ETFs has continued to soar, with Coinshares, a European-based asset manager, joining seven issuers to file for a SOL ETF. According to the filing, the Coinshares ETF will track the price of the SOL token, which is set to go live on the Nasdaq stock market.

As markets resumed on Friday following the Juneteenth break on Thursday, June 19, the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened just 150 points higher. Meanwhile, the benchmark S&P 500 hovered near the flatline, up 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.6%. President Trump’s message and fresh comments on a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut seemed to catalyze the upward move. Middle East conflict: Trump offers deadline The overriding sentiment revolved around geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, with Israel and Iran continuing strikes against each other. Stocks had plummeted on Wednesday after Trump indicated the United States was set to enter the conflict. However, the White House released a statement on Trump’s latest move that held off any attacks on Iran to allow for negotiations. His diplomatic effort includes a two-week deadline for Tehran, while reports suggest Israel’s strike on Iran may intensify over the weekend. “If Trump does end up deciding to attack Iran he will most likely wait until after 4PM ET on Friday because he wants the shock of bombing to be diminished as much as possible by market open on Monday,” said Jesse Cohen, a global markets analyst. Stocks and cryptocurrencies have swung amid the seesawing situation. Bitcoin ( BTC ) rose from lows of $104k to above $106k. Despite geopolitical risks, analysts at QCP say volatility is not “gone”. “Markets are in limbo. Participants are digesting geopolitical headlines and recalibrating risk amid rising tensions. Volatility may just be taking a breather, not gone,” QCP posted on X.

Away from the geopolitical tensions, fresh focus is on the Federal Reserve after Chair Jerome Powell left interest rates unchanged following the Fed’s meeting on Wednesday. Trump has insisted the Fed has to cut rates , and while investors see a high chance of rate cuts in September, latest reports suggest the central bank could act sooner. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, in an interview with CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Friday, noted that the Fed could consider cutting interest rates as early as July. “I think we’re in the position that we could do this as early as July. That would be my view, whether the committee would go along with it or not,” Waller said.

In an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box , Waller said policymakers should not wait for economic conditions to deteriorate before acting. “I think we’re in the position that we could do this and as early as July,” Waller remarked, hinting at a potential rate cut at the July 29–30 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. “That would be my view, whether the committee would go along with it or not.” Waller’s remarks follow Wednesday’s decision by the FOMC to hold its benchmark interest rate at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the fourth consecutive pause since the last cut in December 2024. Trump turns up heat on Powell and the Fed President Trump, who appointed Jerome Powell as Fed Chair and nominated Waller during his first term, has argued that higher rates are choking economic growth and driving up the cost of servicing the $36 trillion national debt. He has called for at least a two percentage point reduction, even suggesting rates should fall 2.5 points below their current level. Powell has so far resisted those demands, but his grip may be loosening. Still, the Fed chair insists that the central bank should proceed cautiously. Waller’s recent comments show there’s an internal push for at least a modest rate cut, which will be the first since Trump’s return to the White House. “Why do we want to wait until we actually see a crash before we start cutting rates?” he asked. “I’m all in favor of saying maybe we should start thinking about cutting the policy rate at the next meeting.” Fed governors ‘divided’ over rate cuts Although Waller is a voting member of the FOMC, Wednesday’s rate decision was unanimous. According to the Fed’s “dot plot,” which outlines individual policymakers’ forecasts, seven of 19 officials expect no change in rates through the end of the year. Yet, two anticipate a single cut, while 10 project two or more reductions in 2025. There could be a significant split within the central bank. According to the prediction platform Polymarket, there is an 89% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in July, with only 10% betting on a 25 basis point cut. Fed July decision prediction. Source: Polymarket Waller admitted that although he prefers a rate cut, they should be gradual. “You’d want to start slow and bring them down, just to make sure that there’s no big surprises. But start the process,” he continued, “We’ve been on pause for six months to wait and see, and so far, the data has been fine.” Powell: Tariffs could spike inflation During a press conference on Wednesday, Powell claimed that new trade barriers are beginning to push up consumer prices. “We’re beginning to see some effects,” he reckoned. “Inflation is creeping up,” and recent data shows that “near-term measures of inflation expectations have moved up” across consumer and market surveys. The Fed chair directly blamed Trump’s tariffs as the culprit, saying that survey respondents view them as the driver behind inflationary pressures. Still, Waller pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause lasting damage. He argued that their effect should be “a one-off level effect and not cause persistent inflation.” “We believe we can stay in wait-and-see mode,” Powell told the press in his address. He mentioned that the inflation data has shown minimal pass-through so far because companies are still working through inventory stockpiled ahead of tariff implementation. Weak consumer demand has also limited pricing power, providing the Fed with some room to maneuver. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

You might also like: Why Ethereum should not be ignored amidst massive institutional capital inflows What is Status? Status falls into the category of desktop and mobile operating systems, as well as a decentralized browser with a messaging feature. As a result, Status lets you communicate with a network from anywhere at any time. It was first made available in June of 2017. You can access all Ethereum decentralized applications, or DApps, from an app that is installed on your smartphone or tablet, thanks to this light client Ethereum ( ETH ) node. This implies that users can access decentralized apps, such as a cryptocurrency wallet, and send encrypted communications through the Status interface with ease. Now let’s discuss SNT price prediction for this year and in the coming years as well. Status price prediction What can be a realistic projection for the SNT token? Let’s dive into the SNT price prediction for 2025 and 2030. Status coin price prediction: short-term outlook According to CoinCodex’s Status price prediction for the near future, the token is projected to rise by 17.27% and reach $0.058215 by July 19, 2025. As of June. 20th, 2025, the overall sentiment of the SNT price outlook is bullish, with 25 technical analysis indicators showing bullish signals, 4 indicating bearish trends, and 6 indicators showing neutral forecasts. Status price prediction 2025 For the remaining months of 2025, DigitalCoinPrice predicts that the SNT token’s price could fluctuate between $0.0454 and $0.11, and may likely hold a yearly average of $0.11. CoinCodex projects that the SNT token can trade in the price channel of $0.04964 and $0.058246 in 2025. While the general sentiment in the financial markets is that 2025 will be the year of the bull, it is important to understand that this prediction also has a chance of being wrong. BTC has already breached the $100k mark, and there is a possibility that it may be at the top of this bull cycle. Hence, it is advised to do your research before investing in SNT or any other cryptocurrency with the hopes of gaining on your investment in 2025. Status price prediction 2030 As per CoinCodex’s Status crypto price prediction for 2030, SNT’s price could vary between $0.086751 and $0.09243. DigitalCoinPrice expects that SNT’s price could climb to $0.24 or $0.28 by the end of 2030. Before trusting any source that is trying to predict the SNT price prediction for 2030, you should understand that it is a cryptocurrency and, like all other tokens, the SNT token’s price can be highly volatile. 2030 is five years away, and many cryptocurrencies can become obsolete in that time. This is why it is hard to give a realistic price prediction for any token, including SNT. A great way for SNT to survive these five years and continue its ascent in the crypto market is to continue building its blockchain technology and partner with key players in the digital crypto space. You should research and keep yourself updated with the latest developments in the upcoming years to make an informed investment decision in the SNT token.

Before investing in any cryptocurrency, including SNT, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Additionally, it is worth noting that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market can change rapidly, and a token that was once considered a future investment may also be delisted from major exchanges. Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals before having any price expectations for the future of the SNT token. Will Status go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is challenging to predict the exact value of the SNT token, it is essential to watch for potential buying factors that may include new partnerships, increased token holders, or viral campaigns. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for Status price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious, as no one can accurately predict how high or low SNT can go. Should I invest in Status? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or relying on a Status price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks associated with market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are a highly speculative investment, and their success not only relies on market volatility but also on the constant and sustainable growth of their community. Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals, which may very well decide the future of the SNT token. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Currency movements, particularly for major pairs, reflect shifts in global economic sentiment, central bank policies, and geopolitical events – factors that can indirectly influence the flow of capital into or out of riskier assets like crypto. Today, we delve into a specific view from a major financial institution: UBS’s outlook on the EUR/SEK forecast , highlighting potential upside risks for this specific currency pair analysis . UBS, a global leader in financial services, has recently shared its perspective on the Euro (EUR) versus the Swedish Krona (SEK) exchange rate. Their analysis points towards potential upside movement for the EUR/SEK pair. This means UBS analysts believe the Euro could strengthen relative to the Swedish Krona in the foreseeable future. Understanding the reasons behind such a forecast requires looking at the economic landscapes of the Eurozone and Sweden, as well as broader market dynamics. Why UBS Sees Potential Upside for EUR/SEK A forecast predicting upside risks for a currency pair isn’t made in isolation. It stems from careful consideration of various economic indicators, central bank stances, and market positioning. UBS’s view on the UBS EUR/SEK outlook is likely influenced by several key factors: Monetary Policy Divergence: Differences in how the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Riksbank (Sweden’s central bank) approach interest rates and quantitative easing can significantly impact currency valuations. If UBS anticipates the ECB maintaining a tighter stance relative to the Riksbank, or vice versa in a way that favors the Euro, it could support an upside view for EUR/SEK. Economic Growth Outlooks: The relative health and growth trajectory of the Eurozone economy compared to Sweden’s economy play a crucial role. Stronger growth prospects in the Eurozone could attract investment, increasing demand for the Euro. Inflation Trends: Inflation rates and expectations in both regions influence central bank decisions and purchasing power. Diverging inflation paths can create pressure on the exchange rate. Global Risk Sentiment: The Swedish Krona is sometimes considered more sensitive to global risk appetite than the Euro. In periods of heightened global uncertainty or risk aversion, investors might prefer the relative safety of the Euro, potentially leading to EUR/SEK upside. Conversely, in risk-on environments, the SEK might perform better. UBS’s view on global sentiment would factor into their Forex market outlook . Technical Factors: Chart patterns, support and resistance levels, and trading volumes also inform institutional forecasts. UBS’s analysis would incorporate technical indicators alongside fundamental data. What Does “Upside Risks” Mean for the Currency Pair? When analysts refer to “upside risks” for a currency pair like EUR/SEK, they are suggesting that the probability or potential magnitude of the pair moving higher is greater than it moving lower. It doesn’t necessarily mean they predict a straight line ascent, but rather that the balance of factors leans towards a stronger Euro against the Swedish Krona . This implies that traders and investors should be mindful of potential appreciation in the exchange rate. For instance, if the current EUR/SEK rate is around 11.50, an upside risk forecast suggests that a move towards 11.60, 11.70, or even higher is considered more likely or has a higher potential payoff than a move towards 11.40 or lower, based on UBS’s assessment. These forecasts often come with specific target levels or ranges, though the core message is the directional bias. Actionable Insights from the UBS EUR/SEK View While this is an institutional forecast and not financial advice, understanding the rationale behind it can provide valuable insights for those involved in the Forex market outlook or even those tracking global economic health. Here are some potential takeaways: Monitor Key Data: Keep an eye on economic releases from both the Eurozone (e.g., inflation data, GDP growth, ECB announcements) and Sweden (e.g., inflation, GDP, Riksbank meetings). Surprises in this data can either reinforce or challenge the UBS forecast. Watch Central Bank Commentary: Statements and forward guidance from the ECB and Riksbank are critical. Any shifts in their expected policy paths can quickly alter the attractiveness of their respective currencies. Assess Global Sentiment: Pay attention to broader market sentiment regarding risk. A significant shift towards risk aversion or risk-on trading could impact the SEK’s performance relative to the EUR. Consider Positioning: While not a direct recommendation, understanding that a major bank sees upside risks can inform how traders might approach positioning in the EUR/SEK pair, potentially looking for opportunities consistent with an upward trend, while always managing risk. It’s important to remember that Forex markets are influenced by a multitude of factors, and even well-researched forecasts carry risk. Market conditions can change rapidly based on unforeseen events. Comparing Economic Headwinds: Eurozone vs. Sweden To grasp the potential for divergence driving the currency pair analysis , let’s briefly compare some economic aspects often considered by analysts like those at UBS: Both the Eurozone and Sweden face common global challenges, such as supply chain issues, energy price volatility, and the lingering effects of recent global events. However, their specific vulnerabilities and policy responses can differ. For example, the structure of their economies (e.g., reliance on exports, specific industries) and their sensitivity to interest rate changes can vary. The housing market in Sweden, for instance, has been a point of focus, and its performance can impact the Riksbank’s decisions. In the Eurozone, the diverse economic conditions across member states present a different set of challenges for the ECB. UBS’s forecast likely weighs these specific economic nuances, concluding that the balance of factors currently favors a strengthening Euro relative to the Swedish Krona . Conclusion: Navigating the EUR/SEK Landscape UBS’s view that the EUR/SEK pair faces potential upside risks provides a specific angle on the current Forex market outlook . This perspective is grounded in an analysis of monetary policy, economic fundamentals, and market dynamics in both the Eurozone and Sweden. For anyone tracking currency markets, this serves as a signal to pay close attention to data and central bank actions that could validate or contradict this forecast. While the world of Forex might seem distant from the fast-paced crypto space, understanding these fundamental market analyses helps build a more complete picture of the global financial environment.

In a press release on June 20, Parataxis Holdings LLC announced its acquisition of a controlling stake in Bridge Biotherapeutics for KRW 25 billion (about $18 million). The deal, pending shareholder approval, will see the biotech outfit rebranded as Parataxis Korea, a publicly traded, Bitcoin ( BTC )-native treasury company listed on South Korea’s KOSDAQ exchange. Edward Chin, Parataxis’ founder, and Andrew Kim, a partner at its affiliate Parataxis Capital, will join the board, with Kim stepping in as CEO.

Given the strategic nature of BTC on the global stage and its finite supply, we believe that building and growing a company like Parataxis Korea and accumulating a BTC treasury will benefit our shareholders as well as the country over the long run,” Chin stated. According to Parataxis executives, the soon-to-be-renamed successor of Bridge Biotherapeutics will be structured as a hybrid to retain its biotech arm while adding a BTC-centric financial strategy layered on top. James Jungkue Lee, co-founder of Bridge Bio, will lead the core biotech business. Parataxis is joining an established movement. The company points to Strategy’s massive 582,000 BTC treasury and Metaplanet’s 10,000 BTC holdings as successful precedents for their Korean venture. And the trend is growing: according to Standard Chartered, at least 61 publicly listed firms not native to crypto have adopted Bitcoin treasury strategies in recent months, a number that has doubled since April, underscoring how BTC is emerging as an alternative, not speculative, reserve asset for established companies. For all the enthusiasm, the strategy isn’t without risks. Charles Schwab’s recent analysis warns that companies overexposed to Bitcoin risk liquidity crunches if prices plummet. Standard Chartered estimates a drop below $90,000 could wipe out half of corporate BTC treasuries.

This prolonged consolidation comes despite XRP maintaining a relatively high open interest of $3.89 billion, suggesting market participants are positioned but unwilling to commit further capital. XRP’s stagnant movement is being weighed down by declining onchain activity on the XRP Ledger, bearish momentum signals, and the inability to push past key technical levels. The resistance range between $2.22 and $2.40 is acting as a firm barrier for bulls, where the major simple moving averages currently converge. Currently, the coin is trading at $2.17. Source: CoinMarketCap Unless XRP breaks above this cluster of trendlines, price may continue to trade sideways or head lower, a pattern already seen twice this year. XRP ledger activity hits multi-month lows A significant factor contributing to XRP’s muted price action is a marked decline in network usage. The number of new addresses on the XRP Ledger has fallen steeply from a 2025 peak of 15,823 on January 16 to just 3,500 as of June 5. Similarly, daily active addresses (DAAs) on the network have plummeted to 34,360, down from 577,000 recorded only days earlier. Lower network participation typically correlates with weaker demand for a cryptocurrency. With fewer new wallets joining the ecosystem and a sharp decline in DAAs, transactional activity on the chain has thinned out, leading to reduced liquidity and lower trading volume. Historically, when XRP Ledger activity drops, price consolidation or decline tends to follow. This reduction in user activity reflects a subdued investor sentiment, limiting upside momentum for XRP. Open interest down 30% from January peak XRP’s open interest (OI), which tracks the total value of open futures and options contracts, has dropped significantly from earlier in the year. XRP OI fell by 30%—from $5.53 billion to $3.89 billion—indicating that traders are closing positions as bullish momentum fades. This reduction in OI mirrors a similar pattern seen earlier in the year. Between January and April, XRP saw a drop in OI that preceded a price slide from $3.40 to $1.61. The current OI decline suggests that traders expect more downside or are waiting for clearer signals before re-entering the market. If the OI continues to decrease alongside weak network metrics, XRP may find it difficult to sustain even the current range, let alone attempt a move toward $3.00. Technical indicators highlight bearish risks XRP’s price continues to hover below key technical resistance levels. Data shows that the token remains under pressure beneath the $2.22–$2.40 band, where all the main SMAs intersect. This confluence of resistance has repeatedly capped upward momentum since April. The relative strength index (RSI) has also cooled off. After reaching an overbought 81 on January 20, it has now slipped to 51, suggesting weakening bullish momentum and increased selling pressure. If bears continue to dominate, XRP could retest lower support zones at $2.01, $1.90, or even $1.55. Technical analysts have also identified a descending triangle pattern on the chart, which, if confirmed, could lead to a breakdown toward $1.20—a 45% drop from current levels—should the support at $2.00 fail to hold. However, some historical comparisons offer a more optimistic outlook. In 2017, XRP consolidated below major resistance levels for nearly 200 days before breaking out to new highs. Some traders believe that a similar breakout above $3.00 could open the path toward $10.00 if macro and technical conditions align.

On Friday, the Nordic country’s government said it aims to conserve electricity for other industries. The Norwegian government revealed plans in April 2024 to regulate crypto mining activities in the country by restricting data centers. Norway’s Digitalization Minister Karianne Tung and Energy Minister Terje Aasland acknowledged that the initiative is driven by the government’s desire to control and limit undesirable projects, such as crypto mining. Norway intensifies efforts to limit crypto mining Norway will become the first nation in Europe to implement comprehensive regulations for data centers, focusing on controlling energy-intensive activities like cryptocurrency mining. The regulation requires crypto mining operators to register with local authorities and disclose the service offered. Tung argued that the government requires a registration obligation for those behind the data center, the center’s manager, and an obligation to state which services are offered. He added that the purpose of regulating the crypto mining industry is so that the government can shut down projects it does not want. The Norwegian government said the regulation aims to empower the relevant authorities to approve or reject projects based on their social and environmental impact. Aasland maintained the importance of promoting socially beneficial data centers. In Norway, crypto mining is considered incompatible with the country’s environmental goals. Aasland issued concerns about the industry’s significant greenhouse gas emissions. The government also disclosed that a temporary ban on data centers that mine crypto could be introduced during the autumn of 2025. “The Labour Party government has a clear intention to limit the mining of cryptocurrency in Norway as much as possible. Cryptocurrency mining is very power-intensive and generates little in the way of jobs and income for the local community.” -Karianne Tung, Minister of Digitalization and Public Administration in Norway. The Norwegian government also proposed in October 2022 to abolish the reduced electricity tax rate for data centers, effectively subjecting mining electricity to standard rates. Finance Minister Trygve Slagsvold Vedum emphasized the importance of prioritizing electricity for societal needs amid the growing prevalence of crypto mining. Vedum said the proposed changes were projected to generate additional revenue of 150 million NOK (approximately $13.61 million), with 110 million NOK expected to be realized in 2023. According to Cambridge University CCAF’s Bitcoin Mining Map data from January 2022, Norwegian Bitcoin miners contribute approximately 0.74% to Bitcoin’s hash rate, which measures the computational power dedicated to mining. Norway also ranks among the top in electricity generation per capita globally, largely due to its mountainous terrain and wet climate, facilitating the development of numerous hydropower plants. In 2021, hydropower contributed 92% of the country’s electricity generation, with an additional 7% from wind power. Banning crypto mining causes a surge in electricity prices In October last year, residents of Hasdek, a Norwegian municipality that pushed to shut down a local Bitcoin mine, faced a spike in their electricity bills due to the lost revenue for the local power company. Climate tech venture capitalist Daniel Batten argued that when politicians turn against Bitcoin, the people suffer. Mayor of Hadsel, Kjell-Borge Freiberg, revealed on September 13 that the noise from the Bitcoin mining center was disturbing many residents in Hadsel. The mine’s closure – representing around 20% of electricity distribution provider Noranett’s income – meant local electricity bills would surge to compensate for the lost revenue. Noranett network manager Robin Jakobsen stated that there’s an impact when such a large individual customer switches off operation suddenly. He estimated that, following the adjustment, the average household in Hasdel could face an additional annual cost of between 2,500 and 3,000 Norwegian krone (roughly $235 to $280). Batten argued that it showed another example of how Bitcoin mining helps lower power prices for everyday people. The data center consumed roughly 80 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity annually, equivalent to the yearly usage of around 3,200 households. Freiberg revealed that Hasdel would seek new projects to offset the reduced electricity consumption following the mining center’s closure. In September 2022, locals in Sortland, another Norwegian municipality, complained about the noise of Bitcoin mining activity in the area. CEO at the local KryptoVault, Kjetil Hove Pettersen, acknowledged that it could be another case of media spin targeting Bitcoin.

For anyone following the market, understanding the underlying dynamics is crucial. A significant development reported by on-chain analytics firm Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) highlights a dramatic surge in Bitcoin’s weekly transaction fees. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a substantial increase that tells a story about the current state and future potential of the network and the asset itself. What’s Behind the Surge in Bitcoin Fees ? According to Sentora’s report shared via X, Bitcoin’s weekly fees skyrocketed to $6.8 million. This represents a staggering 105.8% increase compared to the previous week. Such a sharp rise in transaction costs on the network isn’t random; it’s typically a symptom of increased demand and network activity. When more people and institutions are transacting on the Bitcoin blockchain, the competition for block space increases, leading to higher fees as users prioritize faster confirmation times. Sentora attributed this surge primarily to two key factors: Regulatory Clarity: Increased clarity from regulatory bodies in various jurisdictions often boosts confidence among larger investors and institutions. This reduced uncertainty makes it easier and safer for them to engage with Bitcoin. High Institutional Demand: There has been a notable uptick in interest and investment from institutional players – hedge funds, asset managers, corporations, etc. These entities often make larger transactions, contributing significantly to network load and, consequently, fees. While the report specifically mentions these drivers, it’s also worth considering other potential contributors to increased network activity that could push up Bitcoin fees , such as the ongoing popularity of Ordinals or general speculative interest driving more transactions. Why is Bitcoin Leaving Exchanges a Big Deal? Complementing the data on fees is another crucial metric from the same period: $2.09 billion worth of Bitcoin exited centralized exchanges. This metric, part of comprehensive Bitcoin on-chain data , is often seen as a bullish signal by market analysts. Here’s why: Reduced Selling Pressure: Bitcoin held on exchanges is generally considered ‘hot’ supply, readily available to be sold onto the market. When a large amount leaves exchanges, it suggests these coins are being moved to cold storage, private wallets, or institutional custody solutions. This reduces the immediate supply available for selling. Long-Term Holding (HODLing): Moving Bitcoin off exchanges is a strong indicator that the holders intend to keep their coins for the long term, rather than trading them frequently. This ‘HODLing’ behavior is a hallmark of conviction in Bitcoin’s future value. Institutional Accumulation: Institutions acquiring large amounts of Bitcoin typically do not leave it on exchanges due to security and regulatory reasons. They move it to secure, regulated custody solutions. Large outflows are often correlated with periods of significant institutional buying and accumulation. The combination of rising fees and significant outflows from exchanges paints a picture of strong underlying demand and accumulation, particularly from entities likely prioritizing long-term investment over short-term trading. How Does Institutional Bitcoin Demand Shape the Market? The entry and increasing participation of institutions are transformative for the Bitcoin market. Their influence extends beyond simply buying large quantities. Institutional Bitcoin demand brings: Increased Capital Inflow: Institutions manage vast amounts of capital. Even a small allocation from large funds can represent billions of dollars flowing into Bitcoin. Market Validation: Institutional adoption lends legitimacy to Bitcoin as an asset class, potentially encouraging more conservative investors to consider it. Development of Infrastructure: To service institutional clients, financial firms build robust infrastructure for trading, custody, and research, further professionalizing the market. Potential for Reduced Volatility (Long Term): While initial large buys can cause price swings, institutions often have longer investment horizons than retail traders, potentially contributing to more stable holding patterns over time. The link between increased institutional activity and the observed on-chain metrics – higher fees reflecting more transactions (potentially large ones) and coins leaving exchanges for secure storage – is clear. Institutions aren’t just buying; they are actively using or securing the network, contributing to its economic activity and reducing readily available supply. Diving Deeper with Bitcoin On-Chain Data Understanding these dynamics relies heavily on Bitcoin on-chain data . This refers to all the information publicly available on the Bitcoin blockchain ledger. Every transaction, every address balance, every block mined – it’s all recorded and accessible. Analytics firms like Sentora specialize in processing this vast amount of data to derive meaningful insights. Key on-chain metrics that provide valuable context include: Metric What it Measures Significance (in this context) Transaction Fees Cost to send a transaction High fees suggest high network demand/congestion Exchange Balances Total BTC held on centralized exchanges Decreasing balances suggest accumulation and reduced selling pressure Active Addresses Number of unique addresses active on the network Indicates overall user activity and adoption Miner Revenue Total income for miners (block reward + fees) Higher fees increase miner profitability, contributing to network security The reported surge in Bitcoin fees and the significant amount of Bitcoin leaving exchanges are prime examples of how on-chain data provides a transparent look into the fundamental activity and sentiment within the network, often preceding or confirming trends seen in price charts. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends These specific Bitcoin metrics are part of broader Crypto market trends . The increased professionalization of the market, driven by regulatory developments and institutional interest, is a major theme. This contrasts with earlier cycles that were predominantly retail-driven. While high fees can be a positive signal for network health and miner revenue, they also present challenges for everyday users making smaller transactions. This highlights ongoing discussions around Bitcoin scalability solutions (like the Lightning Network) which aim to make smaller payments faster and cheaper off the main chain. For investors and enthusiasts, paying attention to on-chain data alongside price charts and news headlines offers a more holistic view of the market. It helps differentiate between speculative price movements and fundamental shifts in adoption and holding patterns. Actionable Insights from the Data What can you take away from this information? Stay Informed: Follow reliable sources for on-chain data analysis like Sentora (IntoTheBlock). Understand Fee Dynamics: If you need to make a Bitcoin transaction, be aware that fees fluctuate based on network congestion. Check current fee rates before sending. Look Beyond Price: While price is important, metrics like exchange flows and transaction counts offer deeper insights into market sentiment and potential future movements. Recognize Institutional Impact: Understand that institutional participation is a growing force shaping the market. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal? The simultaneous surge in weekly Bitcoin fees to $6.8 million (a 105.8% jump) and the significant outflow of $2.09 billion in Bitcoin leaving exchanges , as reported by Sentora, are powerful indicators. Driven by factors like regulatory clarity and robust Institutional Bitcoin demand , these metrics suggest a market characterized by high activity and strong conviction among holders, particularly larger players. This on-chain data paints a picture of accumulation rather than distribution, reducing potential selling pressure and reflecting increased fundamental use and long-term holding intent. While high fees can be a minor inconvenience for some users, they are a clear sign of a healthy, in-demand network. Coupled with the large outflows from exchanges, these metrics collectively provide compelling evidence of underlying strength and offer valuable insights into current Crypto market trends .

Norway is cracking down on energy-intensive crypto mining operations. On Friday, June 20, the Norwegian government announced a temporary ban on new data centers that mine crypto. The ban, which will take effect in August, is intended to curb the significant energy consumption associated with mining activities. “The Labour Party government has a clear intention to limit the mining of cryptocurrency in Norway as much as possible,” Minister for Digitalization and Public Administration Karianne Tung. The move is part of an ongoing crackdown on crypto mining in the country. In April, Norway introduced a bill to regulate its data centers, including those involved in crypto mining. Under the proposed law, data centers must register and disclose ownership information. Minister Tung stated plainly that the goal is to “close the door on the projects we do not want.” You might also like: Crypto firms in Norway’s wealth fund face ethics probe in 2025: report Norway becomes a hub for crypto mining Due to its cheap and abundant electricity, Norway has become a hub for crypto mining—particularly in the northern regions, where energy and real estate costs are even lower. According to Webopedia, Norway contributes 2% of the global Bitcoin (BTC) mining hash rate. For this reason, the mining operations require a significant amount of electricity. What is more, the government doesn’t believe that mining operations significantly contribute to the local economy and job creation. For this reason, the government wants to prioritize electricity usage for other sectors of the economy. In addition to its oil reserves in the North Sea, Norway benefits from significant hydropower capacity due to its geography.

Polygon collaborates with diverse industries to enhance adoption, focusing on NFT solutions and Ethereum scalability. Partnerships include Starbucks for an NFT loyalty program and collaborations with Adidas, Prada, and Disney to develop NFT offerings. Why is the POL price up today? Following overall selling demand in the market, POL price faced increased bearish pressure around the $0.2 peak. However, this triggered minor accumulation around recent lows, triggering a strong rebound. What is the POL price prediction for 2025? The Polygon price prediction for 2025 expects the POL price to record a maximum level of $1.57. Will POL price touch $1? Yes, POL price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2025. However, this depends on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will POL Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and POL gains regulatory recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2030. Is POL a good long-term investment? As Polygon continues to expand its offerings, it gains a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, POL can be a good long-term investment option.

Additionally, transfers related to P2P surged from the low of $3.3B to $4.7B in April. POL price prediction June 2025 Analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices in June month. We expect POL to record a minimum price of $0.17 and a maximum price of $0.35, with an average of $0.28 in June. POL Price Prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high POL Price Prediction June 2025 $0.17 $0.28 $0.35 POL price prediction 2025 Ethereum fees increase dramatically during a bull market, making it too expensive for regular cryptocurrency users. That’s why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon’s Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $0.15. It’s anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year.

The Norwegian government is signaling a major shift in its energy policy concerning cryptocurrency operations. Specifically, they are planning a temporary ban on the construction of new, high-energy crypto mining data centers . This move, reported by Odaily based on local sources, underscores a growing global tension between the energy demands of certain industries and the needs of the broader economy. Why is Norway Targeting Crypto Mining Data Centers? Norway, a nation known for its abundant hydropower, is taking this step primarily to reallocate precious electricity resources. The core reason behind the proposed ban is the high energy consumption associated with cryptocurrency mining, particularly for proof-of-work coins like Bitcoin. While mining operations consume significant amounts of power, the government reportedly views their local economic impact as minimal compared to other industries vying for the same energy supply. Think about it: Industries like manufacturing, traditional data centers supporting essential services, or even residential heating all require reliable and affordable electricity. As demand grows, prioritizing which sectors get access becomes crucial. Norway’s government seems to be making a clear choice here. What Does This Temporary Ban Entail? The proposed measure isn’t an immediate shutdown of existing facilities, but rather a pause on expansion. Here’s what we know: What: A ban on the construction of *new* data centers specifically intended for high-energy cryptocurrency mining. When: The ban is expected to come into effect in the fall of 2025. This gives the industry some lead time, but also sets a firm deadline for any planned new developments. Why: To limit the overall energy consumption of this specific industry and ensure sufficient electricity is available for sectors deemed to have greater local economic benefit. This focus on crypto mining data centers highlights the government’s view that while cryptocurrency might be a global phenomenon, the energy-intensive process of creating it within Norway’s borders doesn’t provide enough tangible benefits back to the local community or economy to justify its power demands, especially when other industries are energy-starved. The Broader Implications: Energy Consumption and the Future of Mining This decision by Norway adds to a growing list of countries and regions scrutinizing the energy consumption of crypto mining. We’ve seen similar discussions, regulations, and even outright bans in places like China and various US states. The narrative is consistent: the environmental and grid strain caused by massive power usage for mining is becoming a significant point of contention. For the crypto mining industry, this poses a challenge. It forces miners to consider locations with more favorable energy policies, potentially shifting operations to regions with surplus renewable energy or less stringent regulations. It also accelerates the debate around more energy-efficient consensus mechanisms, such as Proof-of-Stake, which require vastly less electricity. What’s Next for Norway Crypto Mining? While existing facilities may continue operating (for now), the door is closing on new large-scale expansions specifically for high-energy mining. The temporary ban signals that Norway is serious about managing its power grid and prioritizing energy use based on perceived economic and societal benefit. The duration of the ban remains ‘temporary,’ but the criteria for lifting it would likely involve a change in energy availability, a shift in the economic impact of mining, or perhaps technological advancements that drastically reduce energy consumption . For investors and operators in the space, Norway’s decision serves as a stark reminder that regulatory and energy-related risks are significant factors when considering mining operations globally. Access to affordable and sustainable electricity is not guaranteed and can be subject to sudden policy changes. In Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Energy and Digital Assets Norway’s planned temporary ban on new crypto mining data centers from Fall 2025 is a pivotal moment, emphasizing the global debate around the energy consumption of digital asset creation. By prioritizing its valuable electricity resources for industries deemed more beneficial to the local economy, Norway joins a growing trend of nations grappling with the power demands of mining. This move highlights the need for the crypto industry to continue innovating towards more sustainable practices and for operators to carefully evaluate the regulatory and energy landscape of potential locations. The future of Norway crypto mining , at least in terms of expansion, is now clearly linked to the nation’s strategic energy priorities.

46418829,https://timestabloid.com/?p=71730,1750433461,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Says the Next 90 Days Will Make XRP Millionaires. Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-the-next-90-days-will-make-xrp-millionaires-heres-why/,"Crypto analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO has made a bold claim: the next 90 days could mint a new wave of XRP millionaires. According to his recent post on X, XRP is currently following a parabolic “step-like” chart formation, specifically entering what he calls “base 3,” a historical precursor to explosive price moves. The analyst notes that the last time XRP completed this technical structure, it doubled in value within a very short timeframe. Now, with similar conditions aligning, Steph believes history may be about to repeat itself. The “Base 3” Breakout In technical analysis, parabolic patterns often form in steps or “bases” as an asset gathers momentum. Base 3, in this context, refers to a critical consolidation zone that occurs before a sharp vertical move. Steph is Crypto argues that XRP is once again at this phase, and if the pattern holds, the next price leg could be rapid and significant. The Next 90 Days Will Make #XRP Millionaires! pic.twitter.com/UZ8wcAQoN0 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) June 20, 2025 He draws comparisons to XRP’s behavior during two historical moments. The first occurred in late 2017 when the asset rallied from under $0.25 to over $3.00 in just weeks. The second took place between November 2024 and January 2025, when XRP surged from $0.51 to highs above $3.00—both times following similar parabolic structures. Current Price and Market Context As of report time, XRP is trading at $2.15, having consolidated within the $2.00–$2.20 range for several weeks. This extended sideways movement is precisely what Steph views as the “third base,” a necessary formation before a potential breakout. Market sentiment around XRP has remained cautiously optimistic. Investors are watching closely, not only because of the technical setup but also due to the larger macro landscape favoring altcoins. If XRP were to mirror its past rallies, a breakout from this consolidation could result in a swift price escalation. Bullish Sentiment Meets Regulatory Clarity XRP’s technical outlook is supported by growing clarity in its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. With Judge Torres previously ruling that XRP is not a security in programmatic sales and the recent expectation of a finalized penalty settlement, Ripple’s position in the U.S. market is strengthening. This renewed confidence among investors and institutions has led to increased liquidity and broader access via relistings on major exchanges. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In addition, Ripple continues to expand its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) services globally, further enhancing XRP’s utility as a bridge asset for cross-border payments. Millionaire Potential or Market Hype? Steph’s claim that XRP could make investors millionaires in 90 days is ambitious, and while based on chart history, it’s not without risk. Price targets above $10 or more would require a massive influx of capital and market momentum. Still, the possibility of significant upside remains on the table—especially for those who entered during XRP’s months-long consolidation below $1. Final Thoughts Steph is Crypto’s prediction adds to the growing chorus of bullish sentiment surrounding XRP. While market conditions, technical patterns, and legal wins support a potential breakout, investors should temper excitement with caution. The path to millionaire status is rarely linear in crypto—but if XRP repeats history, the coming weeks could indeed be transformative.

Rising spot ETH ETF inflows reflect growing institutional interest and bullish momentum. However, recent positive exchange netflows hint at possible sell pressure ahead. Is ETH the Right Horse? Ethereum (ETH) has rebounded from the multi-year low of under $1,400 in April and currently trades at well above $2,500. Its resurgence brought back optimism among industry participants, with many viewing it as an attractive investment opportunity. The X user Crypto Rover (who has over 1.2 million followers) recently argued that ETH “is the most obvious trade in 2025.” $ETH is the most obvious trade in 2025! pic.twitter.com/NhywHpRnzT — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) June 19, 2025 He claimed the asset’s latest rally resembles the one from 2020, which continued until the end of 2021 when the price reached an all-time high of just south of $5,000. Crypto Caesar touched upon ETH’s positive performance in the past hour, summarizing that “it’s looking good for now.” The analyst urged investors to remain patient, claiming that only the potential outbreak of World War III could derail the bullish momentum. Crypto Fella believes ETH’s next rally is a matter of when not if. The X user envisions new peak levels ahead, though the price may dip before heading higher. Those willing to explore additional recent forecasts involving Ethereum can refer to our dedicated article here . What Are the Indicators Signaling? Over the past several weeks, there has been an evident influx of capital toward spot ETH ETFs. Data compiled by SoSoValue shows that the last day when the netflow was negative (outflows exceeding inflows) was on May 15. Spot ETH ETF Inflows, Source: SoSoValue The development generally indicates that a rising number of investors have been buying shares of these funds, showcasing their confidence in the asset. Spot ETFs hold actual ETH , so these purchases can benefit the bulls. Nonetheless, it’s not all sunshine and roses. The Ethereum exchange netflow has been predominantly positive in the last few days, suggesting that some investors have moved their holdings to centralized platforms. This is typically considered a pre-sale step and might have a negative influence on the valuation.

There may still be the odd week or two, or perhaps even longer before the crypto market pulls itself out of the sideways price action it has been following for more than a month now. The continual rise of Bitcoin Dominance Source: TradingView Bitcoin Dominance is still rising. It’s a slow rise, but it’s continual, and is showing no signs of stopping. In fact, this chart has been up and to the right since September 2022. All this said, is there the chance that the altcoins can come back against $BTC? Yes, of course. There can always be a dip that enables the altcoins to run. Nevertheless, with $billions coming into $BTC by way of whales, sovereigns, and company treasuries, it will probably be hard for the vast majority of the altcoin market to keep up. $ETH faces initial rejection Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $ETH reveals that the price has just been rejected at the descending trendline. This coincides with a cross-down of the Stochastic RSI. That said, there is very strong support at $2,500, so the breakout might still take place. If the support doesn’t hold, the next support level is at $2,400. “Steady Eddy” $BNB rejected from trendline Source: TradingView $BNB is a real “steady Eddy” among the top layer 1 altcoins. The latest ranging price action has been in force since 9 May, with a floor at $640 and resistance at $674. The price is now quite near to that bottom support, and is being channeled into a breakout area formed by the support and the descending trendline. Given that the Stochastic RSI indicators are shaping to turn back down, it may be that the price is further squashed into the point of the triangle. Descending triangles would generally break down rather than up, so this pattern will need to be watched closely. Can $SOL hold support and attempt another breakout? Source: TradingView $SOL is continuing to track down, with the latest attempt to break beyond a small descending trendline looking like it has been foiled. That said, the nearby support level is a strong one at $143, while further supports are underneath at $136, and $125. The Stochastic RSI indicators are posturing to roll over and come back down again, but if support can hold, another attempt at breakout could take place.

Recently, the spotlight has turned towards a significant crypto scam involving fraudulent over-the-counter (OTC) token deals, with accusations touching the founder of SelfChain, Ravindra Kumar. What is This $50 Million OTC Crypto Scam? Reports have surfaced detailing a sophisticated OTC crypto scam that allegedly defrauded investors out of approximately $50 million. This scheme reportedly involved the sale of fake or non-existent vested tokens for major blockchain projects like Sui and Near. Over-the-counter deals, unlike exchange-based transactions, happen directly between two parties, often involving large volumes and private negotiations. While legitimate OTC trading is common, its private nature can also make it susceptible to fraudulent activities if proper due diligence is not performed. The scam came to light primarily through the efforts of Mohammed Waseem, the CEO of Aza Ventures, a firm that unknowingly facilitated some of these fraudulent transactions. Waseem publicly exposed the scheme and pledged to refund victims who were affected by deals his firm handled. This highlights a significant challenge in the OTC space: even intermediaries can be misled by sophisticated fraudsters. Ravindra Kumar’s Denial and Response At the center of the current controversy is Ravindra Kumar, the founder of SelfChain. According to reports from DL News, Kumar has been accused of being the mastermind, referred to as “Source 1,” behind this $50 million operation. However, Kumar has vehemently denied these allegations. He maintains that the accusations are false and has indicated that his legal team is preparing a formal response to address the claims. The denial from a prominent figure like Ravindra Kumar adds another layer of complexity to this unfolding story. In the crypto space, the reputation of founders and projects is paramount. Allegations of this magnitude, even if denied, can significantly impact trust and investor confidence in associated projects like SelfChain. Understanding the Mechanics: Fake Vested Tokens and Ponzi Schemes The alleged token scam leveraged the concept of ‘vested tokens’. Vested tokens are cryptocurrencies allocated to team members, advisors, or early investors of a project that are released gradually over a set period, rather than all at once. This vesting schedule is designed to align interests and prevent large token dumps early on. The scam appears to have involved selling tokens that were either completely fake, did not belong to the seller, or were misrepresented as being immediately available when they were still under vesting periods. Authorities in India, where some of the activities allegedly took place, have reportedly confirmed that “Source 1” was operating a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme is a form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors. The scheme leads victims to believe that profits are coming from legitimate business activity (in this case, perhaps successful token sales or investments) rather than from the money they themselves or other investors have contributed. This structure is inherently unsustainable and collapses when new investment slows down. Key aspects of the alleged scheme: The Asset: Fake or misrepresented vested tokens (specifically mentioning Sui and Near). The Venue: Over-the-counter (OTC) deals, often conducted privately. The Method: Selling non-existent or restricted tokens as legitimate, available assets. The Structure: Described by authorities as a Ponzi scheme, using new investor money to pay off earlier ones. The Alleged Mastermind: Accused of being “Source 1”, with allegations pointing to Ravindra Kumar, which he denies. Implications for Victims and the Wider Crypto Market The primary victims of this alleged crypto scam are the investors who lost approximately $50 million. The public admission by Aza Ventures CEO Mohammed Waseem and his commitment to refunds for deals his firm facilitated is a step towards restitution for some, but recovering funds in complex international crypto frauds is often challenging. This incident also serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with private OTC deals, especially when dealing with illiquid or vested tokens. The lack of transparency compared to regulated exchanges requires investors to perform rigorous due diligence on both the counterparty and the legitimacy of the assets being traded. Actionable insights for investors include: Verify the Counterparty: Conduct thorough background checks on individuals and firms involved in OTC deals. Confirm Asset Legitimacy: Independently verify the existence, ownership, and transferability of tokens, especially vested ones. Consult project official sources if possible. Use Reputable Intermediaries: If using a facilitator, ensure they have a strong reputation and clear processes for verifying assets. Be Wary of Unrealistic Returns: High-pressure sales tactics or promises of significantly below-market prices should be red flags. Seek Legal Counsel: For large OTC transactions, consider consulting with legal professionals experienced in crypto assets. Furthermore, such high-profile scam allegations, particularly those involving tokens from well-known projects like Sui and Near (even if the projects themselves are not implicated in the scam), can cast a shadow over the entire market and erode investor confidence. SelfChain and the Path Forward For SelfChain, the project founded by Ravindra Kumar, these allegations pose a significant challenge. While the accusations are directed at Kumar’s alleged activities unrelated to SelfChain’s core technology, the association is undeniable. The project’s future perception and investor relations will likely depend heavily on the outcome of the investigations and Kumar’s ability to convincingly refute the claims. The legal battle ahead for Ravindra Kumar and his team will be crucial in clearing his name and potentially mitigating the impact on SelfChain. Meanwhile, the exposure of this alleged Ponzi scheme underscores the ongoing need for vigilance, education, and improved security measures within the cryptocurrency ecosystem to protect investors from sophisticated fraudulent operations. Conclusion: Navigating Allegations in the Crypto Space The alleged $50 million OTC crypto scam and the subsequent denial by SelfChain founder Ravindra Kumar highlight the persistent risks in the less regulated corners of the crypto market. While Ravindra Kumar denies the serious accusations linking him to the “Source 1” figure running the alleged Ponzi scheme involving fake Sui and Near tokens, the incident serves as a critical reminder for all market participants. Investors engaging in OTC deals must exercise extreme caution and conduct exhaustive due diligence. The exposure by firms like Aza Ventures, even as facilitators, demonstrates how pervasive and convincing these scams can be. As legal proceedings and investigations continue, the crypto community will be watching closely to understand the full scope of this alleged fraud and its implications for individuals and projects involved.

The limited-edition Oakley Meta HSTN, priced at $499, will open for preorder on July 11. Later in the season, additional Oakley models using Meta’s technology will arrive, with prices starting at $399. The glasses share many features with Meta’s Ray-Ban models. Each frame includes a front-facing camera, open-ear speakers, and built-in microphones. When connected to a smartphone, they can play music or podcasts, handle phone calls, and access Meta AI. The camera and microphones also let Meta AI describe what you see and translate spoken language in real time. Designed with an active lifestyle in mind, these Oakley frames meet an IPX4 water-resistance standard. A single charge provides about eight hours of use, twice the battery life of the original Ray-Bans, and the included charging case offers up to 48 extra hours. The camera now records video in 3K resolution, up from 1080p. There are five frame-and-lens combinations, all of which can be fitted with a prescription for an added cost. Frame colors include warm grey, black, brown smoke, and clear. Lens choices range from standard tints to transition lenses. The $499 special edition adds gold details and Oakley PRIZM lenses. These glasses will be sold in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Italy, Spain, Austria, Belgium, Australia, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark. Competition in AI eyewear is heating up Meta’s partnership with Ray-Ban and Oakley extends over several years. To date, Meta Ray-Bans have sold more than two million pairs. EssilorLuxottica, the owner of Rayban and Oakley, has said it aims to ship ten million smart-glass units with Meta’s software each year by 2026. Other tech firms are also working on smart glasses. In May, Alphabet agreed to invest $150 million with Warby Parker to develop frames that use Google’s Gemini AI. Snap has said it will introduce its sixth-generation augmented-reality glasses next year as part of a wider push to add AI features to eyewear. Meanwhile, Meta has revealed WhatsApp is about to feature ads for the first time. The app’s original creators had pledged to keep the service free of advertising, but starting this summer, users around the globe will encounter three distinct ad formats—none of which will intrude on private, end-to-end–encrypted conversations.

This initial foray, valued at NOK 50 million (approximately $4.97 million), marks a pivotal moment for the company as it simultaneously reveals plans to rebrand itself as StandardCoin. This development is generating considerable buzz within the cryptocurrency news landscape, highlighting the increasing adoption of digital currencies by traditional firms. Why a Standard Supply Bitcoin Investment Now? The decision by Standard Supply to allocate a considerable portion of its capital into Bitcoin isn’t happening in a vacuum. It reflects a growing trend among companies globally to explore digital assets as part of their treasury strategy or future business model. For Standard Supply , this investment serves multiple potential purposes: Entering the Digital Asset Space: It provides immediate exposure to the performance of Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Treasury Management: Some companies view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation or currency devaluation, similar to gold. Signaling Strategic Direction: The investment clearly communicates the company’s intention to become a player in the digital asset economy, paving the way for the planned rebrand. This move positions Standard Supply among a growing list of publicly traded companies that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, signaling increasing institutional confidence in the long-term value proposition of decentralized currencies. StandardCoin: What Does the Rebrand Signify? Alongside the significant Bitcoin investment , the announcement of the rebrand to StandardCoin is perhaps the most telling sign of the company’s future direction. The name change itself strongly suggests a fundamental shift in focus, moving away from its historical identity towards one more aligned with the digital economy and potentially, blockchain technology or tokenized assets. While specific details about the future operations under the StandardCoin moniker are anticipated, the initial announcement emphasizes a focus on key areas crucial for operating within the digital assets space: Secure Custody: Protecting digital assets from theft, loss, or unauthorized access is paramount. Risk Management: Navigating the volatility and unique risks associated with cryptocurrencies requires robust frameworks. Regulated Partners: Utilizing established, compliant service providers is critical for institutional players entering this market. This focus on security, risk, and regulatory compliance indicates that StandardCoin aims to operate responsibly within the digital asset ecosystem, which is often a priority for companies transitioning from traditional sectors. Navigating the World of Digital Assets: Security and Regulation One of the standout points in the announcement is Standard Supply’s commitment to secure custody and risk management through regulated partners. This is not a trivial detail in the world of digital assets . Unlike traditional finance, where established institutions handle asset custody, the digital realm requires specialized solutions. Choosing regulated partners for custody ensures that the assets are held by entities that adhere to strict compliance standards, often including: Robust security protocols (both physical and digital). Segregation of client funds. Regular audits and reporting. Compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. This approach is crucial for building trust and ensuring the safety of the invested capital, particularly for a publicly traded company. It also reflects a mature understanding of the operational necessities involved in managing crypto holdings beyond simply buying the asset. What Does This Mean for Standard Supply Shareholders and the Market? The transformation of Standard Supply into StandardCoin, underpinned by a foundational Bitcoin investment , is likely to have significant implications. For existing shareholders, it represents a bold strategic shift that could potentially unlock new growth avenues in a rapidly evolving market. However, it also introduces new risks associated with cryptocurrency price volatility and the successful execution of the rebrand and new business model. For the broader market, this move serves as another data point indicating the mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies and digital assets . As more traditional companies explore or commit to this space, it adds legitimacy and can potentially pave the way for further institutional adoption. Analysts and investors interested in cryptocurrency news will be closely watching StandardCoin’s progress to see how this transition unfolds and what new ventures the company might pursue in the digital asset space. Looking Ahead: The Future of StandardCoin The journey from Standard Supply to StandardCoin is just beginning. The initial Bitcoin investment is a clear statement of intent, but the real story will be how the company leverages this position to build its future business in the digital asset sector. Will they focus on providing services related to digital assets? Will they explore further investments or perhaps even tokenization initiatives? The emphasis on secure custody and regulated partners suggests a focus on institutional-grade operations. This could position StandardCoin to cater to other companies looking to enter the space but lacking the in-house expertise for secure management of digital assets . The coming months will likely reveal more details about the strategic vision for StandardCoin. This development is a compelling example of how companies are adapting and evolving to participate in the digital economy, driven by the potential offered by cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Conclusion: A New Era Begins Standard Supply’s significant $4.97 million Bitcoin investment and planned rebrand to StandardCoin mark a definitive pivot towards the digital asset future. By prioritizing secure custody and risk management through regulated partners, the company is laying a foundation for responsible participation in the cryptocurrency market. This move is a clear signal of the increasing integration of digital assets into traditional corporate strategies and is a key piece of recent cryptocurrency news . The transition to StandardCoin represents not just a name change, but a fundamental strategic realignment, positioning the company to explore new opportunities in the dynamic world of digital finance.

An innovative idea for predictive intelligence and a fast-growing presale make Ozak AI a rather curious project. This article will address the condition of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, as well as the investigations of the technological growth of the Ozak AI and its possibly bright future in the prospective realm of digital assets. Youtube embed: Next 500X AI Altcoin Ozak AI: The first company to predictive intelligence Everything is going great in the artificial intelligence sector, and Ozak AI is doing an outstanding job of progressing and making nuances in the sphere. The presale of its $OZ token is showing great pace. More than 7,909,111.204 $OZ tokens have been sold so far, which is evidence of the high investor interest. Each of the three initial stages (1-3) sold 169 million tokens with starting and subsequent prices of $0.001 and $0.003, respectively, totaling $1.23 million to fuel product development. In Phase 4, the $OZ token is valued at a low of 0.005 and this is the final sub-cent phase before Phase 5 doubles the amount to $0.01. The early investors that bought at 0.001 have already made 5 times the money. Scenarios, which are strategic growth points of the platform, include such vital directions as Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) and Ozak Data Vaults as central fields that could be used to introduce a revolution into the sphere of processing and use of data with the help of AI. Shiba Inu and Dogecoin: The Way in the Market Despite the popularity of DOGE and Shiba Inu (SHIB), the currencies are now in the realm of cooling off after having shot up. On analyzing the given charts, the price action of Shiba Inu demonstrates the recent trading value that amounts to approximately $0.00001321. The chart shows the downward trendline and the latest bounce off the support area near the value of $0.00000800, implying the consolidation period. The trading volume on SHIB has also fluctuated, meaning that the degree of trading interest in the group changes. The long-term cyclical trend is also characteristic of Dogecoin, as its price behavior is displayed, as shown, in the image of the long-term chart. It shows spells of strong rally and retraces, which tend to create what look like Wolfe Wave settings. According to the chart, DOGE has been moving in set channels and its support and resistance data are evident. The fact that it is at the position it is in now shows a possibility of it holding ground after having been pushed a bit recently, hence preparing us for an imminent movement by it to be felt within its known patterns. Ozak AI: The Way Forward The fact that Ozak AI has housed a presale, selling more than 120 million tokens in its third stage at the price of 0.003 and the listing at 0.05 means that it has an opportunity to grow tremendously in the future. The fact that the remaining window to purchase the tokens at the price of 0.005 provides a good opportunity, as the price is likely to surge up by a doubled mark in the future. The core infrastructure and technology are described as a strategic investment that supports the willingness of Ozak AI to offer an effective and worthy AI platform. In the turbulence of the volatile cryptocurrency market, Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are on the frontline, but considering that Ozak AI is working on physical AI capabilities and is aiming to accomplish a lot with its ambitious development schedule, it is one of the projects worth keeping an eye on in the next few months.

But as price enters a corrective phase, traders are now eyeing key levels to determine what’s next. Rexas Finance ( RXS ) has delivered one of the most eye-catching moves across the market with an explosive 325% rally. The move was impulsive, aggressive, and fueled by momentum, but the real question is whether this was a blow-off top or simply a launchpad for higher prices. While volume has begun to decline, the market structure hasn’t yet shifted bearish, suggesting this correction may be part of a broader bullish continuation. Key technical points, High Time Frame Support: $0.109; yet to be retested Volume Profile: Declining volume post-rally hints at consolidation, not collapse Point of Control: Aligns with $0.109 support, adds strong confluence Local Resistance: 0.618 Fibonacci retracement on the recent drop Market Structure: No confirmed top or lower low established yet RXSUSDT (1H) Chart, Source: TradingView Following the break above the value area high, RXS surged into a vertical rally that topped out over 325% from its prior base. While such explosive price action often signals exhaustion, the correction that has followed appears controlled and consistent with standard market behavior after large impulsive moves. Importantly, the decline in volume during the correction phase is typical in scenarios where the market is searching for a higher low or new base, not necessarily signs of collapse. The $0.109 support level stands out as a critical zone. Not only does this level mark high time frame support, but it also aligns with the point of control from previous volume activity, making it a strong candidate for a bullish reaction if tested. You might also like: FUNToken announces deflationary update, achieves Certik certification Meanwhile, local resistance resides at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement of the recent pullback. If price pushes up into this zone and fails to break through, a rejection could send RXS back toward the $0.109 level, offering a potential base-building opportunity before any continuation. While price action remains volatile, the structure hasn’t broken down. There’s no official lower low, and no bearish market structure has been established. This suggests the market may still be in a healthy corrective state rather than reversing altogether. What to expect in the coming price Action As RXS consolidates, keep a close eye on whether it forms a bottoming structure near $0.109. A strong reaction from that support, especially with an uptick in volume, could trigger another leg higher. Until a lower low is printed or key support fails, the bullish narrative remains intact.

While Ripple (XRP) continues to hold its ground amid ongoing regulatory developments and moderate trading volumes, a rising contender is beginning to turn heads, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance is now in Presale Phase 5 at $0.03. Investor interest is still incredibly robust, and over 12,200 investors have bought the token along with a total raise of $10.8 million. Investors who get in on this level will see 100% return on investment when the token is launched at $0.06. While XRP maintains its relevance in institutional corridors, Mutuum’s fast-growing community and aggressive roadmap are driving serious conversations about whether this new crypto could soon challenge even legacy players. Mutuum Finance Surges Past $10.8 Million in Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about projects in DeFi. With over $10.8 million raised and more than 12,200 investors already on board, the presale is gaining serious momentum. Currently in its fifth phase, the token is priced at $0.03. The next round will see the price jump to $0.035, and with an official launch price of $0.06 already set, early participants could be looking at a 100% return before the token even hits the market. Some analysts are even projecting a post-launch price surge past $2.50 before the 2025 bull run wraps up. A Smarter, More Flexible Future for DeFi Lending With a lending platform built upon the tenet of user-freedom, control and security, Mutuum Finance is disrupting decentralized finance. Mutuum Finance provides a two-side model which accounts for different manners of DeFi involvements. Its Peer-to-Contract system gives users the option to deposit USDT into automated smart contracts allowing interest rates to fluctuate depending on the activity in the market. For users who would like to have more freedom of action have the opportunity of using the Peer-to-Peer option that gives the freedom to the same parties of lending and taking loans and they do not have to depend on third party groups. It is a transparent, trustless model that provides the user complete freedom in their funds, which is an effective option in a more turbulent situation or a specific lending deal. The integration of automation and personalization allows Mutuum Finance to establish a new standard in DeFi lending; the ability to have a fully automated product but not have to completely give up control over the system. $100,000 Giveaway and Leaderboard Rewards To celebrate its explosive growth and reward early supporters, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway . Ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, simply for joining early. In addition, the project has rolled out a live leaderboard, where the top 50 MUTM token holders earn exclusive bonus rewards, adding a gamified edge to the presale and making participation even more exciting. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has now raised over $10.8 million from more than 12,200 early investors, solidifying its status as one of the most explosive presales of 2025. Priced at $0.03 in Phase 5, current buyers are positioned for a 100% return when the token launches at $0.06. Its dual-lending system, Certik-audited security, and dynamic ecosystem incentives, including a $100K giveaway and leaderboard rewards, are fueling rapid momentum.

With market sentiment split between short-term dips and long-term utility, a few tokens are showing strong setups. Some are bouncing off support, others are expanding real-world use cases, and a few are still in presale stages with serious upside. If you’re looking for the best crypto to invest in now, this list covers the top five you should be paying attention to. From stealth wallets and zero-knowledge tech to oracle dominance and enterprise-ready chains, these cryptos are delivering utility, not just hype. Whether you’re looking for short-term trades or long-term upside, this list is built on the latest data post–June 11. Let’s break down the strongest picks worth watching today. 1. Cold Wallet ($CWT) – Privacy That Pays Off Cold Wallet is in stage 14 of its presale, priced at $0.00906, while targeting a listing price of over $0.35. That puts the ROI potential at roughly 4,900%, which is turning heads across the crypto space. But it’s not just the upside that matters, Cold Wallet is solving a real problem. The wallet uses zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enable stealth transfers, anonymous balances, and privacy-first operations with zero tracking. No IP logging, no third-party analytics, and no energy overhead. It’s built for users who want true self-custody and confidentiality. The roadmap is tight and execution-focused. The MVP (minimum viable product) is set for Q3 2025, with a full rollout and exchange listings planned for Q4. Beyond strong tech, the tokenomics are clean: 40% of supply is allocated to presale buyers, 30% to community incentives and governance, with vesting in place for the team and partners. Large wallets are entering now, locking in their allocations before listings go live. If you’re looking for the best crypto to invest in now, Cold Wallet is near the top of that list. It combines strong privacy tech, real presale momentum, and clearly defined release goals. With utility baked in from day one, it offers early investors both purpose and profit potential. 2. Cosmos (ATOM) – Backed by the Upgrade Cosmos is trading around $4.12, down slightly but holding firm after completing a major v24 upgrade on June 11, 2025. This update has boosted chain interoperability and reinforced validator incentives. While ATOM dropped nearly 9% during a broader market sell-off, it found strong technical support between $4.02 and $4.13. Traders are watching the $4.50 level closely. If momentum returns to altcoins, Cosmos could break out of this channel quickly with strong volume. Many are eyeing ATOM as one of the best crypto to invest in now, not just because of its low price but due to the long-term bet on modular, interconnected blockchains. Forecasts expect ATOM to trade in a range of $3.95–$5.25 this summer. Governance enhancements, rising DeFi integrations, and consistent staking yields make Cosmos more than just another Layer-1. It’s still early in its new roadmap cycle, and that gives it added appeal for medium- to long-term buyers. 3. Chainlink (LINK) – Data That Powers Everything Chainlink is holding steady near $13.30, having recovered from a recent 14% dip in early June. It’s been boosted by two key drivers: a major spike in GitHub development activity (even outpacing Ethereum at one point) and its role in the e-HKD+ CBDC pilot in Hong Kong. That pilot alone pushed prices from $13.90 to $15.28 in less than 24 hours, showing how quickly LINK responds to demand. Chainlink remains one of the best crypto to invest in now thanks to its dominance as a real-world data bridge. It powers DeFi, gaming, tokenized assets, and even central bank pilots. Analysts see potential for LINK to push toward $19–$20 by Q4 2025. Key support levels around $13.80–$14.20 are holding strong, giving traders confidence. It’s not just technicals, partnerships and utility keep it relevant. This is one coin with infrastructure-level impact, and it’s quietly reinforcing its lead every month. 4. Avalanche (AVAX) – Built for Enterprise Scale Avalanche is trading at $19.22, rebounding after dipping to $18.57 during a broader sell-off tied to geopolitical uncertainty. Its support at $22 was broken briefly but is now in sight again. June’s Avalanche Summit in London helped spotlight its expanding use of subnets for enterprise solutions and public-private collaborations, especially in tokenization. Analysts are expecting a price range between $18.80 and $19.90 over the next few weeks, with a longer-term push toward $25.96 by Q4 if momentum builds. AVAX stands out for scaling capabilities and a developer-first environment that supports enterprise adoption. For buyers watching key support zones and builder ecosystems, this is one of the best crypto to invest in now for long-term upside. It’s less flashy than meme coins, but its fundamentals are hard to ignore. When markets turn, infrastructure projects like Avalanche usually lead the charge. Conclusion Whether you’re going in early on Cold Wallet or watching Cosmos and Chainlink hold key technical levels, there’s something here for every kind of investor. Cold Wallet offers stealth, ZK-based privacy tech and a presale ROI of nearly 4,900%, making it the best crypto to invest in now if you’re betting on product-led growth. Cosmos is stabilizing post-upgrade, Chainlink is riding institutional demand, Avalanche is turning heads with enterprise adoption, and Chain is quietly getting its roadmap back on track. These aren’t random picks, they’re backed by current data and real product development. If you’re building your next portfolio wave, these five cryptos deserve your closest attention. The setups are live, the teams are building, and timing is still on your side.

The banks just don’t care. According to LendingTree, the average APR jumped again in June for the third month in a row, reaching the highest level since last year. Bankrate also puts the average interest rate across all cards at just above 20%, while new card offers are hitting 24.3%, per LendingTree’s data. That’s not a small bump. That’s painful. Clifford Cornell, a financial planner at Bone Fide Wealth in New York, said , “These are crippling rates that are compounding your debt at such a fast clip.” And that’s exactly what’s happening. For people who carry a balance, the interest is stacking up like a brick wall, month after month. Card rates keep jumping even with no new Fed hikes This isn’t something that came out of nowhere. Credit card APRs were flat for years after Congress passed the Credit CARD Act in 2009. That law kept things stable for a while. Then the Fed began lifting its key rate in 2015. Ever since, the interest rates tied to most credit cards—because they’re variable—have been slowly, then quickly, going up. By now, average APRs have nearly doubled from about 12% to where they are today. That upward trend hit full throttle in 2022 when the Fed raised its benchmark 11 times starting in March. Rates on credit cards followed each of those hikes, just like they were designed to do. But now, even after three Fed cuts in 2024 and a long pause since December, card rates are still climbing. Banks aren’t backing off. They’ve decided to keep pushing those APRs higher anyway, regardless of what the central bank does. Some lenders even said directly that the elevated rates would stay. Matt Schulz, LendingTree’s chief credit analyst, explained why the pattern is still moving upward: “This unfortunate trend could continue in coming months,” he said. The reason? Risk. Banks are trying to protect themselves from borrowers who might default. Schulz called it a defensive move. “This is a sign of banks trying to protect themselves from the risk that is out there in these uncertain times,” he said. So they pass the risk onto consumers through steeper APRs. Charlie Wise, a senior vice president at TransUnion, broke down what’s happening on the borrower side. He said people are applying for more credit during unstable times to shield themselves against future money problems. “When there is uncertainty in the market, this often results in consumers seeking new credit to ensure they are prepared for any future financial hurdles,” Wise said. But when that happens, credit card companies respond by raising rates again. Charlie also said that when more people with weaker credit take on debt, the system raises the average APR across the board. “If more balances are in the hands of riskier borrowers, those rates will trend higher,” he added. Higher APRs don’t affect everyone, but most still get hit Not every credit card user is feeling the sting. People who pay off their balance every month don’t really deal with APRs at all. The problem is for those who carry debt. That group is the one being buried right now. Another twist? The APR hikes only affect new balances. If someone got a card years ago and hasn’t added to it, that old debt is still tied to the rate they signed up for. But new credit, new balances, or new applications? Those get slammed with the current rates—20% or higher. Some folks are hoping a future Fed cut will save them. Charlie Wise said that’s not really how it works. “The reality is you could drop the fed funds rate by two full basis points and all you are doing is lowering your interest rate from 22% to 20%,” he said. “That’s not a material difference.” It still hurts. Good credit doesn’t just help with new card offers. It affects the whole financial picture. People with strong credit scores can ask for better rates, and they’re more likely to be approved. The better the credit, the lower the interest rate on everything from credit cards to loans. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Will We See a Summer Rally in Bitcoin (BTC) and Altcoins?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/interest-rate-good-news-from-a-fed-member-will-we-see-a-summer-rally-in-bitcoin-btc-and-altcoins/,"While the FED is expected to start interest rate cuts, which it has been pausing since January, to cause a rally in Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins, good news about interest rates came from FED member Christopher Waller. Speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box, Christopher Waller said he did not expect the tariffs to significantly increase inflation, so policymakers should consider cutting interest rates as early as next month. We May Start Interest Rate Cuts in July! Waller said he and his colleagues think they should move slowly on rate cuts, but added that inflation is no longer a significant economic threat to rates and they should start easing. “I think we are in a position where we can cut rates and the earliest we can do that is July. That would be my view, whether the committee agrees with that or not, time will tell.” Waller's comments on the rate cut came two days after the FOMC voted to hold interest rates steady for the fourth time in June, following its last rate cut in December. Waller added that he thinks the Fed should cut interest rates to prevent a possible slowdown in the labor market. “We are seeing job creation slowing and other things that indicate the labor market is weakening. If you're starting to worry about the risk of the labor market moving down, don't wait. Because I don't want to wait for the job market to collapse before lowering interest rates. The labor market is in good shape, but not as strong as in 2022. The FED should start the interest rate reduction process slowly but proceed cautiously to avoid surprises. The FED can pause the interest rate reduction process whenever it wants. Because we have enough reasons to lower interest rates, then we can watch inflation again.” Following the interest rate decision, FED Chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that inflation continues to run slightly above their targets and that they will proceed with a bit more caution in reducing interest rates due to concerns about tariffs. *This is not investment advice.

The drop hit hard across the board. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) lost 2.5% in its US-listed shares, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index slid by 2%. Applied Materials fell 4%. Dutch equipment maker ASML Holding NV also took a 1.9% hit. The new curb warning came from Jeffrey Kessler, the Commerce Department’s undersecretary for industry and security. He told TSMC, Samsung Electronics, and SK Hynix that the waivers they currently rely on might be pulled. These waivers let them use US semiconductor manufacturing tools inside China. If they lose them, it would disrupt key parts of the global chip supply chain. US justifies restrictions with reciprocal licensing policy The Commerce Department tried to calm things down, saying in a statement to Bloomberg that the companies are not being shut out of China. “The new enforcement mechanisms on chips mirror licensing requirements that apply to other semiconductor companies that export to China and ensure the United States has an equal and reciprocal process,” the official reportedly said. That same quote was shared with the Wall Street Journal, too. The White House also defended the move, saying it’s not meant to increase trade tensions. Instead, it’s about aligning licensing rules with how China treats its own rare-earth material exports. But the timing complicates everything. US and Chinese officials are still working on finalizing the trade agreement they discussed in London, and this could easily be seen as the US going back on that deal, according to the Journal. This new enforcement approach could anger Beijing and strain ties with Seoul and Taipei, whose companies would be the most impacted. These allies have spent billions building US plants and have supported Washington in its tech strategy against China. Removing the waivers would directly target their chip operations in China , including Samsung’s memory chip plant in Xi’an. The Xi’an factory is part of a larger network that includes production of memory, logic, and other chips. These aren’t cutting-edge plants, but their products are used worldwide in everything from smartphones to vehicles. If the waivers disappear, it doesn’t mean factories will shut down tomorrow, but over time, they’ll find it harder to run without access to US gear and updates. Companies scramble for backup plans as US debates waiver removal Industry executives say they’ll likely need to apply for special licenses to keep their Chinese factories going. Others are already looking at suppliers from Japan and Europe to find equipment not bound by US restrictions. But the situation remains unstable. The waiver removal isn’t confirmed yet, as the Journal’s report claims Kessler’s office at the Bureau of Industry and Security hasn’t gotten full approval from the rest of the US government. There’s pushback inside the administration. Some officials, especially in the Defense Department, believe that scrapping the waivers could actually help China, worried that if American firms leave, Chinese companies will just take over the plants, according to the Journal. But Kessler and the national security faction argue that more aggressive controls are needed to block China’s growth in key technologies. That split has grown louder in recent months. The Biden-era chip bans were already biting. Sales of high-performance chips to China from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) were stopped. That decision alone cost billions in lost revenue. Commerce also floated a broader ban on chip equipment sales to China, though a White House official said that idea is no longer being considered. At the same time, Samsung, TSMC, and SK Hynix have all alerted their own governments. They’re asking authorities in South Korea and Taiwan to step in and help block the waiver changes. The stakes are high. Both countries are working on wider trade deals with Washington. The companies fear this dispute could derail those talks completely. Their argument is simple. They need their Chinese factories to compete. Samsung’s current waiver lets its Xi’an plant make advanced chips that directly challenge China’s Yangtze Memory Technologies. Losing that ability hands the advantage to China, the very outcome the US says it’s trying to avoid. South Korea and Taiwan have already cooperated with the US on restricting tech transfers to China. They’ve also made huge investments in American factories with government support. The companies involved—Samsung, TSMC, and SK Hynix—have each poured billions into US facilities. The waiver fight now threatens to undermine those efforts, damage trade talks, and unsettle the already fragile global chip industry.

Table of Contents Nobitex breach marks new chapter in cyber risk New crypto curfew reflects crisis mood Blockchain forensics reveal troubling patterns Is Iran going to attack the U.S.? Experts chime in Nobitex breach marks new chapter in cyber risk In the early hours of Jun. 18, Iran’s largest crypto exchange, Nobitex, suffered a coordinated cyberattack that resulted in one of the most severe digital asset breaches in the country’s history. The incident was confirmed by Nobitex’s technical team and involved the compromise of multiple hot wallets. A wide range of assets was affected, including Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Tether ( USDT ), Ripple ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), Tron ( TRX ), and Toncoin ( TON ). Estimates of the stolen funds vary. TRM Labs, Chainalysis, and Elliptic each placed the losses near $90 million, while independent analyst ZachXBT calculated at least $81.7 million lost across Ethereum and Tron-compatible networks. The breach was first identified after Nobitex detected unauthorized access to its internal reporting infrastructure, triggering an emergency response that led to the suspension of both its website and mobile application.

Immediately upon detection, all… — Nobitex | نوبیتکس (@nobitexmarket) June 18, 2025 Cyvers researcher Hakan Unal noted that the breach stemmed from a failure in segregating wallet credentials, which should have remained isolated from the systems that were compromised. However, unlike typical crypto hacks where funds are laundered for profit, the Nobitex case showed a different intent. The stolen crypto was transferred to vanity addresses with politically charged labels, such as TKFuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXy2r7mNX on Tron and 0xffFFfFFffFFffFfFffFFfFfFFFFDead on Ethereum, both computationally impossible to access, rendering the funds effectively “burned.” Shortly after the incident, the pro-Israel hacker group Gonjeshke Darande, also known as Predatory Sparrow, claimed responsibility via a post on X.

On Jun. 19, the group acted on the threat. In another X post, Predatory Sparrow shared what they claimed to be the full source code of Nobitex.

The Nobitex attack came just one day after a similar breach by the same group. On Jun. 17, Predatory Sparrow targeted Iran’s state-owned Bank Sepah, disrupting ATM services nationwide. Together, the incidents suggest that the Nobitex breach may form part of a broader cyber campaign linked to escalating tensions. The attack followed Israeli military strikes on Iran, launched on Jun. 13 amid growing concerns over Iran’s nuclear program. New crypto curfew reflects crisis mood Following the Nobitex breach, Iranian authorities moved swiftly to tighten oversight of the country’s digital asset infrastructure. On Jun. 19, the Central Bank of Iran imposed a curfew limiting operating hours for all domestic crypto exchanges to between 10 AM and 8 PM daily. The measure coincided with rising military tensions between Iran and Israel. As of Jun. 18, official reports listed 224 deaths in Iran and 24 in Israel following a series of missile strikes. Actual figures may be significantly higher. Analysts at Chainalysis noted that the curfew may also be intended to limit capital flight and increase financial surveillance during the crisis. Meanwhile, in direct response to the hack, Nobitex activated emergency protocols to secure remaining reserves. Large amounts of Bitcoin were moved into new cold storage wallets, a step confirmed by Chainalysis as part of the platform’s containment strategy. The exchange issued a public statement assuring users that the majority of customer assets held in cold wallets remained secure. Nobitex also pledged to use its reserve and insurance fund to fully reimburse affected clients. Despite these reassurances, user access to Nobitex would remain suspended in the upcoming days. Users have expressed growing anxiety over frozen funds, limited access, and broader trust issues. The situation was further complicated by a nationwide internet blackout. Data from Cloudflare showed a 90% decline in traffic volumes compared to the previous week. #Internet connectivity has once again become unavailable across #Iran , with traffic down ~90% after initially falling at 12:50 UTC (16:20 local time). https://t.co/9mmRkVO86Y pic.twitter.com/orqqmu0hhN — Cloudflare Radar (@CloudflareRadar) June 18, 2025 No official link has been established between the cyberattack and the internet outage. However, the disruption severely impacted civilian access to online services, including financial platforms, messaging apps, and news portals. Blockchain forensics reveal troubling patterns In a country facing international sanctions, limited access to global banking, and persistent currency devaluation, Nobitex has emerged as a critical financial gateway for Iranians. Founded in 2017, the platform has grown into the most dominant player in Iran’s crypto market. The platform has over 7 million registered users and accounts for the majority of the country’s digital asset activity. According to Chainalysis, Nobitex has received more than $11 billion in total inflows, exceeding the combined total of Iran’s next ten largest exchanges. Total inflows of Iranian crypto exchanges | Source: Chainalysis Nobitex enables users to trade crypto assets using Iranian Rials, offering a way to store value, participate in global markets, and sidestep the limitations of Iran’s restricted financial infrastructure. While Nobitex has served an important role for civilians grappling with economic uncertainty, it has been accused of facilitating not only everyday transactions but also financial activity linked to the Iranian state. Following the June 2025 breach, hacker group Predatory Sparrow claimed Nobitex was targeted for allegedly aiding the Iranian government in evading sanctions and funding illicit operations. Blockchain analytics firms including Elliptic and Chainalysis have traced the platform’s activity to individuals and groups under U.S. sanctions. Among them are Ahmad Khatibi Aghada and Amir Hossein Niakeen Ravari, both designated by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control in 2022 for their involvement in ransomware operations. Further blockchain analysis has linked wallets on Nobitex to groups such as Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Houthis, and accounts promoting al-Qaeda-affiliated content. U.S. lawmakers have raised repeated concerns over Nobitex’s role in potential sanctions evasion. In May 2024, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Angus King sent a letter referencing a Reuters investigation from 2022 that uncovered nearly $8 billion in transactions between Nobitex and Binance between 2018 and 2022. The letter questioned whether such flows might reflect systemic gaps in global enforcement. Nobitex’s internal policies have also drawn attention. Public reports indicate the platform previously issued user guidance on bypassing financial restrictions, prompting concern from regulatory authorities and international watchdogs. Predatory Sparrow has gone so far as to claim that employment at Nobitex is considered equivalent to military service within Iran, due to the platform’s perceived strategic value to the regime’s financial operations. Is Iran going to attack the U.S.? As tensions between Iran and Israel escalate, prediction markets have seen a rise in activity focused on conflict-related outcomes. On Polymarket, users are trading on the likelihood of various geopolitical events, including military actions, cyberattacks, leadership changes, and diplomatic negotiations. The combined volume across these contracts now exceeds $70 million, offering a glimpse into how speculative behavior continues even in high-risk, politically sensitive contexts. One of the most active markets centers on the possibility of U.S. military action against Iran before July. The contract has recorded more than $19 million in volume, with current odds reflecting a 45% probability. A related contract measuring the likelihood of a major cyberattack on Iran during June has surged to 95%. The shift follows recent breaches at Nobitex and Bank Sepah, reinforcing expectations of ongoing digital escalation. Markets predicting Israeli airstrikes on Iran within specific June timeframes are also heavily traded. The contract for a strike on June 20 is priced at 99%, while neighboring dates hover just below that threshold. Leadership-related scenarios have drawn increased attention as well. A contract forecasting that Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei will leave office before July is trading at 60% probability, with over $2 million in trade volume. Contracts covering broader regime change, direct invasions by the U.S. or Israel, or formal declarations of war remain priced far lower, with probabilities ranging from 1% to 5%. At the same time, markets are also speculating on diplomatic outcomes. Scenarios involving a U.S.-Iran nuclear deal or resumed negotiations are currently priced between 15% and 40%, reflecting uncertainty about the possibility of de-escalation in the near term. Experts chime in crypto.news spoke with Yehor Rudytsia and Oleksii Haponiuk from Hacken to explore how the Nobitex breach challenges traditional assumptions about crypto hacks in today’s geopolitical environment. What set the incident apart was not just the scale of the breach but the fact that the stolen funds were deliberately burned. There was no attempt to launder, convert, or profit from the assets. According to Rudytsia, that detail represents a monumental change in how threats to exchanges should be interpreted. “Web3 projects, especially centralized exchanges, are no longer just targets for financial theft. They can also become instruments for politically motivated cyberattacks. The Nobitex case shows that attackers may act with the intent to disrupt rather than gain.” He stressed that centralized exchanges remain the primary access point for millions of users. A successful breach has consequences that can cascade through the broader ecosystem, affecting not just the platform but the public’s confidence in crypto infrastructure. “We need to move past the idea that decentralization alone is the answer. Most users still rely on centralized exchanges, and securing them remains essential for web3 adoption.” The attack also brought renewed focus to Nobitex’s position within Iran’s financial system and its potential role in sanctions evasion. Haponiuk explained that while crypto offers pseudonymity, it does not guarantee anonymity, especially when transaction patterns are scrutinized over time. “State-affiliated entities often rely on tools like mixers, chain hopping, or layered routing. But their behavior differs from that of regular users, who typically stay within predictable thresholds and transactional habits.” He added that blockchain analytics has advanced to the point where clustering, attribution, and behavioral profiling can detect coordinated activity across wallets and chains. Although not foolproof, these tools are now strong enough to yield actionable insights when supported by consistent signals. As blockchain infrastructure becomes more integrated into global finance. The Nobitex case offers a clear example of how crypto platforms operating in politically sensitive regions are increasingly exposed to conflict-driven risks. And as crypto continues to merge with real-world systems, the frequency and complexity of such attacks are likely to grow.",Feature|Iran|Israel|Сrypto hack,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-06-20 17:02:45

Accordingly, Brad Sherman claimed that TikTok had made or would make a $300 million purchase from US President Donald Trump's memecoin TRUMP. At this point, Sherman accused TikTok's owners of bribing President Trump due to the impending ban in the US. TikTok, a social media platform owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, responded to these allegations with harsh language. TikTok, which has been rumored to be shutting down or being sold, has described the claims as clearly false and irresponsible. “Mr. Congressman, TikTok owners’ claims that they purchased Trump Coin are patently false and irresponsible, and do not even accurately reflect a letter you signed last month.” Bribery Allegation Regarding TRUMP! These claims come after news that Trump signed a new executive order to ban or delay the sale of TikTok. Brad Sherman also alleged bribery with TikTok, citing these postponement decisions. Sherman argued that Trump’s failure to enforce the ban on TikTok was unlawful, noting that US law only allows for one postponement. “TikTok's shutdown has been postponed for the 3rd time by Trump. Trump only has the authority to do this once. This coercion is illegal. In addition, TikTok's Chinese owners announced that they received $300 million worth of Trump coins. This is a bribe. Because Trump is creating TRUMP Coin for free, so it's just a $300 million bribe that goes into his pocket.” Sherman’s claims that TikToK bought TRUMP are believed to be based on the TikTok-affiliated GD Culture Group’s announcement of plans to buy TRUMP and Bitcoin for $300 million. *This is not investment advice.

Meanwhile, SEI outpaced peers as a major news announcement injected bullish momentum. However, with sentiment across the markets largely negative amid the Middle East conflict, a seesaw on Wall Street also saw BTC and top altcoins pare gains amid some downside volatility. Broader crypto market wrap The global crypto market capitalization hovered at $3.24 trillion, up just 0.18% at the time of writing. Also, per CoinMarketCap data, the global daily trading volume was down 7.6% to approximately $89.4 billion, with the crypto fear & greed index neutral amid a cautious market sentiment. Elsewhere, the total liquidations reached $197 million, up 57% in 24 hours, as geopolitical uncertainties and leveraged positions unwind triggered traders. The outlook across crypto had largely mirrored Wall Street, with equity markets gaining on Friday after President Donald Trump’s decision to delay military action against Iran eased fears of escalation. However, the risk-on sentiment, bolstered by Fed Governor Christopher Waller’s comments suggesting steady rates with two cuts projected for 2025, failed to strengthen. U.S. stocks were thus largely flat as crypto tokens also gave up gains. Earlier in the day, analysts at QCP Group had shared their outlook for the market. QCP @QCPgroup · Follow Asia Colour – 20 Jun 251/ Markets are in limbo. Participants are digesting geopolitical headlines and recalibrating risk amid rising tensions. Volatility may just be taking a breather, not gone. 12:04 pm · 20 Jun 2025 4 Reply Copy link Read 1 reply Bitcoin pares gains after spike to $106k Bitcoin surged to $106,539 early Friday, but later pared gains to trade near $104,440 at the time of writing. As noted, the rally had aligned with a broader equity market uptick, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq advanced following Trump’s de-escalation move. Waller’s remarks, emphasizing a cautious monetary policy, said the Fed could cut rates as soon as July. While the developments helped BTC higher, bearish pressure remained. QCP analysts noted this about Bitcoin price: “Crypto stays quiet, but under the hood, risk sentiment is shifting. $BTC and $ETH risk reversals favor downside, pointing to active hedging. $ETH’s June implied vol has dipped below September, a rare flip suggesting fading short-term event risk.” ETH, XRP see uptick Ethereum climbed to $2,569, rebounding from a 24-hour low of $2,486. While bears could target fresh lows, bulls are holding strong. Recent ETF inflows, with BlackRock’s ETHA adding $600 million recently, and historic staking highs of 35 million ETH, underscore institutional interest and reduced liquid supply. Elsewhere, XRP rose to $2.17 before paring gains. Bulls nonetheless look strong above $2 despite a failed breakout above $2.30. Positive sentiment from a Canadian spot XRP ETF approval and Ripple’s growing role in cross-border payments bolster this resilience. SEI among top gainers SEI price surged over 15% in early trading on Friday, leading the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. The rally, fueled by the Sei Network’s announcement of a Wyoming-backed stablecoin initiative, saw SEI reach highs above $0.21. Other notable performers included Story and GateToken . Top crypto losers today While cryptocurrencies looked to bounce higher, a few within the top 100 plummeted. SPX6900 fell nearly 12%, Fartcoin dropped 9%, and Aerodrome Finance declined 6%.

While you can still get attractive returns on these established crypto assets even now, they are nothing compared to the gains made upon buying these coins when they first came into existence. While BTC had to be mined, ETH and SOL were sold out through initial coin offerings (ICOs) at around $0.31 in 2014 and $0.22 in 2020 and have since risen to their all-time highs (ATHs) of $4,880 and $293 , respectively. Investing early is clearly key to enjoying most returns, and the way to do so is through launchpads. Today, we’ll explore the leading crypto launchpads for you to get access to the best opportunities. But first, let’s understand what it actually is. What is a Crypto Launchpad? Crypto launchpads are specialized platforms that connect developers with investors to advance the digital asset industry with innovative and exciting projects. These platforms enable new projects to gain attention, secure funding, and establish a strong foundation in the highly competitive crypto market. At the same time, they allow investors to find bold and exciting ideas to invest in early on, before they get to the market, and capture significant potential future upside. Why Choose Crypto Launchpads? As the digital asset market expands and its adoption grows, launchpads have become a key part of the crypto ecosystem. Here’s why using crypto launchpads is worth crucial consideration: - Quick and seamless access to early-stage opportunities at discounted prices. - Promising and reliable projects thanks to a rigorous selection process. - Increased token liquidity through subsequent exchange listings. - Established infrastructure to fundraise from a broad early supporter base & launch tokens. - Technical, marketing, and expert support boosts chances of success. How to Choose Crypto Launchpads? Making the right choice at the right time can enhance the chances of success through proper tools and resources. Here are the factors that can help one make the right decision: - Flawless reputation, credible history, and proven reliability. - A track record of successful project launches. - Proper and transparent process for selecting and vetting projects. - Security measures to prevent hacks and scams. - Clear fundraising terms, competitive fees, and support services. Best Crypto Launchpads for Investors Now, let’s check out some of the best crypto launchpads and their unique offerings. Binance Launchpad The world’s largest centralized exchange (CEX), Binance, has its fingers in every pie, and that includes the crowdfunding sector. Launched in 2018, Binance Launchpad is a leading platform that allows users to lock tokens and get airdrops. So far, a whopping $2.55 billion capital is locked onto the launchpad. What makes this launchpad popular among developers is the exposure to Binance’s massive user base around the world and access to significant liquidity in multiple trading pairs. The platform naturally takes advantage of its established infrastructure, which ensures legitimacy and security to both investors and project teams. Besides offering a platform to launch the token, Binance Launchpad also provides help and advice on the best way to issue their tokens. It actually provides a full-service offering that starts before the token is issued, to post-listing and marketing support. More than 100 projects have launched their tokens through Binance Launchpad, raising a total of $200 million in combined funding. The platform also boasts over six million all-time unique participants. Some of the most successful projects that conducted an offering via this launchpad include POL, FET, INJ, SAND, AXS, BTTC, and ARKM. The Binance-backed platform is the ideal choice for high-cap, premium projects, which can enjoy instant liquidity and a huge user base. However, it is completely controlled by Binance and considerably less decentralized than its competitors. Also, investors are required to hold the native token BNB and sometimes large amounts to get a meaningful allocation. Then there are restrictions on some regions, such as the EU, from participating in Binance Launchpad. CoinTerminal A relatively new entrant, being launched in 2023, CoinTerminal doesn’t have the same experience as others on this list, but even in a short timeframe, the launchpad has created a strong name for itself, having facilitated close to 90 early-stage projects. What sets this platform apart from others is the free access to high-quality projects that were once reserved for just a handful of insiders. This launchpad doesn't just lower entry barriers but removes them entirely for retail by allowing everyone around the world to get their hands on high-value investment opportunities, which go through a rigorous selection process before being hosted on CoinTerminal. There are no staking requirements here, and the selection process for token allocation is completely fair and random through the use of Chainlink VRF . The open-access CoinTerminal, which aims to democratize early-stage crypto investment, comes with the added benefits of a refundable sale with zero collateral option, ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ for maximum upside and limited downside, and enhanced transparency. AIT Protocol ($AIT), StarHeroes ($STAR), and Inspecf ($INSP) are among the successful launches hosted by CoinTerminal. Early adopters of new platforms will enjoy this low-entry-barrier platform that offers access to quality projects that one may not find anywhere else. While the all-inclusive, community-focused CoinTerminal is one of the leading emerging launchpads in the market, there is the usual risk of high volatility, besides KYC required of winners and limited tickets available for each pre-sale. CoinList Founded in 2017, CoinList is an established crypto launchpad platform known for hosting projects like ALGO, NEAR, and FIL. So, it has a strong track record in conducting successful token fundraising and offering new crypto opportunities before exchange listings. Tokens on CoinList are typically allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, and even if you successfully participate, there’s no guarantee that you will get tokens during the sale. However, a way to get into token launches and exclusive offerings is through karma, a point system that rewards your activity. And the more active one is, the higher their score, and the higher the chances of getting into deals. As a comprehensive platform, CoinList has launched a CEX, which supports both spot and derivatives trading. Using this feature, users can trade early assets and leverage more of their capital. The launchpad also offers staking services, which enable one to lock up their tokens and earn rewards. Furthermore, one can earn rewards by beta testing new products and providing valuable feedback. So, CoinList is the platform for regulatory-compliant investing, where you get access to top-tier projects and an integrated crypto exchange, but this comes at the cost of a lengthy KYC process and geo-restrictions . This means that not everyone is allowed to enjoy the opportunities that the platform has to offer. On top of that, investors have to deal with a tier-based system to participate in a token sale, and there’s no guarantee of getting an allocation. DAO Maker Next on our list is DAO Maker , an IDO launchpad that aims to give individual investors the ability to participate in interesting early-stage options that were previously reserved only for venture capital. DAO Maker isn’t just a launchpad, though, but an ecosystem that features its own native cryptocurrency required to invest in projects, a Vault for staking tokens and earning passive income, and Farms to provide liquidity and earn rewards. There is also a unique system called Strong Holder Offerings (SHOs), per which investors are selected for their holding behavior to ensure long-term support and commitment to the project’s success. To further help projects gain broader crypto market access, DAO Maker has integrated with BSC, 1inch, Ronin, and other chains so that protocols can enjoy enhanced liquidity and greater participation. ALICE, IPAD, and ORN are among the successful token launches facilitated by DAO Maker. While these projects delivered strong returns, not every single fundraiser has been successful. Hence, an investor must always be vigilant and do their proper due diligence. The retail-friendly DAO Maker, while an attractive platform to get your hands on quality projects before their big listings and for the long term, requires an investor to tie up their capital before they can participate in a sale. Staking the native DAO Token exposes users to not only volatility but also opportunity risk. Additionally, newcomers may find its interface a bit too complicated to navigate the high-risk crypto investment space. Seedify The last but not the least option is Seedify , a fully decentralized IDO platform that is constantly evolving to support both builders and investors. Each participant on Seedify has to go through a KYC process, which ensures regulatory compliance. And it’s only once you have completed your identity verification that you can participate in future IDOs based on your tier and $SFUND holdings. What this means is you must own $SFUND, and depending on how many of these tokens you own, you receive the IDO allocation. The idea behind this was to create a seed fund for blockchain innovations in a completely decentralized way so that everyone can support new projects, have a say in the platform's operations and future, and enable professionals to help projects in fields like communication, marketing, tokenomics, and community. $SFUND is available on many leading exchanges like Kucoin, Bybit, Huobi, Gate.io, Uniswap, and Packaswap, so you won’t have a hard time buying the asset, which can be staked and farmed to earn even more $SFUND tokens. By enabling staking, Seedify allows token holders to get reward tokens from all projects selected for funding and incubation. Then there are liquidity mining programs and rewards for community members who help projects succeed in different areas. Seedify is a strong option for GameFi, AI, and NFT-focused investors, but that also means there are sector-specific risks present here. While often seen as the future of gaming and digital ownership, GameFi and NFT sectors are experiencing a lull in activity and remain exposed to the broader crypto sector. On top of that, at Seedify, the ROI is tied to SFUND performance, which further increases the volatility risk. Conclusion These are some of the best crypto launchpads available on the market today. As the key components of the modern, fast-paced, and innovative blockchain world, these launchpads are helping shape the crypto industry. By offering a quick and easy way to raise money to bring ideas into reality and connecting them with potential investors who can invest in high-quality early-stage projects, these launchpads provide a secure and seamless way for both parties to contribute to the future of crypto. But that’s not all. These crypto launchpads are more than just fundraising platforms; they are the incubators of tomorrow’s blockchain giants, offering technical support, marketing resources, and access to strong communities. With the right launchpad, you can also position yourself for the next wave of breakout blockchain success stories! Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Alongside, the company — which currently holds 4,449 bitcoin worth about $462 million — announced a goal of owning at least 10,000 bitcoin by the end of this year, 42,000 by year-end 2026 and 105,000 by year-end 2027. ""We are excited to have Joe join our Bitcoin strategy team and help drive our three-year-plan to own 105,000 Bitcoins,"" said company Chairman Eric Semler in a press release . ""Joe is an analytical thought leader on Bitcoin and Bitcoin treasury companies. His expertise will be instrumental as we pursue our Bitcoin treasury strategy and aim to deliver long-term value to our stockholders."" ""For over seven years, [Joe] has publicly been making the case for Bitcoin as the world's most advanced form of monetary technology,"" the release continued. ""He previously served as director of market research at Unchained, a Bitcoin-focused financial services company."" Investors, for now, are applauding the news, sending SMLR higher by 14% on Friday even as bitcoin has dipped back below $104,000 and most BTC-related stocks are trading in the red. Prior to today, though, it's been a rough ride for SMLR, which remains lower by 33% year-to-date and more than 50% off its 2025 high above $80. The sharp share price decline has left the company's market capitalization at or below the value of the bitcoin on its balance sheet — thus taking off the table the ability to accretively raise money for more BTC purchases through common share sales. The hiring of Burnett and lofty BTC acquisition goals suggests Semler is likely to get creative with capital raising plans, perhaps — in similar fashion to Michael Saylor's Strategy — turning to the preferred share market.",Markets|Semler scientific|News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-20 17:12:35

While Ethereum’s momentum gathers steam, another major plot twist is unfolding in the meme coin arena—Shiba Inu, once considered the top dog among meme coins, is now losing investor attention to a fresh and feisty newcomer: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . As Ethereum sets its sights on a $4,000 target, it has become increasingly clear that both institutional and retail investors are flocking to ETH at a surprising rate. But what’s even more captivating is how LILPEPE has emerged as the next big name in the meme coin space, outshining Shiba Inu and becoming a magnet for those looking for the next explosive crypto gem. Ethereum Leads the Charge with Strong ETF Inflows and DeFi Dominance Ethereum’s recent price strength is no accident. Over the past month, the Ethereum ecosystem has experienced a surge of institutional interest, driven by the approval and success of several spot Ethereum ETFs. According to Farside Investors, nine Ethereum ETFs collectively pulled in $52.7 million on June 9 alone. BlackRock ’s ETHA led the charge with $35.2 million in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FETH with $12.9 million and Grayscale’s ETH ETF with $4.6 million. These consistent inflows since May 22 signal deep investor conviction in Ethereum’s future. Crypto expert Nik Tomaino has highlighted ETH’s critical role in the DeFi sector, describing Ethereum as the “backbone of decentralized finance.” With Ethereum powering the issuance of stablecoins, DEXs, and collateralized loan platforms, it’s clear that ETH isn’t just surviving—it’s thriving. The stablecoin market capitalization on Ethereum Layer-1 increased by 11% in 2025 alone, solidifying ETH’s foundational role in the blockchain economy. While Ripple (XRP) continues to make headlines with its regulatory battles and hopes for an upcoming ETF, the market has voted with its dollars—and that vote is currently leaning toward Ethereum. But ETH isn’t the only surprise winner this June. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin That’s Dethroning Shiba Inu Built on its own Layer 2 blockchain, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is not just another dog-faced token riding a viral wave. It’s an actual infrastructure project, engineered for blazing-fast speeds, ultra-low fees, and the security needed to support a vibrant ecosystem of decentralized applications—all infused with a meme-powered personality. LILPEPE is still in its early presale stage but is already shaking the foundations of the meme coin world. With $1,325,000 already raised and Stage 2 selling out rapidly, LILPEPE has now entered Stage 3, offering tokens at just $0.0012. With 1 billion tokens available in this round and a target raise of $1.2 million, demand is sky-high. The presale itself is capped at 26.5% of the total 100 billion token supply, ensuring a fair and strategic distribution. LILPEPE’s Tokenomics and Unique Features LILPEPE’s tokenomics reveal a thoughtful distribution designed to balance growth, liquidity, and community incentives: 10% – Liquidity: To ensure smooth, uninterrupted trading. 30% – Chain Reserves: Fueling future upgrades and Layer 2 ecosystem growth. 10% – DEX Allocation: For seamless decentralized trading at launch. 10% – Marketing: To amplify global reach with memes, influencers, and creative content. 13.5% – Staking & Rewards: To reward loyal holders with passive income. 0% – Tax: Yes, you read that right. Zero buy/sell tax. DeFi the way it was meant to be—clean, permissionless, and community-first. Major Exchange Listings and a $770,000 Giveaway To further boost its appeal, LILPEPE has confirmed listings on two major centralized exchanges at launch, with the world’s largest exchange also on board. This level of exposure provides early investors with the kind of exit liquidity and potential price action that few meme coins ever experience. And if that weren’t enough, LILPEPE is giving back to its growing community with an eye-popping $770,000 giveaway . Ten lucky winners will each receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens.

As legacy chains face new challenges, emerging contenders like Qubetics are drawing buyer interest for their focus on real-world applications and long-term sustainability. At the same time, Polygon has made headlines again. Jordi Baylina, co-founder of Polygon zkEVM, has introduced a new project: Zisk. Meanwhile, Tron is under scrutiny. For the first time, average TRON transaction fees have surpassed Ethereum’s, hitting $0.002 per transfer. Once celebrated for its low fees, Tron is now facing tough questions. As uncertainty builds, the spotlight is shifting toward projects like Qubetics, which offer a stable, utility-driven path forward in an increasingly fragmented landscape. How Qubetics Brings Practical Blockchain Solutions to the Forefront Qubetics ($TICS) sets itself apart through its flagship feature: a Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet that simplifies blockchain access for all types of users. This tool connects with over 20 major blockchain networks and allows users to send, receive, and manage assets without relying on centralized exchanges. From small businesses accepting crypto payments to freelancers working across borders, the wallet supports real use cases while maintaining full user control. For example, a digital artist can receive payment from clients using Ethereum, Polygon, or Tron, and manage everything in one secure wallet, no extra apps or platforms needed. A software company integrating Web3 functionality into its platform can route multi-chain transactions through Qubetics, cutting down on technical overhead. Even in gaming, developers can offer rewards across different chains, allowing users to access their assets seamlessly. As more users and companies look for dependable, multi-chain support in one place, Qubetics presents a reliable and accessible solution. With its real-world utility and expanding user base, this platform stands as a strong candidate for those seeking the best crypto under $1 in 2025. Final Presale Opportunity: Best Crypto Under $1 With Strong ROI Potential The Qubetics presale is currently in Stage 37, which marks its final phase before launch. Each $TICS token is available at $0.3370. Once the public listing goes live at $0.40, those who purchase now will immediately benefit from a 20% return. This opportunity is attracting significant attention, especially as the supply has been reduced from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion tokens. With 38.55% of tokens reserved for public buyers, Qubetics is prioritizing community access over internal allocations. So far, more than $18 million has been raised, with over 516 million tokens sold and 28,100+ holders participating. Only 9 million tokens remain in this stage, meaning time is limited. Analysts are already projecting a notable price rise after listing, driven by the platform’s strong fundamentals, limited supply, and demand from early supporters. To illustrate the potential, consider this: a $35,000 purchase at the current price would secure approximately 103,846 $TICS tokens. Once listed at $0.40, that amount would already be worth $41,538. If the price reaches $5 in the upcoming market cycle, the value climbs to $519,230. Should $TICS hit $10—as some analysts suggest—that initial $35,000 could grow to over $1 million. For early adopters looking to join a well-structured, utility-focused blockchain project, the “ Qubetics presale” presents a rare opportunity. With real product use, fixed pricing, and a potential for long-term growth, this “crypto presale” deserves close consideration. Polygon Reinforces Its Vision Through ZK Stack Innovation Polygon’s influence continues through Zisk, Jordi Baylina’s latest venture focused on zero-knowledge technology. Built on the ZK Stack, Zisk allows developers to build hyperchains, rollups tailored to specific applications. These chains offer customizable governance, data availability, and sequencing features. This model empowers developers to operate independently while still benefiting from Ethereum’s base security. Baylina’s move reflects a return to his earlier ambitions for Polygon zkEVM, which had shifted direction within Polygon Labs. Zisk restores the emphasis on modularity, showing that there is room for parallel innovation outside of core teams. As a result, Polygon’s technology continues to expand its reach, even if through a separate channel. For developers and participants interested in zk rollup scalability, this is a promising signal. Tron Faces Growing Pains as Costs and Concerns Rise Tron has seen extensive usage, but its affordability is now in question. According to recent reports, Tron’s transaction fees are now more expensive than Ethereum’s. Though $0.002 might seem minimal, it contradicts Tron’s long-held reputation as a low-cost alternative. This change is drawing attention, particularly as activity increases and congestion worsens. Adding to the concern is the launch of JustLend DAO. While the platform has quickly grown in size, some members of the blockchain community remain skeptical about its foundation and sustainability. The project’s fast rise in TVL numbers has led to discussions about the risks involved with aggressive growth and overexposure. These shifts raise questions about Tron’s long-term stability. While the network continues to grow, challenges around cost efficiency and platform integrity could make it harder to maintain trust. Compared with newer projects focused on transparency and long-term value, Tron may face hurdles ahead. Final Thoughts: Which Token Stands Out in 2025? Polygon continues to build on its legacy through advanced zero-knowledge solutions like Zisk. Tron remains active but is navigating increasing transaction costs and scrutiny over its DeFi platforms. Qubetics, however, offers a balanced mix of accessibility, long-term value, and practical use cases, all at a fixed rate during its final public offering. With fewer than 10 million tokens remaining and a solid user foundation already in place, Qubetics presents a strong case for those seeking high-utility tokens with measurable ROI potential. For those evaluating options, now may be the best time to join this best crypto presale before the window closes.

LILPEPE takes on DOGE,https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/20/which-meme-coin-will-secure-your-future-lilpepe-takes-on-doge/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) may have paved the way for meme coins, but 2025 is already proving that new contenders are rising fast. While DOGE is trading at a little over $0.18 and showing signs of consolidation, the majority of investors are searching for the immense promise that the meme coin sector holds. One name continues to gain serious traction: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) —a meme token with real infrastructure and already attracting waves of early investment. While DOGE has nostalgia and a loyal fanbase, LILPEPE is catching up with its innovation, Layer 2 blockchain, and aggressive presale hype. The question on everyone’s mind is: can LILPEPE be the next meme coin to make your future? Dogecoin (DOGE): the original meme giant still holding on Dogecoin remains the face of meme coins for most investors. Initially developed as a joke in 2013, it has since evolved into a serious competitor, boasting celebrity endorsements and a strong community. DOGE is currently trading, as of June 2025, at approximately $0.18, with analysts eagerly awaiting a breakthrough above $0.1704. Despite its popularity, DOGE’s development has stabilized to some extent. It lacks the modern infrastructure that newer tokens are building. Dogecoin, too, is based on proof-of-work; therefore, energy costs are increased, and transaction speed is decreased, which is increasingly known to investors. The hype can further boost the development of DOGE; however, technical constraints and a lack of a clear development plan pose serious doubts about its success. Some people are now searching for a meme coin that offers more than a brand name. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): the new meme coin that’s built for the future Enter Little Pepe (LILPEPE), a meme token that goes beyond hype. Supported by a bespoke Layer 2 blockchain designed explicitly for meme tokens, LILPEPE boasts lightning-fast, low-fee transactions, sniper-bot protection, and zero-tax trading—all major upgrades over older tokens like DOGE and even Shiba Inu (SHIB). With its Pepe’s Pump Pad, LILPEPE enables meme creators to launch tokens featuring built-in liquidity locks and anti-rug pull functionality—a feature that brings a real-world use case to the meme coin universe. This aspect alone gives LILPEPE a utility advantage that Dogecoin simply can’t compete with. Investors have been taking notice. The LILPEPE presale has already raised over $1.2 million, with Stage 2 selling out quickly. This strong momentum shows that LILPEPE is more than a meme—it’s a movement. Massive $777K giveaway pumping LILPEPE’s hype LILPEPE organized a massive $777,000 giveaway to drive awareness, where 10 winners received $77,000 worth of tokens each. One of the largest meme coin giveaways of 2025, it generated hype and attracted thousands of new users to the ecosystem. 🌐 Join the giveaway here: littlepepe.com/777k-giveaway How to buy $LILPEPE during presale It’s easy to participate in the presale: Download MetaMask or Trust Wallet Fund your wallet with ETH or USDT (ERC-20) Visit littlepepe.com and connect your wallet. Buy $LILPEPE tokens directly. Tokens can be traded when the presale is over. The prices increase in every tier, so the earlier one invests, the more they benefit. DOGE vs. LILPEPE: which holds the future? Dogecoin (DOGE) remains the classic meme coin, trading at around $0.18 in June 2025. Propelled by years of hype and popularity within its community, it remains a presence, but with limitations. With slower and more costly transactions and no major upgrades, DOGE is struggling to keep up. On the other hand, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is quickly changing the meme coin script. Listed at just $0.0011 during presale, it’s developed on a meme-optimized Layer 2 blockchain with lightning speed, tax-free trading, sniper-bot protection, and “Pepe’s Pump Pad” for safe token launches. It has already generated over $1,000,000 in presales and is offering a $ 777,000 giveaway to fuel adoption. Where DOGE represents nostalgia, LILPEPE offers real infrastructure and explosive potential. For investors seeking the next breakout phenomenon with both virality and use case, LILPEPE is quickly becoming the meme coin to watch in 2025. Conclusion: which meme coin can secure your future? Dogecoin still enjoys robust name-brand recognition, but it is falling behind other newer tokens that offer better speed, scalability, and investor protection. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is only one of these tokens, quickly gaining popularity. It is built using real technology and backed by a community that’s growing by the second. With its Layer 2 blockchain, creator-first launchpad, sniper-bot protection, and viral giveaway campaign, LILPEPE is no ordinary meme coin. It’s the new benchmark for what meme tokens can and should be. For anyone looking to get in early on the next wave of crypto growth, LILPEPE has the tech, the timing, and the tools to be a contender.

In a statement, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the central bank could slash interest rates as early as its July meeting. He cited a slowing economy and noted that the impact of tariffs on inflation would be muted and short-lived. Waller also said he believes the Fed’s benchmark rate is currently about 1.25% to 1.50% above the estimated neutral rate. He said : “I think we’ve got room to bring it down, and then we can kind of see what happens with inflation. We’ve been on pause for six months to wait and see, and so far the data has been fine.” His statement came two days after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged between 4.25% and 4.50% and hinted that it will deliver two more cuts later this year. You might also like: Best crypto to buy ahead of Friday’s $6.5b triple witching It also came as the Fed faces substantial pressure from Donald Trump who has called for a full point cut. He has cited the European Central Bank, which has slashed rates eight times since last year. A Federal Reserve cut would be a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other altcoins like Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), and Cardano ( ADA ). Historically, these assets do well when the Fed is cutting interest rates, such as during the COVID pandemic in 2020 and 2021. Waller’s statement comes as third-party data shows growing demand for Ethereum and Bitcoin from Wall Street investors, possibly in anticipation of a Fed policy shift. Spot Bitcoin ETFs added $389 million in inflows on Wednesday, bringing total inflows this month to $2.28 billion. Over the past three months, they’ve added more than $10 billion, with cumulative inflows reaching $46.65 billion. Similarly, spot Ethereum ETFs have attracted nearly $1.5 billion in inflows over the past three months, with total inflows now approaching $3.9 billion. These flows help explain the declining supply of Bitcoin and Ethereum on exchanges, and why their prices may bounce back in the near term.

Table of Contents Ethereum: A force that keeps growing Little Pepe: The memecoin that’s more than just hype The $777k giveaway that’s generating buzz How to invest in LILPEPE in presale Presale momentum and future outlook Is LILPEPE the best ETH-based token to buy in 2025? Ethereum (ETH) has been a stalwart in the cryptocurrency world, particularly among innovative contract platforms, for years. As of mid-2025, Ethereum remains in existence, with its network’s use still going strong and updates in progress. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , though, a serious infrastructure-backed memecoin with quickly growing investor interest, is but one of many lesser-known projects running on the Ethereum network that is starting to overtake it in short-term prospects and viral attraction. On sale for less than $0.0015 in presale, LILPEPE is not some hype-grabbing memecoin. With real Layer 2 usability, explosive presale growth, and a major giveaway campaign underway, it’s quickly becoming one of the top cryptocurrencies to invest in 2025 for early adopters seeking exponential gains. It may not yet have the ambit of Ethereum, but it’s already starting to show the early signs of a high-ROI contender in the short term. You might also like: Shiba Inu exploded in 2021, PEPE in 2023, this frog token under $0.002 could soar in 2025 Ethereum: A force that keeps growing The price of Ethereum is currently fluctuating around $3,800 as of June 2025 and is predicted chiefly to climb over $5,000 by the end of the year. Despite this, ETH’s low scalability and high transaction fees are a hurdle for memecoin creators and retail investors. It is precisely this niche that Little Pepe seeks to occupy. Ethereum is paving the way, but tokens like LILPEPE are reducing the barriers to entry for meme creators and retail investors. Little Pepe: The memecoin that’s more than just hype Little Pepe is built on an Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 blockchain, focusing on memecoins in its vision. It accommodates tax-free, lightning-fast transfers with sniper-bot security — a feature of utmost importance that safeguards the original investors from unfair presale manipulation. That added layer of fairness and transparency is just one reason why LILPEPE’s community is growing so rapidly. What LILPEPE does differently is its focus on proper infrastructure. In a time when the majority of meme tokens remain founded on hype alone, LILPEPE introduces Pepe’s Pump Pad. This launchpad enables meme creators to create tokens with liquidity locks and anti-rug pull features, offering a safer environment for both creators and investors. With the deployment of scalability, security, and fair tokenomics, LILPEPE is now more than just another memecoin; it represents the entire industry. The project is also actively recruiting creators and has already attracted the attention of many crypto communities on Telegram and X. The $777k giveaway that’s generating buzz To further build momentum, Little Pepe has launched one of the most outrageous giveaway promotions in meme coin history: a $777,000 giveaway , with 10 winners to receive $77,000 apiece in LILPEPE tokens. This audacious marketing push is more than creating waves; it’s building community loyalty and generating massive presale demand. The giveaway aligns with LILPEPE’s community-focused ethos and commitment to rewarding early adopters.

Purchase LILPEPE tokens directly on the page. The tokens will be tradable after the presale, with prices increasing at each stage, so early buyers have the best entry point. With each subsequent stage featuring higher token prices, buyers in Stage 3 and beyond may already possess unrealized gains on prior investments. Presale momentum and future outlook Little Pepe presale is rolling quickly. Stage 1 sold out within 72 hours. Stage 2 followed soon after, and the project is now over $1 million in value.

Traders are now combing through the microcap space, hunting for the next big play. Although veterans like BONK still sit at the top, newcomers such as Angry Pepe Fork ($APORK) have started popping up in chats and tweets. Even in pre-sale, $APORK looks to be more than a meme coin. Analysts say its cross-chain expansion, real-use features, and deflationary tokenomics give it a shot at outpacing BONK when the next wave rolls in. BONK: Solid Legacy, But Fading Narrative? Debuted in late 2022, BONK is also recognized as a symbol of a comeback. As a Solana-native meme coin, BONK soon generated support owing to its timeliness, dog-themed branding, and connection with Solana's revived ecology. However, BONK's growth story has now stalled. As of now, BONK is trading more than 70% down from its all-time high. The lack of a deflationary mechanism, staking incentives, and on-chain value has resulted in lower long-term investor loyalty. APORK: A Meme Token Built for Mechanics, Not Just Memes Unlike BONK, Angry Pepe Fork ($APORK) is the “coordinated meme coin”— a currency designed to combine virality and tokenomics in order to grow in value over and over again. Launched in June 2025, $APORK possesses unique features not typically seen in meme coins. When they use the CommunityFi system, they earn $APORK by producing content, contributing to the project's growth, and promoting overall growth, which translates their contributions into direct on-chain rewards. $APORK will also be used to play on-chain mini games on the GambleFi platform, with each purchase, some tokens will be instantly burned, leading to constant deflation. The staking tokenomics would enable presale staking deals offering over 10,000% APYs, which incentivise early adopters to remain invested. $BONK is and may be available only to Solana, $APORK will be available on Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Solana, increasing liquidity and user reach. $APORK is capped at 1.9 billion , with 380 million of supply being available in presale. But what places $APORK in genuine microcap territory is its soft cap of 4 million and a hard cap of $10 million. In comparison, BONK's supply of 90 trillion makes supply constraints and value per token boost substantially more difficult without external excitement. Final Thought BONK remains an integral component of Solana's meme history. Whereas $APORK is being positioned as a genetic successor, with economic logic, viral structure , and chain-agnostic expansion. While the risks are higher due to $APORK being in the early stages of development, the asymmetrical upside is what analysts are rooting for. In the present market cycle, small caps with genuine mechanics can deliver the biggest surprises, and $APORK, which has lately been under the radar, is making buzz in all the right areas.

The aim is to support innovation while keeping investors safe. The new rules could also give crypto exchanges more freedom, especially in listing utility tokens. Exchanges May List Their Crypto in Thailand In a press release shared on June 20, the SEC says the proposed changes aim to keep up with the fast growth of the crypto industry in Thailand. Under the draft rules, crypto exchanges operating in the country, like Kucoin , could be allowed to list utility tokens they issue themselves or through affiliated companies. This shifts from previous restrictions and could give platforms more ways to offer digital assets that serve specific uses. Another important change would require exchanges to disclose the identities of people linked to each listed token and include warning alerts in their systems so the SEC can better monitor for insider trading. If the rules are approved, platforms would have 90 days to provide this information for tokens already on the market. The SEC has opened the public consultation process and will accept comments until July 21. This allows market participants, developers, and investors to share their views on the proposed changes. Thailand’s Bigger Push for Crypto Growth This move is part of Thailand’s larger effort to grow its digital asset market . Earlier this week, the Thai government approved a five-year tax break for people who earn income by selling cryptocurrencies. The aim is to boost the economy and help local entrepreneurs. Thailand is also preparing to launch about $150 million worth of digital investment tokens later this year. These tokens are designed to offer higher returns than regular bank deposits. The SEC is also investigating whether Thai-based Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be listed on local exchanges. This could make it easier for regular Thai investors to invest in crypto. Deputy Finance Minister Julapun Amornvivat said the government wants to turn Thailand into a global center for digital assets.

The talks between the two centered on the role of the Tron network and blockchain technology in advancing U.S. crypto leadership. Details of The Meet-up Sun shared insights in an X post , saying, “It was a pleasure meeting Bo Hines to discuss how Tron and blockchain technology can support U.S. leadership in digital assets.” Most crypto community members who responded to Sun’s post reacted positively to their meeting. Many thanked him for his role in the crypto industry. Others praised the platform for driving real change and expressed expectations for bullish results for its native TRX token. Sun acknowledged Hines’ support of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, stating it will help accelerate much-needed reforms in crypto legislation. He also thanked the Digital Sovereignty Alliance for initiating the talks and supporting the advancement of the landmark bill. After passing the U.S. Senate in a 68 to 30 vote on June 17, the legislation now moves to the Republican-controlled House before it can be made into law. It aims to create a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, including clear rules on reserves, audits, and consumer protections. Hines’ Efforts in The Crypto Industry Hines has become a key figure in the digital asset space after President Donald Trump appointed him as his Crypto Czar last year. During his first 30 days in office, the former U.S. congressional candidate convened with industry leaders to help shape the administration’s digital asset strategy. Among the most high-profile meetings were sessions with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who later praised Trump’s push for regulatory clarity, and Andreessen Horowitz partners Chris Dixon and Marc Andreessen. Meanwhile, the president has come under scrutiny for his crypto dealings as well as his budding relationship with Sun. Earlier in the year, the crypto entrepreneur put $75 million into the Trump-affiliated decentralized finance (DeFi) project, World Liberty Financial, becoming its single largest investor. He was also recently part of a group of wealthy crypto enthusiasts who had an exclusive dinner with the head of state, after coughing up more than $18 million to buy a huge stash of Trump’s official meme coin. And only days ago, the president’s son, Eric, was forced to deny rumors that he was part of Tron’s proposed reverse merger with SRM Entertainment, even though he referred to Sun as a “great friend and an icon.” It has led Democratic legislators to call for investigations into Trump’s crypto dealings over fears of fraud and conflict of interest.

However, as market trends shift, industry leaders are beginning to prioritize projects with real-world utility over sheer speed or scalability. Ruvi AI (RUVI) is emerging as a standout in this arena, combining blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver practical solutions across multiple industries. Analysts believe Ruvi AI, with its structured growth and potential 66x ROI, could surpass Solana in this year’s bull run. Why Analysts Say Ruvi AI Is Set for Success Solana focuses on blockchain scalability and supports decentralized applications (dApps), but Ruvi AI offers much more than a fast network. Leveraging AI, Ruvi AI addresses real-world problems in sectors like marketing, entertainment, and finance. For investors, this level of utility means predictable, long-term value rather than reliance on speculative market sentiment. A key differentiator is Ruvi AI’s structured growth model. Currently, during Phase 2 of its presale, RUVI tokens are priced at an accessible $0.015 each. The price is locked to increase to $0.07 post-presale, delivering an almost 5x ROI before exchange listing. Analysts predict a value of $1 per token post-listing, which translates to an extraordinary 66x ROI from the presale price. This focus on measurable growth puts Ruvi AI ahead of speculative assets like Solana. Ruvi AI’s Presale is Making Waves Ruvi AI’s presale performance highlights its strong appeal among both retail and institutional investors. The project has already: Raised over $1.9 million, Attracted more than 1,600 holders, and Sold over 160 million tokens. What’s particularly notable about Ruvi AI’s presale is its guaranteed post-presale price increase to $0.07 per token. This transparent pricing strategy ensures investors can lock in significant value right from the start, creating a level of trust rarely seen in crypto markets. VIP Tiers Unlock Big Returns To further incentivize early investors, Ruvi AI offers VIP investment tiers that multiply potential profits with bonus token allocations. Here’s a breakdown of these tiers: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These VIP tiers not only reward early adoption but also provide a structured path to exponential earnings. Transparency and Security Set Ruvi AI Apart Ruvi AI differentiates itself in the crowded crypto space by emphasizing trust and safety. The platform is currently undergoing a third-party audit by CyberScope, a globally recognized blockchain auditing firm. This audit certification will further solidify Ruvi AI’s standing as a secure and reliable investment. The project’s partnership with WEEX Exchange ensures post-presale liquidity, allowing investors to trade their RUVI tokens immediately after the presale ends. This seamless trading ecosystem further enhances Ruvi AI’s credibility and appeal. Real-World Utility Drives Ruvi AI’s Future One of Ruvi AI’s greatest strengths is its ability to deliver real-world applications across industries, unlike Solana, which remains focused on infrastructure for developers. Here’s how Ruvi AI’s solutions stand out: Marketing: By integrating AI, Ruvi AI helps businesses optimize campaigns, improve ad targeting, and boost ROI through data-driven insights. Entertainment: Content creators use blockchain-secured payment systems and AI tools to monetize their work and engage audiences more effectively. Finance: Ruvi AI’s fraud detection tools, scalability enhancements, and operational transparency support financial institutions in modernizing their systems. This practical usability ensures Ruvi AI’s token demand is rooted in tangible value rather than speculation. Why Ruvi AI Might Outperform Solana Ruvi AI’s combination of utility, projected high returns, and structured growth makes it a standout during the market’s current bull run. With a $0.015 presale price, guaranteed $0.07 valuation post-presale, and a projected $1 listing price, Ruvi AI is ready to deliver life-changing returns to its investors. Having raised over $1.9 million and sold 160 million tokens, coupled with strong institutional backing from CyberScope and WEEX Exchange, Ruvi AI is emerging as the choice for investors seeking high-growth opportunities. If you’re looking to join a project that blends real-world utility with incredible ROI potential, Ruvi AI might just be the next big thing in crypto investing.

Ruvi AI (RUVI) is distinguishing itself by leveraging artificial intelligence to create impactful solutions, especially in marketing, entertainment, and financial services. This approach may well provide Ruvi AI an edge over platforms like Solana, traditionally focused more on infrastructure capabilities. Detailed Analysis of Ruvi AI's Market Strategy Ruvi AI's approach to building a practical and versatile blockchain platform underscores its potential to outperform competitors. The integration of AI into blockchain technology not only enhances efficiency but also opens up new avenues for application in critical sectors. This blend of technology is designed to drive significant return on investment, as evidenced by the presale strategy of Ruvi AI. During its ongoing Phase 2 presale, RUVI tokens are being offered at $0.015 each, with an anticipated increase to $0.07 post-presale, marking a significant early gain for investors. Analysts project a potential increase to $1 per token following public listing, suggesting a possible 66x return from the initial presale price—a compelling argument for those looking at long-term investment growth. Tangible Benefits Offered by Ruvi AI's Tokenomics The structured presale and clear tiered investment bonuses underscore Ruvi AI's strategic market position. The project offers VIP investment tiers that provide bonus tokens, amplifying the potential returns: VIP Tier 2 involves a $750 investment for a 40% bonus, multiplying the investment's value significantly by the time tokens reach a projected $1 valuation. VIP Tier 3 demands a $2,100 investment but offers a 60% bonus, further enhancing potential earnings. The highest, VIP Tier 5, requires a $9,600 investment but doubles the number of tokens received, maximizing the possible financial outcome. These carefully structured incentives are designed to attract a broad spectrum of investors, from small-scale to institutional patrons, offering them a clear path to substantial financial returns. Security and Transparency: Ruvi AI's Commitment Unlike many speculative crypto ventures, Ruvi AI emphasizes security and investor trust. An ongoing third-party audit by CyberScope aims to ensure the integrity and security of the platform, enhancing investor confidence. Additionally, the collaboration with WEEX Exchange will facilitate immediate liquidity post-presale, making RUVI tokens readily tradable—a crucial factor for investor reassurance. Why Ruvi AI Could Surpass Solana in the Upcoming Market Surge Ruvi AI's market strategy, focused on real-world applications empowered by AI, positions it as a formidable contender in the blockchain space. With solid financial incentives for early investors and a robust framework for growth and security, Ruvi AI is not just a technological innovation but a potentially lucrative investment opportunity. As Solana continues to enhance its infrastructure, Ruvi AI's focus on delivering practical, AI-driven solutions might just give it the upper hand in the next bull run.

The possible buy comes amid ongoing conflict in the Middle East, which has rattled the global financial markets. The company recently purchased BTC on June 9, buying around $110 million worth of BTC. According to recent charts, Strategy has over $20 billion in unrealized gains from its BTC purchases. Saylor’s announcement of an upcoming purchase is a sign of growing investor confidence in the crypto sector amid a massive regional conflict. What The Future holds For Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The resilience that the crypto market has demonstrated in the ongoing Iran-Israel conflict shows the high level of confidence that investors have in crypto. It could also signal that the upcoming altcoin rally could be the biggest ever. Traditionally, crypto has done quite poorly during destabilizing conflicts around the world. The recent resilience shows that investors continue to build positions in the crypto sector in preparation for an upcoming bull run. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has not been spared and has been experiencing growing investor interest in recent weeks. As investors look for opportunities for upside in the altcoin rally, they are turning to the presale market and identifying strong, promising projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that are built for utility. The Mutuum Finance Protocol Mutuum Finance is a decentralized non-custodial protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. When they join as lenders, they deposit their assets in a pool and begin earning interest. The interest that they earn in the pool is set dynamically by the pool utilization rate. As the value of loans taken from a pool grows, relative to the total in the pool, the utilization rate rises, which pushes up the interest rate. This higher interest rate encourages borrowers to repay their loans, while also attracting more lenders to deposit their assets. Over time, this increases the total liquidity in a pool, which lowers the rates. The result is that the protocol achieves optimal capital efficiency on its own. When lenders deposit assets in a pool, they receive mtTokens in exchange. For instance, when a lender deposits $1,200 worth of AVAX in a communal pool, they receive mtAVAX tokens in exchange on a 1:1 ratio. These mtTokens represent the value of the deposit in the pool, plus any interest accrued. The mtTokens also make it easy for holders to track the performance of their position in a pool with ease. Additionally, they simplify the entire process as lenders do not have to actively claim or compound their gains in a pool. Security On Mutuum Finance The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will come with several security features that will ensure all users are safe. One of these features is the address screening, while all new crypto addresses will be checked by a third-party audit service before they can transact on the platform. If they are found to have any past misconduct in the crypto world, they will not be allowed on the platform. This will be an important part of the legal compliance procedures on Mutuum Finance, ensuring the protocol is available to as many people as possible. They will also have in place measures to protect the client application security, such as DNS integrity protection. This will ensure that the platform does not fall victim to DNS spoofing and unauthorized domain transfers. To achieve this, they will deploy the DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions), which will validate DNS data to reduce the chances of tampering. Additionally, there will be active monitoring and regular updates to the DNS configuration to ensure it has the highest domain-level security possible. MUTM Presale Details Mutuum Finance is currently in phase 5 of the presale, where tokens are selling for $0.03. The current token price represents a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. So far, over $10.8 million worth of tokens have been sold in the ongoing presale. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. The presale has experienced a massive surge in participation levels, which has seen 40% of the tokens set aside for phase sold, barely two weeks after they launched. A major catalyst for the pace is the expected launch of the beta version of the platform. This beta launch is expected to cause an online hype, generating a massive amount of organic traffic for the project. Additionally, it is expected to contribute to further upside for MUTM tokens. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents the perfect opportunity to position yourself to benefit from the upcoming flood of institutional capital into crypto. Instead of chasing 2% gains in major coins like Bitcoin, which are trading near the top of their pricing, you could experience gains of over 2000% when MUTM tokens go live.

In a recent chart shared on X, EGRAG unveiled a long-term technical setup that could signal the beginning of a historic breakout for XRP. But amid the bullish excitement, he urges investors to remain strategic and realistic about potential price levels. As of now, XRP trades at approximately $2.15, having steadily consolidated around the $2 mark following a powerful rally in late 2024. This surge pushed XRP to its highest levels in years, prompting early investors to begin realizing gains, with a recent report showing profit-taking averaging over $68.8 million per day on a 7-day simple moving average (7D-SMA). With profit realization accelerating, the question shifts from “when to buy” to “when to sell.” Historical Patterns, Future Possibilities EGRAG’s latest chart outlines a massive multi-year symmetrical triangle pattern that strongly resembles the setup leading to XRP’s legendary rally in 2017. That breakout took XRP from below $0.01 to nearly $3.84 in a matter of months. His analysis suggests XRP has once again broken out of a long-standing triangle, this time stretching from 2018 through 2024. #XRP – Choose Your Targets Wisely: pic.twitter.com/DmI4vHKeDO — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 20, 2025 The pattern suggests that the recent breakout toward the $2 range may be just the beginning. EGRAG draws a strong correlation between the previous structure and the current one, implying that XRP could be poised for another parabolic move, if history repeats. Price Targets: From Rational to Remarkable EGRAG’s chart doesn’t just highlight a breakout — it also maps out potential target zones. These targets range from $3.5, a conservative estimate, to over $17, a more aggressive projection. These levels are derived from Fibonacci extensions and measured moves based on the triangle’s height. But the key takeaway from EGRAG’s post isn’t the numbers, it’s the strategy. He warns against emotional decision-making, whether it’s selling too early out of fear or holding on too long chasing dreams of overnight wealth. Instead, he advocates for scaling out intelligently and setting pre-planned exit points that align with each investor’s personal goals.

XRP is still navigating its long-running legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Although Judge Analisa Torres ruled in July 2023 that XRP is not a security when sold to retail investors, the issue of institutional sales remains unresolved. On June 12, 2025, Ripple and the SEC refiled their settlement terms , and the crypto world now awaits Judge Torres’ final decision. The outcome could either strengthen XRP’s legal clarity or prolong regulatory uncertainty. Yet, this hasn’t stopped Ripple from advancing its ecosystem, including the rollout of the RLUSD stablecoin and multiple CBDC partnerships, which continue to build fundamental value for XRP. Final Thoughts EGRAG Crypto’s analysis offers a compelling long-term view for XRP holders, underpinned by historical patterns and disciplined forecasting. As XRP hovers around $2.15, the temptation to dream big is understandable. But the true challenge lies in preparation. Choosing your price targets wisely and sticking to them might be the difference between short-term hype and long-term success.

On Thursday, COO Kash Dhanda said the move is being made to redirect energies toward product development and push growth. He emphasized that Jupiter is “on the cusp of an inflection point,” and that the chance to shape the future of DeFi “won’t stay open for much longer.” Current DAO mechanics are not working to drive substantive progress, but to fracture and slow down, according to Dhanda. Governance Structure to Be Rethought The current DAO framework, in Dhanda’s opinion, is “stuck in a negative feedback loop.” To disable this, Jupiter will halt all DAO voting and new proposal submission until a more united and viable system is established. Ongoing projects, staking rewards, and working groups that have received funding will not be halted. The community reserve, however, will not be tapped into during the pause. Community development programs will instead be funded from Jupiter’s operations treasury. Reforms Expected in 2026 While no new model of governance has yet been proposed, Dhanda made it clear this is not the end of decentralized governance for Jupiter. DAO voting will resume in 2026, following the construction of a new system through community debate. “This is not a closure to governance, but a pause,” Dhanda said. Part of a Broader DAO Governance Backlash Jupiter’s decision follows a broader trend of criticism for DAO governance models. Earlier this month, Yuga Labs proposed the abolition of the ApeCoin DAO in favor of a centralized successor, ApeCo. Yuga Labs CEO Greg Solano criticized DAO inefficiencies as “sluggish, noisy, and often unserious governance theater.” Both Solano and Dhanda referenced how current governance models can hamper innovation and waste resources on proposals that fail. Jupiter’s migration represents a shift towards pragmatic DeFi governance — one that prioritizes execution while leaving the door open for a more graceful, future DAO.",Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-06-20 17:31:00

She also ruled that they cannot cut pay for many Federal Reserve workers. MacDonough said the GOP-backed measures fall outside the scope of the fast-track budget process that Senate Republicans are using to advance Trump’s agenda without any Democratic support. Senate Democrats announced the ruling; Senate Republicans did not immediately respond to requests for comment, Bloomberg reported. The budget process can’t be filibustered and only covers bills about taxes and spending. It is not meant to make broad changes to public policy or to dismantle regulatory agencies. Senate Republicans plan to begin voting next week on their version of what they call a $3 trillion tax and spending cut bill. Under their proposal, the CFPB’s independent funding would be eliminated, and the measure would save about $1.4 billion by lowering non-monetary policy staff pay at the Federal Reserve to match levels at the Treasury Department. The parliamentarian also rejected moves to get rid of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and to weaken EPA vehicle-emissions rules. If Republicans insist on keeping any of those provisions, they would need 60 votes to pass them, rather than the simple majority that applies to other parts of the reconciliation package. With 53 Republican seats in the chamber and unified Democratic opposition, clearing that higher hurdle appears unlikely. The decision represents another setback for the Trump administration’s long-running effort to weaken the CFPB. Since its creation, the bureau has faced numerous legal challenges and, under the current administration, has seen major rule-writing and enforcement initiatives scrapped. Democrats plan to challenge more parts of the GOP bill Democrats say they will continue to challenge many other parts of the bill as violating Senate rules. Among the disputed sections are measures to loosen regulations on short-barrel shotguns and firearm silencers and to pressure states to limit their own oversight of artificial intelligence. “We will continue examining every provision in this Great Betrayal of a bill and will scrutinize it to the furthest extent,” said Senator Jeff Merkley, the top Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee. The CFPB currently draws its funding directly from the Federal Reserve and can request up to 12 percent of the Fed’s profits. For years, Republicans have argued that making Congress set the bureau’s budget would make it more accountable. Under the Trump administration, the CFPB has seen many of its enforcement actions halted, staff reductions proposed, and multiple legal challenges filed in federal courts. Senator Tim Scott, who chairs the Senate Banking Committee and oversaw the drafting of the disputed provisions, said he would continue working with MacDonough but gave no details on next steps. More rulings from the Senate’s nonpartisan referee are expected in the coming days as Republicans push to finalize their tax and spending priorities.

Barkin said in an interview with Reuters, “These data do not force us to cut interest rates… I am very clear that we have not met our inflation target for four years.” Businesses in Barkin’s district (Richmond) are expecting higher prices due to new tariffs that will go into effect later in the year. And there’s a real possibility that tariffs could increase even more in the coming months. Barkin also said that unemployment is still low at around 4.2% and that companies are not showing any signs of mass layoffs. That suggests the Fed’s goal of “maintaining maximum employment” is still in place. Barkin said that the final impact of the customs duties is not yet clear, and that the “wait-and-see” policy is being pursued in the current situation, adding, “We should not step on the brakes, but we should not step on the gas either.” Related News: Analysis Company Says ‘Countdown to the Return of Trade Wars Has Begun,’ Reveals Critical Dates According to the FED's new economic forecasts published on the same day, economic growth is expected to slow down and inflation to increase in the coming period. However, policymakers expect interest rate cuts to occur in 2025. This shows that although it is accepted that customs duties will increase prices, there is a belief that this effect will not be permanent. But there are differences of opinion among the 19 Fed officials. Seven think there should be no rate cuts this year, while eight predict two. This view coincides with the market's expectation of two 25 basis point cuts in September and December. Two of the remaining four officials expect one rate cut, and the other two expect three. Fed Board members Christopher Waller and Thomas Barkin are on opposite sides of the spectrum when it comes to interest rate cuts. Waller says the rate cut could begin in July, while Barkin argues it’s too early. While neither name has given a specific rate, they have diametrically opposed views on the impact of the Trump administration’s tariffs on prices, employment and economic growth in the coming months. *This is not investment advice.

Sources close to the meme platform noted the auction has been delayed several times since the initial plans for a native token. Pump.fun will continue to operate as a tokenless platform, as the TGE and auction were once again delayed. According to sources, Pump.fun intended to launch its auction on June 25, but the event may be pushed to mid-July. The platform aimed to raise $1B for a $4B valuation. The delay arrived just days after the Pump.fun X account was suspended , along with other influencers in the Solana ecosystem. Currently, Pump.fun only relies on pre-market trading on the Aevo DEX. Additionally, sources close to Pump.fun mention that the platform is selling token allocations to cryptocurrency funds. Based on social media expectations, up to 60% of the PUMP tokens would be sold through a private placement. According to recent sources, there are on-chain data of sales to selected investors, based on stablecoin deposits to wallets connected to Pump.fun. Up to $70M may be raised in the initial stages, sold to private investors ahead of the larger TGE. While the initial selling may be slow, there are expectations that the proper token sale event may fill up in minutes. Pump.fun has already achieved cumulative revenues over $760M during its most active year of meme activity, raising questions on the need for extra fundraising and a new token. However, the opportunities for revenue sharing are still raising the potential demand for the token. Pump.fun still produces over $2M in daily fees, setting expectations of sharing the inflows with PUMP holders. Before the announcement of a potential auction, Pump.fun users were also anticipating an airdrop as a reward for activity on the platform. PUMP tokens break out to a higher price in pre-market trading Even the delayed official launch has not stopped speculations about PUMP. In pre-market trading, PUMP accrued only $12K in open interest, reaching $5.85 on low-liquidity speculation. The market rallied to a peak above $7, suggesting Pump.fun may have a chance at reaching a fully diluted value of over $6B. PUMP tokens traded on the Aevo perpetual futures DEX, reaching a peak above $7 on extremely low volumes. | Source: Aevo The Aevo pre-market trading remains only an indicator of general interest while increasing the exposure of PUMP. The expected notional value for the PUMP sale is aimed at $4B in total valuation, or around $4 per token. There are expectations that PUMP may be undervalued at that price, since the platform rivaled markets like Hyperliquid based on monthly fees. PUMP may reflect the market’s performance if the token does not fall due to immediate selling pressure. Additionally, there are multiple meme tokens trying to claim the ticker, including a very early meme launched in the first days of Pump.fun. There is currently no on-chain evidence for an official token and no hints that an already existing asset would be adopted as official.

Ever wonder what’s really happening under the hood of the Bitcoin network, especially when its price is making headlines? It seems Bitcoin is playing a bit of a paradox game right now. While the price continues to hold strong, potentially even above that significant $100,000 mark mentioned in recent analyses, the day-to-day hustle and bustle on the network itself appears surprisingly quiet. Let’s dive into this fascinating trend shaping Bitcoin network activity . Understanding the Dip in Bitcoin Network Activity According to data analyzed by Glassnode and reported by The Block, the raw number of daily transactions on the Bitcoin network has actually fallen to levels not seen since October 2023. This might sound counter-intuitive given the strong price performance, right? The primary driver behind this dip isn’t a lack of interest in Bitcoin itself, but rather a significant reduction in specific types of network usage that surged in popularity last year. Remember the buzz around Inscriptions and Runes? These innovations allowed for embedding data directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain, creating unique digital artifacts. While they generated a ton of network activity and fee revenue for a time, their popularity has waned considerably. Since these activities accounted for a large portion of the daily transaction count, their decline has left the network looking much quieter on the surface. Think of it like this: Phase 1 (Late 2023/Early 2024): High transaction count driven by standard transfers PLUS a boom in Inscriptions/Runes minting and transfers. Phase 2 (Current): Standard transfers continue, but the high-volume, non-monetary Inscriptions/Runes activity has dropped off significantly. The result? A lower overall number of daily transactions, creating the appearance of subdued Bitcoin network activity , even as the price remains robust. High-Value Bitcoin Transactions Take Center Stage Here’s where the story gets really interesting and perhaps reveals more about the current market dynamics. Despite the lower overall transaction count, the value being transferred across the network is incredibly high. The composition of transactions has shifted dramatically. Consider these points: The average size of a Bitcoin transaction is currently hovering around a substantial $36,200. That’s a hefty sum for an ‘average’ transaction! Even more telling, transfers exceeding $100,000 now constitute a staggering 89% of the total network volume. This is a significant jump from around 66% back in 2022. This data strongly suggests that while smaller, potentially retail or speculative, transactions (like those associated with Inscriptions/Runes) have decreased, large players are actively moving significant amounts of value. This dominance of high-value Bitcoin transactions could indicate increased institutional activity, large holder movements, or significant over-the-counter (OTC) deals settling on the blockchain. Analyzing Bitcoin Transaction Volume and Fees Let’s look at the overall flow of value and the resulting network revenue. Despite the lower transaction count, the daily settlement volume on the Bitcoin network averages a robust $7.5 billion. This figure highlights the network’s continued role as a powerful settlement layer for large amounts of capital. However, this high settlement volume isn’t translating into proportionally high fees for miners. Daily fee revenue has dropped to approximately $500,000. For context, during periods of high network congestion or intense speculative activity (like peak bull markets or the height of the Inscriptions craze), daily fees could easily reach tens of millions of dollars, sometimes even exceeding the block subsidy itself. Why the discrepancy between high settlement volume and low fees? It comes back to the type of activity. While large transfers move significant value, they don’t necessarily require high fees to get confirmed quickly if the network isn’t congested by millions of smaller, time-sensitive transactions (like those from Inscriptions/Runes). The reduced competition for block space means users sending large sums can opt for lower fees while still ensuring their transactions are included in a timely manner. Key takeaways regarding Bitcoin transaction volume and Bitcoin fees : Total value settled remains high ($7.5B/day). Dominance of large transactions ($100k+). Average transaction size is substantial ($36.2k). Fee revenue is relatively low ($500k/day) compared to previous peaks. This dynamic presents a different picture than the retail-driven frenzy often associated with bull market tops. It suggests a more mature, perhaps institutional, level of activity underpinning the current price levels, even if the raw number of transactions is down. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? The current state of the network – quiet activity in terms of transaction count, yet booming with high-value Bitcoin transactions – raises interesting questions and offers potential insights: Potential Benefits: Efficient Settlement: The network is efficiently settling massive amounts of value without the congestion and sky-high fees seen during peak retail/speculative waves. This reinforces its core function as a robust value transfer system. Institutional Presence: The dominance of large transfers could be a sign of increasing institutional participation or large corporate treasuries utilizing Bitcoin. Challenges/Considerations: Miner Revenue: Low fee revenue, combined with the upcoming halving reducing the block subsidy, puts pressure on miner profitability. While the Bitcoin price helps, relying solely on the block subsidy isn’t a long-term model; transaction fees need to become a more significant component. Network Utility Perception: A focus solely on transaction count might lead some to believe the network is less active or useful, when in reality, its utility is being demonstrated through massive value settlement. This shift highlights the multi-faceted nature of Bitcoin transaction volume . It’s not just about how many transactions occur, but also about the value being moved and the types of participants using the network. The current data paints a picture of a network quietly handling significant wealth transfers, a stark contrast to the more visible, smaller-scale activities that previously dominated the transaction count. Conclusion: A Quiet Giant Settling Billions In summary, the Bitcoin network activity landscape is currently defined by a fascinating dichotomy: a lower transaction count primarily due to the decline of non-monetary activities like Inscriptions/Runes, juxtaposed with an overwhelming dominance of high-value Bitcoin transactions . The network continues to settle billions daily, reinforcing its strength as a store of value and a settlement layer, even as Bitcoin fees remain relatively low compared to past highs. This quiet, powerful movement of large sums suggests a potential shift in the network’s primary users or use cases at this price level. Keeping an eye on both transaction count and settled value will be crucial for understanding Bitcoin’s evolution.

At the same time, the lead underwriter of Morgan Stanley is working to finalize investor commitments for the package. The original commitment deadline was Tuesday, June 17, but Morgan Stanley extended the timeline to allow more investors to participate. Musk’s xAI offers new packages for investors to counteract challenges faced Following the sweetened pricing on xAI, the package now consists of $3 billion of bonds with a yield of 12.5%, a $1 billion 12.5% fixed rate term loan, and a $1 billion term loan B offered at 7.25 percentage points above the benchmark rate with a discount of 96 cents for every dollar, a person familiar with the matter said. All the components were priced at lower rates, and the term loan B had a smaller discount. In the meantime, some investors expected that the company would have to offer higher yields on the debt to get the deal done. The offering began earlier this month and has been dragged down by Musk’s differences with US President Donald Trump and investor fears of xAI’s financial resources. According to reliable sources, the company opted to raise another $4.3 billion in equity and amend some terms on debt documents to allay those concerns. Representatives for xAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Musk’s xAI pushes ahead with $5B debt sale despite investor doubts Elon Musk’s xAI is set to finalize a $5 billion debt deal led by Morgan Stanley, even as investor demand turns cold, two people familiar with the matter said. The debt sale, including a floating-rate term loan, fixed-rate loan, and secured bonds, will be allocated to investors on Wednesday next week, the people said, asking not to be mentioned because the deal is private. The floating-rate loan will be available at an interest rate of 700 basis points over the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, a reference rate used to price bond deals, while the fixed-rate loan and the secured notes will carry a yield of about 12%, the two people said. The average yield-to-maturity on high-yield bonds ended at 7.6%. Musk’s AI company has to pay quite a bit higher because xAI and its debt are not rated, giving investors little visibility into the company’s finances and higher risk. In addition, three bond investors who pitched the debt told reporters they declined to invest. They provided a parade of reasons for this decision. One investor noted that xAI has not turned a profit, and the debt is not rated. They were especially cautious about Musk’s history and how he paid for his $44 billion acquisition of the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, in 2022. The banks, which had lent him $13 billion for that deal, had to keep the debt on their books for two years because they could not sell it. Unlike Musk’s debt deal during his Twitter acquisition, Morgan Stanley did not promise how much it would sell or commit its own money in the transaction, but instead operated under a form of a “best efforts” agreement, according to a person familiar with the terms. Besides selling debt, xAI is also discussing plans to raise around $20 billion in equity, which would value the company over $120 billion. According to last week’s reports, some investors estimate valuations as high as $200 billion. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

News platform Semafor claimed in a report that Reddit was in talks to leverage the iris scanning device launched by Sam Altman-backed World, formerly Worldcoin , to use the Orb for the verification of Reddit users. The price of Worldcoin ( WLD ) rose slightly amid the report, with sources telling Semafor that there are talks between Reddit and Worldcoin contributor Tools for Humanity. Age of bots and AI fakes The alleged talks come amid growing concerns over bots and artificial intelligence-generated content. Worldcoin’s technology offers proof-of-human verification through its eye-scanning device, enabling platforms to distinguish real users from bots and AI entities. Worldcoin has seen significant growth and adoption of its technology, despite notable legal and regulatory bottlenecks in various jurisdictions. WLD is the cryptocurrency of this ecosystem.

A recent comment from a key figure at the U.S. Federal Reserve has sent ripples, suggesting a potential shift in the timeline for a highly anticipated Fed rate cut . Could this signal good news for digital assets? What Exactly Did Waller Say About a Possible Fed Rate Cut? According to a report by Watcher.Guru on X, U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller made a notable statement regarding the central bank’s future actions on interest rates . Waller reportedly indicated that the Fed “could cut rates as early as July meeting.” This is a significant hint, coming from a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the body responsible for setting U.S. monetary policy. While this statement doesn’t guarantee a rate cut, it introduces the possibility of an earlier move than some analysts might have predicted. Previously, many market participants were looking towards later in the year for the first rate reduction, assuming inflation continued to cool and the economy remained stable. Why Does a Potential Fed Rate Cut Matter for the Crypto Market? The connection between the Federal Reserve’s actions and the crypto market might not be immediately obvious to everyone, but it’s a crucial relationship. The Fed’s monetary policy , particularly its stance on interest rates , has a profound impact on the broader financial landscape, which in turn influences risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Here’s a simple breakdown: Lower Interest Rates: When the Fed cuts rates, it generally becomes cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow money. This can stimulate economic activity. Increased Liquidity: Cheaper money often leads to more liquidity flowing into the financial system. Search for Yield/Growth: In a low-interest-rate environment, traditional safe investments like savings accounts or bonds offer lower returns. Investors are then more inclined to seek higher returns in riskier assets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies. Reduced Cost of Capital: For companies involved in the crypto space (miners, exchanges, tech firms), lower borrowing costs can support expansion and innovation. Conversely, when the Fed raises rates, it tightens financial conditions, makes borrowing more expensive, and can draw investment away from risk assets towards safer, higher-yielding alternatives. What Are the Implications of This Monetary Policy Hint? Governor Waller’s comment, while conditional, suggests that the internal discussions within the Fed might be leaning towards easing monetary policy sooner rather than later, provided economic data supports such a move. The primary driver for a rate cut would typically be a sustained decrease in inflation towards the Fed’s 2% target, or signs of significant weakening in the labor market or broader economy. The potential implications include: Market Sentiment Boost: The mere *possibility* of a July cut can improve investor sentiment towards risk assets, as it signals potential future liquidity injections. Faster Economic Loosening: An earlier start to rate cuts could mean a more aggressive easing cycle over time, further supporting assets sensitive to liquidity. Focus on Data: Waller’s comments reinforce that the Fed remains data-dependent. Upcoming inflation reports (like the Consumer Price Index – CPI) and jobs data (like the Non-Farm Payrolls) will be scrutinized even more closely. It’s important to remember that Waller’s statement is just one voice, albeit an influential one, within the FOMC. Other governors and the Chair may hold different views or require more convincing data before committing to a specific timeline. How Do Interest Rates Influence Investment Decisions in Crypto? Understanding the relationship between interest rates and investment decisions is key for anyone navigating the crypto market . When rates are high, the ‘opportunity cost’ of holding assets that don’t pay interest (like Bitcoin) increases. You could potentially earn a guaranteed return in a high-yield savings account or bond instead. When rates are low or falling, this opportunity cost decreases. The appeal of potentially higher returns from volatile assets like cryptocurrencies grows stronger, as the alternatives offer less attractive yields. This dynamic can influence capital flows into and out of the crypto space. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors: Stay Informed on Macro Data: Keep an eye on key economic indicators like inflation, employment figures, and GDP growth. These are the data points the Fed watches. Listen to Fed Speak: Pay attention to speeches and press conferences from Fed officials. Look for consensus or divergence in opinions regarding the economic outlook and policy path. Waller’s speech is a prime example of this. Understand Correlations: Recognize that while crypto has its unique drivers (adoption, technology, regulation), it is not immune to broader macroeconomic forces. Diversify and Manage Risk: Don’t make investment decisions solely based on interest rate speculation. Maintain a diversified portfolio and manage your risk according to your investment goals and risk tolerance. Conclusion: Navigating the Waters After Waller’s Speech Governor Waller’s hint at a possible July Fed rate cut injects a new layer of speculation into the financial markets, particularly exciting for those in the crypto market . It suggests the door might be open for earlier easing of monetary policy than widely anticipated, provided economic conditions align. Lower interest rates have historically been viewed as a tailwind for risk assets like crypto, potentially increasing liquidity and investor appetite. However, this is not a done deal. The Fed’s decisions remain contingent on incoming data. Investors should view this as a significant signal to watch closely, rather than a guaranteed outcome. The coming weeks, filled with economic reports and further commentary from Fed officials following the Waller speech , will be critical in shaping expectations and potentially influencing the direction of the crypto market.

Recently, a notable development emerged from UBS, the global financial services giant, regarding the GBP CHF currency pair. This move warrants attention, especially for those involved in currency trading or following broader macro trends. UBS has revised its forecast for the British Pound against the Swiss Franc, increasing its price target. But what drives this change, and what does it mean for the pair? Decoding the Latest UBS Price Target for GBP CHF UBS analysts have adjusted their expectations for the GBP CHF exchange rate, elevating their price target to 1.13. This represents a notable shift in their outlook, suggesting a potential appreciation of the British Pound relative to the Swiss Franc from current levels. Such adjustments from major banks like UBS are based on comprehensive research into economic indicators, central bank policies, and market dynamics. Understanding a bank’s price target involves looking at the factors they believe will influence the currency pair’s movement over their forecast horizon. For GBP CHF , this involves comparing the economic health and monetary policy stances of the United Kingdom and Switzerland. Understanding the Pound Carry Trade Appeal The primary driver cited by UBS for their optimistic UBS price target on GBP/CHF is the increasing attractiveness of the pound carry trade . A carry trade involves borrowing a currency with a low interest rate and investing in a currency with a high interest rate. The profit comes from the difference in interest rates. Here’s a simplified look at why the pound offers carry appeal against the franc: The Bank of England (BoE) has maintained relatively higher interest rates compared to the Swiss National Bank (SNB). Holding British Pounds (the higher-yielding currency) and selling Swiss Francs (the lower-yielding currency) allows investors to potentially earn the interest rate differential. While the SNB has recently cut rates, and the BoE is expected to cut later, the differential remains significant enough to make the pound carry trade attractive in this specific pairing. This interest rate differential acts as a potential tailwind for the GBP/CHF pair, as investors are incentivized to buy and hold GBP. Implications for Currency Trading and Market Dynamics A raised UBS price target like this can influence market sentiment and trading strategies. For those engaged in currency trading , it signals that a major player sees potential upside for the pound against the franc, driven by a fundamental factor – the carry advantage. However, it’s crucial to remember that carry trades are not without risks. They are particularly vulnerable to shifts in global risk sentiment. In times of market stress or uncertainty, investors often unwind carry trades, selling higher-yielding, riskier currencies and buying safer, lower-yielding ones like the Swiss Franc (which is traditionally seen as a safe haven). Therefore, while the carry is attractive, market volatility remains a key consideration for currency trading . Forex Analysis: Beyond the Carry Trade While the pound carry trade is a significant factor, a comprehensive Forex analysis of the GBP CHF pair requires looking at other elements. UBS’s forecast likely incorporates a broader view of the UK and Swiss economies. Other factors influencing the pair include: Economic Growth: Relative performance of the UK and Swiss economies. Stronger growth typically supports a currency. Inflation: Inflation trends and how they might influence future central bank decisions. Central Bank Commentary: Any signals from the BoE or SNB about future interest rate paths or quantitative easing/tightening. Political Stability: Geopolitical events or domestic political developments in either country. Global Risk Sentiment: As mentioned, CHF’s safe-haven status means it can strengthen during periods of global uncertainty, potentially pushing GBP/CHF lower, regardless of carry. A thorough Forex analysis considers how these factors interact with the carry advantage. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors Given the UBS price target and the focus on the pound carry trade , what should those interested in the GBP CHF pair consider? Monitor Central Banks: Pay close attention to statements and decisions from the Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank. Changes in their interest rate outlooks are paramount. Track Economic Data: Key economic releases from the UK and Switzerland (inflation, GDP, employment) can impact currency valuations and central bank expectations. Assess Risk Sentiment: Keep an eye on global events and market sentiment. An increase in risk aversion could quickly reverse the positive impact of the carry trade. Consider the Horizon: UBS’s target is likely for a specific timeframe. Understand that currency markets are volatile, and short-term movements can differ significantly from longer-term forecasts. Risk Management: As with all currency trading , employing robust risk management techniques (like stop-loss orders) is essential, especially when trading based on forecasts. This news from UBS provides a valuable piece of the puzzle, highlighting a key fundamental reason for potential GBP strength against CHF, but it is just one perspective among many factors influencing the pair. Conclusion UBS’s decision to raise its GBP CHF price target to 1.13 underscores the current appeal of the pound carry trade driven by interest rate differentials between the UK and Switzerland. While this provides a bullish signal for the pair based on a strong fundamental argument, market participants involved in currency trading must conduct their own comprehensive Forex analysis , considering the full spectrum of economic indicators, central bank policies, and global risk factors that could impact the pair’s trajectory towards or away from the stated UBS price target .

In 2028, SHIB can reach a maximum value of $0.00003745. The price of Shiba Inu is predicted to reach an average value of $0.00003134 in 2031. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) cryptocurrency, originally a meme coin, has transformed into a comprehensive Shiba Inu ecosystem, significantly impacting Shiba Inu’s value and utility. Key components include ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and Shibarium, a Layer 2 solution to enhance scalability. These developments have boosted SHIB’s adoption and functionality. As SHIB’s ecosystem grows, questions arise about SHIB’s future and its price trajectory. Will the advancements in ShibaSwap and Shibarium drive SHIB to new highs and influence the price action in the market? Can SHIB sustain its current price momentum and strengthen its position in the crypto market by flashing bullish signals? Will SHIB ever reach $1? In this Shiba Inu price prediction, analyzed by Cryptopolitan, we’ll determine future SHIB price trends.

Strong support at $0.00001145, buyers consistently defend the $0.00001145 level, confirming it as solid support. A bullish 4H double-bottom setup, a double-bottom on the 4-hour chart, signals a possible short-term move higher if momentum holds. On 20th June 2025, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.00001182, reflecting a 2.26% gain over the past 24 hours. Despite this intraday rise, SHIB is still in recovery mode from a recent broader decline, with a defined resistance level at $0.00001182 and support near $0.00001145. The meme coin’s price activity today signals a possible momentum shift as it tests overhead resistance on low-to-moderate volume. With a rating of 4.1 stars and verified smart contract audits, SHIB maintains strong visibility and liquidity across leading Ethereum-based wallets and platforms, including MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet. Shiba Inu daily price chart: SHIB recovery push faces key resistance at $0.00001182 On the daily chart, SHIB began the session at $0.00001156 and faced early selling pressure, slipping to an intraday low of $0.00001145, which established key support for the day. The token rebounded in the second half of the session, recovering lost ground and surging to the day’s high at $0.00001182, now acting as immediate resistance. The pattern indicates a V-shaped intraday recovery, though the daily candle is testing the upper range without a confirmed breakout. Momentum is building, but the absence of a substantial volume spike suggests caution among buyers. SHIB price chart SHIB is currently trading just above its 20-day EMA, suggesting a short-term bullish structure is developing. However, the daily RSI is still under 40, and a decisive close above $0.00001182 would be required to confirm upside continuation. If resistance holds, bears may push the price back toward the support at $0.00001145, forming a tight range that may lead to a breakout. Traders are watching this zone closely as any daily close above resistance could trigger a broader shift in momentum toward previous swing highs. Shiba Inu 4-hour price chart: SHIB double-bottom formation signals short-term bullish momentum The 4-hour chart shows that SHIB has formed a mild double-bottom pattern around the $0.00001145 level, signaling strong buyer presence at that support. The recovery wave started around 9:00 AM and gained pace, pushing SHIB back toward the resistance at $0.00001182. A bullish engulfing candle in the mid-session points to increased demand, and the price now sits just under the critical resistance level. If bulls hold momentum, the next leg higher could be triggered on a break above this threshold. SHIB price chart Short-term indicators remain favorable, with RSI pushing upward and MACD nearing a bullish crossover. Price is trading above both the 20-EMA and 50-EMA on the 4-hour chart, suggesting near-term trend strength. However, a failed breakout attempt may invite selling pressure, bringing the token back into the consolidation range. SHIB must maintain above $0.00001160 to avoid weakening momentum and to continue building toward a sustained uptrend.

SHIB is testing key resistance at $0.00001182. A breakout above this level could push the price toward $0.00001200 and higher. If the breakout fails, a pullback to $0.00001145 support is likely, keeping the price in a tight consolidation range. Holding above $0.00001160 is critical to maintain bullish momentum. Is Shiba Inu a good investment? Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a high-risk, high-volatility asset that appeals mainly to short-term traders and speculative investors. Its significant community backing, consistent development efforts like Shibarium, and strong wallet integration (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet) support its liquidity and utility within the Ethereum ecosystem. However, SHIB’s long-term value still depends heavily on broader market sentiment and continued project development. Investors must recognize that SHIB lacks the fundamentals of traditional assets and behaves more like a momentum-driven token. It may offer short-term trading opportunities, but long-term investment decisions should be approached with caution, clear risk management, and diversification. Why is Shiba Inu down today? Shiba Inu (SHIB) is showing signs of weakness today, primarily due to profit-taking near the key resistance level at $0.00001182. After a brief 2.26% intraday gain, price momentum stalled, reflecting cautious sentiment as bulls struggled to break above this resistance zone. The lack of substantial trading volume and failure to secure a clean breakout have led to a minor pullback, putting pressure back on support near $0.00001145. Broader market consolidation and uncertainty in Bitcoin’s direction may also be weighing on SHIB, causing traders to lock in gains and reduce exposure. Recent News on Shiba Inu Shiba Inu announced a robust update for the Shibarium blockchain, which aims to strengthen the network’s decentralization. 🚨 Important Shibarium Update: Enhancing Decentralization! 🚨 The Shibarium team is taking a significant step to strengthen the network!

Buyers are vigorously defending a drop below the immediate support channels on the price chart. If the SHIB price holds its momentum above the $0.000014 level, we might see further surges. Will SHIB reach $0.00005? Yes, according to the long-term SHIB price prediction, the current Shiba Inu price is projected to reach up to $0.00005 by 2027. Will SHIB reach $0.0001 Yes, according to crypto experts’ long-term predictions, SHIB is projected to reach $0.0001 by 2029. Will SHIB reach $100? SHIB’s goal of reaching $100 is virtually impossible due to its vast circulating supply in the meme coin market. Additionally, to get the $100 mark, SHIB would require a strong push in its market cap, which is beyond imagination for a meme coin. Does SHIB have an excellent long-term future? The Shiba Inu price made headlines in January 2025 after Shytoshi Kusama, the lead developer, stepped down. However, SHIB shows some positive movement, suggesting the ecosystem may have a promising long-term future. However, its success will depend on partnerships, broader market adoption trends, and other regulatory developments. You are advised to do your own research and form expert opinions before investing in the highly volatile crypto market.

The analyst quickly addressed concerns, noting how such deviations usually happen at some point but don’t invalidate the macro trend. Analyst Highlights Bitcoin Price’s Deviation From Global M2 Money Supply In an X post, Colin revealed that the Bitcoin price has deviated from the global M2 money supply. He noted that this deviation was short-term in an otherwise broad correlation. The analyst added that this current deviation is similar to the position that BTC was in February 2025. Related Reading: Will The Bitcoin Price Move Above $110,000 Again? Global M2 Money Supply Shows What’s Next Colin remarked that this development doesn’t mean the M2 is broken, just as it wasn’t broken back in February. Instead, he claimed that it just means that market participants haven’t zoomed out enough and are allowing for the non-correlated periods. The analyst added that non-correlation between the Bitcoin price and global M2 money supply happens 20% of the time. He then alluded to the regular chart, which shows the strong correlation between the Bitcoin price and the global M2 money supply. Colin explained that the M2 is “directionally predictive” for BTC and that it is not 1:1 price-related. The analyst further remarked that the M2 does not predict a specific BTC price. Instead, the global M2 money supply only predicts the market direction, with about 80% accuracy. Colin added that the Bitcoin price has its y-axis while the M2 is on a different y-axis. He also opined that the M2 may decouple from BTC near the cycle top. Although the analyst didn’t provide a timeline for when the cycle top will be, his analysis indicates that the cycle top is not yet in and the bull run isn’t over. Money Supply Shows No Need To Worry About BTC Price In an X post, market expert Raoul Pal suggested that the Bitcoin price’s correlation with the money supply shows that there is no need to worry about the current price action. He remarked that if 89% of BTC’s price action is explained by global liquidity, then by definition, almost all “news” and “narrative” is noise. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Bitcoin Price Primed For Deep Correction Below $90,000 This suggests that the current geopolitical risks, heightened by the Israel-Iran conflict, are unlikely to impact the Bitcoin price as much as expected. Trading firm QCP Capital recently noted that the flagship crypto has yet to show full-blown panic, which shows how much the asset has matured. The firm remarked that BTC’s resilient price action appears underpinned by continued institutional accumulation, with companies like Strategy and Metaplanet buying the dip. The Bitcoin ETFs also continue to record positive flows. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $104,700, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

According to the table shared by Balchunas, the approval probability for spot ETF applications of major crypto assets such as Litecoin, Solana and XRP has increased to 95%. This rate is estimated to be 90% for Dogecoin, Cardano, Polkadot, HBAR and Avalanche. The fact that the SEC largely considers these assets as “commodities” and that they have futures regulated by the CFTC is also among the factors that increase their chances of approval. Related News: Senior FED Official Barkin Makes Critical Statements on Interest Rates Amid Important FED Week The approval probability for SUI and Tron (TRX) seems more uncertain. In particular, while the approval rate for SUI is evaluated as 60%, no probability is given for TRX as its final decision date extends to 2026. According to the latest updated data, the approval probabilities are as follows: Litecoin (LTC) – 95% Left (LEFT) – 95% XRP (XRP) – 95% Dogecoin (DOGE) – 90% Cardano (ADA) – 90% Polkadot (DOT) – 90% HBAR (HBAR) – 90% Avalanche (AVAX) – 90% SUI (SUI) – 60% *This is not investment advice.

In a new thread, pseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 248,700 followers on the social media platform X that Solana ( SOL ) may not put up the massive gains against Bitcoin (SOL/ BTC ) on the weekly chart like it did last year. “Other than a few blips here and there, I don’t see SOL outperforming BTC on any longer timeframe chart from here on out. I’m not saying Solana is dead; it’s clearly not; just that I don’t see it having a run like it did in 2021/2024.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X SOL/BTC is trading for 0.0013768 BTC ($143) at time of writing, flat on the day. Next up, the analyst says that Bitcoin’s market correction may have come to an end after dipping into the $103,000 range. “Local bottom for BTC in my opinion.” He also says Bitcoin is trading sideways in a range with an upper bound of $106,826 and a lower bound of $103,127, and may soon breakout. “BTC pretty much three weeks within this same range with deviations on both ends (up and down). Price hasn’t done anything relatively speaking and your only job right now is to survive during this chop and not get destroyed. Best to probably not take any trades (I’ve taken a few today and lost pretty much all).” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Bitcoin is trading for $104,359 at time of writing, flat on the day. Lastly, the analyst says Ethereum ( ETH ) may trade sideways for another three months, similar to a 2024 pattern. “ETH we’re all waiting for this to outperform… going to have to wait even longer I guess. It chopped here for 90 days last year, maybe it’ll do the same.” However, he predicts ETH will eventually have an explosive breakout as several Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) converge, which in technical analysis may indicate a trend reversal is forming. “ETH probably just sit here in spot and don’t do anything. This type of compression means ‘big move coming.'” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X ETH is trading for $2,501 at time of writing.

Blue-Chip NFTs Enter TON Territory On June 19, the original Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) announced plans to launch its Bored Ape Originals sticker pack collection on Telegram, lending credibility to TON’s emerging NFT niche.

In 2022, a single BAYC NFT commanded $646,717.50 (250 ETH at the time), establishing the collection’s premium status. this BAYC just sold for $646,717.50 (250 ETH) would you rather be the buyer or the seller? pic.twitter.com/KHbK5foZym — Puff Yachty (@PuffYachty) March 8, 2022 Many cryptocurrency traders now view the upcoming launch as a second opportunity to acquire BAYC-branded digital assets through TON’s sticker format. The migration extends far beyond BAYC, with virtually every major NFT and intellectual property brand establishing a presence on Telegram and TON. Several collections, including Pudgy Penguins, Azuki, Doodles, and Moonbirds , have all developed distinctive sticker collections that maintain their brand aesthetics while adapting to the platform’s format.

The NFT collection that appears to have catalyzed TON’s emergence as a leading NFT blockchain is Plush Pepe , which achieved the feat of becoming the fifth most expensive NFT collection by floor price across all blockchain networks.

Why TON’s NFT Boom Could Deliver 120% Gains Industry observers believe TON’s NFT ecosystem remains in its early development phase, noting the absence of TON-based collections on major platforms like Magic Eden and OpenSea. Given Telegram’s user base exceeding 1 billion users, the potential for increased adoption could drive NFT prices higher. Since Toncoin is the utility token facilitating these transactions, market analysts anticipate increased trading volume and positive market sentiment for the blockchain, potentially translating into upward price pressure for $TON.

The $3.50 level represents a key resistance, having previously rejected multiple upward attempts. Source: TradingView A successful breakout above this threshold would confirm a bullish reversal pattern, potentially opening pathways toward initial targets at $4.23, followed by $4.64 and $5.15. Despite relatively subdued price action, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows gradual improvement from 44.46, indicating mild bullish divergence, though it remains below the neutral 50 level. Current low volume conditions suggest a decisive directional move may be developing. Should TON successfully breach and maintain levels above $3.50, bullish momentum could accelerate toward mid-$4 price targets. However, failure to overcome resistance could result in another decline toward the ascending support trendline near $2.70.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP eyes $10 target for 2025 as analysts cite bullish patterns, rising adoption, and legal clarity as key drivers. XRP is currently trading near $0.50, and bullish energy is returning to the market. According to updated market data, traders are taking note after well-known analysts who predicted XRP’s previous 600% rally issued a bold new target: $10. The catalyst? Growing institutional interest and potential regulatory clarity. This forecast builds on strong technical signals, as XRP is forming a similar pattern to its pre-2021 breakout. The recent surge in on-chain activity and network growth supports the view that XRP may be on the verge of another major move. Optimism is also rising around Ripple’s legal positioning, fueling investor confidence as 2025 unfolds.

When similar consolidation patterns formed in the past, explosive upside followed within months; if history repeats, XRP could see its price multiply in a short window, especially if market sentiment flips bullish across the board.

If buyers push through, UNI might target its second resistance at $12.27, potentially translating into a solid gain from its current levels. The RSI index at around 48 suggests it's not overbought or oversold, hinting at possible stability or a chance for upward momentum. Whether it can break past these hurdles will shape its growth story. Stacks (STX) Primed for Comeback Rally Source: tradingview Stacks is quietly positioning itself for a powerful recovery. While it currently trades between $0.57 and $0.70, technical indicators hint at bullish potential ahead. With resistance sitting at $0.77, a breakthrough could open the path to $0.90—offering gains of over 30%. The RSI near 55 shows healthy buyer interest, and any shift in sentiment could trigger fast upward movement. With Bitcoin-native smart contracts gaining traction, STX could be an under-the-radar gem ready to heat up. Toncoin (TON) Eyes Breakthrough as Bulls Regroup Source: tradingview Toncoin is stabilizing between $2.78 and $3.28, showing resilience despite recent pullbacks. Support at $2.59 remains firm, and any bullish push above $3.59 could unlock a strong move toward $4.08—representing a solid 20%+ upside. The RSI and steady moving average point to a market pause rather than a breakdown, suggesting TON may be consolidating before its next leg up. With growing adoption through Telegram integrations and Web3 momentum, Toncoin is still very much in the game. Conclusion While the broader market remains unpredictable, these three altcoins are showing signs of life at just the right time. Uniswap is gearing up for a breakout, Stacks is reclaiming lost ground, and Toncoin is quietly building strength beneath the surface. Each project carries its own narrative and growth potential—and in a market driven by momentum, timing is everything. Stay sharp, do your research, and don't sleep on the altcoins that are heating up when it matters most. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The takeover comes as TRON announced an Initial Public Offering (IPO), which may propel the digital asset further into the public domain. Dogecoin (DOGE) has had a wide-reaching audience due to its exposure on social media platforms and in popular culture. However, TRON (TRX) has been focused on breaking new boundaries regarding performance and has much potential as a token of the future. TRON has plans to create a reverse merger with SRM Entertainment, which could change the rules of crypto investing, merging the old world of traditional finance with the new world of blockchain innovations. TRON now has a market capitalization of $500 million, more than Dogecoin’s $23.5 billion. TRON’s price has historically enjoyed low volatility, with a similar signature to Ripple’s XRP, experiencing only a few dramatic jumps in price over the past year. USDT stablecoin transactions have surged on the TRON network, possibly adding to the increase in market cap, originating from both developing and established countries across the globe. TRON DAO commented that this was proof that cryptocurrency was not just a phenomenon of developing countries but was truly a global project powered by the convenience of stablecoins. Since May, TRON has risen by 12%, whereas Dogecoin has dropped by 30%. There is speculation that Dogecoin has dropped in price due to a waning interest in meme coins. TRON recently partnered with P2P.org, a staking business, to provide validator services. A big part of TRON’s success is fueled by its ever-expanding ecosystem. A cryptocurrency grows its user base by proving itself to be a trustworthy project that can be relied upon to provide business services. Despite blockchain being designed to enable trustless network connections, a project still needs trust to be developed. The recent success of TRON may be a combination of technical acumen and business partnerships. Nevertheless, TRON has not been as forthright with ETF developments as its counterpart, XRP. Justin Sun, the founder of TRON, has said that the project will push for an ETF shortly so that traders can enjoy the benefits of traditional finance when investing in TRX. Binance transactions include around $2 billion and $3 billion per day for USDT transfers on the TRON blockchain, representing around 65% of all USDT activity on the exchange. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that Binance is responsible for much of TRON’s success. TRON boasts rapid settlement times and low fees. Although new users are not used to the TRON ecosystem, it may have a slight learning curve to overcome. There are suggestions that TRON could become so popular that it could rival platforms like Alipay or GCash in certain jurisdictions. Meanwhile, Dogecoin has waned regarding technical appeal and business partnerships. The token seems to have relied on social media campaigns and neglected a cryptocurrency’s much-needed technical aspects. The DOGE token was started as a memecoin, but there was still an expectation that the coin could be used for more practical uses, such as making payments for a Tesla sedan. Dogecoin remains a well-known crypto project but risks dropping out of the top ten rankings if it does not adapt to a changing market. Simply relying on social media campaigns could condemn the project as a ‘one-trick pony’ and limit its ability to expand globally. Conversely, TRON seems to be embracing an extensive range of crypto projects, including serious business partnerships and popular marketing projects. There is also the rift between President Trump and Elon Musk , a supporter of the DOGE token, while Justin Sun makes positive steps to collaborate with the Trump family. The shift in rankings, with TRON overtaking DOGE, could be a clear sign that the crypto world is evolving right before our eyes.",Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|Dogecoin|Tron News|TRX,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|TRX,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-20 19:26:56

A total of 26,671,734 XRP, worth approximately $56.5 million, was moved from Coinbase’s cold wallet to its institutional wallet, signaling a major shift in liquidity preparation. This move, far from being routine, suggests that Coinbase is preparing for a surge in institutional trading activity—an insight that has the XRP Army watching closely. Strategic Positioning, Not Panic Unlike typical outflows to exchanges that often precede sell-offs, this transfer occurred internally within Coinbase’s ecosystem. The XRP was moved from a cold storage address to wallet DT:1, which is widely associated with Coinbase Institutional —an arm that services high-net-worth clients, OTC desks, and institutional funds. These wallets are not used for day-to-day retail transactions but for facilitating large-scale settlements and trades. The nature and direction of this move imply one thing: Coinbase is gearing up for significant trading volume, potentially from large institutional clients. It also reflects growing confidence in XRP as a viable liquidity asset, especially as more institutional actors enter the digital asset space. 26,671,734.82 $XRP transferred from Coinbase Cold Wallet to Coinbase Institutional This isn’t just a move — it’s Coinbase gearing up for surging trading demand XRP Momentum Building! #XRP #Ripple #XRPArmy #Crypto pic.twitter.com/scz1byE20w — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) June 19, 2025 A Pattern of Preparation This isn’t the first such move. On June 12, roughly 27 million XRP were also transferred internally by Coinbase to the same institutional wallet. These recurring high-volume transactions are not anomalies—they point to a larger trend of proactive liquidity management. As the exchange prepares for larger trade flows, especially from institutions, repositioning assets into operational wallets becomes essential. XRP’s price has remained stable through these movements. Currently trading at $2.12, the token has been consolidating around the $2 mark for several weeks following its explosive rally in late 2024. Importantly, similar internal transfers in the past—such as those in early June and December 2024 involving tens of millions of XRP—did not lead to any sustained price declines. This reinforces the interpretation that these are non-bearish operational moves. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Army Reacts Reactions from XRP enthusiasts have been overwhelmingly positive, reflecting the community’s growing excitement and optimism. One user enthusiastically responded with, “Absolutely fantastic,” capturing the sentiment of many who see this development as a major step forward. Another echoed the anticipation with a spirited tweet: “Let’s fire it up. It’s about time,” underscoring the collective eagerness for progress and momentum within the XRP ecosystem. Xaif’s alert has drawn attention to more than just a wallet transfer—it has highlighted the growing institutional readiness surrounding XRP. Coinbase’s internal shift of over $56 million in XRP signals preparation, not liquidation. At a time when XRP is holding firm around $2.12, such a move suggests the groundwork is being laid for increased trading activity at higher volumes. For the XRP Army, this is yet another sign that momentum is building beneath the surface. With institutions preparing their positions and infrastructure aligning for scale, XRP’s next phase may already be in motion—quietly and strategically.

The asset is now trading roughly 20% below its May high of $185, with recent attempts at recovery facing strong resistance. Despite holding above major support for now, the overall structure suggests that downside risk remains if market conditions don’t improve soon. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Eyes High Timeframe Close – Range Break Above $2,800 Could Be Violent Top analyst Efloud shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting the importance of tracking Solana’s response to broader Bitcoin dynamics. He noted that if Bitcoin (BTC) continues to consolidate sideways while Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) rises, altcoins like SOL may struggle. In that case, Solana could continue retracing to find stronger support at mid-zones, particularly around the $123 and $116 levels. These price zones have previously acted as solid support/resistance areas and could serve as key inflection points should bearish momentum persist. A breakdown toward these targets would likely coincide with increasing BTC.D and continued investor caution in the altcoin market. Until then, SOL remains vulnerable within a fragile technical structure, and traders will closely watch for either a rebound or deeper correction in the coming days. Solana Holds Key Support As Analysts Eye Bullish Scenarios Solana is currently trading about 50% down from its all-time highs, with the explosive momentum seen at the end of 2024 now replaced by more subdued price action. The asset’s underperformance has left investors cautious, but many analysts remain optimistic about Solana’s potential once a new altcoin rally begins. For now, the focus is on holding critical demand zones that could determine whether SOL is gearing up for a recovery or further downside. According to Efloud, if Bitcoin continues consolidating sideways while Bitcoin dominance rises, Solana may find support at several mid-zones, particularly around $123 and $116. The $140 region has historically acted as a strong support/resistance flip, and a deviation around this level—losing it briefly before regaining it with strength—could present a short-term buying opportunity. Efloud notes that this scenario doesn’t necessarily imply that SOL must drop to those levels, but current market conditions—aside from Bitcoin—lack strong pair structures. If SOL can decisively break above the $168 resistance, a new leg upward could be triggered, with $230 potentially acting as the next major resistance zone. On the SOL/BTC pair, Efloud is watching for a reclaim of the 0.0015 level or a pullback toward 0.00115 for confirmation. Another key support sits at 0.000988 sats. Despite the current cooling, the structure may still offer solid opportunities for new entrants. If these levels hold and macro conditions improve, SOL could be setting the stage for a sustainable rally, ultimately leading to new all-time highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2017-2021 Pattern – $4,000 Is The Trigger Point Weekly Chart Analysis – Holding the Line Near Key Support Solana is currently trading at $148.33 on the weekly timeframe, showing a 3% decline over the past seven days. The price has dropped roughly 20% from its May high of around $185 and is now testing the critical $140–$150 support zone. This level has repeatedly acted as a pivot point in the past and could define SOL’s short-term trajectory. The chart shows that Solana has been unable to reclaim the 50-week moving average (currently near $170), which now acts as key resistance. A decisive weekly close above this level would open the door for a bullish continuation toward $185 and possibly $200. However, failure to hold above the 100-week moving average around $132 could lead to further downside pressure, with $123 and $116 as the next demand zones to watch—levels identified by analyst Efloud in his mid-zone scenario. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates as Realized Profits Stay Low – No Signs Of Major Sell-Off Yet Volume has declined steadily over the past three weeks, signaling reduced participation, but also suggesting that aggressive selling is fading.

Japanese investment giant SoftBank is reportedly planning a monumental push into the AI and robotics sectors, potentially dwarfing previous initiatives. This ambition centers around a rumored trillion-dollar industrial complex project in Arizona, highlighting SoftBank’s aggressive strategy in shaping the future of technology. Exploring the Scale of SoftBank AI Ambition Following its reported involvement in the massive $500 billion Stargate AI Infrastructure project, SoftBank appears set to launch an even larger undertaking. Sources suggest the company is exploring the creation of a sprawling AI industrial complex in the United States. This project, potentially costing a staggering trillion dollars, signifies a profound commitment to building the physical infrastructure needed for the next wave of technological advancement. The scale of a trillion-dollar investment in a single industrial complex is immense. It suggests not just a factory, but a comprehensive ecosystem designed to integrate research, development, manufacturing, and deployment of advanced AI systems and robotic technologies. This kind of investment could reshape regional economies and significantly impact global supply chains. Potential Collaboration with TSMC Arizona Central to SoftBank’s reported plan is a potential collaboration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). The initiative, internally dubbed ‘Project Crystal Land,’ aims to establish this vast complex in Arizona. Arizona is already a key location for TSMC, which is building its own advanced chip manufacturing facilities there. This existing presence makes TSMC a logical, albeit potentially complex, partner for SoftBank’s ambitious project. However, the exact nature of TSMC’s involvement remains unclear. Reports indicate it’s uncertain what role TSMC would play or if they are definitively committed to joining forces with SoftBank on this specific project, given their existing independent plans for TSMC Arizona operations focused on semiconductor production crucial for AI computation. What Does a Trillion-Dollar Complex Mean for Robotics Manufacturing? A project of this magnitude dedicated to AI and robotics points towards a future where advanced automation and intelligent machines are manufactured at an unprecedented scale. This potential complex would likely focus on producing sophisticated robots for various industries, alongside the AI hardware and components necessary to power them. The development of such a large-scale facility could significantly boost domestic robotics manufacturing capabilities in the United States. This aligns with broader trends towards strengthening local supply chains and reducing reliance on overseas production for critical technologies. It could encompass everything from industrial automation robots to specialized AI-driven machines for logistics, healthcare, or consumer applications. Connecting the Dots: From Stargate Project to Crystal Land SoftBank’s reported pursuit of ‘Project Crystal Land’ can be seen as a natural progression from its participation in other major AI infrastructure initiatives like the Stargate project . While Stargate is rumored to focus heavily on AI data centers and computing power – the ‘brains’ of AI – Crystal Land appears aimed at building the ‘body’ and the manufacturing muscle for AI and robotics. SoftBank’s strategy seems to involve investing across the entire AI value chain, from the underlying computing infrastructure (Stargate) to the physical manufacturing capabilities for AI-powered devices and robots (Crystal Land). This integrated approach could position SoftBank and its portfolio companies at the forefront of the AI revolution. Challenges and Uncertainties Ahead While the vision is grand, significant challenges lie ahead for ‘Project Crystal Land’. A trillion-dollar investment is colossal and would require immense planning, funding, and execution capabilities. Securing the necessary capital, regulatory approvals, and skilled workforce for such a large complex in Arizona would be major hurdles. Furthermore, the reported uncertainty surrounding TSMC’s commitment is a critical factor. TSMC’s expertise in advanced semiconductor manufacturing is vital for producing the chips that power modern AI and robotics. Without a clear partnership, SoftBank would need to find alternative solutions for securing these essential components or develop its own capabilities, adding complexity and cost. The Future of AI and Robotics Manufacturing SoftBank’s reported ambitions underscore the growing global race to dominate the future of AI and robotics. Building large-scale, integrated industrial complexes capable of producing advanced AI hardware and robots domestically could provide a strategic advantage. If realized, ‘Project Crystal Land’ could become a cornerstone of US advanced manufacturing, fostering innovation, creating jobs, and accelerating the deployment of AI and robotic technologies across various sectors. It’s a bold vision that, despite the current uncertainties, highlights the immense potential and investment flowing into this transformative technological frontier.

Dive into the details to uncover the forces behind this surge and discover which coins might be poised for a breakout. Dogecoin Struggles as Bears Keep Bulls at Bay Source: tradingview Dogecoin (DOGE) is hovering between 16 and 20 cents, showing more weakness than strength. Bears seem to have the upper hand, with the price dipping nearly 8% over the last week and losing a quarter of its value in a month. The RSI is under 50, signaling more sellers than buyers. For now, Dogecoin faces resistance at 22 cents, and a stronger barrier at 26 cents. On the downside, support is present at 15 cents, offering some price cushioning. To ignite a rally, Dogecoin would need a boost of over 30% to break the first resistance level. However, a glance at the last six months reveals a challenging road ahead. Conclusion Despite the spike in trading volume, Dogecoin’s price remains stuck in a bearish zone, with resistance levels keeping bulls in check. Still, this kind of activity rarely goes unnoticed for long. If buying pressure mounts and key resistance levels break, DOGE could surprise skeptics with a sharp rebound. Whether this is the calm before a meme coin revival or just another blip in the chart—one thing’s for sure: the DOGE narrative is far from over.

46429332,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=401296,1750447917,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/46429332.jpeg,CZ Highlights AI Deepfake Dangers as Hackers Target Trusted Link,https://cryptopotato.com/cz-highlights-ai-deepfake-dangers-as-hackers-target-trusted-link/,"Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has sounded a fresh alarm on the growing threat of AI-powered deepfakes, after a chilling real-life hack compromised Japanese crypto advocate Mai Fujimoto during a routine video call. The incident has renewed calls for stricter security habits as criminals wield advanced AI to breach even trusted communication channels. A Case Study in Modern Hacking On June 20, Fujimoto, better known online as Miss Bitcoin, narrated how she fell victim to a deepfake after being tricked into a Zoom call with an acquaintance whose Telegram account had already been compromised. According to her, the person on the video link was familiar, causing her to let down her guard. “For about 10 minutes in the online meeting, I saw her face but had no clue it was a deepfake,” Fujimoto recounted. However, there were audio issues with the call, prompting the deepfake impersonator to send a link supposedly meant to fix the problem. After clicking the link, Fujimoto unknowingly installed malware that compromised her Telegram and MetaMask. Her main X account was also hijacked, forcing her to plead with followers to report it as impersonation. She also warned users of the social platform not to click any links sent from the account. “If I had known about this kind of attack, I might not have clicked the link,” the crypto enthusiast lamented, urging widespread awareness. Her ordeal struck a chord across the crypto community, with influencers and security experts flooding X with stern reminders that in the age of AI, trust must be verified through multiple channels. CZ weighed in, too, warning his 10 million followers of the rampant use of artificial intelligence in new kinds of deepfake hackings. “Even a video call verification will soon be out of the window,” he cautioned, suggesting AI-generated impersonations will become harder to detect as the technology improves. The former Binance head urged users never to install software from unofficial links, even if they appear to come from friends. The Rise of AI-Powered Fraud The attack on Fujimoto is hardly isolated. A major report released by Bitget only days ago revealed that deepfake technology had played a role in nearly 40% of all high-value crypto frauds in 2024, contributing to at least $4.6 billion lost to scams. The study documented criminals using AI to create convincing fake videos of public figures like Elon Musk promoting scams, simulating customer service chats, and crucially, weaponizing video conferencing tools like Zoom with malicious links. Additionally, a different publication by Chainalysis noted that lawbreakers were increasingly using AI tools, including deepfakes, to bypass KYC measures and automate fraud, making crypto cons “increasingly difficult to detect.” In one such instance, Hong Kong police arrested 31 individuals linked to a syndicate that stole $34 million using AI-generated videos of crypto executives. Terrifyingly, the report warned that AI-driven swindles are poised to grow significantly.

On Friday, the US Supreme Court rejected a request from two toy manufacturers who tried to speed up their lawsuit challenging the legality of the trade penalties. That decision means the administration now has a full 30 days to respond, not a day less, as the normal appeal timeline remains intact. The request came from Learning Resources and hand2mind, two family-owned businesses that wanted to bypass the lower courts. Both companies said Trump had no legal right to impose the tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The law, passed in 1977, lets the president act during emergencies—but they argued it doesn’t let him slap blanket duties on imports just because he feels like it. They claimed the tariffs are wrecking business operations across the country and that dragging things out in court was not an option. Source: US Supreme Court Toy companies say tariffs are hurting businesses The companies told the court in their filing, “In light of the tariffs’ massive impact on virtually every business and consumer across the nation, and the unremitting whiplash caused by the unfettered tariffing power the president claims, challenges to the IEEPA tariffs cannot await the normal appellate process.” Rick Woldenberg, the chairman and CEO of Learning Resources and hand2mind, said in an interview with CNBC that the court’s refusal to fast-track the case “was a disappointment but honestly just another twist in the road.” Rick said, “You want to win every motion, but sometimes you don’t,” and made it clear that the legal battle isn’t over. “Ultimately this showdown will be at the Supreme Court.” For now, the fight continues in the lower courts. Last month, the US Court of International Trade temporarily blocked the tariffs, saying the IEEPA doesn’t give any president the power to slap tariffs on everything across the board. That decision gave some hope to companies like Rick’s. But earlier this month, a federal appeals court reversed that block and allowed the tariffs to stay while they consider arguments. The next hearing in that case is expected by the end of next month. The tariffs were first announced just weeks after Trump started his second term. Economists immediately warned that prices would skyrocket, stoking a new inflation storm just as Americans were hoping for relief. But that never happened. Not yet, anyway. Inflation hasn’t matched the predictions Consumer prices in May only went up 2.4% compared to a year ago, based on numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was even lower than what many economists had expected. In April, prices rose just 2.3%, the lowest pace since early 2021. The core inflation rate, tracked by the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, dropped to 2.5% in April—also the slowest since March 2021. This didn’t line up with the nightmare projections. Goldman Sachs predicted 6.3% core goods inflation this year. JPMorgan thought core inflation would nearly double before 2026. Back in May, American consumers surveyed by the University of Michigan expected prices to rise 6.6% by the end of the year. That dropped to 5.1% in June, but fears are still high. So far, businesses haven’t passed those tariff costs onto customers like experts said they would. Fitch Ratings said the effective tariff rate jumped to 14.1% this year—up from just 2.3% last year. That’s an increase of nearly 12 percentage points under Trump’s 2025 trade actions. The numbers alone made analysts sure inflation would spike. But prices haven’t followed that script. Not yet. Some economists haven’t given up on their predictions. They say this is just a delay. The US economy is massive, and things don’t move overnight. Trump’s trade policy has also been unpredictable, starting and stopping in ways that complicate forecasts. Still, inflation right now is lower than it was when Trump walked back into the White House. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the price spikes are limited so far. “Just a few items are growing in price as a result of tariffs,” Powell said. He pointed to Chinese electronics, especially PCs and audio-visual equipment. Those have gotten more expensive. But most items haven’t changed yet. Why not? Powell explained that stores are still selling inventory that arrived before the tariffs were active. He said, “Goods being sold at retailers today may have been imported several months ago, before tariffs were imposed.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

In its Weibo post , Tesla described the planned installation as a “smart regulator” for city power supplies, saying it can flexibly shift energy resources as needed. It added that the facility will “effectively solve the pressure of urban power supply and ensure the safe, stable, and efficient electricity demand of the city.” After completion, the project is expected to stand as the largest grid-side energy storage station in China. Tesla’s statement noted that its Shanghai battery plant produced more than 100 Megapacks during the first quarter of this year. Each Megapack is capable of delivering up to one megawatt of electricity for four hours. Battery energy storage systems on a utility scale help power networks keep supply and demand in check. They’re vital because they store energy when solar and wind output falls and release it when needed. China expands grid storage goals with Tesla amid trade tensions with US On Tesla’s website , each Megapack is listed under $1 million in the United States, but it hasn’t revealed the price in China. The deal marks a milestone for Tesla, which faces homegrown rivals CATL and BYD in the race to supply grid-scale batteries. CATL alone holds about 40% of the global market for battery cells and packs. Reuters has also reported that CATL was expected to provide the battery cells and modules for Tesla’s Megapacks. This deal comes at a tense time, with U.S.-China trade strained after President Trump slapped tariffs on Chinese imports. Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, was aligned with Trump in the early stages of that trade conflict, a factor that complicated the outlook for American automakers in China. Demand for large battery installations in China remains strong. In May 2024, Beijing set a goal to add nearly 5 gigawatts of storage capacity by the end of 2025, lifting the nation’s total to 40 gigawatts. Meanwhile, Tesla has begun exporting its Megapacks from Shanghai to Europe and other parts of Asia to serve global customers. Worldwide, battery storage capacity jumped by 42 gigawatts in 2023—nearly double the increase seen in 2022, according to the International Energy Agency.

Right now, Solana, XRP, and Cardano are topping Google trends, signaling renewed investor curiosity and potential momentum shifts. From bullish technical setups to macro narrative appeal, these highly searched tokens may be poised for breakout moves that align with rising visibility. This insight is brought to you by Outset PR —an agency that transforms trend signals into strategic media presence. With performance-backed PR and market-aligned messaging, Outset PR helps crypto projects stay visible exactly when investors start paying attention. Solana (SOL) Bounces Back: Bullish Hopes Amid Recent Dips Source: tradingview Solana's price is currently experiencing a dip, with values swinging between about $140 and $167. Recently, the coin's value declined by roughly 5.5% over the past week and nearly 15% in the last month. Despite this slump, Solana shows promise for a rebound. If buyers regain momentum, it could challenge the resistance level of $181, a potential climb of over 20% from lower levels. A further leap could drive prices towards the next marker at $209, suggesting an even more significant gain. But watch for immediate support around $127 to see if Solana can find a firm footing for the next upward push. XRP Edges Up with Possible Gains on the Horizon Source: tradingview XRP is currently trading between just over $2.05 and $2.30. Its price has seen a minor dip recently, falling by about 2% over the past week and nearly 9% this past month. Looking ahead, XRP could rise to the nearby resistance point of $2.45, which would mean a bump of about 10%. If it pushes further, it might aim for the second resistance level of $2.70, offering possible gains of around 17% from its current range. This crypto shows potential, although it’s just below its short-term trend average, hinting that it might soon break higher. Cardano's Current Price Movement: Is a Bounce Back on the Horizon? Source: tradingview Cardano's ADA is trading between fifty-nine to seventy-one cents, showing a recent drop in value. The coin faces a resistance level at seventy-eight cents and could climb nearly ten percent if it breaks through. However, it may fall to fifty-four cents if support doesn't hold, about a nine percent decline. Current market indicators show potential for growth, with the RSI and stochastic both pointing to the asset being oversold. If enthusiasm builds, ADA might approach ninety cents, indicating a potential gain of over twenty-five percent from its current range. Investors are watching closely for signs of a rebound in this fluctuating market.

Could these digital assets experience a surge by 2025? To capture a clearer picture of their potential, an in-depth analysis of their fair value post-correction is essential. Prepare to uncover which coins might be primed for substantial growth in the coming years. XRP Faces Mid-Range Struggles as Bearish Trends Persist Over the past month, XRP fell nearly 9.5% and slid around 5.35% over the last six months. Weekly performance indicates a drop of about 5.03%, reflecting continued bearish sentiment in the market. Selling pressure has often outweighed buying activities, keeping the price under strain. The overall trend demonstrates that XRP has been struggling to maintain upward momentum, trapped within a downtrend that shows little sign of reversal. Current trading positions XRP within a price range of $1.95 to $2.53, with the nearest resistance at around $2.88 and immediate support near $1.73. A secondary resistance level exists at $3.45, while a deeper support zone sits at $1.15. Oscillators like the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator show modest negatives at -0.068 and -0.166, suggesting sellers dominate. Traders might find opportunities near $1.73 for potential rebounds, yet caution is advised until a clear breakout above $2.88 occurs. The market remains sideways, favoring range-bound strategies until a trend reversal is evident. Ondo Price Trend: Recent Decline and Key Levels in Focus ONDO experienced a notable drop of around 17% over the past month, with a steep decline of nearly 57% over the last six months. The one-week change indicates a decrease of approximately 11.5%, reflecting a consistent downtrend in both the short and long term. During this period, price action remained within a range of about $0.70 to $1.05. Cumulative data points illustrate a prevailing bearish sentiment in the market, leading to reduced momentum that has hindered upward movement. This historical performance has actively contributed to the current trend observed in the figures. Current price levels remain confined within a range of about $0.70 to $1.05, with immediate support near $0.57 and resistance close to $1.27. Bears continue to dominate as key indicators, such as momentum and oscillator measurements, linger in negative territory, with the RSI around 39. This range signals active trading, though there is no clear bullish trend. Traders may consider waiting for a breakout above $1.27 or testing the $0.57 support for potential buying opportunities while maintaining close attention to price actions and employing tight risk management strategies amid uncertain market conditions. Conclusion XRP and ONDO show potential for significant growth by 2025. Trends and market performance indicate that both coins could see price increases after current corrections. Interest from investors and development activity around these cryptocurrencies will likely drive their value. While exact prices are uncertain, both XRP and ONDO could see a rise if market conditions remain favorable and adoption continues. Investors should keep an eye on market trends and upcoming developments for these coins. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In the statement made by the Wyoming Stable Token Committee, it was stated that both networks received the highest scores in terms of technical competence and performance and the stablecoin WYST was determined as the priority distribution platforms. WYST is the first fiat-backed stablecoin to be issued by a US state government. The digital asset, which will be pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, is designed to operate on multiple blockchains via LayerZero technology. Users will be able to conduct transactions on this public blockchain without requiring permission from any centralized entity. Although Wyoming is the least populous state in the US with a population of approximately 600 thousand people, it stands out as the state with the most “permissive” legal environment regarding digital assets. The WYST project launched in this context aims not only at the digital economy but also at the public good. The stablecoin will be backed by interest-bearing US Treasury bonds and repurchase agreements (repos). The income from these financial instruments will be transferred to the Wyoming School Foundation Program, which is affiliated with the Wyoming Department of Education. In this way, the increased use of stablecoins will directly contribute to the funding of schools in the state. *This is not investment advice.

The digital asset world is buzzing today, and not necessarily for the reasons many investors hoped. The Bitcoin price has experienced a notable dip, falling below the significant $104,000 mark. According to real-time market monitoring, the BTC price is currently trading around $103,909.99 on major exchanges like the Binance USDT market. Understanding the Latest Bitcoin Price Drop This recent Bitcoin drop below $104,000 is a key development that warrants close attention. While volatility is a hallmark of the crypto market, breaching specific price levels can trigger technical sell-offs or shift market sentiment. The $104,000 level may have been viewed by some traders as a support point, and its failure to hold could signal further downward potential in the short term. Several factors can contribute to sudden price movements in Bitcoin. Let’s explore some potential influences: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic uncertainty, inflation data, interest rate decisions by central banks, and geopolitical events can all impact investor risk appetite, leading to shifts away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory News: Announcements or rumors regarding stricter regulations on cryptocurrencies in major economies can create fear and uncertainty, prompting sell-offs. Large Liquidations: Significant liquidations of leveraged trading positions on exchanges can cascade, forcing more selling and accelerating a price decline. Market Sentiment Shifts: News cycles, social media trends, and overall investor confidence play a huge role. Negative sentiment can quickly spread, leading to panic selling. Technical Chart Patterns: Traders analyze charts for patterns and support/resistance levels. Breaking a key support level like $104,000 can trigger automated trading strategies designed to sell. What Factors Influence the BTC Price? Understanding the drivers behind the BTC price is crucial for anyone participating in the crypto market. It’s not just about supply and demand; it’s a complex interplay of global forces, technological developments, and human psychology. Here are some ongoing factors: Factor Influence on BTC Price Supply & Halvings Reduced new supply over time tends to be bullish long-term. Adoption Rates Increasing use by individuals, institutions, and businesses is bullish. Regulatory Landscape Clear, favorable regulations are bullish; restrictive ones are bearish. Technological Development Improvements to the network (e.g., scalability) can be bullish. Global Liquidity Availability of capital in the financial system can flow into crypto. While the current Bitcoin drop is concerning for some, it’s important to view it within the context of these broader factors and Bitcoin’s historical volatility. Navigating Crypto Market Volatility Price swings like the current Bitcoin drop are a stark reminder of the volatility inherent in the crypto market. For investors, this presents both challenges and potential opportunities. Challenges: Emotional stress and potential panic selling. Risk of significant losses, especially with leveraged positions. Difficulty in timing market entries and exits perfectly. Actionable Insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand the assets you invest in. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders. Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Long-Term Perspective: Many long-term investors focus on the fundamental technology and adoption rather than short-term price fluctuations. Stay Informed: Follow reliable cryptocurrency news sources to understand market drivers. This moment could be seen as a challenge for short-term traders, but for those with a long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s future, price dips can sometimes be viewed as potential accumulation opportunities. Staying Informed: The Importance of Cryptocurrency News In a fast-moving environment like the crypto market, staying updated through reliable cryptocurrency news is paramount. Knowing about regulatory shifts, technological updates, macroeconomic indicators, and significant on-chain movements can provide valuable context for price action, including the recent Bitcoin drop. Timely information helps investors make more informed decisions, avoid impulsive reactions based on fear or hype, and better understand the potential catalysts for future Bitcoin price movements. Conclusion: What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? The dip in Bitcoin price below $104,000 is a significant event for the market today. It highlights the inherent volatility and the influence of various global factors on digital asset valuations. While the immediate future price action remains uncertain, understanding the potential reasons behind this Bitcoin drop and adopting sound investment strategies are key for navigating these turbulent times. The crypto market continues to evolve, and price movements like this are a natural part of its growth trajectory.

Amidst this uncertainty, the CEO of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, is sounding an alarm that crypto can be a game-changer. Since Trump became President, markets have been unstable because of fears over the US Fed debt, inflation, and the added tariff menace. POTUS and the Fed’s chairman have been back and forth about the economy. Other than the US, other nations like Russia have reported slower economies and are also trying to fight inflation. It's no coincidence Bitcoin prices are at all-time highs. People are turning to Bitcoin as a refuge from inflation and deficit spending. It will ultimately be a check and balance on this activity. If this continues, Bitcoin could become the next world reserve currency. pic.twitter.com/Gr0hJDrWaN — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) June 20, 2025 Amidst all this, the crypto industry has thrived in most parts. In fact, the biggest coin, Bitcoin , has managed to maintain the 100k price for more than 40 days. Armstrong said, “ it’s no coincidence Bitcoin prices are at all-time highs. People are turning to Bitcoin as a refuge from inflation and deficit spending. The world needs crypto, now more than ever. “ BTC will soon grow to be the reserve currency – Armstrong According to Armstrong, the crypto industry is functioning in a way that, while Bitcoin is a store of value, stablecoins are the medium of exchange. He believes that holistic crypto adoption will take 10 to 15 years. Stablecoin legislation is navigating its way through the government. And Circle’s (CRCL) IPO was met with resounding enthusiasm. Armstrong said, “The stablecoin market cap is up 50%+ year-over-year, uncorrelated with crypto trading volume. […] This is crypto’s next daily use case, and it’s just the beginning. ” On the other hand, the Trump administration has moved to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve, though its framework remains to be determined. US companies such as GameStop (GME) and Strategy (MSTR) have been big buyers of Bitcoin to diversify their cash holdings. Trump Media & Technology (DJT) recently announced a plan to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin. Armstrong also said that he wants the US to remain in the reserve currency status. However, if the debt situation doesn’t get fixed eventually, Bitcoin will have to become the reserve currency for better or worse. He said that the Chinese RMB has no chance of becoming the reserve currency because they have their own debt problems. According to Statista, China’s total national debt is estimated at around $14.83 trillion in 2023. Coinbase strategies dedicated to Crypto Coinbase’s CEO said that they are focused on driving crypto adoption and growing the total addressable market. Their first strategy was directed towards Bitcoin, listing more assets, and now seeing real-world asset tokenization. Last year, RWA tokenization was up over 200x, with $20 billion now on-chain. He said that Coinbase is partnering with companies like Shopify to bring crypto payments to millions of merchants, further expanding the use of crypto in everyday transactions. Coinbase has created a Credit Card, powered by American Express, with up to 4% cashback paid in BTC. He added, “We’re not just putting a new UI on old rails. We’re building a new financial system from the ground up: new rails, new money, and new services like Bitcoin-backed loans using DeFi and stablecoin payments.” In addition, he said that the company is building a platform for the next generation of internet applications. According to him, the future of internet applications will be built on-chain. This allows value to flow directly to creators without intermediaries and platforms capturing most of the value. Meanwhile, the company’s first-quarter sales fell 24% from the prior year amid a slowdown in trading activity. Worthington rates Coinbase shares as Neutral with a $215 price target, suggesting 16% downside from current levels. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

In a new interview with CNBC Television, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino says that if the firm were a nation of its own, it would be the 18th-largest holder of US Treasuries in the world. “Well, Tether in 2024 was the fifth-largest purchaser of US treasuries. And if we were a country, right, I mean, we compare ourselves to countries now, and as an overall statistic, Tether is the 18th-largest holder of US treasuries. We have around $125 billion in US treasuries. We are acquiring, that portion of our reserve is increasing… We think the trajectory is also in line with the GENIUS Act so we are very excited to see a stablecoin bill that provides clear guidance.” US Treasuries are debt obligations backed by the US Department of the Treasury that vary in maturation dates and pay interest every six months. They are considered low-risk investments due to being backed by the government. Ardoino goes on to note that the US dollar is still the safest currency in the world, adding that USDT will bring over 400 million people access to it. “By far, the US dollar is the safest fiat currency in the world… Between Bitcoin and stablecoins, they will make America stronger, and I think that is the main point of the [current] Administration.

Notably, the app revenue on the network exceeded $1 billion for the second quarter in a row. Application revenue by chain | Source: Solana Foundation In Q2, Solana’s app revenue rose compared to Q1—even as application revenue on other major networks declined. In fact, Solana’s app revenue now surpasses the combined total of all other blockchain networks. This activity also contributed to a sharp rise in validator income, which reached an average quarterly level of $800 million. The peak occurred on Jan. 19, with $56.9 million earned in a single day. At the same time, validator costs have dropped dramatically.

According to recent market data, Solana (SOL) continues its recovery phase, maintaining a stable position above the $150 mark. However, the standout narrative emerging from investor circles and blockchain media revolves around a fast-rising DeFi project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Early buyers will get a preset profit of 100% ROI with the token going live at $0.06. Given the rising search volume around terms like best crypto to buy in 2025 industry experts say Mutuum’s accelerating momentum is no longer flying under the radar; it’s becoming a headline. Solana Forecast: Consolidation and Institutional Tailwinds Solana (SOL) is trading at approximately $153, a slight dip from intraday highs of $158, but holding firm above $149. Today’s pop above the $150 mark has been underpinned by intense staking activity, such as Galaxy Digital piling in about $63 million of Solana into its holdings, and growing optimism regarding multiple pending Solana ETF filings. Analysts note the key Fibonacci resistance zone of $167 to $170, which a break above this should lead to a trip to $190+, the more bullish goal at $300 by December 2025 if institutional momentum continues. Overall, SOL appears to be a cautious rebound, short-term trading in the $140–$158 range, until a sustained impetus marks the beginning of a more determined rise. Among these trends, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has gone under the radar relatively undetected. Mutuum Finance Presale Mania: $10.8M Already Raised Mutuum Finance is exploding in popularity. With its innovative two-way lending model, this DeFi powerhouse has already attracted over 12,200 investors and raised $10.8 million, and it’s not slowing down. The MUTM token price is set to jump to $0.035 in Phase 6, marking a 16.67% surge, meaning those who get in now are positioned for major gains. Early adopters are locking in profits. Mutuum Finance’s Lending Platform Mutuum Finance combines both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, giving users reliable returns from USDT pools via the P2C model and full control of direct crypto transactions via the P2P model. Mutuum’s USD-Pegged Stablecoin Mutuum Finance is not just riding the DeFi wave. Their upcoming overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin, launching on Ethereum, is designed to maintain price stability and avoid the pitfalls that have been seen with algorithmic stablecoins. With the project already audited by CertiK, Mutuum Finance is laying the groundwork for massive adoption, and those paying attention now could reap the biggest rewards later. In addition, the platform is running a massive $100,000 giveaway , where 10 lucky winners will receive $10,000 each in Mutuum Finance tokens. Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about altcoins of 2025, already securing $10.8 million from over 12,200 early investors. With a unique dual lending model, a fully collateralized stablecoin, and a Certik audit backing its credibility, the project is gaining rapid traction in the DeFi space. Early adopters in Phase 5 at $0.03 stand to double their investment with a guaranteed 100% ROI once the token hits $0.06 at launch, before any speculative upside even begins. If you’re serious about becoming a crypto millionaire in 2025, Mutuum Finance deserves a front-row seat in your portfolio. Secure your spot before the next price hike.

With its innovative tech-backed design and focus on optimization, Pepeto claims to offer what PEPE lacked: stability, utility, and long-term potential. PEPE vs. Pepeto: What Sets Them Apart? The original PEPE token remains a favorite among early adopters and retail traders, thanks to its meme-driven appeal and early hype cycle. It features healthy liquidity, visible in its 14.18% volume-to-market cap ratio, and clear technical zones. Source: CoinMarketCap Support sits strong at $0.00001000 and $0.00001012, while resistance is found around $0.00001045 and $0.00001060. Although PEPE rides short-term volatility, it lacks critical infrastructure such as dedicated staking or a built-in ecosystem, limiting its growth potential. In contrast, Pepeto emerges as a structured and utility-driven memecoin. It is not just riding hype but is backed by a roadmap that includes staking, exchange creation, and cross-chain bridging. Pepeto doesn’t just offer a meme; it promises a functional economy built around meme culture. Pepeto’s Bold Launch: Price, Presale, and Promise At the time of writing, #Pepeto is currently trading at a low of $0.000000135 , which presents an early entry opportunity. It has already raised $5.44 million out of its intended presale of $5.67 million. The staking rewards will provide up to 277% per year, which shows that #Pepeto is aiming primarily at long-term investors and not speculators. The token distribution is organised: 30% will be distributed to staking, 30% to presale, 20% to marketing, and minor portions to development and liquidity. Five exchange listings scheduled in presale and an audited smart contract are putting Pepeto in a comfortable position to be more than just another frog meme it is a scalable platform through which memecoins evolve. – Updates on $PEPETO exchange soon; once done, the day of judgement (Date of listing) would be days after – $PEPETO , The God of Frogs. pic.twitter.com/Aay4Tv5HCb — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) June 1, 2025 Why 2025 Might Belong to Pepeto In contrast to most meme tokens, Pepeto is created to be scalable and promote long-term adoption. It has an aggressive but structured roadmap . Once its website is launched and the contract audit is completed, the project will aim to launch a testable bridge and exchange platform. Its openness and interest in contact with the community are reinforced by community AMA sessions, marketing blitzes, and social media engagement. This approach creates trust and exposure, two crucial elements in a crowded market. Therefore, 2025 can be not only a good year of PEPE but also the breakthrough of Pepeto. For early backers, that moment might already be here. ABOUT PEPETO Pepeto is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency project blending the playful spirit of memecoins with a powerful, utility-driven ecosystem. It features a zero-fee exchange, a cross-chain bridge for seamless swaps, and staking rewards designed to support the next generation of tokens.

Strong Presale Numbers Build Confidence Ruvi AI’s impressive presale performance proves its potential. The growing interest in its ecosystem is reflected in these key achievements: $1.9 million raised More than 160 million tokens sold A holder base of over 1,600 investors One standout feature is Ruvi AI’s guaranteed post-presale valuation of $0.07 , a level of transparency that reassures investors looking for security in a fast-moving market.

Santiment says the ratio of bullish king crypto sentiment to bearish sentiment from retail traders has reached a two-month low. A low ratio of the metric is “typically a bullish sign,” according to the analytics firm. “With crypto in a bit of a lull, traders are showing signs of impatience and bearish sentiment. There are just 1.03 bullish comments for every 1 bearish comment, which hasn’t happened since peak fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) during initial tariff reactions on April 6th… …Markets historically move in the opposite direction of retail’s expectations. A prime example was the optimal buy time during the early April fear from other traders.” Source: Santiment/X Santiment further says that the Middle East conflict involving Israel and Iran will “likely continue to cause volatile and unpredictable price action” for the crypto market. “Despite the initial panic, Bitcoin has remained in the $104,000 – $105,000 range, aided by consistent exchange-traded funds (ETF) inflows and a lack of follow-through in military actions, mirroring the typical ‘risk-off, then stabilize’ pattern seen in previous geopolitical crises.” Source: Santiment/X Bitcoin is trading at $104,431 at time of writing.

If so, you know how crucial identifying key levels is for navigating the volatile crypto market . On-chain analysis firm Glassnode , a trusted source for deep market insights, recently highlighted a particularly significant area that could dictate Bitcoin’s next major move. Understanding this zone is vital for anyone tracking BTC. Glassnode’s Insight: Pinpointing Key Bitcoin Support According to recent findings shared by Glassnode on X (formerly Twitter), a substantial cluster of Bitcoin supply currently sits concentrated between the $95,500 and $97,000 price levels. This isn’t just a random number; this cluster represents a significant volume of BTC that last moved within this range, often indicating areas where many holders acquired their coins. Think of it like a historical battleground on the price chart. When the price revisits such an area, these holders’ conviction is tested. Will they sell (adding supply) or hold/buy more (adding demand)? This concentration of supply often acts as a natural support level, a floor where buying pressure might emerge. Why is this specific range so important right now? Glassnode points out that this large supply cluster is located just below a critical on-chain metric: the short-term holder cost basis. Understanding the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis The short-term holder (STH) cost basis is an average price at which Bitcoin moved on-chain relatively recently. Glassnode typically defines short-term holders as entities holding BTC for less than approximately 155 days. Their cost basis represents the aggregate price they paid for their coins. Currently, the short-term holder cost basis is identified around the $98,000 mark. This level is significant because when the Bitcoin price is above the STH cost basis, this group of holders is, on average, in profit. This can sometimes lead to selling pressure as they realize gains. Conversely, when the price drops below their cost basis, they are, on average, at a loss, which can sometimes lead to panic selling or, alternatively, strong conviction holding depending on market sentiment. The fact that the large supply cluster ($95.5K-$97K) sits just below the STH cost basis ($98K) creates a layered support structure. It suggests that not only is there a historical concentration of supply in that lower zone, but the current average purchase price of recent buyers is also just above it, creating a potentially robust area of interest for market participants. Bullish vs. Bearish Scenarios: What These Levels Tell Us The on-chain analysis from Glassnode provides clear potential scenarios based on how the Bitcoin price interacts with these identified levels: Sustained Hold Above $97,000: If Bitcoin manages to consistently trade and close above the upper bound of the supply cluster ($97,000) and especially above the STH cost basis ($98,000), it would signal strong buying pressure and conviction among holders. This scenario supports the continuation of the current bullish momentum, potentially paving the way for further price appreciation. Holding above $98,000 would mean the average short-term holder is back in profit, reducing the immediate pressure to sell at a loss and potentially encouraging renewed buying. This is a key indicator for the health of the current uptrend in the crypto market . Drop Below $95,500: Conversely, a decisive drop below the lower bound of the significant supply cluster ($95,500) would be a bearish signal. Breaking below this level suggests that the historical support from the concentrated supply is failing. It could indicate that holders who acquired coins in this range are now selling, potentially triggering a cascade effect. Furthermore, if the price drops significantly below the STH cost basis ($98,000), a large portion of short-term holders would be underwater, increasing the risk of capitulation or forced selling, which could accelerate a downward price movement. Here’s a quick look at the key levels identified by Glassnode: Level/Zone Significance Potential Implication $98,000 Short-Term Holder Cost Basis Above = STH in profit (bullish); Below = STH in loss (bearish pressure) $95,500 – $97,000 Large Supply Cluster Historical area of significant acquisition, acts as potential support Why On-Chain Analysis Matters for Bitcoin Price While technical analysis focuses on price patterns and trading volume on exchanges, on-chain analysis delves into the underlying blockchain data. It tracks the movement of coins, identifies accumulation or distribution trends, and provides insights into the behavior of different groups of market participants (like short-term vs. long-term holders). Glassnode is a leader in this field, providing metrics derived directly from the Bitcoin blockchain. Their analysis of supply clusters and holder cost bases offers a unique perspective on potential support and resistance levels, complementing traditional technical analysis and providing a more fundamental view of market structure. Challenges and Considerations It’s important to remember that even strong on-chain support levels are not guaranteed floors. Market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and large institutional moves can all impact the Bitcoin price and potentially override on-chain signals. Volatility is inherent in the crypto market . Furthermore, while Glassnode provides invaluable data, interpreting on-chain metrics requires expertise. The definitions of holder groups and the significance of various metrics can evolve, and these insights should be used as part of a broader analysis framework, not in isolation. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors Based on this on-chain analysis : Monitor the $95.5K – $97K Zone: Pay close attention to price action if Bitcoin approaches this range. Look for signs of buying pressure or a bounce, which could confirm it as support. Watch the $98K Level: A move and sustained hold above $98,000 would be a strong indication of renewed bullish momentum, as it puts the average short-term holder back into profit. Identify Potential Risk: A clear break and close below $95,500 should be viewed as a significant bearish signal, potentially indicating further downside is likely. Combine Analysis: Use these on-chain insights alongside technical analysis (chart patterns, moving averages) and fundamental analysis (news, adoption trends) for a more comprehensive view of the crypto market . Conclusion: Navigating Bitcoin’s Critical Juncture Glassnode’s latest update provides a compelling look at key structural support levels for the Bitcoin price . The confluence of a large supply cluster between $95,500 and $97,000, positioned just below the short-term holder cost basis at $98,000, creates a fascinating and critical zone for the market. Holding above these levels, particularly the $98,000 mark, would reinforce the bullish narrative and suggest underlying strength from recent buyers. Conversely, a failure to hold and a break below $95,500 could signal weakness and potentially trigger a bearish phase. As always, staying informed with data-driven insights from firms like Glassnode and combining them with other forms of analysis is key to navigating the dynamic world of the crypto market .

The right crypto PR agency can elevate your brand, secure placements in tier‑1 media, and drive community buzz. Here’s a list of the top 10 crypto PR agencies dominating the space in 2025—and why they could be your web3 project’s best ally. What Is Crypto PR? Crypto public relations is the engine that drives reputation, visibility, and trust in Web3. While traditional PR agencies focus on brand image and media presence, crypto PR agencies go deeper, crafting stories that resonate with a tech-savvy, investor-aware, and often skeptical audience. In practical terms, that means getting your name into publications like CoinTelegraph, Decrypt, Bitcoinist, or Beincrypto. But it also means managing your social presence, engaging with crypto influencers, running AMAs, launching SEO-optimized content, and building a narrative around your utility and vision. If you're launching a new network, promoting a meme coin, or raising funds through an IDO, you need a PR team that understands decentralization and can speak the language of crypto Twitter, Discord degens, and institutional investors. How Crypto PR Differs from Traditional PR While any agency can pitch a press release, only a crypto-native PR team can frame your product in a way that’s authentic to this ecosystem. A traditional agency might fumble over terms like zk-rollups or DAO governance. A top-tier crypto PR firm, on the other hand, already has relationships with top editors at CoinDesk and Crypto Potato, can map out your go-to-market strategy on X, and knows exactly which influencers can take your token from 10K to 100K holders. What Services Do Crypto PR Agencies Offer? Beyond press placements, here are some of the core services crypto PR firms typically offer: Media outreach & Tier-1 publication coverage Influencer and KOL marketing (YouTube, X, TikTok, Telegram) SEO and content strategy Community engagement & AMA coordination Paid campaign coordination Reputation & crisis management Event promotion & speaking opportunities Social media marketing The best agencies offer flexible, outcome-driven solutions tailored to each project's needs and growth stage.

Coinbase , one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has achieved a significant milestone by securing a Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) license in Luxembourg. This isn’t just another license; it marks a pivotal moment as Coinbase becomes the first U.S. crypto exchange to obtain this comprehensive EU crypto license , signaling a strategic shift in its European operations. What is the MiCA License and Why is it a Game Changer? The Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) is the European Union’s groundbreaking framework designed to bring much-needed clarity and regulatory certainty to the crypto space across all 27 member states. Think of it as a unified rulebook for crypto assets and related services within the EU. Before MiCA, the regulatory landscape for crypto in Europe was fragmented, with each country having its own set of rules (or lack thereof). This created complexity and uncertainty for businesses operating across borders. MiCA aims to change that by: Providing legal clarity for crypto assets not covered by existing financial services legislation. Establishing requirements for crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), such as exchanges and wallet providers, covering authorization, governance, capital requirements, and consumer protection. Setting rules to prevent market manipulation and ensure market integrity. Introducing specific regulations for stablecoins and other types of crypto assets. For a major player like Coinbase , obtaining a MiCA license is crucial. It provides a clear legal basis to offer a wide range of crypto services across the entire EU under one regulatory umbrella, rather than needing separate licenses in multiple countries. This simplifies compliance, reduces operational hurdles, and fosters greater trust among users and institutional clients. Why Luxembourg? Exploring the Favorable Regulatory Environment The news from CNBC highlighted that Coinbase is shifting its European hub from Ireland to Luxembourg. This move isn’t random; it points to Luxembourg’s growing reputation as a forward-thinking jurisdiction for financial services, including fintech and crypto. Luxembourg has actively worked to cultivate a favorable environment for innovation while maintaining robust regulatory standards. Its financial regulator, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF), is known for being approachable and knowledgeable about complex financial instruments and technologies. This proactive stance likely appealed to Coinbase seeking a reliable and predictable regulatory partner for its EU operations. Key factors potentially making Luxembourg attractive include: Clear Legal Framework: Luxembourg has been among the early adopters in providing legal clarity for blockchain and crypto activities. Experienced Regulator: The CSSF has experience supervising complex financial entities and adapting to new technologies. Strategic Location: Positioned at the heart of Europe, with strong links to other major financial centers. Political Stability: A stable political and economic environment is crucial for long-term business planning. While Ireland has also been a base for many tech and financial companies, the specific requirements and the perceived efficiency or clarity regarding the new MiCA framework in Luxembourg may have been the deciding factors for Coinbase’s strategic relocation of its primary EU base. What Does This Mean for Coinbase’s EU Strategy? Securing the MiCA license in Luxembourg is a cornerstone of Coinbase’s long-term European expansion strategy. It signifies a commitment to operating within established regulatory frameworks and positions Coinbase strongly to serve the vast EU market more effectively. The benefits for Coinbase are numerous: Market Access: A single license allows passporting of services across the EU, significantly expanding potential reach. Operational Efficiency: Centralizing operations under one regulatory regime reduces complexity compared to managing multiple country-specific licenses. Enhanced Reputation: Being among the first major U.S. exchanges to secure this comprehensive EU license boosts credibility and trust with both retail and institutional clients. Compliance Leadership: Demonstrates a commitment to regulatory compliance, setting a precedent for other international exchanges. This move allows Coinbase to consolidate its European presence, streamline compliance efforts, and potentially offer a wider range of regulated services to its EU customer base, from trading to custody and beyond, all under the unified rules of MiCA. This is a significant step in solidifying Coinbase’s position as a trusted and compliant platform in the global crypto landscape, particularly within the stringent requirements of European Crypto regulation . How Does This Impact EU Crypto Users and the Broader Market? For individuals and institutions using or looking to use Coinbase in the EU, this development is overwhelmingly positive. A MiCA-licensed exchange offers enhanced consumer protection, greater transparency, and increased security due to the stringent requirements placed on licensed entities. Users can have more confidence knowing that Coinbase’s operations in the EU are supervised under a comprehensive, harmonized regulatory framework. This includes rules around safeguarding client funds, handling complaints, and ensuring clear information about the risks associated with crypto assets. On a broader market level, Coinbase obtaining this key EU crypto license could trigger a domino effect. It sets a precedent for other major international crypto exchanges operating or planning to operate in Europe. We are likely to see a rush from other platforms to also secure their MiCA licenses, potentially leading to: Increased competition among regulated entities. A clearer distinction between compliant and non-compliant platforms. Greater institutional adoption of crypto as regulatory uncertainty decreases. Potential for more innovative, yet compliant, crypto products and services entering the market. This move by Coinbase underscores the maturation of the crypto industry and the increasing importance of regulatory compliance for global players. It highlights how major exchanges are adapting to and embracing new regulatory landscapes like MiCA to ensure long-term sustainability and growth. What Challenges Might Coinbase Still Face? While securing the MiCA license is a monumental achievement, it doesn’t mean the path ahead is without challenges. Operating under a comprehensive regulatory framework like MiCA comes with ongoing responsibilities and potential hurdles: Operational Costs: Maintaining compliance with MiCA’s extensive requirements involves significant ongoing costs related to legal, compliance, technology, and personnel. Adapting to Evolving Rules: While MiCA provides clarity, regulatory interpretations and technical standards may evolve, requiring continuous adaptation. Competition: As other players secure MiCA licenses, competition for EU market share will intensify. Integration Challenges: Fully integrating operations and compliance processes across different EU countries, even with passporting rights, can present logistical challenges. Navigating the specifics of Crypto regulation across different EU member states, even under the harmonized MiCA framework, will require careful attention and resources. However, Coinbase’s proactive step in securing the license in Luxembourg demonstrates a preparedness to tackle these challenges head-on. Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto in the EU Under MiCA Coinbase’s move is a strong indicator of the direction the crypto industry is heading in Europe. The implementation of MiCA is transforming the EU into one of the most regulated and potentially safest jurisdictions for crypto activities globally. This regulatory clarity is expected to attract more traditional financial institutions and investors into the space, further bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized technologies. The decision to base the EU hub in Luxembourg also highlights the country’s ambition to be a key player in the future of finance, embracing digital assets within a robust regulatory structure. As MiCA comes fully into effect and more companies like Coinbase obtain licenses, we can anticipate increased innovation, greater consumer protection, and a more stable and predictable crypto market across the European Union. This is a positive development for the entire ecosystem, suggesting a future where major crypto exchanges operate with the same level of regulatory scrutiny and consumer confidence as traditional financial institutions, paving the way for broader adoption and integration of digital assets into the global economy. Conclusion: A New Era for Coinbase in Europe Coinbase securing the first U.S. exchange MiCA license in Luxembourg is more than just a regulatory formality; it’s a strategic pivot that underscores the increasing maturity of the crypto market and the growing importance of clear, comprehensive Crypto regulation . By choosing Luxembourg as its new European hub, Coinbase is positioning itself to navigate the complexities of the EU market under a unified framework, offering enhanced trust and accessibility to millions of potential users. This landmark achievement not only benefits Coinbase by streamlining its operations and expanding its reach but also signals a positive step forward for the entire European crypto ecosystem. It encourages compliance, fosters confidence, and lays the groundwork for future growth and innovation under the protective umbrella of the EU crypto license framework. The crypto journey in Europe is entering a new, more regulated, and potentially more prosperous phase, with Coinbase leading the charge from its new base in Luxembourg .

Daly said that the impact of the customs duties on inflation, which have recently been on the agenda, does not seem to be as serious as first announced, and that the continuous decline in inflation is also a positive development. “The economic fundamentals are moving toward the possibility of a rate cut,” Daly said, but he said a rate cut could be more appropriate in the fall unless there is significant weakening in the labor market. The FED member also stated that caution should be exercised regarding the future course of customs duties, saying, “Other potential customs duty measures may not have as great an impact on inflation as is thought.” However, he added that it was unclear to what extent these measures would be reflected on consumers.

On the other hand, the new FED economic forecasts released this week indicate that growth will slow and inflation will increase slightly. However, FED officials predict that interest rates will be cut this year. This shows that they accept that customs duties will put pressure on prices, but they think this effect will not last long. However, there are striking differences of opinion within the FED. Seven of the 19 officials argue that no interest rate cuts should be made this year, while eight predict two interest rate cuts. This view coincides with investors’ expectations of two 25 basis point rate cuts in September and December. Two officials expect one, and two officials expect three. *This is not investment advice.

Using a ChatGPT analysis, we’ve broken down the most up-and-coming crypto trends you should know about before they likely dominate the industry in the years to come. “Narrative waves” have long dominated the crypto sector as a whole—think NFTs in 2021 or this year’s memecoin boom. However, with blockchain attracting more and more attention, it seems as if it’s only a matter of time before the next wave makes a splash on the Web3 scene. DePIN Reimagines Infrastructure As We Know It One such trend shaking things up is the emergence of decentralized physical infrastructure networks, primarily known as “DePIN.” DePIN refers to blockchain-based programs that allow users to contribute infrastructure at a local scale while rewarding participants for adding data and resources to the network itself. Traditional DePIN infrastructure includes storage, energy, bandwidth, computing, and more, making the sector attractive to governments looking to potentially improve their jurisdiction’s infrastructure via a decentralized, people-first approach. Proponents of DePIN argue that it decentralizes and democratizes technological advancement, particularly when it comes to developing rural areas with innovative technology. “DePIN leverages blockchain technology to decentralize the control and management of physical devices, addressing limitations of traditional infrastructure networks,” a June 2024 study by Zin et al. states . Coming off the heels of an unprecedented power outage that saw parts of Spain, France, and Portugal go dark, DePIN could offer a localized solution for reconfiguring power grids in a way that decreases the risk of a major blackout occurring. #BREAKING : Massive blackout Caused by ""Rare Atmospheric Phenomenon""!

Portugal’s grid operator blames a fault from a ""rare atmospheric phenomenon"" causing extreme temp… pic.twitter.com/NJxiybYjOi — In2ThinAir (@In2ThinAir) April 28, 2025 With a market value of $2.2 trillion and the potential to grow to $3.5 trillion by 2025, DePIN appears to be a hotbed for innovation. Cooperative digital storage network Filecoin, global map crowdsourcing platform Hivemapper, and graphics processing unit (GPU) companies like Render Network have all created hype around the forthcoming sector, with plenty of startups following suit. And that’s not all—a 2025 Messari report finds that the DePIN projects have attracted an estimated $1 billion in venture capital since 2023. “DePIN went from being a non-consensus category to being widely recognized as one of, if not the single most important sector advancing the crypto economy today,” the report reads . In summary, DePIN has the ingredients of a 2026 breakout—novel tech, real utility, strong early metrics, and synergy with other hot trends, making it a top sector to watch. Traditional Finance Meets Web3 With RWA Tokenization Another key crypto trend expected to surface next year is the rise of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. RWA tokenization involves shifting traditional finance assets into blockchain-based signifiers, effectively giving each claim both physical and digital value . Key categories gaining traction include tokenized debt and securities (e.g., tokenized U.S. Treasury bills, corporate bonds, stocks), real estate tokens (fractional ownership of property or REITs on-chain), commodities (gold, oil, carbon credits tokenized for easier trading), invoices and trade finance (bringing receivables onto the blockchain for lending), and even intangibles like intellectual property, art, or royalties. According to a study from Fortune Business Insights , the global tokenization market is expected to hit $3.95 billion in 2025, up from $3.32 billion in 2024. The sector is also projected to hit $12.83 billion by the end of 2032, with a compound annual growth rate of 18.3%. Heavyweights in the traditional finance industry like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and JPMorgan Chase have already embraced bringing tokenization to their clients as the sector becomes increasingly popular. BREAKING: BlackRock is tokenizing its $150B Treasury Fund ( #RWA ), SEC filing shows. Partnering with BNY Mellon to launch DLT-based shares. It’s happening at $150B scale. pic.twitter.com/kvaD0aOqfR — Real World Asset Watchlist (@RWAwatchlist_) April 30, 2025 “The continued experimentation with tokenized assets by global financial institutions such as banks, custodians, fund administrators, and asset managers points to a potential future where multiple participants can transact across multiple asset types in a seamless and automated way, enabling new approaches to portfolio construction, management, and distribution at scale,” JPMorgan Chase said in a recent report . “We believe the concepts put forward in this initiative could revolutionize the wealth management industry, and we encourage ecosystem participants to join us in building towards this future,” the organization added. Meanwhile, tokenization is already making a dramatic impact on the world of alternative assets. For example, just last month, the Dubai Land Department (DLD) unveiled its landmark government-backed tokenized real estate platform. BREAKING: Dubai just launched a $16B tokenized real estate project on XRP Ledger. Buy property for just $500. Habibi money is loading. #RWA pic.twitter.com/rdYpptVzoj — Real World Asset Watchlist (@RWAwatchlist_) May 26, 2025 The first-of-its-kind initiative plans to tokenize $16 billion worth of real estate by 2033, marking a major step in mainstream tokenized RWA adoption globally. “Through the platform, investors can access comprehensive property details, ranging from pricing, risk factors, and technical specifications to the minimum investment required, ensuring full transparency and informed decision-making,” DLD said in a May press release . “Currently available exclusively to UAE ID holders, the platform is set to expand globally in the near future, with additional platforms to be integrated in later phases, further reinforcing Dubai’s position as a global hub for innovation in tokenized real estate,” the government organization added. SocialFi Marries Web3 With Social Media Last but not least, blockchain-based social media platforms—collectively referred to as SocialFi—are set to amass strong attention in the years ahead. SocialFi platforms largely focus on blending the decentralized nature of DeFi with the digital connectivity of traditional social media applications, generating a whole new user experience. Key features of these novel applications include censorship resistance, creator control, and direct-to-influencer monetization in a bid to remove traditional top-down social media organizational structures. According to a March 2025 report from Market.us , the global decentralized social network market size is expected to be worth around $61.8 billion by 2034, up from just $9.4 billion in 2024. “Demand for decentralized social networks is predominantly driven by tech-savvy users and advocates of digital privacy, who are disillusioned with the data handling practices of conventional social media corporations,” the report reads in part. Certain platforms have offered users the opportunity to trade cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and tokens with friends as a means of creating a digital space for social financialization. “This economic incentive is a significant draw for content creators, influencers, and everyday users who seek to gain tangible rewards for their online engagement and community engagement efforts,” the report continues. SocialFi platforms like Farcaster, Lens Protocol, Open Campus, and Friend.tech are just some of the names shaking up the emerging DeFi social media sector. Bringing a $3.8T education industry on-chain is no small feat. Watch @hanshanhk break down why solving student finance is at the heart of @EDUChain_xyz ’s mission. pic.twitter.com/RlFBWuTzwt — Open Campus (@opencampus_xyz) June 10, 2025 All in all, ChatGPT’s forward-looking analysis suggests that by 2026, one or more decentralized social networks could achieve a mainstream breakthrough, turning SocialFi into a leading crypto narrative . As blockchain technology continues to evolve, identifying the major narrative waves that still lie ahead remains no small feat. From the emergence of DePIN to the development of SocialFi, emerging trends in the crypto sector offer new approaches to longstanding issues along the lines of tech, governance, and social connectivity. These trends aren’t just for insiders—they’re shaping how we live, invest, and interact online. AI’s early analysis reveals that by 2026, these sectors could be leading the charge in the next crypto boom.

After launching in July 2024 with barely any excitement, these funds are now pulling in cash for the sixth straight week, and have booked inflows in eight of the last nine weeks. According to SoSoValue, this is the most consistent interest Ethereum ETFs have seen since they started trading. The same products that were being called zombie funds earlier this year are suddenly alive and pulling in real money. This renewed appetite comes as the second-largest crypto by market cap finds itself back in the middle of regulatory actions in the US. Traders are also paying attention again, thanks to new progress around stablecoins, which mostly run on the Ethereum network. Source: SoSo Value A key event was the IPO of Circle, the company behind the second-largest stablecoin. That, combined with a leadership shake-up at the Ethereum Foundation, is drawing institutions back in. Institutions quietly re-enter as arbitrage opportunities grow Ben Kurland, CEO of research firm DYOR, said big players have been changing strategy. “What we’re seeing is institutional recalibration,” Ben said. “After the initial ETH ETF approval fizzled without a price pop, smart money started quietly building positions. They’re betting not on price momentum but on positioning ahead of utility unlocks like staking access, options listings, and eventually inflows from retirement platforms.” So far, Ethereum ETF inflows have reached around $3.9 billion. That’s tiny compared to bitcoin ETFs, which pulled in $36 billion in their first year. But Ethereum is starting to catch up. Chris Rhine, who heads liquid active strategies at Galaxy Digital, pointed to one reason why. “With increasing acceptance of crypto on Wall Street, especially now as a means for payments and remittances, investors are being drawn to ETH ETFs,” Chris said. The arbitrage window is also helping. Right now, the CME basis on Ethereum—the gap between futures and spot prices—is wider than Bitcoin’s. This gives traders a chance to go long on Ethereum ETFs and short on futures, squeezing out profits. That strategy is simple and repeatable. It’s also one of the forces behind the steady ETF inflows we’re seeing now. Even though the money is flowing into ETFs, the price of Ethereum itself hasn’t moved. It’s down this month. Over the past month, it’s basically flat. For the year, it’s fallen 25%. That’s not a small drop. Ethereum has struggled with its identity. Since its last major upgrade, revenue is down. Solana is gaining ground. Traders aren’t sure what Ethereum’s long-term value looks like anymore. There’s also macro pressure. This year has been full of geopolitical noise, and that has kept volatility high across crypto. In March, Standard Chartered cut its Ethereum price target by more than half. Even then, the bank said there’s still a chance the coin recovers by the end of the year. The recent ETF inflow spike already slowed down, but it hasn’t reversed. Bitcoin momentum adds fuel to Ethereum demand While Ethereum plays catch-up, Bitcoin is doing what it always does; moving the market. After hitting an all-time high in May, Bitcoin fell 10% over the next nine days. Now it’s almost fully recovered. The rebound is powered by institutions, policy, and market structure. The IBIT ETF has already hit $70 billion in assets in just 341 days. That’s more than five times faster than SPDR Gold ETF’s record. There’s also a clear setup on the charts. The weekly chart of bitcoin futures has been climbing since late 2022. One key metric, the Average Percent True Range (APTR), shows how much the price moves over time, in percentage terms. Right now, the 10-week APTR is at 8.5%. That’s low, and it usually happens just before a breakout. Every time APTR dropped to around 9% or 7%, Bitcoin launched higher. On the daily chart, APTR is hovering between 3% and 4% over the past 10 trading sessions. That’s another low reading. Bitcoin is testing the $110,000 resistance level for the third time. Some traders are calling for a breakout, with a Fibonacci target set at $135,000.

In the noisy world of crypto, Little Pepe isn’t just another token chasing the latest hype. It’s staking a claim as the world’s first Layer 2 blockchain built purely for meme projects, and its early trajectory suggests that 2025 could be the year this froggy hero hops straight into the spotlight. A Layer 2 Chain Tailored for Memes When most Layer 2 networks tout lower fees and higher throughput, they’re typically focused on serious enterprise applications or sprawling DeFi ecosystems. Little Pepe’s creators took a different path: they built an environment where meme coins don’t get lost in the shuffle. By optimizing the network specifically for community-driven, culture-rich tokens, transactions become nearly instantaneous and fees shrink to a fraction of a cent. That specialization removes the noise and delivers a playground where a simple frog meme can compete with the biggest projects on Ethereum, without requiring heavy developer overhead or complex integrations. A Meme Launchpad That Puts Users First Nobody launches a meme coin just by tossing a whitepaper into the wind and hoping it sticks. Little Pepe’s roadmap centers on a dedicated “meme launchpad” that empowers creators with ready-made tools and templates for token issuance, marketing, and community engagement. By removing technical barriers, this launchpad invites influencers, artists, and die‑hard meme aficionados to spin up new projects in hours, not weeks. For investors, that promise of continuous innovation—fresh tokens dropping with viral potential—creates a dynamic pipeline of opportunities that traditional platforms can’t match. Bulletproof Against Rug Pulls and Sniper Bots In the meme coin universe, trust gets eroded every time a project pulls a rug or sniper bots drain liquidity in seconds. Little Pepe addresses both threats head-on. Its smart contracts incorporate built-in defenses against automated front‑running, making it nearly impossible for bots to snatch tokens before genuine community members have a chance. Meanwhile, the token’s distribution model locks a healthy portion into chain reserves and liquidity pools, deterring the sudden disappearance of funds. No BS, no smoke and mirrors—just a straightforward commitment to keeping the baby frog in safe hands. Backed by Meme Veterans and CEX Listings Behind every viral sensation is a team that knows the terrain. Little Pepe’s founding contributors include anonymous experts who’ve steered some of the most successful meme tokens to market. Their strategic know‑how has already shaped two fully sold‑out presale stages: the first closed in just 72 hours, and the second vanished even faster, raising over $1.3 million between them. That momentum has also secured agreements to list on two top centralized exchanges at launch, with plans underway to go live on at least one of the world’s largest trading platforms. By the time you read that “LILPEPE is listed” alert, you’ll know the mainstream is waking up to the frog’s potential. How to Buy LILPEPE Meme Coin Grabbing your share of Little Pepe before the masses arrive is surprisingly straightforward. First, set up a wallet that supports the Ethereum network—MetaMask or Trust Wallet works perfectly. Make sure you’ve topped it up with enough ETH or USDT to cover both your purchase and the network fees. Next, head to Little Pepe’s Website , connect your wallet, input your desired amount, and confirm the transaction. In a few moments, you’ll see LILPEPE tokens appear in your wallet, ready to ride the wave with zero taxes on buys or sells. And if you’re feeling lucky, don’t forget to enter the ongoing $777,000 giveaway, where ten winners will each snag $77,000 worth of tokens. Conclusion: The Golden Meme Age Awaits Little Pepe isn’t just another coin hoping for a tick on the price chart. It embodies a vision of genuinely community-driven, culture‑passed, and technology‑powered digital assets. By uniting meme magic with a robust, low‑fee Layer 2 infrastructure, a purpose‑built launchpad, anti‑bot protections, and heavyweight backing, LILPEPE stands poised to redefine what a meme coin can achieve. If you’ve ever dreamed of getting in on the ground floor of the next big thing, now is the time to learn how to buy, claim your tokens, and brace for takeoff. The Golden Meme Age has arrived—and Little Pepe is leading the charge.

But for those who may have hesitated on Solana in its early days, there’s a new opportunity making waves. Ruvi AI (RUVI), an audited utility token combining blockchain and AI, is shaping up to be 2025’s must-watch investment. With analysts forecasting a 66x ROI, Ruvi AI’s potential could outmatch Solana’s historic growth. Why analysts prefer Ruvi AI over Solana Solana built its reputation by solving blockchain scalability issues with fast and affordable transactions. However, Ruvi AI takes innovation even further by addressing real-world industry challenges using AI-integrated blockchain solutions. Unlike Solana, which primarily focuses on decentralized applications (dApps), Ruvi AI targets marketing, entertainment, and finance, offering practical tools that businesses can implement for tangible results. A key factor driving Ruvi AI’s appeal is its structured growth model. Currently priced at $0.015 per token in Phase 2 of its presale, Ruvi AI allows early investors to enter at a low cost. The token’s price is guaranteed to rise to $0.07 post-presale, delivering an almost 5x ROI before it even hits public exchanges. Analysts project that Ruvi AI could climb to $1 per token after listing, equating to an impressive 66x ROI for presale participants. With this kind of potential, Ruvi AI provides clarity and predictability that speculative investments like Solana can’t offer. Presale success highlights Ruvi AI’s strength The momentum behind Ruvi AI is evident in the success of its presale. The project has already raised over $1.9 million, sold more than 160 million tokens, and attracted a dedicated community of over 1,600 holders. What sets Ruvi AI apart is its guaranteed post-presale valuation of $0.07 per token, which ensures stability and confidence for investors. This structured approach eliminates the guesswork, making Ruvi AI an attractive option in the volatile cryptocurrency market. VIP tiers maximize investor earnings To further reward presale participants, Ruvi AI offers VIP investment tiers that provide substantial bonus tokens based on the level of investment. Here’s how the tiers enhance returns: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These VIP tiers enable investors to maximize their profitability during the presale, further enhancing the appeal of Ruvi AI as a high-reward investment. Trust and transparency set Ruvi AI apart Ruvi AI’s commitment to security and transparency sets it apart from many other crypto projects. The project is undergoing a third-party audit by CyberScope, a globally recognized blockchain auditing firm, to verify its systems and technology. This audit ensures Ruvi AI’s infrastructure is reliable and secure, providing peace of mind to investors. Additionally, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange, guaranteeing post-presale liquidity. This means token holders can seamlessly buy or sell RUVI tokens on an established platform immediately after the presale ends, eliminating common post-launch issues. Real-world applications anchor Ruvi AI’s value Unlike the speculative nature of many crypto tokens, Ruvi AI is designed to solve real-world problems in major industries: Marketing: Ruvi AI provides AI-powered tools that help businesses optimize ad targeting, improve campaign ROI, and streamline operations. Entertainment: By enabling blockchain-backed payments and personalized AI content suggestions, Ruvi AI empowers creators to monetize more effectively while enhancing user engagement. Finance: With solutions for fraud prevention, improved transparency, and scalability, Ruvi AI helps modernize financial institutions for the digital age. This practical utility ensures that Ruvi AI tokens maintain real value far into the future. Why Ruvi AI is the best bet of 2025 If you missed out on Solana’s early growth, Ruvi AI offers a chance to make up for it with unprecedented utility and return potential. With a presale price of $0.015, a guaranteed $0.07 post-presale valuation, and a projected $1 target, Ruvi AI provides a roadmap for success that sets it apart from speculative crypto investments. Having raised over $1.9 million, sold 160 million tokens, and secured partnerships with CyberScope and WEEX Exchange, Ruvi AI is ready to redefine the crypto landscape. Don’t wait to see if 2025 repeats Solana’s success story.

Having already raised over $1.9 million through its ongoing presale and selling more than 160 million tokens , Ruvi AI is proving to be more than just a trend. With analysts predicting a 66x ROI and a future token valuation of $1 , Ruvi AI has emerged as a serious contender that could challenge Shiba Inu’s popularity and value. How Ruvi AI Could Rival Shiba Inu Shiba Inu’s appeal stems largely from its strong community and speculative hype, but the token lacks a structured utility or focus on solving real-world problems. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, combines blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to provide industry-transforming solutions in marketing , entertainment , and finance . This focus on real-world applications gives Ruvi AI practical value, ensuring steady demand for its token beyond mere speculation. Another major factor setting Ruvi AI apart is its structured growth trajectory . Tokens are currently priced at just $0.015 during Phase 2 of its presale , presenting a lucrative entry point for early investors. Once the presale phase concludes, the price will be locked at $0.07 , marking an almost 5x increase . Furthermore, analysts predict the token’s value could skyrocket to $1 post-listing , offering an impressive 66x ROI to those who invest now. Strong Performance in the Presale Ruvi AI’s presale has exceeded expectations, building substantial momentum and trust among investors. The platform has already: Raised over $1.9 million Sold more than 160 million tokens Welcomed a growing community of 1,600+ investors What makes Ruvi AI particularly appealing is its guaranteed $0.07 valuation post-presale , offering transparency and predictability in an often volatile crypto market. This clarity makes it a standout choice for investors seeking stability alongside high returns. VIP Investment Tiers Maximize Profits Ruvi AI goes beyond traditional presales with VIP investment tiers designed to amplify returns. These tiers allow early investors to benefit from substantial bonuses, further enhancing their earning potential: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers provide a rare opportunity to lock in high-value rewards while the presale is still open. Transparency and Security Are Non-Negotiable Unlike Shiba Inu, which gained fame primarily as a meme coin, Ruvi AI places significant emphasis on transparency and trustworthiness . The platform is undergoing a third-party audit by CyberScope , a renowned blockchain security firm, to ensure its reliability and technical soundness. Ruvi AI has also partnered with WEEX Exchange , guaranteeing post-presale liquidity . This allows investors to seamlessly trade RUVI tokens upon listing, further establishing confidence in the project. Real-World Applications Drive Utility While Shiba Inu’s value hinges on community enthusiasm, Ruvi AI thrives on its robust and scalable applications. Here’s how it’s making an impact: Marketing: Businesses leverage Ruvi AI’s AI-powered tools to enhance ad targeting, simplify campaign management, and increase ROI. Entertainment: Content creators benefit from blockchain-secure payments and AI personalization, helping them connect with audiences more effectively while boosting revenue potential. Finance: Ruvi AI equips financial businesses with improved fraud detection, scalability solutions, and greater transparency, addressing key inefficiencies in the sector. These industry-specific use cases ensure that Ruvi AI’s token will remain relevant and functional for years to come. Is Ruvi AI the Real Threat to Shiba Inu? Shiba Inu has had its moment in the spotlight, but Ruvi AI’s combination of utility, innovation, and growth potential makes it a formidable challenger. With a $0.015 presale price , a locked $0.07 valuation post-presale , and a projected $1 token price , Ruvi AI positions itself as a top investment for those seeking exponential returns. Having already raised over $1.9 million , sold 160 million tokens , and secured strong partnerships with both CyberScope and WEEX Exchange , Ruvi AI is making strides that few other projects can rival. If you’re looking for a cryptocurrency backed by real-world applications and immense profitability, don’t miss this chance to secure Ruvi AI tokens and be part of a revolution in blockchain innovation!

From SHIBA INU to XRP, Dogecoin, and the high-potential presale MAGACOIN FINANCE, technical signals and on-chain patterns suggest something big could be coming. Analysts and early investors are paying close attention — and they’re making moves. SHIBA INU Signals Burn-Driven Accumulation Phase SHIBA INU continues to attract attention, not just for its burn rate — which recently soared past 112,000% — but also for its deflationary design and expanding ecosystem. Over 116 million SHIB were burned in a short span, permanently reducing the token’s supply. Despite near-term price volatility and a broader market dip, SHIB remains a key focus among traders. Futures data shows growing open interest, while some technical forecasts predict a rebound of 80–100% if it breaks above resistance. Long-term believers are aiming higher, with sentiment growing that SHIB’s next move could be explosive. Dogecoin’s Volatility Creates Room for a Reversal Dogecoin is back on traders’ radar after a series of volatile price swings tied to geopolitical uncertainty and broader market sentiment. A breakout above key resistance was followed by a sell-off, with analysts noting a descending triangle on the charts. Yet, DOGE remains one of the most speculated tokens in the market. Some models suggest the potential for a wild rally — possibly toward speculative highs — before a retracement. With strong address activity and utility increasing via integrations on Layer-2 networks, DOGE is holding its place in trader portfolios. XRP Readies for Major ETF Catalyst XRP is positioning itself as one of the most credible breakout candidates in the current cycle. The token has held strong amid recent sell-offs, benefiting from increasing institutional flows and speculation surrounding potential spot ETF approvals in the U.S. and Canada. Technical analysts point to tightening Bollinger Bands — a historic precursor to XRP rallies — and the market has taken notice. Breakout targets range widely, with some bullish models forecasting a move toward $8 if momentum holds. The ongoing pause in Ripple’s legal standoff with regulators has further fueled optimism, with major inflows and block trades indicating growing institutional confidence. Why Analysts Say MAGACOIN FINANCE Is a 2025 Power Play Among the many altcoins vying for attention, one presale stands out: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Backed by a scarcity-driven model and a fixed token structure, it’s already attracting capital from sophisticated investors rotating out of larger-cap assets. Analysts have ranked it as one of the top presale cryptocurrencies for 2025 — and early buyers are already sitting on substantial returns. With a verified audit, no VC control, and rising demand, momentum is building fast. For a limited time only, MAGACOIN FINANCE is offering a 100% BONUS with the promo code PATRIOTS100X . This exclusive offer will end once the staking feature goes live — unlocking high APR for investors and creating urgency for those who understand the high upside. Summer entries into MAGACOIN FINANCE could still position early buyers for a potential 100x return as the project progresses from presale to major public exchange listings. Final Word: The Market Is Preparing for a Surge When multiple top assets — from SHIBA and DOGE to XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE — show coordinated accumulation and pattern compression, smart money pays attention. Trading models, investor behavior, and analyst projections all align to suggest that the next big breakout may not be far away. Crypto insiders are already in. The window for high-upside entry is still open — but not for long.

33767162,[object Object],1750453252,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Analyst Says To Expect Dogecoin Price At $5 This Cycle,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-to-5-this-cycle/,"A bold new forecast is calling for Dogecoin to reach an astonishing $5 price level this market cycle. The claim, shared on the social media platform X, is backed by a visual chart analysis that illustrates a repeating pattern of consolidation and breakout phases in Dogecoin’s price movements since its launch. Drawing from the price action in past cycles, the analyst argues that the memecoin is once again preparing for an explosive price action that could see it surging well above the $1 price level. Repetitive Patterns Say Breakout Is Brewing For Dogecoin According to crypto analyst CryptoELITES, Dogecoin’s price chart has a repeating structure of symmetrical triangle formations, each followed by vertical price surges. The chart, which plots Dogecoin’s historical rallies from its early price history to the present day, highlights three distinct triangle breakouts that led to interesting price peaks. Each rally began with a symmetrical triangle consolidation phase that was followed by a breakout to the upside. The first of these patterns ended with a price spike to around $0.002. The second triangle formed over a longer period and eventually drove Dogecoin to roughly $0.013. At the time, the rally laid the groundwork for retail interest in the meme coin niche. The third breakout, however, was the most iconic. Following months of sideways movement within a tightening symmetrical triangle, DOGE exploded upwards and peaked at $0.7316 in May 2021. That rally was on the back of social media hype and a FOMO that transformed Dogecoin from a meme cryptocurrency into one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. This peak at $0.73 was followed by a bear phase of consolidations in another symmetrical triangle that eventually broke to the upside last year. Interestingly, the breakout has stalled and has led to a correction in recent months, but this is all part of a similar playout in previous cycle breakouts. Keeping the possibility of a continuation in mind, crypto analyst CryptoElites projected a similar run to the 2021 bull rally. Particularly, the analyst drew a bold projection arrow extending from the current price action to the $5 mark. According to the analyst, “If you’re not expecting $5, you probably don’t know anything.” $5 Price Target For DOGE Reaching $5 per Dogecoin would be nothing short of monumental for the cryptocurrency. Based on Dogecoin’s circulating supply of approximately 149 billion tokens, a $5 price target would imply a market capitalization above $720 billion. That figure would place Dogecoin just behind Bitcoin in terms of market cap, overtaking Ethereum’s current market cap by a wide margin. Such a Dogecoin valuation would require a high level of participation from both retail and institutional investors. Although this price target may appear ambitious, DOGE has defied expectations before. Its 36,000% rally in the 2020 to 2021 bull cycle serves as a reminder of the explosive force of retail momentum. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.168 after breaking below $0.17 again in the past 24 hours.",Dogecoin|CryptoELITES|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Ethereum|fomo|meme coin|Symmetrical Triangle Pattern,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-06-20 21:00:52

Instead of waiting on approvals or future upgrades, Web3 ai already delivers a live AI platform. With its Stage 9 entry point at just $0.000443 and over $8.1 million raised, it’s catching the attention of those looking for utility, not speculation. Meanwhile, XRP and Pi still need major milestones to move forward. Here’s what’s driving these three names now. XRP Builds Strength as ETF Approval Odds Increase XRP is showing strength as anticipation builds around spot ETF approval. Analysts highlight how it’s maintaining a price above $2.20, backed by solid support from the 50 and 100-day EMAs. Momentum signals, including MACD, suggest a possible rally is forming. Repeated filings have pushed approval odds into the 80% range, and futures activity hints at growing institutional interest. Market insiders believe a breakout could happen if XRP clears resistance between $2.30 and $2.40, with $3.00 the next target. On-chain activity remains consistent, which supports the bullish sentiment. However, until a green light is given, any price jump remains speculative and tied to regulatory news. Pi Network’s GCV Strategy: A Long-Term Play or a Barrier? Pi Network’s large valuation gap between its internal GCV and external market price is stirring conversation. A new report claims this was done deliberately by the team to slow down early dumping after the mainnet goes live. The aim is to give the project time to boost ecosystem demand and add actual use cases. Backers argue this strategy helps early users by giving the project breathing room to grow before it faces market pressure. Critics, however, feel it limits user freedom. For those watching Pi, the gap presents both risk and reward: entry at market rates could pay off if adoption increases and GCV aligns with real demand. Regulatory decisions could also speed up this alignment. Web3 ai Raises $8.1M as Presale Gains Traction With Several AI Tools Web3 ai is quickly gaining ground as its utility is not just planned, it’s already in use. At $0.000443 in Stage 8, users unlock access to many working tools designed for crypto analysis and protection. A GARCH-powered risk engine stress tests portfolios, while another tool rates DeFi pools based on returns and risk. There’s also a contract scanner that flags vulnerabilities, helping users spot threats early. More tools monitor sentiment shifts, rebalance holdings, and track major movements across blockchains. All of this sits inside one unified dashboard. Each action burns WAI, increasing its scarcity as usage grows. With over 22.7 billion tokens already sold and a launch price of $0.005242, the early entry value is clear. The $8.1 million raised so far shows this project is gaining strong traction. Those who missed early moves like Solana now have a new opportunity on the table. With presale allocations closing quickly, Web3 ai is shaping up as a standout in the current market. In Summary XRP’s potential depends on news that remains out of user control. Pi Network’s future value is still tied to long-term mainnet performance. Web3 ai, on the other hand, offers working AI tools from the start. Stage 8 units sell for $0.000443 and grant access to several live utilities. With a set listing price of $0.005242, and over 22.7 billion tokens already sold, Web3 ai proves it’s more than just a presale. The project’s design links usage with value, offering real-world application from day one. For those prioritising functionality over speculation, Web3 ai delivers.

Dogecoin’s open interest climbing to $1.3 billion shows rising speculation, while SUI’s 8% price rise signals regained confidence from recent strategic moves. But both rely on market swings or one-time catalysts. Unstaked is doing something different, tying rewards to what users actually do. Through its “Proof of Intelligence” system and AI-based rewards, Unstaked flips the script on passive income. It’s not about holding, it’s about activity. With over $10.2 million raised, more than 1.1 billion tokens sold, and AI agents set to go live after launch, Unstaked is emerging as a top crypto for 2025, driven by results, not hype. DOGE Open Interest Tops $1.3B: Volatility Ahead? Dogecoin (DOGE) is seeing a sharp spike in open interest, which now sits at $1.3 billion across major trading platforms. This 5.24% rise means more traders are placing leveraged bets, expecting a big price move. However, while open interest rises, DOGE’s price slipped to around $0.2157, showing that this surge in activity hasn’t yet moved the price. This kind of gap between rising open interest and stagnant price often signals that traders expect a breakout or a breakdown. It may mean new capital is entering, not just traders exiting. When open interest grows but the price stays still, it usually sets up a move driven by a big catalyst. That’s why this moment matters for DOGE watchers. Whether it results in a strong rally or a sharp correction, the current setup suggests volatility is just around the corner. From Hack to Rally: How SUI Regained Trust SUI jumped 8% to reach $3.75, while its trading volume surged 44% to $1.25 billion. This rebound comes after the Sui Foundation helped cover losses from the $220 million Cetus protocol hack. Their quick action through a secured loan restored user confidence, especially for those with bridged assets, separate from other frozen funds still pending community decisions. Adding to the momentum, Nasdaq filed a 19b-4 proposal for 21Shares to list a spot SUI ETF, with BitGo and Coinbase Custody as proposed custodians. This move signals growing institutional interest, which could bring more mainstream adoption. Traders are also watching closely. Many point to buy zones between $3.10 and $2.50, suggesting that SUI could continue rising as accumulation grows. In short, a mix of crisis response, institutional interest, and technical support has fueled this SUI rally. AI-Driven Earnings? Unstaked Transforms Passive Income Unstaked is changing how rewards work in Web3. Instead of earning by holding or locking tokens, Unstaked plans to reward users based on what their AI agents actually do. This system is powered by a framework called “Proof of Intelligence.” Every agent interaction, whether it’s content creation, engagement on platforms like Telegram or X, or conversation tracking, gets logged on-chain and graded. This approach values real input. The more useful work an agent does, the more $UNSD its owner earns. The AI agents are not live yet; they’ll launch after the presale ends. Once live, they’ll work 24/7 to generate results that earn rewards. Only those that perform will generate earnings. As of now, Unstaked is in Stage 21 with the presale price at $0.011739. It has raised over $10.2 million and sold more than 1.1 billion tokens. With a launch price of $0.1819, early participants also have a strong chance for upside. By tying rewards to output and skipping token lockups, Unstaked is offering a new kind of passive income, earned, not given. For anyone looking beyond speculative price moves, this model brings real utility into focus. Final Thoughts Dogecoin’s rising open interest and SUI’s quick rebound show how speculation and reaction still shape today’s market. But Unstaked is steering the conversation in a new direction, one where results drive value. Its AI-powered structure doesn’t reward holders for doing nothing. It rewards meaningful action logged and verified on-chain. With over $10.2 million raised, over 1.1B tokens sold, and smart agents going live post-launch, Unstaked offers more than hype; it offers a real system designed for long-term use. As users look ahead to 2025, this mix of performance-driven earnings and utility-based design makes Unstaked one to watch.

Shared by respected crypto analyst SMQKE on X, this revelation is backed by official documents showing that SWIFT’s November 2025 ISO 20022 upgrade introduces blockchain-specific enhancements, marking a major milestone in bridging traditional finance with distributed ledger technology. SWIFT and Ripple: Collaboration Over Competition One of the most striking excerpts from the publication reads: “SWIFT’s network includes a messaging system adopted on a global scale, but it does not settle or make any payments the way Ripple does, thereby making the two companies very different. For this reason, SWIFT and Ripple could easily exist in the same space, even with SWIFT using Ripple’s distributed ledger technology.” “SWIFT and Ripple could easily exist in the same space, even with SWIFT making use of Ripple's distributed ledger technology.” This is documented. https://t.co/NqqT6KAuUx pic.twitter.com/F7vdSUuEUl — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 20, 2025 This acknowledgment signals a significant shift in the narrative. Rather than framing Ripple as a threat, SWIFT is recognizing the possibility of integration. SWIFT remains the backbone of global financial messaging, while Ripple’s strength lies in instant settlement using blockchain and the XRP Ledger. Together, they could form a complementary infrastructure where SWIFT handles secure messaging, and Ripple enables near-instant, cost-effective settlement. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) and XRP bridge asset are already transforming cross-border payments for dozens of financial institutions. SWIFT’s new openness to distributed ledger technology (DLT) suggests a future in which it could tap into Ripple’s capabilities to overcome its limitations in settlement efficiency. ISO 20022: Preparing for a Blockchain Future Further validation comes from a detailed ISO 20022 illustration featured in the Standards MT Release for November 2025. The schema incorporates elements such as “Blockchain Address or Wallet” and “Digital Ledger Identifier (DLT ID: DTI2024Identifier)” into its message structure. These updates are far from symbolic—they reflect a strategic commitment to making blockchain a native part of financial communication standards. The addition of these fields means institutions using SWIFT messaging will soon be able to reference blockchain wallets and DLT identifiers directly in settlement messages. This opens the door for seamless interaction between blockchain networks like the XRP Ledger and the traditional banking ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Notably, the term “Blockchain wallet where digital currencies are maintained” now appears explicitly in ISO messaging structures. This confirms that crypto-native infrastructure is being formally recognized in financial standards, paving the way for banks, central banks, and custodians to manage digital assets with the same clarity and compliance as fiat. A Turning Point in Global Finance This upgrade, set for global implementation in late 2025, represents more than just a technical evolution—it’s a structural realignment of financial messaging standards with the realities of blockchain innovation. Ripple’s technology is already ISO 20022-compliant, positioning it as a ready-made solution for institutions navigating this transition. What once appeared as a rivalry between SWIFT and Ripple is now being redefined. As this new documentation makes clear, they are not competitors, but complementary players in the race to modernize global finance. This new revelation confirms what XRP advocates have long anticipated: SWIFT and Ripple are not mutually exclusive. As blockchain technology becomes embedded in ISO 20022 messaging standards, Ripple’s infrastructure—including XRP and the XRPL—will be more relevant than ever. With SWIFT now laying the foundation for blockchain interoperability, a new era of hybrid finance is within reach—faster, smarter, and borderless.

People familiar with the matter told CNBC , those discussions ended without a deal, and Perplexity chose not to pursue the offer. The negotiations did not reach financial terms, and both companies declined to comment. Perplexity, valued at about $14 billion in its latest funding round, closed that financing shortly before Meta began exploring an acquisition. This outreach fits into CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s wider push to ramp up the company’s AI work. Frustrated by rivals like OpenAI and Google parent Alphabet, he has been aggressively seeking to bring top AI talent and technology into the company. In recent months, Meta has tried to outbid competitors for leading researchers and founders, viewing outside deals and hires as a way to catch up in the fast-moving field. As part of its broader AI strategy, the social media giant agreed to take a 49% stake in Scale AI in exchange for its multibillion-dollar investment. Although the company will hold no voting rights, Scale’s founder, Alexandr Wang, and a small group of his colleagueswill join Meta to work directly on AI projects. Earlier this year, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram also pursued Safe Superintelligence, a research firm that raised funds valuing it at $32 billion in April. Under the deal, Daniel Gross, Safe’s chief executive, and Nat Friedman, former head of GitHub, would come aboard Meta’s new “superintelligence” division led by Wang. Gross and Friedman jointly run a venture firm called NFDG; Meta will secure a stake in that venture as part of the arrangement. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman addressed Zuckerberg’s hiring tactics on a recent episode of the “Uncapped” podcast. He said Zuckerberg’s company had offered some OpenAI staffers signing bonuses up to $100 million and even higher annual packages, but many had turned the offers down. “I’ve heard that Meta thinks of us as their biggest competitor,” Altman said. “Their current AI efforts have not worked as well as they have hoped and I respect being aggressive and continuing to try new things.” Meta also tried to hire Perplexity CEO According to Bloomberg , Meta also sought to recruit Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas for its superintelligence team. Those talks occurred before Meta finalized its deal with Scale AI. Perplexity, founded in 2022, has quickly become known for using generative AI to change how people search the web. Its tool summarizes results, cites sources, and helps users refine queries for clearer answers. The company is now working on an AI-powered web browser to challenge services from Google and others. Zuckerberg’s push has already drawn key figures to Meta. Alongside Wang, the company has hired leading researchers formerly at Google DeepMind and the startup Sesame AI. Yet not every approach has paid off. Some top experts have declined, including OpenAI staffers, despite the hefty proposals. The company has also discussed providing computing infrastructure to Safe Superintelligence, offering use of its data centers for the lab’s work. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

According to a blog post , the company secured a license from Luxembourg’s financial regulator, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF). This means Coinbase can legally provide crypto services in all 27 EU member countries. Coinbase Makes Luxembourg Its Main Hub It is also worth noting that Coinbase has chosen Luxembourg as its main location for operations in the European Union. This is a change from its previous plan to set up its EU headquarters in Ireland. Importantly, the MiCA license enables the exchange to offer crypto custody, trading, and asset management services. To secure this license, Coinbase had to meet strict rules. These include anti-money laundering (AML) checks, Know Your Customer (KYC) processes, and customer ID checks. As such, the exchange must continue to follow strong rules regarding how it handles user funds and shares information with customers. Meanwhile, the regulatory approval comes when Coinbase is focused on growing internationally. It also comes amid increased scrutiny and ongoing legal issues in the United States. Coinbase’s move also enhances Luxembourg’s reputation as a growing hub for digital finance. MiCA’s Role in EU Crypto Regulation Recall that Coinbase Europe delisted several stablecoins from its platform in December 2024, complying with the MiCA regulation. In a message to its European users, Coinbase mentioned implementing restrictions for stablecoins that fail to meet the MiCA requirement. These include Tether’s USDT , Paxos Standard’s PAX, PayPal USD (PYUSD), Gemini Dollar’s GUSD, GYEN, the Japanese YEN Stablecoin, and DAI. MiCA, passed in 2023, is the first major law to bring all EU countries under one crypto rulebook. The law took effect in 2024 and has enforced crypto companies to register in at least one EU country while following stringent rules, including AML, KYC, and operational guidelines. Bitstamp Secures EU-Wide Crypto License Aside from Coinbase, Bitstamp, one of the oldest crypto exchanges in the world, has also received a Crypto Asset Service Provider (CASP) license under the MiCA regulation . Luxembourg’s financial watchdog announced the approval in May. This approval comes a few months after the company gained a MiFID license in 2024, which allowed it to operate a Multilateral Trading Facility under regular financial rules. The MiCA license allows Bitstamp to use the EU’s “passporting” system. Since the exchange is licensed in Luxembourg, it can now offer services in all 27 EU countries without needing separate approval.

While BCH aims to scale peer-to-peer transactions, projects like Qubetics have their ambitions set on integrating real-world asset tokenization into decentralized systems. This analysis addresses the Bitcoin Cash price prediction 2026 and unpacks the emerging impact of Qubetics’ tokenized asset marketplace. Both stories illustrate a broader trend: blockchain technology is actively reshaping global finance. Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2026: A Monthly Breakdown Bitcoin Cash remains one of the most widely recognized cryptocurrencies built for transactional efficiency. As Layer 1 competition grows, BCH has managed to maintain its relevance thanks to strong community backing and increased merchant acceptance. Analysts observing BCH price charts have compiled projections for 2026 based on historical movements and expected market cycles. The year starts with BCH hovering near $371. By March, projections suggest BCH will climb to an average of $593, continuing a pattern of steady gains. Come June, the price is estimated to range between $568 and $695, largely due to anticipated increases in crypto adoption and possible improvements in scalability. By late Q3, BCH could reach new local highs. September forecasts show BCH trading between $686 and $831. A strong October leads into a bullish close: December is predicted to see a minimum of $804.63 and a potential high of $967.09, with the average sitting at $833.90. From a macro lens, this points to a possible 109% return from current levels. However, as with all digital assets, volatility remains a constant force. Changes in regulation, mining dynamics, or broader market sentiment could shift these trajectories. Yet, the current models reveal a promising narrative for those closely watching BCH. Asset Tokenization: Qubetics Is Unlocking Tangible Value on the Blockchain The centerpiece of Qubetics’ offering is its Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. This is a feature poised to redefine how financial institutions and enterprises operate on-chain. Through this platform, banks and financial organizations can mint their own tokens, backed by real-world assets. These can include property titles, intellectual property, or physical commodities. Tokenization transforms these historically illiquid assets into transferable, transparent digital formats. What sets Qubetics apart is its two-fold approach. First, it enables institutions to create asset-backed tokens on the Qubetics blockchain. Second, it facilitates the trade of these tokens through a marketplace that enhances liquidity and global accessibility. The platform offers a framework that balances compliance with accessibility, offering pathways for institutions to innovate without sacrificing trust. Qubetics Crypto Presale: Milestone Metrics Reveal a Strong Finish Qubetics is currently in its final presale phase. The fixed token price stands at $0.3370, with fewer than 10 million $TICS tokens left before launch. This comes after a strategic move by the project to drastically reduce its total token supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion. This sharp cut not only introduces scarcity but also reinforces long-term value across the ecosystem. So far, over 516 million $TICS tokens have been sold, contributing to a crypto presale tally of more than $18 million. The project now boasts over 28,100 holders, marking widespread interest across retail and institutional audiences. These numbers point to increasing confidence in Qubetics’ utility and structure. With a projected 20% rise upon listing, momentum heading into the open market is strong. Qubetics Price Prediction: How a $9,000 Allocation Could Play Out At the current price of $0.3370, a $9,000 allocation would yield approximately 26,703 $TICS tokens. If the token reaches its forecasted listing price of $0.40, that holding would already be worth $10,681. A jump to $1 would increase that value to $26,703. Looking further ahead, if the token climbs to $5, the total value would hit $133,515. Should the token reach $6, the portfolio’s value would grow to $160,218, representing a 1,679% increase. And if long-term adoption and marketplace activity push the token toward $10 or even $15 following the mainnet launch, the valuation could hit $267,030 and $400,545, respectively. Still, it’s essential to consider variables. Regulatory changes, smart contract vulnerabilities, or slowed institutional onboarding could affect these trajectories. However, the potential upside remains significant. Final Thoughts: Two Paths to the Same Future Bitcoin Cash and Qubetics serve two very different purposes in the crypto space. BCH aims to continue its journey as a scalable peer-to-peer currency with strong support and a solid legacy. Bitcoin Cash price prediction for 2026 suggests a doubling of value, signaling continued relevance. On the other side, Qubetics is building infrastructure for the token economy of tomorrow. Its tokenization marketplace addresses a critical gap in blockchain, bringing real-world assets on-chain with transparency and flexibility.

Its parent company, DT Marks DEFI LLC, quietly lowered its ownership from 60% to approximately 40% over the past couple of weeks. Timeline of Events According to a Forbes report , the change was found in the updated fine print on the company’s website. Donald Trump launched WLF in September 2024 at the height of his presidential campaign. The project promised a “financial revolution,” offering 25 billion of its native WLFI tokens to raise about $590 million . To manage the venture, Trump renamed DT Tower II, which he had initially formed in 2016, into DT Marks DEFI. While he owned 100% of the original company, the new structure saw 30% of the shares transferred to family members, believed to be his sons Don Jr., Eric, and Barron, leaving him with a 70% stake. In July 2024, three new companies were registered in Delaware under the names DJT Jr DEFI LLC, ET DEFI LLC, and BWT DEFI LLC, plainly the initials of the three Trump brothers. By the end of December, a financial disclosure report showed that the new entity held a 75% stake in WLF. This changed in early January. Just before the president’s inauguration, the family sold more than $200 million worth of tokens, with the project’s website subsequently showing that DT Marks’ ownership had dropped to around 60%. The Trumps also onboarded a new partner, controversial Tron founder Justin Sun, who paid $75 million to join the First Family’s crypto business. In March, the DeFi project launched the USD1 stablecoin, with Abu Dhabi-based investment giant MGX later confirming that the dollar-pegged crypto asset would be used to settle its $2 billion purchase of a minority stake in Binance. A Quiet Sale? However, with U.S. lawmakers discussing stablecoin legislation, including the GENIUS Act, several Democrats raised the alarm over a possible conflict of interest and the ethics of mixing business and presidential power. There were also concerns that Sun’s $75 million buy-in into WLF may have been a means to curry favor with the president, possibly leading to the SEC pausing an investigation against the crypto entrepreneur. Following the development, a group of opposition legislators requested all suspicious activity reports (SARs) connected to Trump. Subsequently, a court-appointed monitor overseeing his company’s finances was reportedly informed that the First Family planned to sell part of one of their firms. While the correspondence did not name the company, observers believed it to be DT Marks DEFI. Sometime after June 8, the fine print on the WLF website was updated again. It now shows that DT Marks DEFI owns about 40% of the company. However, nothing has been said of the parties that may have taken up the 20% stake.

Among them, XRP , SUI , and Solana are capturing attention. Could these be the digital currencies that redefine industry benchmarks? Dive into their potential and what sets them apart in this exciting exploration of emerging market leaders. XRP Faces Mid-Range Struggles as Bearish Trends Persist Over the past month, XRP fell nearly 9.5% and slid around 5.35% over the last six months. Weekly performance indicates a drop of about 5.03%, reflecting continued bearish sentiment in the market. Selling pressure has often outweighed buying activities, keeping the price under strain. The overall trend demonstrates that XRP has been struggling to maintain upward momentum, trapped within a downtrend that shows little sign of reversal. Current trading positions XRP within a price range of $1.95 to $2.53, with the nearest resistance at around $2.88 and immediate support near $1.73. A secondary resistance level exists at $3.45, while a deeper support zone sits at $1.15. Oscillators like the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator show modest negatives at -0.068 and -0.166, suggesting sellers dominate. Traders might find opportunities near $1.73 for potential rebounds, yet caution is advised until a clear breakout above $2.88 occurs. The market remains sideways, favoring range-bound strategies until a trend reversal is evident. SUI Faces Decline Amid Key Support and Resistance Levels SUI experienced a notable downturn over the recent month and past six months with weekly losses of nearly 17%, monthly drops of about 26%, and an overall six-month decline of roughly 38%. Price action moved within a trading range of roughly $2.77 to $4.01, reflecting persistent selling pressure. Indicators like the negative Awesome Oscillator and declining momentum point to fading bullish strength. The recorded losses suggest investors have been cautious and the overall market sentiment has leaned bearish during this period. Currently, SUI trades between $2.77 and $4.01, with immediate support around $2.29 and resistance near $4.77. Bears seem to hold control, as indicated by negative moving averages. The RSI sits at 35.61, hinting at oversold territory but not signaling a clear upward reversal. Traders might consider short-term plays by watching for a break below immediate support or testing resistance areas for a potential reversal setup. Cautious positioning is advised, with entry points aligned to stops near these key levels while remaining alert for a sentiment shift that could trigger a bull rally. Solana Shows Declining Momentum Over Recent Periods SOL dropped around 14% in the past month and nearly 26% over the last six months. A weekly slide of roughly 10.5% reflects the coin’s recent struggle to gain traction. The price action has been marked by persistent downward pressure, with investors watching for signs of stabilization amid ongoing weakness. The current price for SOL sits between $136 and $182, testing key levels for potential movement. A support zone forms at $115, while a nearby weakness is seen at $69, suggesting a floor if capital returns. Resistance is evident at $207, with a tougher barrier around $254 worth keeping in mind. Bears dominate the scene for now, as indicators including a negative Awesome Oscillator and a subdued Momentum Indicator underline the prevailing caution. The RSI at 39.5 hints at oversold conditions but stops short of confirming a clear bounce. The setup invites cautious trading strategies; some may consider shorting when testing the $207 resistance, while others could look to accumulate if a firm support hold emerges at $115. Conclusion XRP , SUI , and Solana are emerging as potential leaders in the market. Their unique features and recent performance indicate strong future prospects. XRP's efficient transaction process, SUI's advanced technology, and Solana's rapid growth highlight their potential. These coins could set new standards in the market. Investors and traders should closely monitor them. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The S&P 500 dropped 0.22%, closing at 5,967.84, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.51% to end at 19,447.41. Only the Dow Jones Industrial Average stayed afloat, up 35.16 points, or 0.08%, finishing at 42,206.82. This comes as traders completely ignored a fresh signal from the Federal Reserve that a July rate cut might actually happen. The early bounce on Wall Street quickly faded once people realized that none of the geopolitical chaos had changed. President Donald Trump, now leading from the White House again, hasn’t ruled out striking Tehran, and according to CNBC, he plans to make a final decision within the next two weeks. This kind of risk doesn’t exactly give traders the confidence to go long into a weekend. Waller hints at a July cut but Powell holds the brakes Things started upbeat after Christopher Waller, a Federal Reserve Governor, told CNBC’s Squawk Box that the Fed could move forward with a rate cut as early as July. “I think we’re in the position that we could do this and as early as July,” Waller said . He clarified that this was his personal view and didn’t guarantee full committee support, but the signal was strong enough to lift markets—at least for a few hours. Two days earlier, Jerome Powell had told reporters that the Fed wasn’t rushing anything. He said decisions would stay “data dependent,” especially since no one really knows how Trump’s tariffs will hit the economy yet. The S&P 500 dipped slightly after those comments. Powell’s warning put a question mark over July and left markets wondering how solid that potential cut really is. By Friday afternoon, the focus had fully shifted to the Persian Gulf. Trump, who previously demanded Iran’s full surrender, is now weighing military options. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called the demand “threatening and ridiculous,” and with that, stocks stopped caring about rate cuts. Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, said the environment is too unstable for confidence. “With so much uncertainty going on in this world, who really wants to go long over the weekend,” Sam said. He added that even though the S&P 500 is still only 3% away from its recent 52-week high, that doesn’t make it an easy breakout. “Prior highs act like rusty doors and require several attempts before finally swinging open.” Semiconductor stocks slump after fresh policy threat Tech got smoked Friday after a Wall Street Journal report said the US government might revoke special export waivers for certain chipmakers. That hit the entire semiconductor sector. Nvidia dropped more than 1%, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing fell nearly 2%. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) slid close to 1%, dragging the broader indexes with it. Some analysts think the market’s next big move depends entirely on whether the economy holds up. Joe Kalish, the chief macro strategist at Ned Davis Research, wrote that a deep drop would only happen if the US hits a recession. “A new low would likely require a recession call,” Joe said. “The economy is not currently in recession and we do not foresee one in the second half of the year.” But there are warning signs. Housing starts for May came in weaker than expected. Retail sales also missed forecasts. Traders are watching for cracks, and some are already showing up. At the same time, long-term outperformance by US stocks over emerging markets is reaching record levels. Since 2009, the S&P 500 has returned 562%, while the Emerging Markets ETF ($EEM) has only gained 163%. That’s about 3.4 times less. Even worse, the performance ratio between US equities and emerging markets has now fallen to its lowest point in 55 years, about one standard deviation under its historical average. Even during the Dot-Com Bubble peak in 2000, the ratio wasn’t this skewed.

They have pinned their optimistic outlooks on recent positive engagement with the SEC, which is considered an encouraging sign for ETF issuers. “Eric Balchunas and I are raising our odds for the vast majority of the spot crypto ETF filings to 90% or higher,” Bloomberg ETF Analyst James Seyffart wrote in a post on X. “Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion.” Approximately two weeks ago, Balchunas and Seyffart pegged the odds of XRP, Dogecoin, and ADA funds securing the green light by the end of 2025 below 90%. The latest update shows that the analysts’ estimated odds of the SEC approving XRP ETF products now stand at 95% amid regulatory wins . Dogecoin and Cardano ETF proposals have a 90% chance of obtaining the regulatory go-ahead. The analysts also raised estimated approval odds for other altcoin ETFs, including Polkadot (DOT) and Avalanche (AVAX), to 95%. They also ascribed a 95% likelihood of approval to funds holding Litecoin (LTC). SEC Signals Pro-Crypto Shift The SEC earlier this month requested that spot Solana ETF issuers amend their S-1 registration statements, signaling that approvals could be imminent, as ZyCrypto reported . So far, the SEC has only approved spot crypto ETFs for the top two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). A handful of major asset managers are awaiting clearance from the Commission to list different spot crypto ETF filings. The deluge of applications reflects US President Donald Trump’s efforts to soften the SEC’s regulatory stance toward digital assets since returning to the White House in January. Moreover, Paul Atkins, who officially took over as SEC chair in April, has promised a more lenient approach to digital assets. Approval of these pending filings could unlock institutional capital for the respective altcoins, amplying their demand and potentially pushing prices higher. While approval timelines remain unclear, they would mark a step toward mainstream adoption for these alternative cryptocurrencies.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|ADA|Cardano|Doge|Dogecoin|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|DOGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-20 21:45:59

ADA is currently trading a t $0.5833, and the RSI is plunging to 30.76, which is in oversold territory. Interestingly, nearly $1 billion worth of ADA was withdrawn from centralized exchanges this year, and Ford Motor Company’s advisory role in a Cardano-based legal data storage project suggests institutional confidence despite technical weakness. Source: CoinMarketCap After losing 13% over seven days, ADA faces key support at $0.5812 amid an elevated daily volume of 67.7 million tokens. Whales purchased 310 million ADA in June, providing potential accumulation support as technical indicators reach extreme oversold levels. The following analysis was conducted using ChatGPT’s o3 AI model. It synthesized 38 real-time technical indicators, on-chain whale movements, enterprise adoption developments, and social sentiment metrics to assess ADA’s 90-day price trajectory across multiple probability scenarios. The predictions were then reanalyzed and edited together for enhanced readability while maintaining analytical precision. Technical Pulse: Extreme Oversold Conditions Meet Volume Surge Cardano’s daily chart reveals a market under severe technical pressure. ADA is trading at $0.5833 , having opened at $0.6021 before establishing a range between $0.6071 (high) and $0.5812 (low), a 4.3% intraday spread reflecting heightened volatility. The RSI at 30.76 places ADA deep in oversold territory, approaching the 30-level threshold that historically precedes relief rallies. Within the last seven days, ADA has lost almost 13%, causing the coin to trade at around $0.60 , creating the most oversold reading since May’s capitulation. MACD indicators paint a bearish picture with the MACD line at -0.0065 trading below the signal line at -0.0311 . However, the histogram at -0.0246 shows potential momentum divergence, suggesting selling pressure may be exhausting despite continued downward price action. Source: TradingView Moving averages create formidable overhead resistance across all timeframes. The 20-day EMA at $0.6502 sits 11.5% above the current price, while the 50-day EMA at $0.6838 represents a 17.2% premium. The 100-day EMA at $0.7063 and the 200-day EMA at $0.7084 cluster near 21% above current levels, creating a resistance wall that confirms the bearish trend structure. Volume analysis shows 67.7 million ADA traded daily, representing a 19% increase from recent averages and indicating distribution pressure. However, this elevated volume at oversold levels often precedes capitulation bottoms, particularly when combined with whale accumulation data. The Relative Volatility Index at 37.57 indicates continued bearish momentum, though approaching levels where reversal patterns historically emerge. ATR readings suggest daily volatility ranges of approximately 4-5%, consistent with the current $0.58–$0.61 consolidation zone. Historical Price Context: Six-Month Bear Market Trajectory Cardano’s 2025 performance shows a systematic decline from January’s peak near $1.16 . February trading in the $0.85–$0.90 range gave way to March’s $0.80–$0.85 consolidation before accelerating weakness through the spring months. May witnessed the steepest decline, with ADA bottoming near $0.65 before June’s volatile range between $0.60 and $0.95 . At the start of June 2025, ADA was trading near $0.69, just 58% higher than the previous year, showing the crypto’s underperformance relative to the broader market recovery. Source: TradingView The April low near $0.51 is a key psychological level, with current prices holding approximately 14% above this threshold. This support zone has attracted renewed buying interest, evidenced by recent whale accumulation patterns and exchange outflow data. Historical analysis shows ADA’s current price represents an 81.32% decline from its September 2021 all-time high of $3.10 , placing it among the deepest retracements in major crypto rankings. This is the hardest pre bull market in history to hold in. Bc this will be the biggest bull in history Believe in something… Don't sell your $ADA now pic.twitter.com/7qnpPW7NgQ — Mr Banana (@D_realMrBanana) June 19, 2025 Support & Resistance: Critical Battle Zones Define Range Immediate support clusters around today’s low at $0.5832 , reinforced by the psychological $0.58 level where strong buying interest has emerged. The immediate support lies at the $0.60 mark, aligning with a long-standing trendline formed by the lows on November 5, April 9, and June 5. The next major support zone extends from $0.5500 to $0.5600 , representing a confluence of technical levels and potential whale accumulation areas. Historical support lies in the $0.4200 – $0.4400 range, corresponding to 2023’s base-building period. Source: TradingView Resistance emerges immediately at $0.6071 (today’s high), followed by the key $0.6200 – $0.6500 zone where the 20-day EMA creates overhead pressure. Sidelined investors looking for buying opportunities could load up on Cardano upon a closing price higher than $0.7315 , an inflection point on June 11. Major resistance lies within the $0.7000 – $0.7100 EMA cluster, where the 100-day and 200-day EMAs converge to create a formidable overhead supply. Breaking this level would require a large volume expansion and fundamental catalysts to overcome established selling pressure. The current range between $0.58 and $0.61 represents a compression zone where directional momentum could emerge rapidly once triggered by volume or news catalysts. Enterprise Validation: Ford Partnership Revolutionizes Adoption Narrative Ford Motor Company has joined Iagon and Cloud Court in a pilot proof-of-concept project that leverages the Cardano blockchain for secure legal data storage.

Under the hybrid model, testimony data remains encrypted on distributed nodes. Still, Cardano smart contracts log permissions and access events, creating an auditable chain of custody that satisfies frameworks such as HIPAA, GDPR, and US protective orders.

If Ford ultimately endorses the architecture, other Fortune 500 legal departments could view the pilot as proof that public-network infrastructure can satisfy stringent confidentiality and audit requirements. On-Chain Dynamics: Massive Capital Flight from Exchanges Cardano (ADA) has gained bullish momentum, with nearly $1 billion worth of ADA withdrawn from centralized exchanges this year. Blockchain analytics firm TapTools reported Tuesday that approximately $932 million in ADA has left exchanges since January. Source: Coinglass This massive outflow represents approximately 4.6% of ADA’s total market cap moving to self-custody wallets, indicating strong conviction among long-term holders despite recent price weakness. Exchange outflows typically precede price recovery as reduced sell-side liquidity creates upward pressure when demand returns. Since June 1, whales with holdings of 100 million to 1 billion ADA tokens have expanded their portfolios to 3.15 billion tokens from 3.02 billion tokens. Similarly, whales with more than 1 billion ADA tokens have a total holding of 1.97 billion ADA, up from 1.79 billion ADA on June 1.

That’s down from 2,413 nine days ago but slightly up from 2,382 just two days ago. Over recent days, the slight rebound in whale count suggests accumulation may accelerate as technical oversold conditions attract opportunistic buyers seeking value at multi-month lows. Market Metrics: Fundamental Resilience Amid Technical Weakness Cardano maintains a market capitalization of $20.41 billion with 24-hour trading volume reaching $564.37 million , representing a volume-to-market cap ratio of 2.75% . The fully diluted valuation reaches $26.04 billion based on the maximum supply of 45 billion ADA tokens. The current circulating supply stands at 35.36 billion ADA, representing 78.6% of the maximum supply. The remaining tokens are allocated to treasury reserves and staking rewards. This controlled supply inflation provides long-term scarcity dynamics supporting price appreciation potential. ADA trades at $0.5833, representing an 81.32% decline from its September 2021 all-time high of $3.10. However, current levels sit 3,235% above the October 2017 all-time low of $0.01735 , showing the cryptocurrency’s long-term appreciation trajectory despite recent weakness. Source: CoinGecko Market dominance remains stable at 0.65% of total cryptocurrency market cap, maintaining Cardano’s position among the top 11 digital assets by valuation despite underperformance relative to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Social Sentiment: Community Conviction Amid Enterprise Optimism LunarCrush data reveals Cardano’s AltRank at 174 , indicating strong relative social engagement compared to other cryptocurrencies. The Galaxy Score of 55 suggests moderate bullish sentiment, while engagement metrics total 10.78 million interactions across social platforms. Mentions reach 31.21K with 4.64K creators contributing to discussions, reflecting sustained community interest despite price headwinds. Sentiment is 90% positive, indicating overwhelming optimism among active community participants. The 2.8% social dominance demonstrates Cardano’s ability to capture attention relative to its market cap, with enterprise partnership news driving increased discussion volume. Recent social media themes focus on Ford’s collaboration importance, long-term ecosystem development, and accumulation opportunities at current price levels. Source: @Cardanians_io on X Derivative Markets: Reduced Leverage Signals Capitulation CoinGlass data indicates a decline of over 4% in Cardano’s Open Interest (OI) , reaching $709.39 million in the last 24 hours. The falling OI relates to capital withdrawal from Cardano derivatives, suggesting a drop in traders’ interest. Source: CoinGlass The OI-weighted funding rate has corrected to 0.0084% from a peak of 0.0108% on June 11, indicating reduced bullish positioning among leveraged traders. The long/short ratio is at 0.9681 . A ratio below 1 suggests a greater number of short positions. Long liquidations have accelerated over the past 24 hours, contributing to selling pressure but also reducing leveraged longs that could create additional downside risk. This deleveraging process often precedes price stabilization as weak hands are flushed from the market. Three-Month ADA Price Forecast Scenarios Oversold Bounce Recovery (Base Case – 45% Probability) RSI oversold conditions at 29.66 historically precede relief rallies, particularly when supported by whale accumulation and reduced derivative leverage. The target range extends to $0.62–$0.65 , representing a 6–11% upside from current levels. Source: TradingView This scenario requires support defense at $0.58 with volume expansion above 80 million ADA daily. Recovery faces initial resistance at the 20-day EMA around $0.65 , with a sustained break above this level potentially extending gains toward $ 0.70. Success probability increases if Ford partnership developments provide fundamental support and broader altcoin sentiment improves. Risk management requires stop-loss placement below $0.55 to limit downside exposure. Enterprise-Driven Breakout (Bull Case – 30% Probability) Successful Ford pilot implementation and additional enterprise partnerships could drive sustained buying interest. Bulls target $0.74–$0.78 , representing a 27–34% upside, with a breakout above $0.74 potentially opening the path to $0.80–$0.85. Source: TradingView This scenario requires concrete enterprise adoption progress, broader crypto market recovery, and technical reclaim of multiple EMAs with a daily volume exceeding 100 million ADA. If that level continues to hold, bulls are eyeing a potential bounce back to $0.74–$0.78 , with a breakout above $0.74 possibly opening the door to $0.80. Fundamental catalysts must include additional Fortune 500 partnerships, successful proof-of-concept completion, and institutional investment flows supporting price appreciation beyond technical resistance levels. Deeper Correction (Bear Case – 25% Probability) Failure to hold $0.58 support could trigger algorithmic selling toward $0.55–$0.50 . A breakdown below $0.55 would indicate a deeper correction targeting June’s $0.51 low or potentially $0.45–$0.48 based on historical support levels. Source: TradingView This scenario requires broader crypto weakness, negative enterprise developments, or the failure of current whale accumulation to provide price support. ADA is in a consolidation phase and faces difficulty maintaining support at the $0.620 level. ADA Price Forecast: Is ADA Oversold? Cardano’s current position represents a key inflection point where extreme technical oversold conditions meet massive enterprise validation through Ford’s blockchain evaluation. The confluence of $932 million in exchange outflows, 310 million ADA whale accumulation, and RSI near 30 creates a unique setup rarely seen in major cryptocurrencies. The current support defense at $0.58–$0.60 remains essential, with any breakdown below $0.55 potentially triggering a deeper correction toward $0.50-$0.51. However, whale accumulation patterns and reduced derivative leverage suggest selling pressure may be nearing exhaustion. Recovery requires reclaiming the 20-day EMA near $0.65 with sustained volume expansion, potentially opening the path toward $0.70–$0.75 if enterprise developments provide fundamental support. The current technical setup creates a risk-reward setup favoring patient accumulation despite near-term volatility risks.

The waiver cemented Mashinsky’s position as the party responsible for the collapse of Celsius. It also distanced him from making amends to the victims who lost funds. The agreement filed on Monday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York prohibited Mashinsky, AM Ventures Holdings Inc., Koala1 LLC, and Koala3 LLC from receiving any bankruptcy proceeds. The court document stipulated that all of Mashinsky’s claims submitted or scheduled on his behalf be “withdrawn, disallowed, and shall receive no distribution” under the bankruptcy plan. Mashinsky and the entities related to him were permanently barred from receiving any recovery in the Celsius bankruptcy, allowing those reserved assets to be redistributed to other creditors. However, even as Mashinsky claimed to have agreed to forfeit the assets that the government traced directly to the proceeds of his crimes, his wife asserted that she had a superior claim to the property. Her assertions would reduce what the government seized and returned to Mashinsky’s victims if credited. Attorney Clayton says America’s investors deserve better U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Jay Clayton, said the Celsius founder targeted retail investors with false promises, used their funds to place risky bets, and profited tens of millions of dollars (~$48M). At the same time, his customers lost billions (~$4.7B). Crypto influencer Tiffany Fong lost 3.1 BTC and 11.6 ETH to Celsius (over $300K at today’s prices). However, Clayton believes that America’s investors deserve better. The waiver agreement, therefore, stipulated that since the court had disallowed claims from Mashinsky and related parties, all the money and assets (crypto and company shares) that were being held for them could be released for distribution to other creditors who were owed under the bankruptcy payout plan. Mashinsky was ordered by the bankruptcy court to pay a $50K fine and forfeit $48.3 million. However, despite this specific ruling, the order clarified that it did not affect other claims, counterclaims, or defenses that the Plaintiffs, Mashinsky, AMV, Koala1, and Koala3 might have in other legal proceedings, whether in the main case or other lawsuits. Celsius has made progress in returning value to affected users, distributing over $2.5 billion to more than 251K creditors as of August 2024. However, despite the progress, reports indicated that over $1 billion in claims from ~121K creditors were filed this year alone, highlighting the scale of the liabilities Celsius faced and the number of individuals and entities impacted. Clayton also pointed out that validating and categorizing claims remained a monumental task. Mashinsky admits to giving Celsius customers ‘false comfort’ In court, Mashinsky admitted to giving Celsius customers “false comfort” by giving an interview in 2021 in which he said Celsius had received approval from regulators for its “Earn” program, which it had not. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan also said the former CEO misled Celsius’ customers to persuade them to invest, and artificially inflated the value of his company’s proprietary crypto token. He also failed to disclose that he had been selling his CEL holdings. However, Mashinsky owned up to his wrongdoings and vowed to do whatever it took to atone for his mistakes. Attorney Clayton claimed that Mashinsky marketed Celsius as the safest place for crypto, and encouraged customers to “unbank” themselves by transferring crypto assets to the platform. He repeatedly misrepresented key aspects of Celsius’s business and finances throughout his tenure to attract customers and retain their assets. His false claims covered the safety of Celsius’s yield-generating activities, its profitability, the sustainability of high reward rates, and the risks associated with depositing crypto assets on the platform. Mashinsky and others orchestrated a years-long scheme to mislead customers about the CEL token. They manipulated CEL’s price by spending hundreds of millions purchasing it on the open market to artificially inflate its value. They sometimes used customer deposits to fund these market purchases, without disclosing that to customers. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Trading around $0.62, Cardano is gaining traction with its growing smart‑contract activity and upcoming protocol updates fueling renewed optimism. But here’s where the FOMO really kicks in, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is flying under the radar, and rumor mills are spinning out buzz about a possible 10x or more rally before June ends. Presale of Mutuum Finance is now in Phase 5, with MUTM priced at just $0.03, rapidly approaching the Phase 6 price of $0.035. The Mutuum Finance presale has attracted over 12,200 investors. More than $10.8 million has been raised. Mutuum Finance Presale Surpasses $10.8M with Over 12,200 Early Backers Mutuum Finance is a DeFi protocol that makes waves on the market as it has received funds in the amount of more than $10.8 million and was supported by more than 12,200 investors during the current presale. Such a momentum says much of this growing confidence in the long-term project mission and the role it would play in changing the decentralized finance segment. The MUTM tokens are priced at $0.03 and are at the phase 5. Provided that Phase 6 will raise the price to $0.035, initial investors can still receive 100 percent of profits at launch when the token will begin to trade at $0.06. Redefining DeFi: A Dual-Lending Model That Works Compared to standard DeFi protocols, Mutuum Finance will be the first attempt to develop a hybrid lending system that will be able to serve the needs of both passive and more advanced users. In Peer-to-Contract (P2C), customers fit the needs of any investor looking to generate passive income by locking their USDT into smart contract pools that generate stable, passive returns due to an interest rate that it moves up and down based on market conditions. In Peer-to-Peer (P2P) more experienced users can use this model where the lenders and borrowers have complete control over the terms set, which is ideal to work with volatile assets. The two-model scheme enables optimum flexibility, control, and risk management so that a current DeFi framework can be provided in comparison to early traditional lending protocols. Security First: Audited, Transparent, and Built to Last The crypto market can be full of rug Pulls and unmeditated risks, Mutuum Finance is atypical, audited by CertiK, a KYC equivalent of any crypto market. All the smart contracts are open source and auditable, which strengthens the community with regard to trust and accountability. In another push to strengthen the financial infrastructure, the project is also launching a full collateralized stablecoin pegged to USD on Ethereum network. Employing mechanisms not subject to the depegging issues that bedevil algorithmic stable coins, the asset is developed to be reliable, liquid, and ready to pursue values that can be realized in both retail and institutional applications over time. With more than 12,200+ early adopters contributing over $10.8 million, Mutuum Finance is fast becoming a unicorn in the making, with the smart money evidently following. It is now available in Phase 5 of its presale at only $0.03, and it will increase to $0.035 in the sixth phase shortly, followed by a guaranteed launch price of $0.06, and early adopters are looking at the opportunity of 100% returns before this token even becomes publicly available. Supported by a CertiK audit and a dual-lending framework (P2P and P2C) and fully-collateralized stablecoin allows Mutuum Finance to become a potential game-changer in DeFi, yet it remains under the radar. If you are yet to find the next 10x altcoin before June closes, remember to take your spot in the presale as soon as possible.

With fresh momentum building across early-stage assets, even a tiny allocation could turn into a significant return. Meanwhile, larger caps like Cardano, Solana, Arbitrum, and NEAR Protocol are facing slower action, prompting many to look elsewhere for rapid moves. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Small Entries, Serious Setup MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction for a different reason — it’s early enough to offer true upside but structured enough to stand apart from typical hype coins. The token’s supply is hard-capped at 170 billion, staking is already live, and on-chain data is showing strong accumulation behavior. Unlike many short-term fads, this project has been fully audited by HashEx and operates without centralized control or VC dominance. It’s appealing to traders who want more than just volatility — they want a strategic entry point with long-term potential. Combine that with the PATRIOTS100X promo currently in effect — giving added bonuses to new buyers — and the math gets compelling. A small, early stake now could position investors for exponential upside next year as the project nears listings and institutional exposure. It’s not about betting the farm — it’s about entering early, strategically, and letting structure work in your favor Cardano (ADA) Tracks Bitcoin Trends Cardano (ADA) continues to reflect broader market sentiment rather than generating its own momentum. No major developments have surfaced in the current cycle, and its price remains tied to Bitcoin’s dominance. Though its community remains engaged, ADA is trading in a narrow range, making it a less attractive short-term target. Solana (SOL) Maintains On-Chain Strength Solana (SOL) still ranks among the most active blockchains by user activity. Its ecosystem, especially across NFTs and DeFi, remains robust. However, traders are waiting for a breakout catalyst to lift SOL beyond its current consolidation phase. Without a major news driver, Solana’s momentum is stable but restrained. Arbitrum (ARB) Volume Slows Despite Ecosystem Growth Arbitrum (ARB) remains a critical player in the Layer 2 landscape. However, trading volumes have pulled back in the latest cycle, and there are no headline events propelling fresh capital inflow. While developers continue to build, the token’s near-term appeal has softened, leading momentum traders to explore more active plays. NEAR Protocol Expands Partnerships Quietly NEAR Protocol is steadily expanding, with ongoing partnership announcements and integrations across web3 infrastructure. Yet, despite the progress, the token’s price has been slow to respond. Like other altcoins this month, NEAR is holding ground — but it hasn’t sparked the kind of movement speculators are hoping for in June. Final Thoughts As Cardano, Solana, Arbitrum, and NEAR Protocol consolidate in quiet ranges, a growing number of traders are pivoting to MAGACOINFINANCE for its structured setup and investor-first mechanics. For those with an eye on 2025, even a modest stake could offer life-changing upside — if the timing is right.

With the RSI near 43 and MACD showing bearish momentum, Ethereum trades between immediate support around $2,485 and resistance near $2,557 . Volume remains moderate at roughly $20.15 billion daily. Source: Cryptonews After oscillating in a $2,480 – $2,547 range today, longer-term EMAs indicate underlying strength as the price sits above the 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs yet below the 20-day EMA. The following analysis was conducted using one of ChatGPT’s AI models, the new o3 pro. The predictions were then reanalyzed and edited together for enhanced readability while maintaining analytical precision. Technical Pulse: Neutral Consolidation Amid Longer-Term Strength Ethereum’s daily chart on Binance reveals a market in a holding pattern. As of June 20, 2025 , ETH trades around $2,432.47 , having opened near $2,523 and swung between a high of $2,547.5 and a low of $2,368.68 . This tight band reflects short-term consolidation after prior moves, with RSI at 43.12 hovering just below neutral and MACD displaying a negative histogram around 45.35 , indicating mild bearish momentum without decisive breakdown. Volatility remains moderate, with daily price swings staying within roughly $180 – $201 , consistent with ATR levels implied by today’s high-low range. Source: Cryptonews Moving averages convey a mixed but overall bullish medium-term structure. The 20-day EMA sits slightly above the price at $2,557 , suggesting short-term resistance and consolidation pressure. In contrast, the 50-day EMA at $2,438 , the 100-day EMA near $2,372 , and the 200-day EMA around $2,476 lie below the current price, indicating that on medium and longer timeframes, the trend retains a bullish orientation. Source: TradingView Price holding above those EMAs argues that dips near $2,438–$2,485 could attract buyers defending the uptrend, while reclaiming the 20-day EMA would signal a resumption of upward momentum toward higher resistance zones. Volume remains moderate at approximately 204,000 ETH traded daily, reflecting steady institutional and retail participation but not yet a surge. Trading within the $2,485–$2,547 range shows a balanced tug-of-war, with sellers cap rallies near the 20-day EMA, while buyers step in near the 50-day EMA or intraday lows. This kind of balance often sets up a breakout once a catalyst appears. For now, the short-term mood is neutral to slightly bearish, yet the broader medium-term uptrend means any drop below immediate support will likely be brief and shallow. Any successful reclaiming of the 20-day EMA could quickly attract momentum traders. Support & Resistance: Defining the Key Zones Immediate support emerges at today’s low around $2,485 . Should that level fail on heavier volume, the next anchor lies near the 50-day EMA ( ~$2,438 ), a zone where buyers may re-enter if the broader uptrend remains intact. Source: TradingView Beneath that, psychological and structural support around $2,400 coincides with a stop-loss region that many traders reference, but a sustained break below the 50-day EMA would shift focus toward deeper corrective territory closer to major support zones around $1,800–$1,900 , though such a move would likely require major negative catalysts given Ethereum’s longer-term strength. On the upside, immediate resistance resides at the 20-day EMA near $2,557 , a hurdle that price has struggled to clear. Beyond this, today’s high at $2,547 marks the short-term ceiling; clearing that area convincingly on strong volume could open a path toward the next major resistance zone between $2,700 and $2,800 , where prior swing highs reside. Above that, strong resistance lies in the $3,200–$3,400 range, levels reached in previous bullish runs but requiring robust catalysts and sustained bullish conviction to revisit. Within the current consolidation, the interplay between support near $2,438–$2,485 and resistance near $2,557 shapes trading dynamics. Traders watching daily closes above $2,557 look for confirmation of renewed upside, while breaches below $2,485 , especially with volume pickup, indicate potential deeper tests of the 50-day EMA. Given moderate volatility, breakout or breakdown beyond these pivot points could occur quickly once momentum shifts, with daily ranges of roughly $60–$70 broadening if ATR expands. Liquidity & Market Depth: Assessing Fuel for Moves Ethereum’s market cap is around $293.41 billion , and daily trading volume exceeds $21.91 billion , which shows deep liquidity across major venues. Binance order-book depth typically absorbs sizable orders with manageable slippage, a necessary condition for sizable moves when volume surges. Institutional participation appears average, with stablecoin flows and on-chain activity reflecting continued usage. Order-book clusters often form around support zones near $2,480–$2,500 , offering a buffer against light sell-offs, while resting asks near $2,550–$2,580 can absorb minor rallies until a catalyst drives stronger buying. Monitoring volume-weighted moving averages in tandem with order-book snapshots can reveal subtle accumulation. If volume-weighted metrics trend upward while price lingers below the 20-day EMA, selective accumulation may be underway despite short-term consolidation. Given deep liquidity, a meaningful breakout above $2,557 would likely require noticeable volume expansion, indicating a shift in conviction. Conversely, a breach of $2,485 supported by higher sell volume could lead to a swift move toward the 50-day EMA at $2,438 . On-Chain Insights: Usage Trends and Network Health Ethereum’s on-chain metrics continue to illustrate robust ecosystem engagement. Source: Etherscan Active address counts and transaction volumes across layer-1 and layer-2 networks reflect ongoing usage. Nearly 1% of circulating ETH is held as a reserve asset on layer-2 networks, while whales are accumulating at rates unseen since 2017 . These behaviors suggest a demand baseline beyond mere speculation, as participants lock up ETH for staking, layer-2 activity, DeFi participation, and reserve strategies. Statements from Ethereum co-founders emphasize Ethereum’s vision as a “master ledger for the world,” underpinned by layer-2 expansion and ecosystem growth. Ethereum Layer 1 will be the master ledger for the . Permissionless to inspect, use and add data or functionality to. Credibly neutral. Censorship resistant. Tamper resistant and tamper evident (via slashing and transparency). Incessantly progressively decentralizing… https://t.co/jMaHHpK2na — Joseph Lubin (@ethereumJoseph) June 19, 2025 Rising stablecoin supply on Ethereum and surges in layer-2 usage indicate that transaction demand may persist or increase, supporting fee-related demand for ETH. At the same time, staking yields and burning mechanisms under EIP-1559 continue to reduce net supply , providing a deflationary tilt that underlies longer-term bullish narratives. However, token unlock schedules or large whale movements warrant attention, as large accumulation by whales can bolster price floors if buying outpaces selling. Yet, any large-scale sell-offs could stress support zones. Overall, on-chain metrics point to a healthy network with sustained usage and structural supply factors that favor longer-term strength, even as short-term price consolidates. Social Sentiment: Gauging Community and Market Mood LunarCrush data for Ethereum reveals a broadly constructive but cautious sentiment environment. A Galaxy Score around 41 suggests a mildly bullish bias, while an AltRank near 380 indicates high engagement relative to other assets. Engagement metrics totaled billions of interactions, and mentions remain elevated in the tens of thousands, with creators numbering nearly 37,570 voices shaping narratives. Sentiment sits around 83% positive or neutral-positive, indicating prevailing optimism tempered by awareness of broader market uncertainty. Social dominance near 13.35% indicates Ethereum’s outsized share of crypto chatter, meaning major news or shifts can drive swift sentiment swings. THE $ETH SETUP IS IDENTICAL TO $BTC IN 2020 Same structure. Same retrace. Same disbelief. Bitcoin went 11x. If Ethereum does the same… you know the number. pic.twitter.com/isvpngSw4K — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) June 19, 2025 Recent commentary points out themes such as Ethereum’s evolving role as layer-1 backbone, strong technical setups compared to historical BTC patterns, and potential breakout scenarios following consolidation in the $2,170–$2,480 zone. In sum, social sentiment reflects confidence in Ethereum’s fundamentals and network potential, but traders remain watchful for confirmation cues. Macro & Ecosystem Catalysts: Potential Triggers Ethereum’s price trajectory will hinge on a mix of ecosystem developments and broader market forces over the coming months. Major catalysts include progress on layer-2 rollouts, prominent DeFi or additional stablecoins launches driving transaction spikes, and announcements around protocol upgrades that enhance scalability or interoperability. Stablecoin supply on $ETH is skyrocketing! pic.twitter.com/uh3TOLv5zn — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) June 19, 2025 Broader crypto sentiment, influenced by macro liquidity conditions, regulatory clarity around digital assets, and institutional adoption (e.g., ETFs, corporate treasury allocations), also heavily affects Ethereum’s outlook. Given its central role in decentralized finance, geopolitical events influencing risk appetite may also prompt rotations away from or back into Ethereum. Ecosystem dynamics, such as shifts in gas fee economics or competition from other layer-1s, factor into longer-term narratives but are less likely to drive abrupt short-term moves unless tied to concrete network performance data or notable project launches. Three-Month ETH Price Forecast Scenarios Over the next 90 days, Ethereum’s price will likely follow one of three broad paths, shaped by the interplay between technical conditions, on-chain trends, social mood, and macro catalysts. Range-Bound Consolidation (Base Case) In the absence of a decisive catalyst, ETH may trade within approximately $2,400–$2,600. Short-term momentum remains neutral-to-slightly bearish below the 20-day EMA, but medium-term trend stays bullish as price holds above the 50-, 100-, and 200-day EMAs. On-chain usage continues steadily, and social sentiment retains modest optimism without euphoria. Source: TradingView Volume and volatility remain moderate, yielding choppy swings that savvy traders can exploit between support near $2,365–$2,461 and resistance near $2,557–$2,600. Longer-term holders may await clearer directional signals before adding exposure. Bullish Breakout Toward $3,000+ (Bull Case) A convergence of positive factors, such as a sustained surge in layer-2 activity, a major upgrade announcement, or a broad crypto rally fueled by macro liquidity or ETF news, could lift ETH above the 20-day EMA near $2,557. Confirmation requires robust volume expansion pushing price through $2,600 and toward the $2,700–$2,800 zone, where prior resistance resides. On-chain metrics would need to register spikes in transaction volume or staking inflows, while social sentiment (Galaxy Score rising above 60 , engagement uptick) reinforces confidence. Source: TradingView Upon clearing $2,800 , the path to $3,000 and beyond becomes feasible, potentially revisiting multi-month highs if market conditions remain constructive. Traders should manage risk with trailing stops and watch for profit-taking near key resistance zones to guard against sharp pullbacks. Deeper Correction Toward $2,200–$2,300 (Bear Case) Should negative catalysts emerge, such as disappointing ecosystem news, regulatory headwinds, or broader risk-off driving crypto-wide declines, ETH could breach near-term support around $2,485 and test the 50-day EMA near $2,438. Confirmation of deeper weakness would involve volume-backed breakdown below $2,438 , accompanied by RSI falling below 45 and MACD deepening negative. Source: TradingView On-chain signs might show slowed transaction growth or unwind of staking positions, while social sentiment shifts toward caution or fear. In this scenario, the price may retest zones at around $2,300–$2,200 , reflecting deeper consolidation territories. A breach below those could invite further selling pressure toward $2,000 or lower. However, given Ethereum’s structural strength, such moves would likely be met with increased buying interest at perceived value levels. Risk management via stop-loss placement and hedging strategies becomes paramount. ETH Price Forecast: Balancing Technicals, On-Chain Health, and Sentiment Ethereum’s current consolidation reflects a market balancing short-term caution against medium-term bullish undercurrents. Price wedged between roughly $2,485 support and $2,557 resistance underlines a waiting game: will on-chain usage or macro-driven optimism tip momentum upward, or will external headwinds trigger a test of deeper support? Participants should treat each swing as a diagnostic: does price hold near $2,485 on steady or rising transaction volumes? Does reclaiming the 20-day EMA coincide with an uptick in layer-2 activity or a surge in staking inflows? Conversely, does a breach of $2,438 align with waning on-chain metrics or broader crypto weakness? Breakout or Consolidation? Ethereum’s current range between roughly $2,485 support and $2,557 resistance reflects a market where short-term momentum leans neutral to slightly bearish under the 20-day EMA. Yet, the medium-term structure remains bullish as the price is above 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs. Over the next 90 days, the interplay of on-chain usage trends, social sentiment shifts, ecosystem milestones, and macro dynamics will determine whether ETH breaks higher toward $3,000+ or undergoes a deeper correction toward $2,200–$2,300. Traders should watch for daily closes above $2,557 to validate bullish continuation or breakdowns below $2,485–$2,438 to signal caution. At the same time, watching layer-2 activity, staking trends, user engagement, and wider market indicators can either back up or challenge recent price action.

In a new blog post , Coinbase announces that it has secured its Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) license from the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF), enabling it to operate across all 27 EU member states fully. “This milestone enables us to offer a full suite of crypto products and services to 450 million people across all 27 European Union member states. Luxembourg has always been a key player in Europe’s financial ecosystem, and we’re delighted to share that Coinbase is officially establishing its European crypto hub in this dynamic country, under the Markets in Crypto Assets regulatory framework (MiCA).” According to Coinbase, Luxembourg was chosen because it offers regulatory clarity when it comes to crypto assets, as it has passed four bills in its national legislature related to blockchain technology. “By choosing Luxembourg, we’re positioning ourselves in a jurisdiction that understands the needs of the crypto industry and excels in regulatory clarity. Luxembourg is actively pursuing a whole-of-government approach to blockchain and DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology), and has passed four blockchain-related policies through the national legislature. This new hub represents a landmark step forward for Coinbase in Europe and strengthens the broader innovation ecosystem.” MiCA is a comprehensive regulatory framework that was formally adopted by the European Parliament in 2023 and offers clear guidance on digital assets, stablecoins, crypto wallets, as well as crypto service providers.
