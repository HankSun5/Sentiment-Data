Ruvi AI’s (RUVI) Early Entry Bonuses And Growing Hype Could Turn $1,500 Into 6 Figures",https://timestabloid.com/ripple-xrp-too-slow-ruvi-ais-ruvi-early-entry-bonuses-and-growing/,"Ripple (XRP) has long been a favorite for those seeking a stable and utility-driven cryptocurrency, built for efficient cross-border payments. Yet, its measured growth has often left investors craving a faster path to larger returns. Enter Ruvi AI (RUVI) , a blockchain and AI-powered project making waves with its impressive early performance and massive growth potential. Analysts and investors alike are pointing to Ruvi AI as a far more dynamic investment, thanks to its innovative model and potential to turn $1,500 into six figures . Why Investors Are Considering Ruvi AI Over Ripple While Ripple focuses heavily on financial institutions and cross-border transaction efficiency, Ruvi AI widens its scope by addressing critical challenges in marketing , entertainment , and finance . Incorporating both blockchain technology and artificial intelligence , Ruvi AI creates scalable solutions that meet real-world needs. What differentiates Ruvi AI from Ripple is its structured growth model , which provides investors with immediate returns and long-term potential. Currently in Phase 2 of its presale , RUVI tokens are priced at $0.015 each , offering an affordable entry point for early backers. Post-presale, the token price increases to $0.07 per token, delivering a nearly 5x return before the token is publicly listed. Analysts further project Ruvi AI could reach $1 per token , representing a 66x ROI and a clear advantage for proactive investors. Presale Success Showcases Momentum Ruvi AI’s presale has already achieved significant milestones, a marker of investor confidence in its value-driven proposition. With over $1.8 million raised and 1,600+ holders , the platform has additionally sold more than 160 million tokens , solidifying its growing reputation in the market. Unlike speculative projects, Ruvi AI’s roadmap includes a guaranteed price increase to $0.07 after the presale. This transparency gives investors clarity and reduces risks, establishing Ruvi AI as a standout in an often volatile crypto space. VIP Tiers Provide Exceptional Bonus Opportunities Beyond offering early entry pricing, Ruvi AI features VIP tiers , designed to reward contributors with substantial bonus token allocations. These bonuses significantly amplify the earning potential for investors: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These lucrative VIP tiers underline the importance of joining Ruvi AI’s presale early for optimal gains. Built on Transparency and Security A significant part of Ruvi AI’s rapid success stems from its dedication to transparency and security , values that resonate strongly with investors. Ruvi AI has partnered with CyberScope , a top blockchain auditing firm, for a third-party audit , ensuring its systems meet rigorous security standards. Additionally, Ruvi AI has teamed up with WEEX Exchange , guaranteeing post-presale liquidity and paving the way for seamless trading once the token is publicly listed. This partnership reflects Ruvi AI’s commitment to building a trustworthy ecosystem for its investors. Real-World Utility Drives Long-Term Demand Ruvi AI’s significance reaches far beyond its potential for immediate returns. By solving real-world problems across major industries, it establishes a sustainable demand for RUVI tokens. Some of its notable applications include: Marketing: With AI-powered tools for ad targeting and campaign optimization, Ruvi AI helps businesses improve ROI and reach their ideal audiences. Entertainment: Blockchain-supported payment systems paired with AI-curated recommendations allow creators to monetize efficiently while engaging users more effectively. Finance: Ruvi AI’s tools for fraud prevention, transparency, and operational scalability empower financial institutions to modernize. These applications ensure Ruvi AI’s longevity, making it more than just a short-term investment opportunity. Why Ruvi AI Can Outpace Ripple Ripple’s stability makes it a decent choice for conservative investors, but Ruvi AI’s $0.015 presale pricing , guaranteed rise to $0.07 post-presale , and projected $1 valuation provide unparalleled upside for those seeking explosive growth. Having already raised $1.8 million , sold 160 million tokens , and secured partnerships with CyberScope and WEEX Exchange , Ruvi AI is proving to be a leader in the blockchain and AI space. If you’ve been searching for a promising investment that could turn $1,500 into six figures , Ruvi AI is likely your best bet. Don’t wait to join this revolutionary opportunity.

While many projects talk big but deliver little, a few are setting themselves apart with real-world milestones. These four projects, BlockDAG, XRP, PEPE, and Sui, showcase the power of delivering tangible results. From miner rollouts to institutional finance, each one highlights what it means to turn vision into reality in the Web3 space. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Hardware Shipment & Network Participation BlockDAG leads by example among top crypto assets, taking a practical step by shipping real mining hardware. Beginning July 7, users will receive the X-Series lineup, including X10, X30, and X100 models. These units are ready-to-use, bringing real mining capability into users’ hands. The X10 targets new entrants, while the X30 and X100 serve high-performance needs. Built on a hybrid DAG and Proof-of-Work model, BlockDAG blends accessibility with proven security. Unlike many presale projects, it’s already delivering physical results. With $312 million raised in its presale and 22.8 billion coins sold across 29 batches, BlockDAG shows strong support. The coin is currently priced at $0.0276, and early participants have seen a 2,660% ROI. Until June 20, a reduced rate of $0.0018 remains available. BlockDAG is not about speculation; it’s about building and scaling ahead of exchange listings. 2. PEPE: Community Strength & Viral Appeal PEPE stands out not for enterprise use but for its ability to dominate conversations and generate high engagement. As a meme-driven coin, PEPE thrives on cultural recognition and strong community backing. It gained traction quickly, with rapid price increases and widespread exchange listings. Although it lacks a technical roadmap, it offers users speculative excitement and strong liquidity. Its place among the top crypto assets in 2025 comes from community growth and social momentum. 3. XRP: Reliable Utility in Cross-Border Finance XRP continues to be recognized among the top crypto assets due to its consistent use case in global payments. It supports quick, low-cost transfers, making it a practical solution for institutions. Despite legal battles involving Ripple, the team behind XRP, the project has secured significant partnerships. These developments suggest long-term alignment with the financial sector. XRP’s performance is driven by steady utility rather than hype, appealing to those who prioritize function and reliability. 4. Sui (SUI): Technical Foundation for Scalable Applications Sui brings speed and scale to the Layer-1 blockchain space. Built by Mysten Labs and leveraging the Move programming language, Sui enables secure and efficient smart contract execution. What sets Sui apart is its proven capacity to handle real-world transactions. Its parallel execution and near-instant finality create a strong foundation for developers and applications. Ongoing support and tooling improvements have strengthened its reputation. Rather than chasing hype, Sui focuses on enabling real use. Its technical progress and builder-centric approach make it a long-term contender in the Web3 infrastructure category. Which Are the Top Crypto Assets of 2025? When it comes to the top crypto assets of 2025 , the common thread is tangible progress. BlockDAG leads with hardware rollout and network integration. XRP maintains relevance through enterprise adoption. PEPE shows the strength of cultural engagement. Sui offers a solid technical base for application development. For anyone seeking more than promises, these projects show what execution, utility, and community can achieve in a growing Web3 world.

As expected, the central bank did not make changes to its federal funds rate. However, Chairman Jerome Powell did assert that they still expect to make two rate cuts this year. As a result, he may have calmed down the markets for a bit at a point when rising tensions in the Middle East have rattled investors. XRP is about to explode. I’m eyeing at least $8, and the market still hasn’t caught up to the fact that the SEC doesn’t consider it a security. $XRP holders are about to PRINT. I’ll drop the signal to exit right here when the moment is right. You’ll regret not following. pic.twitter.com/oiE8INoy7F — Crypto Beast (@cryptobeastreal) June 16, 2025 In the past week, XRP has accumulated a 3.2% loss. However, the crypto analyst “Crypto Beast”, whose account on X is followed by 727,000 users, seems to think that this token has significant upside potential ahead now that its regulatory headwinds have disappeared. Crypto Beast has identified a bullish price flag pattern that could result in significant gains for the native asset of the Ripple network in the near term. His baseline XRP price forecast sees a jump to $10 after a bullish breakout is confirmed. “You’ll regret not following,” he said. XRP Price Prediction: Ongoing Consolidation Confirms Crypto Beasts’ Thesis XRP has been consolidating for a while now after the token experienced a significant jump following Ripple’s legal victories against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the appointment of a new leader, Paul Atkins, for the regulatory agency. Looking at XRP’s 4-hour chart, this consolidation has been going on since Monday and shows that the price has traded range-bound between $2.33 and $2.10. Consolidation patterns tend to anticipate a big breakout ahead. They are not directional, so it is not possible to tell if they favor a bearish or bullish XRP price prediction. Traders should keep an eye on how this pattern unfolds. To further confirm Crypto Beast’s bullish XRP price prediction, the price would have to break above $2.35 with strong trading volumes. This should lead to a retest of multiple upper resistances, the first and most relevant one being the $2.65 level. Although XRP has failed to deliver the outstanding gains that investors may have been expecting throughout this year, Bitcoin (BTC) has already made a new all-time high as the top crypto is seen as a safe haven. A new crypto presale called Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) aims to unlock the huge potential of Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem by launching a Solana-power layer-2 scaling solution. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Raises $1.4M in Less Than a Month to Launch its L2 Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) leverages the efficiency of the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to launch a layer-2 protocol for the Bitcoin network that will support the rapid expansion of its DeFi and meme coin ecosystem. This solution will support cheap and fast asset transfer of Bitcoin tokens through a secure L2 that offers near-instant finality on all transactions. The L2’s architecture is quite simple. BTC tokens are transferred to a Bitcoin address monitored by Bitcoin Hyper’s Canonical Bridge. Once the assets are received, they will be minted in the L2 via smart contracts. As this solution gains popularity and becomes widely adopted by wallets and exchanges, the demand for $HYPER will explode. To buy this token at its discounted presale price, head to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to invest.

46372989,https://timestabloid.com/?p=71650,1750374327,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Pundit Uses $100 XRP Price to Prove Market Is Still Early,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-uses-100-xrp-price-to-prove-market-is-still-early/,"In a recent market update, prominent cryptocurrency commentator known as The Modern Investor asserted that the current valuations of major digital assets, including XRP and Bitcoin, suggest the broader crypto market has not yet reached maturity. His analysis focused particularly on XRP’s price level and long-term growth potential, positioning today’s market as an early-stage opportunity for strategic investors. XRP and Bitcoin Prices Reflect an Unfinished Market Cycle At the time of the analysis, XRP was trading at approximately $2.14, while Bitcoin remained under $105,000, far from the multi-million-dollar valuations that some long-term projections have anticipated for Bitcoin. The Modern Investor argued that these figures are indicative of a market still in development, emphasizing that significant growth potential remains across multiple cycles. According to him, many investors mistakenly believe they’ve missed their chance due to not entering the market during the earliest phases. However, he pointed out that the lack of a $100 XRP or a $2 million Bitcoin reinforces the idea that there is still considerable time for patient accumulation and strategy. Long-Term Growth and Accumulation Strategies Referencing an earlier claim by a market observer who projected that XRP could eventually reach the $100 mark , The Modern Investor noted that the target, while ambitious, could be realized throughout several bull markets. He stressed that long-term accumulation and disciplined investing are often underestimated strategies. According to his view, the growth potential of cryptocurrencies like XRP is not just theoretical; it is supported by previous market trends where assets have seen exponential increases over extended periods. The video also addressed recent commentary from market voices such as Edoardo Farina, who has urged investors to aim for holding at least 10,000 XRP. At today’s price, that target would require an investment of roughly $21,400. While Farina presented this as a worthwhile benchmark, The Modern Investor raised concerns about its practicality for the average retail investor. He acknowledged that while the intent behind such advice may be well-meaning, it may not account for the financial limitations many individuals face. Interestingly, Farina has expressed similar views, recognizing that acquiring such a position is becoming increasingly difficult . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Modern Investor described it as a hard truth, one that reflects how quickly digital asset prices can become inaccessible to everyday participants. Ownership Distribution and Market Positioning Further illustrating this point, data from the XRP Rich List indicates that owning around 11,000 XRP places an investor within the top 4% of all XRP wallet holders. Out of more than 6.5 million wallets, just over 263,000 meet this threshold. This suggests that even a relatively modest XRP holding by future standards could place investors in a highly advantageous position if the market moves as projected. If XRP were to reach $100, owning 10,000 tokens would translate to a portfolio worth $1 million. According to The Modern Investor, many long-time investors who adopted a strategy of small, consistent purchases over several years have already met or exceeded their goals through persistence and planning. Market Opportunities Remain Despite the recent price increases, The Modern Investor emphasized that opportunities still exist. While prices like $0.50 XRP are no longer available, he argued that the market’s current state still allows for smart investment decisions. He also discussed the growing trend of staking major assets, including XRP and Bitcoin, to generate passive income, viewing it as another avenue for building long-term financial security. The Modern Investor maintains that the absence of a $100 XRP should be interpreted not as a missed opportunity but as a sign that the market remains in its formative stages. For investors willing to remain focused and strategic, the path to meaningful gains is still accessible. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Musk’s companies merged following a $33B acquisition of the social media platform, X, by the billionaire’s AI startup, xAI. The move has drawn new regulatory scrutiny from the European Union, and it could have potential consequences that change the relationship between large tech companies and EU law. xAI buys out X The European Commission has reportedly sent a fresh wave of inquiries to X concerning the implications of the March buyout. The deal raised xAI’s value to $80B and effectively placed X under the AI startup’s umbrella. The move raised concern in Brussels that the restructuring could affect the scale of penalties the company may face under the Digital Services Act (DSA). Under the DSA, the EU holds the power to fine digital firms for up to 6% of their annual global turnover if they fail to address illegal content, disinformation, or comply with transparency requirements. According to insiders cited in publications, the European Commission is currently evaluating whether to include revenue from Musk’s other ventures, such as SpaceX , Neuralink, and The Boring Company, when calculating a potential fine against X. By attaching the penalties to the company’s total global revenue, the regulation raises the stakes for large corporations like Musk’s X. “We are following closely changes in the corporate structure of X, as we would changes in any other designated platform,” The Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier said on Thursday. He confirmed that the Commission sent a request for information to X, emphasizing that such structural changes could influence the ongoing investigation. EU regulators may pass fine decision by summer Regulators have yet to issue their first major penalty under the DSA, and insiders have revealed that a decision regarding X’s case could come before the Commission’s summer recess in August. However, the timeline for the decision remains unclear because the final size or even the rationale for a fine is still being determined. The investigation into X started in 2023 and is a result of multiple suspected DSA breaches, including the platform’s failure to curb disinformation, lapses in transparency for advertisers and researchers, and most notably, the controversial overhaul of its blue checkmark system. The European Commission argued that the change to the checkmark policy deviated from established industry norms and contributed to a more opaque information environment. X explained the blue checkmark’s current functionality in a recent attempt to avoid penalties, but it is unclear if it satisfied the Commission’s inquiry. Platforms under DSA scrutiny have the opportunity to make binding commitments to address violations in exchange for leniency. Brussels has thus far shown limited tolerance for superficial fixes. X has yet to respond publicly to the Commission’s latest inquiries. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

The project’s decentralized oracle technology revolutionized blockchain connectivity, helping Chainlink earn a reputation as one of the most popular cryptocurrency launches of its time. However, with prices now down more than 75% from that peak, those late to join have found themselves searching for the next significant opportunity. Today, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out at the center of this search. With its ongoing crypto presale at $0.3370, Qubetics offers features designed to address real-world needs, including its non-custodial multi-chain wallet. This new platform is attracting buyers who are focused on utility, growth, and security, qualities that define the most popular cryptocurrency choices today. For those seeking a fresh chance at advancement, Qubetics could be the project to watch now. Qubetics Brings Multi-Chain Wallet Convenience to Crypto The non-custodial multi-chain wallet from Qubetics addresses a crucial gap in the digital asset sector. In today’s market, many users are active on more than one blockchain. Managing funds, tracking tokens, and making transactions across networks can be confusing and time-consuming. Qubetics solves this challenge by offering a wallet where users control their assets, manage private keys, and interact seamlessly across multiple chains. A designer managing payments from international clients can now receive digital assets from various blockchains and keep them in a single secure wallet. This eliminates the need to transfer assets through multiple exchanges, saving both time and fees. For an e-commerce shop expanding into digital collectibles, the Qubetics wallet allows for simple management of different tokens, streamlining business growth. Professional service providers and consultants also benefit from the non-custodial approach. Sensitive transactions, such as legal settlements or high-value payments, are handled with full ownership and without relying on a third party. Enterprises handling payroll or supplier payments across borders can move funds securely, track everything in real time, and avoid compatibility issues between networks. By focusing on user control, privacy, and compatibility, Qubetics is setting a new standard among the most popular cryptocurrency solutions. The wallet’s ability to bridge networks and deliver convenience for a wide audience positions Qubetics as a leader in real utility and community trust. Its practical impact is becoming clear as more buyers join the ongoing crypto presale and look for technologies that can deliver lasting value. Qubetics Crypto Presale: Final Phase Unlocks High Demand Qubetics has now entered the final 37th stage of its crypto presale. Over 516 million tokens have been sold to more than 28,100 holders, and the platform has raised over $18 million so far. With less than 10 million $TICS remaining, the current price is locked at $0.3370 per token, ahead of an expected 20% increase to $0.40 at public listing. The total supply has been cut from 4 billion to 1.36 billion, with 38.55% allocated to the public. This approach puts control in the hands of the community. The combination of scarcity, transparent distribution, and practical features could drive a strong rally after Qubetics’ listing. The ongoing crypto presale stands out for those seeking the most popular cryptocurrency in its early stage, where both value and accessibility remain high. Those who buy $TICS at this stage immediately position themselves for a projected surge. Current estimates suggest $TICS could reach between $5 and $10 post-listing. The structure of this crypto presale rewards early adopters with access and growth that is rarely seen in established projects. A $25,000 entry into the current Qubetics crypto presale yields approximately 74,187 $TICS tokens at the price of $0.3370 each. If $TICS lists at $0.40, that holding would already be valued at $29,674, a 20% increase at listing alone. Should $TICS reach $1, the value rises to $74,187. A climb to $5 projects a return of $370,935, while $10 takes the total to $741,870. Participants from stage 1, who bought at $0.01, are already looking at gains above 3,270%. Although the earliest phase has ended, the current stage still offers significant return potential for those ready to join. Only a limited amount of tokens remain, creating urgency for buyers who do not want to miss out on the most popular cryptocurrency presale before the public launch. Chainlink: From All-Time Highs to a Slower Growth Cycle Chainlink began as a blockchain abstraction layer and quickly earned a place among the most popular cryptocurrency networks. The protocol’s decentralized oracle technology enables smart contracts to securely access off-chain data, powering innovations in DeFi, insurance, gaming, and more. Chainlink’s cross-chain interoperability protocol has continued to evolve, connecting blockchain networks with real-world data and services. However, Chainlink’s all-time high was reached four years ago at $52.88. Since then, the price has remained more than 75% below that record, with most late arrivals missing out on the early exponential growth. Despite regular network upgrades and expanding adoption, Chainlink’s current phase is marked by steadier growth and lower volatility. While it continues to be respected and widely integrated, the chance for new buyers to experience the dramatic wealth creation seen in the initial phase has largely passed. The market now looks for projects that combine proven technology with genuine new access. Qubetics is drawing attention as the most popular cryptocurrency for those seeking both practical features and early entry potential. Looking Ahead Market sentiment continues to shift as community members seek the next major platform with both real-world application and strong potential for returns. Qubetics stands out for its focus on interoperability, user ownership, and transparency. Its non-custodial multi-chain wallet addresses the challenges faced by modern crypto users and businesses, bringing fresh relevance to the most popular cryptocurrency debate. As the final crypto presale stage advances, Qubetics is seeing growing demand and positive coverage. Credible analysis and active community engagement signal a project with significant room to grow. Those who missed the ICO phase of earlier projects have a new chance to participate, as the opportunity remains open.

46373648,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=750302,1750374978,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46373648.jpeg,Local Texas lawmakers could delay Musk’s robotaxi launch until September,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/texas-lawmakers-could-delay-musk-robotaxi/,"Lawmakers from the Texas House of Representatives and Senate are trying to get Tesla to postpone its robotaxi launch and have signed a letter of request to this effect. The letter, which was signed on Wednesday, June 18, requests that Tesla delay its robotaxi launch until September, when new autonomous driving regulations are scheduled to go into effect. Lawmakers express concern as they push for a delay The regulations coming into effect in September would require autonomous cars to be registered under Texas law, meet certain safety and vehicle standards, and also be “capable of achieving a minimal risk condition if the automated driving system is rendered inoperable.” In accordance with the regulations, companies operating autonomous vehicles would also be required to provide a First Responder Interaction Plan to the Department of Public Safety detailing how emergency personnel should interact with driverless vehicles. The lawmakers wrote that Tesla can still go ahead with the robotaxi launch which is slated for June 22 if it responds to the letter with “detailed information demonstrating that Tesla will be compliant with the new law upon the launch of driverless operations in Austin.” However, there is at least one person among the writers of the letter who is skeptical about Tesla’s readiness to launch. “I don’t know that it is ready to be launched,” Goodwin said of Tesla robotaxis on CBS Austin on Wednesday. “There is more work that needs to be done before they let them loose on the streets.” Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk has said his company has been testing its full self-driving cars on the streets of Austin over the last month, with one driverless Tesla Model Y spotted on public roads in Austin. Musk announced plans to launch thousands of Tesla robotaxis in Austin in May, with future plans to expand to cities like San Francisco. However, in a safety test conducted by The Dawn Project, a known critic of Tesla’s self-driving tech, a Tesla Model Y with Full Self-Driving engaged was unable to stop in the presence of a school bus stop sign and child-sized dummy, raising concerns about how ready it is to be deployed. Texas is attracting autonomous vehicle companies, but public safety officials are worried about oversight As it stands, Texas has minimal regulations for autonomous vehicles, allowing operation with basic registration and insurance, which has made it an attractive hub for companies like Tesla. If Tesla decides to push forward with the launch, it will be competing on Austin’s streets with Google’s Waymo, Amazon’s Zoox, and ventures funded by automakers VW and Hyundai. Unfortunately, the lack of oversight has raised concerns among public safety officials, especially since Tesla has a history of unfulfilled self-driving promises and recent safety test failures. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) also sent Tesla a letter in May 2025, requesting to know about how its robotaxis plan to handle collisions, poor visibility, and emergency situations. Tesla has not publicly responded to either the lawmakers’ or NHTSA’s letters, though a response to the NHTSA’s letter was expected on June 19. How Tesla will respond is unclear, but the request of the Democratic lawmakers is not expected to do much to stop Tesla’s progress, especially in a Republican-dominated state, where the governor and legislative majorities favor a hands-off regulatory approach to promote the autonomous vehicle industry. To his credit, Musk is also very big on safety, noting that the company is “being super paranoid” and could shift the launch date if needed. “We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,” Musk wrote on X on June 10.

The development was recently discussed by George Tung, co-founder of CryptosRus, who described the integration as a major strategic move. Cardano to Strengthen Cross-Chain Compatibility Hoskinson confirmed on June 14 via X that his team is actively developing tools to enable stronger XRP compatibility within Cardano. This includes the introduction of XRP-based DeFi products, integration of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, and participation of XRP holders in upcoming airdrops. These developments mark a significant step in Cardano’s long-term goal of becoming a multi-chain platform. There is a whole XRP package with the glacier drop, lace wallet support, XRP DeFi and the RealUSD talks. — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 14, 2025 Among the proposed initiatives is the Glacier Airdrop , now set to take place in Q4 2025. The airdrop will involve the distribution of Midnight tokens, a privacy-oriented token designed for Cardano’s Midnight sidechain, to users on multiple blockchain networks, including XRP. While initially scheduled earlier, the timeline was extended to accommodate broader cross-chain coordination. The aim is to attract XRP users to Cardano’s ecosystem and encourage the adoption of its privacy-enabled solutions. Lace Wallet to Introduce XRP Support Cardano’s Lace wallet is also on track to expand its supported assets. Following the successful rollout of Bitcoin support in Lace version 1.22 in April 2025, the next update will include functionality for XRP . This upgrade will allow users to manage XRP alongside native assets such as ADA and Bitcoin from a single interface. The addition of XRP support reflects Cardano’s broader efforts to create a unified and user-friendly environment for managing digital assets. It underscores the project’s commitment to building infrastructure that supports multiple leading cryptocurrencies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP DeFi Tools and RLUSD Stablecoin Under Development In addition to the wallet and token initiatives, Cardano is working on integrating XRP into its DeFi framework. Current development efforts are focused on establishing decentralized exchanges and cross-chain liquidity pools that leverage XRP’s efficiency and transaction speed. These tools are intended to offer users faster and lower-cost trading options while contributing to Cardano’s overall DeFi expansion. Furthermore, early-stage discussions are taking place between Cardano and Ripple to enable RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, on the Cardano network. Though still under consideration, both entities are exploring the potential benefits of such collaboration. Successful implementation of RLUSD could diversify stablecoin offerings within the Cardano ecosystem and attract a broader user base. Strategic Integration to Boost Cardano’s DeFi Metrics Hoskinson has previously stated that the integration of assets such as Bitcoin and XRP could be central to Cardano’s projected growth over the next several years. He emphasized that supporting projects centered on these cryptocurrencies could help Cardano significantly increase its total value locked (TVL), potentially exceeding that of competing blockchains like Solana and Ethereum. By committing to cross-chain integration and fostering partnerships with major crypto assets, Cardano is positioning itself as a competitive force in the evolving DeFi landscape. Hoskinson’s strategy appears focused on building infrastructure that facilitates accessibility, interoperability, and growth through targeted collaborations, particularly with Ripple and the XRP community.

The Russian newspaper Vedomosti reported that the fund is called Crypto Factory. It is the brainchild of the Penza-based gas power unit provider Power Systems and the financial management firm Finam. Only qualified investors will be allowed access to the fund. Investors’ money will go toward powering BTC mining rigs on farms that use natural gas. The fund’s operators will then sell the Bitcoin (BTC) they mine and provide regular payouts to the investors. Power Systems’ Bitcoin mining rigs. (Source: Power Systems Crypto/Instagram) Russian Power Firm’s BTC Mining CEF In the financial world, CEFs usually refer to investment funds that issue a fixed number of shares only once, typically during an initial offering. Unlike traditional open-ended funds, their issuers do not continuously issue or redeem shares. Instead, CEF shares are traded on a stock exchange, much like individual stocks. Power Systems said that it would send investors analytics data. It will also let them access CCTV camera feeds that monitor work at the mining farms. The fund’s term is five years, and with an initial capital worth 850 million rubles (around $11 million. Potential investors must put a minimum of 5 million rubles ($63,719) into the fund, the company said. The power firm says its basic financial model assumes a return of 49% per annum. It also promised 10% per year interim payments, with a quarterly frequency. Finam said that the shares would not be made available on secondary markets. It said that its commission fee would be 1% of the average annual value of the fund’s net assets. The #crypto market is down again today, and #BTC fell below $105,000.

Providing BTC prices do not drop below this rate, investors could expect to make money from their stakes, the company said. The exact cost of mining BTC in Russia remains unclear, with power prices varying from region to region. Experts said at the end of the past financial year that US miners spent an average of $82,162 to mine BTC 1.

Having remained relatively cautious about allowing investors access to crypto-related financial products in the past, Moscow has become decidedly more bullish in 2025. At the end of May, the Russian Central Bank allowed financial institutions to offer qualified investors access to crypto derivative products. And earlier this month, the Moscow Exchange began offering a Bitcoin futures contract product for qualified investors. The product is linked to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). It is the exchange’s first crypto-related product. Power Systems, founded in 2005, has recently turned its attention to gas-powered crypto mining operations, using associated gas . The latter often releases during oil drilling operations. Drillers usually flare this gas on site if they cannot find an immediate use for it. The firm claimed that mining BTC at gas fields “helps reduce costs.” It added that this not only makes mining cheaper, but also helps reduce miners’ carbon footprints.

Traders are now scanning the altcoin landscape for early opportunities—and one project is starting to stand out across analyst discussions and trading desks alike. Why Analysts Are Turning Their Attention to MAGACOINFINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most actively discussed altcoins right now. Unlike many short-lived meme projects, this one has evolved into something more strategic — thanks to key developments that traders are now pricing in. With the total token supply locked, analysts are highlighting this altcoin for its combination of scarcity, stability, and long-term yield potential. The project’s clean audit by HashEx and its full ownership model have further cemented credibility, drawing a different class of investor — one more focused on structure and performance than just short-term hype. What’s catching eyes now is the clear setup for accumulation: reduced transactional churn, concentrated wallet growth, and on-chain patterns indicating strategic positioning rather than exit-driven trading. MAGACOIN FINANCE may be a newer name, but the trading behaviors forming around it suggest this one has room to run. Bitcoin’s Macro Advantage Continues to Lead the Pack Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of crypto sentiment, and this month, it’s once again asserting dominance. As global economic pressure and inflationary concerns loom, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a hedge by both retail and institutional investors. This resilience gives it a dual role — both as a barometer for the entire market and as a trigger for altcoin momentum. Traders are currently tracking its consolidation behavior closely, expecting it to be the fuse for the next breakout cycle. Bitcoin’s strength continues to act as a launchpad for strategic rotations into high-potential altcoins. XRP Inches Closer to Regulatory Clarity XRP is riding a wave of renewed optimism as developments surrounding its legal battle with the SEC begin to take shape. A proposed motion to unlock $125 million from escrow has hinted at the closing stages of litigation, and investors are watching with heightened anticipation. Some analysts believe an end to this prolonged case could unleash significant institutional capital, particularly if the XRP ETF rumors hold weight. In parallel, Ripple’s strategic vision of handling up to 14% of SWIFT’s global cross-border transactions in the future gives XRP added long-term weight. SOL, TRX, and KAS React in Different Ways Solana (SOL) continues to hold its position as one of the most active blockchains by user participation. While no major headlines have surfaced recently, Solana’s stability and developer momentum remain positive signals. Traders see it as a consistent contender in the Layer 1 race. TRON (TRX) is staying in the spotlight for its transaction reliability and stablecoin support. Though the market has seen limited price excitement, Justin Sun’s ongoing engagement continues to support the network’s visibility and ecosystem activity. Kaspa (KAS), meanwhile, has had a quieter cycle. Without fresh announcements, KAS maintains a low-profile stance — yet some traders view this calm period as a potential accumulation window depending on upcoming ecosystem signals. Final Thoughts Bitcoin and XRP are proving their staying power this cycle, but the real question for traders is where to find early entries with future momentum. SOL, TRX, and KAS all offer different appeal — yet MAGACOINFINANCE stands apart with confirmed scarcity, passive yield potential, and investor traction. As analysts scan for altcoins positioned to break out, this one is quickly moving up the list.

This June, three presales are getting a lot of attention: MAGACOIN FINANCE, Ruvi AI, and BlockDAG Each of these projects brings something unique to the table, but one name stands out from the pack—and that’s MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The One Everyone’s Talking About Let’s be honest—most people don’t want to miss the next Shiba Inu or Dogecoin moment again. At the moment, MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be poised as the next cryptocurrency breakout to watch out for. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about names in crypto circles. From analyst mentions to investor forums, the project is everywhere, and it’s not slowing down. What’s driving the surge? It’s the sheer energy behind the brand. The tone, timing, and market are all lining up to create the kind of viral lift that’s hard to ignore. While other tokens focus on features and functions, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building a movement, and the market is clearly paying attention. Predictions for MAGACOIN FINANCE are over the roof, but what is really driving investors and institutional interest in the token is the timing, energy, and early-stage opportunity. This isn’t a slow, utility-focused token that hopes to go mainstream one day. MAGACOIN FINANCE is advancing swiftly, and according to insiders, buyer activity has been rapidly increasing. People aren’t just watching this one—they’re getting in. If you’ve ever looked back and said, “I should’ve bought earlier,” this might be one of those moments you remember. Ruvi AI: A Smart Bet for the AI Crowd Ruvi AI is offering something different. It combines blockchain with artificial intelligence to create practical tools in marketing, finance, and entertainment—and it’s doing it with a solid plan in place. With over $1.8 million already raised and more than 155 million tokens sold, it’s clear that people are taking it seriously. Analysts say it’s one of the better-planned and more organized projects in the current presale scene. Some projections suggest that Ruvi AI could deliver 66x returns once it lists, and if AI continues its current trajectory, it could become a long-term winner for patient investors. BlockDAG: Big Tech, Bigger Potential BlockDAG isn’t just another blockchain project. It’s already gained traction for its unique mix of tech, combining DAG and Proof-of-Work in a way that’s got developers and investors alike paying close attention. BlockDAG is obviously aiming for scale, as evidenced by the more than $294 million raised and the confirmed listings on 20 exchanges. Add in a mobile mining app with over 1.5 million users, and it’s easy to see why some analysts are expecting up to 55x returns once it launches. This might be worth keeping an eye on if you’re the type of investor who enjoys large infrastructure plays with long-term utility. The Takeaway: One Name Is Rising Faster Than the Rest All three projects have their strengths, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is the one generating the real heat right now. It’s the project everyone’s talking about. It has the hype, the early movement, and the kind of projections that make people take action. For many, this feels like a rare second chance—a shot at getting in early before the headlines really take off. And let’s be honest: in crypto, the people who get there first usually win.

These zones have tracked major moves from fear-based accumulation to key resistance points. With new formations developing, a potentially parabolic move could be on the horizon. Perfect Setups For SUI That Paid Off Big Cheek Analytics, in a recent X post, identified $1.57 as SUI’s fundamental price and an ideal buy zone, especially during periods of fear. Historical data show that entering at this level on August 3, 2024, could have yielded up to a 957% gain, while a similar setup on April 7, 2025, has already returned up to a 134% gain at its peak. Related Reading: Breakout In Sight? SUI Set To Test Crucial $3.5 Resistance With ATH In View Cheek Analytics also pointed to the Purple Cloud around $4 as the first significant resistance SUI needs to clear. This zone has been tested several times, with one brief breakthrough, only for the price to fall back and validate it as resistance. Cheek views this level as a key barrier: breaking above it would shift the momentum decisively and set the stage for further gains. Looking further ahead, Cheek Analytics highlighted the Orange Cloud at $9 as SUI’s major resistance zone. Historically, once the purple zone is broken, price often accelerates toward this level. However, during a past attempt, growing cloud zones stalled the move, and sentiment shifted to extreme greed, triggering profit-taking. SUI later retraced by -52% and still trades -28% below its peak. To round out the roadmap, Cheek Analytics introduced the Red Cloud at $20 as the long-term target zone, a region that could come into play if the orange cloud flips to support. However, Cheek notes that on larger altcoins like SUI, the red cloud is rarely touched. This is because all cloud zones expand or contract with market movement. Higher Highs Needed: The Path To Breaking Resistance Cheek Analytics concluded that SUI shows strong long-term potential, as seen in its expanding cloud zones. However, for further upside, the price must form higher lows and higher highs; otherwise, a breakout above the purple cloud may fail and attract renewed selling pressure. Related Reading: Here’s Why SUI At $3.61 Could Be the Calm Before A Parabolic Surge If the bullish structure fails to materialize, the analyst warns of a likely retracement back toward the fundamental green line at $1.57, a level described as an ideal accumulation point for long-term believers, or as they put it, “buttlievers.” Currently, the sentiment indicator is already showing fear, marked by a light blue background. Should price revisit the green line, Cheek Analytics expects sentiment to shift into extreme fear, setting the stage for optimal dollar-cost averaging (DCA) conditions for committed holders aiming to ride the next major wave.

MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly gaining momentum, with analysts and investors spotlighting its presale structure and upside potential. As ADA, ETH, OP, and VET also make headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a top contender in the evolving altcoin race. MAGACOIN FINANCE Surges, Igniting an 18,500% ROI Predictions for Early Buyers MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves across the 2025 altcoin landscape, igniting record-breaking investor interest with its sub-$0.01 pre-sale entry point. The project’s rapid momentum—driven by strategic accumulation from both retail and institutional buyers—is reinforcing its position as a serious contender. Backed by viral branding, streamlined tokenomics, and limited-access bonuses, MAGACOIN FINANCE is widely regarded as one of the most promising early-stage opportunities this year. With over $10 million already secured and analysts highlighting major upside potential, market attention continues to intensify. Cardano (ADA): Testing Key Support Amid Volatility Cardano is under pressure in June, slipping below critical support at $0.72 and currently trading around $0.70. Despite short-term technical vulnerability, medium-term prospects remain cautiously optimistic if ADA can reclaim key zones. As some ADA holders rotate into MAGACOIN FINANCE, the altcoin’s appeal as a speculative pick is growing. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Momentum Eyes $2,900 Ethereum is showing renewed strength, with price predictions for June targeting a move back to the $2,800–$2,900 range. Increased trading volumes and bullish technicals are fueling optimism. MAGACOIN FINANCE is benefiting from this positive DeFi sentiment, with ETH whales reportedly joining its presale for early exposure. Optimism (OP): Upward Trend Continues Optimism (OP) has posted an 8% monthly gain, with June forecasts suggesting a potential move to $0.67 or higher. As OP’s ecosystem expands, traders are also looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for similar high-upside opportunities in the altcoin space. VeChain (VET): AI-Driven Price Predictions Signal Upside VeChain is forecasted to rise 55% by the end of June, with a target of $0.035. As VET’s fundamentals improve, the broader altcoin market—including MAGACOIN FINANCE—stands to benefit from renewed investor interest. Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE, Cardano, and Ethereum are capturing the spotlight as traders seek the next big move in crypto. With strong fundamentals and growing community support, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned as a breakout candidate for 2025.

According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Eastern District of California, a 17-count indictment unsealed on Tuesday charges brothers-in-law Ayman Alaaraj and Ahmad Nassar with bank fraud and aggravated identity theft. Court documents show that in May 2023, Nassar took over several bank accounts belonging to two elderly victims at two separate banks using sophisticated techniques, such as porting over the phone number belonging to one of the victims. The method enabled Nassar to access the accounts and bypass the banks’ two-factor authentication protection. Nassar, occasionally assisted by Alaaraj, then drained the accounts and ran up unpaid credit card debits, causing more than $794,000 in losses to the victims. The two men then moved the stolen money through the pass-through accounts created under the victim’s names, as well as funneled $100,000 through Alaaraj’s businesses. The defendants eventually transferred the money to themselves using ATM cash withdrawals, personal checks, Western Union transactions and Zelle transactions. They also used the stolen funds to pay credit cards, engage in online gambling and buy a Mercedes. If found guilty, the two men face up to 30 years of jail time and a $1 million fine for each count of bank fraud. They also face a mandatory prison term of two years and a fine of up to $250,000, or twice the gross gain or gross loss, for the aggravated identity theft count.

It’s time to focus on what really matters: adoption, users, and working systems. In 2025, some coins stand out not just for their name, but for their actual use. BlockDAG, Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana are gaining real momentum. They show up not because of buzzwords, but because people are using them in everyday life. From mobile-friendly mining to smart contracts and fast networks, these top crypto coins are leading for a reason. This guide gives you a clear picture, simple, real, and easy to follow. Whether you’re new or experienced in the space, keep reading to learn why these four names matter in today’s Web3 world. 1. BlockDAG’s Mobile Growth and $312M Milestone BlockDAG is standing out fast, thanks to its simple and powerful X1 Miner App. With over 2 million users mining on the app, X1 is one of the fastest-growing apps in the crypto world this year. What makes it so different? No hardware. No big setup. Just a smartphone is enough to start earning BDAG. This easy model is drawing in users beyond the usual crypto crowd. Its strength also lies in its smart design. BlockDAG combines DAG technology with Proof-of-Work. This setup helps the system stay fast and secure while still being decentralized. That balance is not easy to find, and it puts BlockDAG (BDAG) ahead of many others in the space. The numbers speak for themselves. So far, BlockDAG has raised $312 million, now in Batch 29, priced at $0.0276. The early backers in Batch 1 have already seen a strong 2,660% return. In total, over 22.8 billion coins have been sold. For those still thinking about it, the special price of $0.0018 is available till June 20th, a rare chance to get in early. This isn’t just about numbers. BlockDAG is showing real-world use and growth. It offers a system anyone can access, backed by strong tech. With its reach growing and its user base expanding quickly, BlockDAG is firmly placed among the top crypto coins, leading the shift in how blockchain connects to everyday users. 2. Ethereum Powers DeFi With Upgrades in 2025 Ethereum continues to hold a strong position in crypto, backed by its massive network and active developer base. Though it faced past issues like high fees and speed problems, recent updates are solving those pain points. The switch to Proof-of-Stake and Layer 2 upgrades have helped cut costs and increase speed. In 2025, Ethereum remains a top choice for DeFi, NFTs, and dApps. Billions of dollars are tied up in smart contracts here, showing strong trust and real use. While newer names are growing fast, none have matched Ethereum’s size or reliability yet. It continues to be one of the top crypto coins, offering proven tools and a strong track record in building Web3 systems that actually work. 3. Cardano Grows With Research-Driven Progress Cardano stands out for its slow but steady path. Built on deep research and peer-reviewed work, it focuses on getting things right rather than rushing. In 2025, that careful approach is starting to show results, with more apps and smart contracts going live on its platform. Its Hydra upgrade is helping it scale, while partnerships in developing regions grow its reach. ADA may not have flashy news every week, but it keeps building in the background. That stable growth makes it one of the top crypto coins to watch. It may not be loud, but it’s consistent, something many in the space value when looking for lasting results instead of short-term hype. 4. Solana Delivers Speed With Better Stability Solana has always been known for its fast speeds. It can process tens of thousands of transactions per second and charges very low fees. That makes it ideal for areas like gaming, real-time payments, and quick DeFi moves. Although it faced network downtime in the past, 2025 has brought better results. The team has worked on stability, and it’s paying off. More apps and platforms, especially in NFTs and social media, are choosing Solana as their base. Its fast-growing user base and active devs keep it moving forward. Solana proves that strong performance and improved trust can go hand in hand. It earns its spot as one of the top crypto coins with real-time use and solid backing. Final Thoughts In 2025, success in crypto isn’t just about early hype or big promises. It’s about tools that work, people who use them, and systems built to last. BlockDAG shows how simple mobile access can open doors for everyone. Ethereum keeps leading with its tech and trusted platform. Cardano grows at a steady pace with a research-first focus. Solana offers speed and strong user tools. These four each bring something unique. Together, they shape what the future looks like. As Web3 grows, these top crypto coins show us the way forward, clear, usable, and ready for what’s next.

As attention shifts to high-upside altcoins, a growing number of traders and analysts are keeping close tabs on MAGACOINFINANCE — a fast-developing asset that’s gaining traction thanks to structural strength and bullish indicators. Bitcoin’s Role as Market Driver Remains Strong Bitcoin continues to act as the lead barometer for risk sentiment in crypto. With broader geopolitical concerns easing slightly and macro trends pointing toward cautious optimism, traders are repositioning around BTC’s next major move. Recent strength suggests a renewed appetite for digital assets, and as history shows, Bitcoin rallies often set the tone for altcoin rotations shortly after. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is on Every Analyst’s Radar MAGACOINFINANCE is now being tracked closely by Bitcoin and XRP investors seeking asymmetric returns. The recent staking activation and firm supply cap of 170 billion tokens have added credibility to what began as a meme-inspired entry and is now being taken seriously as a long-term player. Investor behavior tells the story: On-chain wallets show long-term holding patterns Staking inflows continue without major dumps Audit from HashEx confirms code integrity Full ownership structure avoids VC overreach Adding to the momentum, MAGACOINFINANCE has introduced a limited-time bonus offer under the promo PATRIOTS100X , giving new buyers added leverage ahead of wider listing exposure. This has only amplified the wave of interest from early adopters looking for strategic positioning. XRP Closer Than Ever to Legal Resolution For XRP, this cycle feels different. The token has bounced back from a multi-day pullback and now rides on the momentum of an almost-resolved legal battle with the SEC. A joint motion to unlock $125 million from escrow marks a potential end to the years-long case — and that’s attracting fresh capital. Speculation is also building around a possible XRP ETF approval, which, if confirmed, could act as a powerful new catalyst. SOL, KAS, and TRX Show Different Strengths Solana (SOL) remains a top Layer 1 in terms of user activity. While no major events have hit headlines, the network continues to support a thriving developer base, maintaining its reputation as a high-performance chain. Kaspa (KAS) is less visible in the current cycle but is quietly attracting attention from long-term traders looking for value entries. KAS remains an infrastructure-focused project with room to surprise if upcoming releases deliver impact. TRON (TRX) is staying consistent. With active support for stablecoins and a growing decentralized ecosystem, it remains a favorite among traders seeking dependable, lower-volatility exposure. Final Thoughts Bitcoin and XRP are creating room for altcoins to move — and while SOL, TRX, and KAS maintain unique strengths, MAGACOINFINANCE is increasingly being viewed as the altcoin with breakout potential. With staking live, a locked supply, and smart investor accumulation underway, the setup is clear for those watching closely.

The firm said on Thursday that it planned to amass 105,000 Bitcoins by the end of 2027, enough to make it one of the world’s largest corporate holders of digital assets. The company’s Bitcoin purchasing plan is set to be rolled out over three years, led by Joe Burnett, the director of Bitcoin strategy . Semler is hoping to own 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025. That figure will increase to 42,000 BTC by the end of 2026 and to 105,000 BTC by the end of 2027. That approach is part of a broader trend among publicly held companies that are forward-looking and increasingly considering Bitcoin not as a speculative bet but as a long-term store of value and a core treasury asset. Semler treats Bitcoin as a long-term asset Semler’s dive into Bitcoin is no flight of fancy. The company’s been on this path since May 2024, when it jumped onto what it calls the “ Bitcoin Standard .” Since then, Semler has pivoted to a Bitcoin bull and is among the most vocal corporate cheerleaders for cryptocurrency. On June 4, 2025, the company held 4,449 BTC valued at $462 million. That would make it one of the 15 biggest Bitcoin collectives in the world. However, the outfit’s 287% BTC yield and $177 million in profit from its Bitcoin holdings as of early June are more remarkable. These returns reinforce the firm’s argument that Bitcoin is not just a hedge but also a potent value-generating asset. Burnett, who has spoken with some of the smartest economists, investors, and Bitcoin thinkers across every format, will help Semler build its thesis around education, macro insights, and treasury diversification with Bitcoin. It also indicates a more deliberate, permanent establishment of Bitcoin strategy within the company’s executive ranks. Semler builds reputation as Bitcoin strategy leader Semler Scientific’s approach puts it in the company of firms such as Strategy, currently the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. With Semler’s 15,000 BTC to date, compared to Strategy’s 214,400 BTC, closing this gap in the longer term is truly underway. It is now the second US public company to adopt the Bitcoin Standard, following Strategy. According to The Block data, almost 230 companies worldwide have adopted similar Bitcoin treasury strategies. Semler’s move is part of a growing institutional trend toward Bitcoin, such as the growing number of US spot Bitcoin ETFs on the heels of more positive regulatory clarity and greater macroeconomic uncertainty, leading many to diversify their asset portfolio. The company now trades on the Nasdaq under the trading symbol SMLR. It now trades at about $32 a share for a market capitalization of about $375 million. Semler’s aggressive crypto play has garnered interest from traditional investors and Bitcoin enthusiasts. Though it has been relatively modest in size, the fund has seen users plow money into it at a rapid clip. In an industry where few healthcare companies have been brave enough to take such a step, Semler establishes a distinct brand that blends healthcare innovation with Bitcoin maximalism. Assuming its plan proceeds according to schedule, the company may soon become one of the biggest non-financial corporate owners of Bitcoin in the next two years.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins its trading day, bitcoin BTC is trading above $104,500 and, despite a possible looming war in the Middle East, has been relatively flat on the day with negligible market movement. Indeed, for the last full week, BTC is only down 2%, according to CoinDesk market data . Analysts are debating whether the crypto market’s current stillness is a sign of strength or if something more precarious is afoot. Three new reports this week from CryptoQuant , Glassnode , and trading firm Flowdesk all point to the same surface conditions: low volatility, tight price action, and subdued on-chain activity. Additionally, retail participation has waned, and institutional players, from ETFs to whales, are now shaping the structure of flows. But it’s CryptoQuant that’s flashing the most urgent warning. In its June 19 report, CryptoQuant argued that BTC could soon revisit $92,000 support or even fall as low as $81,000 if demand continues to deteriorate. Spot demand is still increasing, but well below trend. ETF flows have dropped by more than 60% since April, while whale accumulation has halved. Short-term holders, who are usually newer market participants, have shed approximately 800,000 BTC since late May. Their demand momentum indicator, which tracks directional buying strength across key cohorts, is now reading negative 2 million BTC, the lowest in CryptoQuant’s dataset. Glassnode , however, sees the same signals and arrives at a far less dire conclusion. In its weekly on-chain update, the firm acknowledges that the Bitcoin blockchain is “quiet,"" meaning transaction counts are down, fees are minimal, and miner revenue is subdued. However, this suggests that it may not be a weakness, but rather a reflection of the network’s evolution. On-chain settlement volume remains high, but it’s concentrated in large-value transfers, suggesting the chain is increasingly being used by institutions and whales. The derivatives market, Glassnode notes, now dwarfs on-chain activity, with futures and options volumes regularly exceeding spot by 7x–16x. That shift has brought more sophisticated hedging, better collateral practices, and a more mature, if less frenetic, market structure. France-based Flowdesk, a market maker and trading firm, has views that fall somewhere in between. While noting thinning altcoin flows and flat market-making volumes, its June 19 update describes the market as “coiled,” not cracking. Flowdesk highlights a surge in tokenized assets, such as Gold-backed XAUT (up 56% in volume), stablecoin growth, and increasing RWA activity. To them, low volatility may simply be the calm before a directional breakout, which is not necessarily downwards. But in the end, no one seems to hold a reliable map for what’s ahead. Even Polymarket bettors aren't sure as there is a near equal chance of BTC dropping to $90K in June or moving up to $115K-120K. One thing is for sure: the tug-of-war between bullish institutional activities and waning retail demand potentially opens bitcoin up to dramatic moves on either side of the trade, which will likely dictate the market’s next chapter. Presto Research Says Crypto Treasury Companies Have Less Risk Than You Think A new report from Presto Research argues that Crypto Treasury Companies (CTCs), such as Strategy and Metaplanet, are not just leveraged bitcoin ETFs, but a new form of financial engineering with less risk than many investors assume. Strategy’s latest raise, which raised nearly $1 billion via perpetual preferred shares , shows how BTC’s volatility can be used to an issuer’s advantage. These securities, along with convertible bonds and at-the-market equity sales, allow CTCs to fund aggressive crypto accumulation without triggering margin risk. Presto points out that Strategy’s BTC is unpledged and Metaplanet’s bonds are unsecured, meaning collateral liquidation, the primary trigger in past crypto blowups like Celsius and Three Arrows, is largely absent here. That does not eliminate risk, but it changes the nature of it. The real challenge, Presto argues, is not crypto exposure itself but the discipline to manage dilution, cash flow, and capital timing. Metaplanet’s “bitcoin yield” metric, which measures BTC per fully diluted share, reflects that focus on shareholder value. As long as CTCs can manage the financial mechanics behind their accumulation strategies, they will earn NAV premiums just like high-growth companies in traditional markets. But if they miscalculate, the same tools that fuel their rise could accelerate their fall. Semler Scientific Maps Bold Plan to Hold 105,000 BTC by 2027 Semler Scientific (Nasdaq: SMLR) has unveiled one of the most aggressive bitcoin accumulation roadmaps in corporate history, announcing plans to hold 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, 42,000 by 2026, and a staggering 105,000 by the close of 2027. The California-based medical device maker, which pivoted to a bitcoin treasury strategy last year, is effectively trying to increase its current bitcoin stash of 4,449 coins by more than two fold over the next 30 months. It plans to do so using a mix of equity raises, debt financing, and operational cash flow. There aren't specific details of how the company plans to fund the buy. Hwever, historically Semler’s primary mechanism for acquiring bitcoin was selling new shares under its at-the-market (ATM) program, which relies on the company trading at a premium to its net asset value (NAV). According to data from Strategy-Tracker , Semler’s mNAV currently sits at 0.859x, meaning the market values the firm’s equity lower than its BTC holdings, which could be cutting off its ability to raise accretive capital. How this dynamic plays out, would be worth watching as the firm initiates more bitcoin buying. Even as bitcoin has surged to all-time highs above $100,000, Semler shares are down nearly 40% on the year. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin remains stuck below $105K despite strong ETF inflows, with repeated resistance at $105,150 and signs of institutional accumulation offset by short-term bearish momentum and macro volatility. ETH: Ethereum found support at $2,490 after a high-volume selloff broke key levels, with the price consolidating in a tight range amid geopolitical tensions and macro uncertainty, signaling potential for a breakout if resistance at $2,510 is cleared. Gold: Gold hovered near $3,366 on Thursday, little changed as escalating geopolitical tensions offset pressure from the Fed’s hawkish stance, while platinum retreated after hitting a near 10-year high; U.S. markets remained closed for Juneteenth. Nikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei 225 opened 0.24% higher Friday as Asia-Pacific markets mostly rose ahead of China’s loan prime rate decision and amid ongoing Israel-Iran tensions.

While Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Injective (INJ), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) continue to dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as a strategic buy with breakout potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: 2025’s Most-Watched List With Upside ROI Outlook MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining serious traction among analysts, earning a place alongside Solana, XRP, and Bitcoin on 2025’s most-watched gainers list . With a series of high-impact upgrades and strong breakout activity, the project is drawing growing attention from experienced investors and strategic buyers. Its early positioning, combined with rising momentum, signals long-term potential that many believe could rival—and even surpass—larger-cap competitors. Now widely seen as a “high-conviction buy under $0.01,” MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a preferred entry point for those seeking asymmetric upside in a crowded market. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Outlook as Institutional Demand Grows Ethereum is poised for a strong June, with price predictions targeting a reclaim of the $2,800–$2,900 range if bullish momentum continues. Institutional buying and DeFi utility are driving optimism, and as ETH consolidates, some investors are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture early-stage growth alongside blue-chip stability. XRP: Lawsuit Decision and ETF Hopes Drive Volatility XRP is trading near $0.54, with investor focus on the pivotal June 16 Ripple lawsuit decision and ongoing ETF speculation. A favorable outcome could push XRP above $0.65, but regardless, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention as a fresh alternative for those seeking new alpha in a volatile market. Injective (INJ): Uptrend Continues with Strong Forecasts INJ remains in an uptrend, with June forecasts projecting prices as high as $16.63. As traders look for the next big mover, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s parabolic presale growth is drawing comparisons to early-stage INJ, especially among those seeking high potential returns. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Steady Growth Amid Market Optimism Bitcoin Cash is trading above $500, with a solid 18% weekly gain and forecasts for continued strength into July. As BCH solidifies its position, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as a complementary play for investors seeking both established and emerging opportunities. Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE, Ethereum, and XRP are capturing the spotlight as Bitcoin insiders and traders seek the next breakout story in 2025. With strong fundamentals and growing support, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a top contender in the altcoin race.

You’re not alone. With so many options, knowing where to look can be tough. In this article, we explore some of the most promising top altcoins for 2025. We’ll break down what makes BlockDAG, Monero, Aave, and Celestia stand out. Each of these projects tackles real issues in crypto with fresh ideas. Whether you’re just getting started or you’ve been around crypto for a while, these coins offer clear reasons to pay attention. We’ll highlight features, growth signs, and what each brings to the table. Let’s dive in and make sense of these top altcoins so you can follow opportunities with confidence. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Where Simplicity Meets Strong Growth BlockDAG is making waves as a user‑friendly and simple option among top altcoins. Its main draw is the X1 Miner App, which lets anyone mine by just tapping on their phone. No complex setup, no energy cost worries, no tech hurdles. It’s that simple. The app has already welcomed over 2 million people, many of them brand new to cryptocurrency. All they need is a smartphone, and they can start earning. So far, BlockDAG has raised $312 million in its presale. It is now in Batch 29, priced at $0.0276 per coin. Early supporters from Batch 1 have seen a fantastic 2,660% return on their money. To date, 22.7 billion coins have been sold. And here’s a bonus: the frozen price of $0.0018 is still available until June 20. This makes it even more accessible right now. This project stands out because it combines ease of use with real early‑stage upside. For those watching the top altcoins, BlockDAG’s figures and mobile approach help it capture attention. It reduces friction for newcomers and could appeal to a much wider audience. Its current batch price and the strong performance so far give a clear view into its momentum. BlockDAG offers both simplicity and scale in a crypto world that often feels complicated. 2. Monero (XMR): Privacy-Centred and Hard to Trace Monero is known as the leading privacy coin among the top altcoins. It hides the sender, receiver, and amount in each transaction. That makes it ideal for anyone who values stealth and control over their data. Unlike coins with public ledgers, Monero masks details so outsiders can’t trace transactions. This feature has earned it respect among users who want serious privacy. As digital surveillance grows, Monero stands as a shield. If you want to send money without exposing your identity or amounts, this coin delivers. Its strong privacy makes it unique and valuable. Many see it as essential in a world where data is constantly tracked. With user privacy becoming a hot topic, Monero stays relevant and powerful. 3. Aave (AAVE): Leading the Charge in DeFi Aave leads the way in the DeFi space and ranks high among top altcoins for good reason. It lets users lend their crypto to earn interest or borrow by using holdings as collateral. No banks, no middlemen. Everything runs on the Ethereum blockchain, using shared pools of funds. One standout feature is “flash loans.” These let users borrow and return money within one transaction. It sounds complex, but it opens doors for smart traders and programmers. Aave’s platform is open source, and its tools have gained strong traction in the decentralised finance world. It helps people earn passive returns or access capital without a traditional loan. As DeFi grows, Aave stands out as one of the most trusted and innovative platforms. 4. Celestia (CEL): Scaling Blockchain with Modular Design Celestia is a newcomer with a big idea: to solve blockchain scaling. It does so by separating how transactions are reached (consensus) from how they’re run (execution). This “modular” setup is different from older systems that try to do everything together. By splitting tasks, Celestia can handle more activity without slowing down. Developers can build apps without worrying about bottlenecks. This makes Celestia a fresh pick among top altcoins focused on next‑gen architecture. It supports more volume while keeping things secure and decentralised. If you’re curious when thinking about blockchain’s future, Celestia offers a smart route forward. Final Thoughts Crypto is a fast‑moving space, but some names keep standing out. BlockDAG brings simplicity with strong early growth. Monero covers privacy in a crowded field. Aave redefines finance without banks. Celestia builds a powerful foundation for future apps. These top altcoins each have clear strengths and offer thoughtful paths forward. Whether you’re new or experienced, they highlight different parts of the crypto puzzle. Keep an eye on them, you might find exactly what fits your goals among the top altcoins in this exciting digital world.

According to market watcher Titan of Crypto, the story isn’t over yet. Related Reading: Tether Enforces Freeze On $12 Million In Tron Funds Over Illicit Activity Bitcoin slipped just 6% from its all‑time high of $112,000, but some analysts pointed to a cooling relative strength index (RSI) and warned of a top. Titan’s take flips that view on its head, arguing that we’re still deep in the meat of the bull cycle. Fractal Cycles Keep Running Titan pointed to a clear pattern in Bitcoin’s last two cycles. Each cycle began with roughly 13 monthly bars—about 396 days—of steep decline. In 2014–15, Bitcoin fell from $1,240 to $161 over that span. Prices then rallied for 35 bars (1,065 days) to hit $19,800 in December 2017. The same 13‑bar slide followed by 35 bars of gains played out again after 2018, ending at $69,000 in 2021. #Bitcoin Bull Market Entering Final Phase 🏁 As in previous cycles: ~1 year of bear market, followed by ~3 years of expansion.$BTC looks to be in the final leg but not done yet. pic.twitter.com/MGre5ahz3P — Titan of Crypto (@Washigorira) June 18, 2025 Momentum And RSI In Focus Some analysts flagged a weakening RSI as a sign that Bitcoin has peaked. That metric can’t be ignored—when momentum wanes, price often takes a breather. Titan’s chart lays down the time‑based pattern, but RSI, trading volume, and on‑chain data give a live read on demand. Bull Run Still Has Room Based on reports, the current cycle’s bullish phase kicked off in January 2023 and sits in the 29th bar this month. Bitcoin has climbed 530% since the start of that run. If history holds, we’ve got at least five more monthly bars of uptrend before the rally tops out around November. Earlier studies even point to a wedge breakout that could send price to about $137,000 before any serious pullback. Big Names See Higher Peaks Samson Mow, the CEO of Jan3, foresees Bitcoin tearing past the $1 million mark in a fierce upswing, powered by government rollouts, sovereign bond issuances, and an urgent surge in ‘hyperbitcoinization’ before seeing any real correction. Raoul Pal (Real Vision), the former Goldman Sachs executive, shares a familiar bullish view. He has laid out scenarios where Bitcoin hits $1 million by 2030, based on monetary stimulus and limited supply. Related Reading: Iran’s Top Crypto Hub Loses $82 Million To Hackers With Israeli Links—Details Strategy’s Michael Saylor has also said Bitcoin could skyrocket to between $500,000 and $1 million before seeing any real correction. These big names in the crypto industry highlight growing institutional inflows and a looming supply squeeze after the next halving as fuel for an even higher peak. This rally isn’t just a rerun of what we saw in 2017 or 2021. Bitcoin today moves with ETFs, big‑ticket corporate buys, and more traders watching on‑chain signals than ever before. Meanwhile, the latest outlook by CoinCodex sees Bitcoin climbing 5.73% to hit roughly $110,732 by July 19, 2025. Right now, technical signals point to a Neutral mood, while the Fear & Greed Index sits at 57—squarely in Greed territory.

It’s the first time a USDC wallet has been integrated into this ecosystem on the XRP Ledger, which means people can send and receive USDC directly in and out of XRP Ledger wallets. It links one of the top stablecoins with one of the fastest and most efficient blockchain networks. Introduced by Circle and supported by fully reserved US dollars, USDC has evolved into an accessible stablecoin for payments, trading, and DeFi. Operating on the XRPL also confers the speed and scalability required to access even more users globally. This will further enhance Uphold’s speed , fee, and interoperability-centric multi-asset platform position. Now, people can smoothly and conveniently send money for remittance, personal finance, or business. It’s also a good tool for developers and entrepreneurs. They can develop apps or services that accept USDC on XRPL, making blockchain-based financial tools more accessible. New regulation strengthens trust in USDC and stablecoins The strategic combination comes at a time of significant change in the regulatory environment in the US. On June 18, American legislators introduced the Genius Act , which was designed to establish a federal framework for regulating fiat-backed stablecoins such as USDC. The Genius Act includes better licensing, disclosure, and reserve requirement parameters. The act should boost legitimate companies like Circle, the issuers of which will be seen as more credible and trustworthy in mainstream eyes. This institutional maturity is the introduction of USDC on XRPL by Uphold. Businesses receiving that guidance will have a clearer direction on complying with US law and financial best practices when using stablecoins. As the regulation progresses, stablecoins like USDC will evolve from tools for crypto traders to trusted components of the global financial infrastructure for payments, fintech, payroll, and treasury operations. This might even push more adoption of XRPL as a network for regulated digital assets. XRP ledger hits key deflationary milestone Meanwhile, the XRP Ledger nears an imminent epoch of massive deflation. More than 13.8 million XRP were burned this way as of June 2025. This burn has been hard-coded in the XRPL protocol from the very beginning. Each time you make a transaction, there is a small fee, and that fee is not paid out to miners or validators but is burned, thus effectively taking XRP out of circulation. This would eventually reduce supply and contribute to value growth and longevity. While 14 million XRP is not much when you consider that there are 100 billion that will ever exist at one point, it can illustrate a steadfast network use case, not to mention the continued working deflationary nature. Fast-finalizing, low-cost, green, deflationary aspects of XRPL provide an attractive venue to issue stablecoins and tokenize assets. Now that USDC is on XRPL through Uphold, you have a stable digital dollar and a network with no speed, efficiency, or value shortages. For developers, that also unlocks the ability to release payment applications, remittance tools, and DeFi protocols, which merge stable value with the speed of blockchain.

Over the past week, Dogecoin has dropped 12%, with a sharp 6% decline in just 24 hours as U.S. regulators delayed altcoin ETF approvals and geopolitical tensions rattled markets. While this decline raises questions over which crypto to buy now, many investors are turning their attention to projects with stronger fundamentals. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of such stand-outs, a trending crypto DeFi token with a price of less than a dollar that has a solid roadmap and 20x potential, and it is a game changer when searching to uncover the next big cryptocurrency. At present, despite being on phase-5 of its presale, MUTM has already received more than 10.8 million and it has drawn close to 12,200 investors due to its scarce price of only 0.03. Mutuum Finance Reinvents DeFi Lending with a Dual-Model Approach Mutuum Finance is raising the bar for decentralized lending by introducing a next-generation protocol built on a dual-model system that blends Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending mechanisms. In the P2C model automated smart contracts manage lending pools with dynamically adjusted interest rates based on market activity. This ensures stable returns for lenders and reliable borrowing terms bringing more predictability and safety to the lending process. Meanwhile the P2P model eliminates middlemen altogether enabling borrowers and lenders to interact directly. This setup is ideal for volatile assets offering greater flexibility and control over terms and risk management. By combining the strengths of both models Mutuum Finance delivers an unmatched mix of efficiency decentralization and adaptability, setting a new benchmark in the DeFi ecosystem. Presale Phase 5 Gathers Pace The presale of the Mutuum Finance is now at Phase 5, and the pace is snowballing. What makes up the project a fast-spreading topic of discussion is that more than 12,200 investors have already participated in the project, and almost $11 million has been raised. Stablecoin Backed by CertiK Audit Adds Layer of Trust To further nail down its platform, Mutuum Finance is planning to introduce a fully collateralized stablecoin pegged to the USD on the Ethereum network. The stablecoin, currently in development, is designed as stable compared to the unstable algorithmic cryptocurrencies and designed to remain pegged even through the volatility in the market, ensuring a reliable and safe means of exchange and saving asset. In order to assure the utmost quality of trust and security, the Mutuum stablecoin itself and the entire ecosystem of the project have been thoroughly audited by the CertiK security firm that is among the most recognizable security firms operating in the blockchain. This audit provides the clear development process and the orientation towards long-term stability and user safety of this project. While Dogecoin continues to slide, now down 12% in the past week and trading near $0.17, investors looking for high-upside opportunities are pivoting toward more fundamentally sound projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Already, Mutuum has raised over $10.8 million from 12,200+ investors during its Phase 5 presale, with the token still priced at just $0.03. Backed by a CertiK-audited ecosystem, a dual-model P2P and P2C lending protocol, and an upcoming fully collateralized stablecoin, MUTM is shaping up to be a serious force in DeFi. With 20x to 44x ROI potential projected by analysts, this could be the most promising DeFi launch of 2025. Secure your stake in Mutuum Finance now before the next price increase hits.

While XRP, Solana, Kaspa, and TRON continue to play key roles in the current cycle, a growing number of experts are now calling attention to MAGACOINFINANCE — pointing to its strategic positioning and untapped return potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Project Gaining Quiet Power MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves behind the scenes. While it started as a meme-fueled idea, it has rapidly transformed into one of the most structurally sound projects on analysts’ dashboards. The token’s capped supply of 170 billion has removed concerns around inflation or stealth dilution, and staking has already gone live — driving behavioral shifts among early investors. What’s drawing analyst attention now is the alignment between fundamentals and behavior: Wallet activity shows long-term accumulation Smart contract audited by HashEx Staking inflows are rising without quick exits Community entry points are timed ahead of major exposure Some traders are using the limited-time PATRIOTS100X bonus offer as an extra edge — locking in positions now before larger market discovery hits. XRP Nears Regulatory Breakthrough XRP’s legal path is finally becoming clearer. The SEC and Ripple have jointly filed to release $125 million from escrow, a major sign that settlement is on the table. This move, coupled with growing speculation about an XRP ETF, has given traders reason to monitor the token closely. Though recent price action reflected broader market sell-offs, sentiment around XRP is improving fast — and analysts are noting its potential for sudden upside if clarity arrives soon. SOL, TRX, and KAS Maintain Strong Foundations Solana (SOL) continues to rank as one of the most used blockchains by daily active users. While no single update has made headlines lately, Solana’s strong ecosystem and consistent technical improvements keep it firmly in trader watchlists. TRON (TRX) is showing stable growth, with particular traction in the stablecoin and dApp segments. Founder Justin Sun remains active, and community engagement continues to support on-chain expansion. Kaspa (KAS) is flying under the radar but remains popular among infrastructure-focused investors. Its quiet development cycle is viewed by some as an ideal setup for long-term positioning — especially for those looking for undiscovered value plays. Final Thoughts As XRP flirts with regulatory breakthroughs and SOL, TRX, and KAS stay on their individual paths, MAGACOINFINANCE is capturing analyst attention for all the right reasons. The foundation is set, momentum is building, and the market is beginning to take notice.

On Thursday, June 19, Polymarket, an American crypto-based prediction platform, gave the GENIUS Act an 89% chance of passing both the US Senate and House. The platform also predicted the president would sign it into law before 2026. This came just a few days after a key vote in the Senate and a recent public push from President Donald Trump to get the bill to his desk quickly. Notably, the Polymarket bet appeared to have gone live around 18 hours after the Senate passed the bill in a 68-30 vote. Polymarket’s 89% odds on the fate of the GENIUS Act sparks controversy in the crypto space Following the Polymarket odds, it is not yet clear if the bill would have strong enough support to pass the House in its current form, or whether lawmakers would append amendments to ease concerns about Trump’s ties to the crypto space, including World Liberty Financial’s stablecoin, USD1. Additionally, several senators voted against a similar change before the final passage of the GENIUS Act, which sent the bill to the House. Depending on the bill’s final version, one possible outcome is that it could open the floodgates for US companies to issue their own stablecoins to settle payments. For instance, Tech giants like Apple and Google were said to be considering their own tokens. Concerning this, two United States senators sent questions to Meta about whether the company had similar plans once the bill potentially becomes law. On the other hand, Trump has indicated he would sign the GENIUS Act “with no add-ons” if the House were to pass it swiftly. In addition, Republicans hold a narrow majority in the chamber and might soon have to vote on a bill to create a framework for a crypto market structure. The CLARITY Act, a proposal the committee passed last week, would clarify US financial regulators’ responsibility over digital assets. Meanwhile, the Polymarket odds do not necessarily predict whether United States legislators will pass the bill or President Trump will give it his signature to become a law. Instead, the prediction market displays how much crypto enthusiasts are willing to bet on one or more specific outcomes. French Hill expresses hope in the CLARITY Act to make the US a global leader in digital assets The US House Committee on Financial Services approved a crypto market structure bill, the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act. This assured crypto enthusiasts that it will soon head to the full House for a vote. House Financial Services Committee lawmakers voted 32 to 19 to send the CLARITY Act for a full floor vote. This came after the House Agriculture Committee advanced the bill in a 47 to 6 vote. Congressman French Hill, who sponsored the bill, right after the vote was successful, stated that this is the second bill that Bryan Steil has skillfully led, acknowledging first with stablecoins and then with a market structure bill. Steil, the chairman of the House Committee on Financial Services Crypto Subcommittee, acknowledged that it was a big step forward and was pleased to see that Hill’s act had made it through the House committees. Hill mentioned that this is a chance for America to take charge of the future of Web3 on the internet, especially in financial services that use tokenized payments. If the CLARITY Act and GENIUS Act are approved, they could bring a major change to cryptocurrency rules in the US, making the crypto world stronger.

As the broader market enters a decisive summer phase, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention with its high-energy pre-sale, forward-thinking tokenomics, and rapidly expanding community. While major players like XRP, Cardano (ADA), and TRON (TRX) continue to generate news, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE’s swift rise that’s prompting comparisons to the early trajectories of the cycle’s most successful altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analysts Forecast Major Growth in 2025 Altcoin Market MAGACOIN FINANCE has made a strong debut in the crypto space, positioning itself as a standout project for 2025 . With a capped supply and politically driven branding, it’s generating significant market anticipation. Analysts are already eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE as a potential disruptor in the altcoin landscape. The exclusive pre-sale—accessible only through the official website—offers a 100% bonus for contributions using PATRIOTS100X . XRP: Lawsuit Resolution and ETF Hopes Dominate June XRP is at a critical inflection point, trading near $2.15 after a recent pullback, as the market awaits the final Ripple lawsuit decision on June 16. As XRP’s volatility attracts speculative capital, some traders are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE, seeking early exposure to the next potential breakout. Cardano (ADA): Stabilizing and Eyeing Recovery ADA is consolidating around $0.75 after a correction from its early-year highs. With ecosystem upgrades like the Chang Hard Fork and Hydra scaling, Cardano’s fundamentals remain strong. If ADA maintains support above $0.70, a move toward $0.80–$0.84 is possible in June. ADA’s measured optimism is echoed by those backing MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is also seen as a growth play with robust fundamentals. TRON (TRX): Bullish Momentum and Price Surge TRON is forecasted to rise as much as 26% this month, with prices potentially reaching $0.35 by late June. Technical indicators point to sustained bullish momentum, and as TRX rallies, many traders are looking for similar high-upside opportunities—putting MAGACOIN FINANCE firmly on their radar. Solana (SOL): Record Retail Growth and Ecosystem Expansion Solana continues to impress with over 11.6 million wallets holding at least 0.1 SOL, a record for the network. Trading near $149, SOL’s technical setup is at an inflection point, with $128 as key support and $160 as breakout resistance. The highly anticipated Solaxy ICO and ongoing ecosystem launches are keeping SOL in the headlines, while MAGACOIN FINANCE’s momentum is drawing similar grassroots enthusiasm. Conclusion As Solana, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE lead the charge in June 2025, investors are watching closely for the next big breakout. With strong communities and bullish catalysts, these projects are shaping the narrative for the summer’s crypto market.

As BlockDAG (BDAG) develops further, its chances for strong growth in 2025 seem clear, especially when compared to what Pi Network and Near Protocol are doing. BlockDAG X-Series Miners Set to Ship to Early Testers BlockDAG is moving forward as it gets ready to ship its X-Series miners. The network will ship the first 100 units of the X30 and X100 models to a selected group of early testers. The shipment of X30 and X100 miners will begin on July 7, while X10 miners will ship from August 15. These first shipments are important for testing how the miners work in real situations. This step marks a key moment in BlockDAG’s push to bring decentralized mining to its network. The move from testing to real-world use is a major step in BlockDAG’s growth. The X-Series miners are designed to be efficient and eco-friendly. They avoid the large machines and high power costs usually seen in crypto mining. This makes mining easier to access and better for more people. BlockDAG’s progress is also shown in its presale numbers. It has raised $312 million so far. The current batch 29 is priced at $0.0276, with a 2,660% rise in ROI since batch one. The reduced coin price of $0.0018 is still available until June 20. As testing begins and feedback is gathered, BlockDAG is working to build its place in the crypto space. This move to live use is an important step toward making decentralized mining work within its system. Mobile Mining Drives Pi Network’s Growing Popularity Pi Network is gaining wide attention thanks to its mobile-first mining system. Users can earn Pi on their phones without using much battery or needing costly equipment. This simple and user-friendly method has helped the project build a strong and expanding community. As a result, Pi is now one of the most talked-about names in crypto today. Looking at Pi Network’s price outlook, many expect the Pi Coin to rise once the project moves fully to its mainnet. As user activity grows, the coin’s supply in the market will also increase, which may boost its overall value. With growing interest and plans for an exchange listing, some believe Pi’s price could go up sharply. Excitement around the network keeps building, pointing to the chance of a major price rise soon. Near Protocol Moves Up as Key Price Levels Hold Near Protocol has been showing strong price action recently. New technical signals suggest the price could jump by 30 percent. This comes as the project’s fast and low-cost blockchain continues to gain users, making it stand out in the world of decentralized apps. A key point in this trend is the support level near $2.00, which has stayed strong over the past few weeks. The price bounced from this zone and moved toward $2.35 to $2.40, breaking through a past barrier. If it holds above that, it might keep rising, with the next key levels between $2.80 and $3.00. BlockDAG Focuses on Scalable Mining for the Future Looking ahead to 2025, Pi Network and Near Protocol both show solid growth paths, but BlockDAG is shaping its own route through efficient and open mining. BlockDAG is now moving from its testing stage into live use, with its X-Series miners playing a central role. While Pi and Near explore their own strengths, BlockDAG is offering a mining setup that cuts down on cost and is easier for more people to use. As all three projects grow and change, BlockDAG is working toward a steady place in the crypto world through its focus on a better way to mine.

At 02:26 UTC the TradingView snapshot captured DOGE changing hands at $0.16979, fractionally lower on the session, while the 14-period relative-strength index sat at 35.72, just north of classical oversold territory. Dogecoin Prints Bullish Divergence The most striking feature of the graphic is a sequence of regular bullish divergences—price sets progressively lower lows even as the RSI traces higher troughs. Cantonese Cat illustrates three such inflection points: the first in August 2024, the second in March and April 2025 and the latest in mid-June. Historically, the first signal preceded the parabolic autumn rally that vaulted DOGE from the high-$0.05 area to an intraday peak just shy of $0.23, a nearly 300% advance. The March divergence ushered in a 100 percent rebound back to the $0.26 zone, a former support now acting as overhead resistance. Related Reading: Dogecoin Looks Like ‘It Wants To Play Dead’—Again “DOGE daily – Bullish divergence with RSI,” Cantonese Cat wrote in his post, letting the annotated arrows speak louder than prose. A schematic inserted on the right-hand side of the chart underlines the textbook definition: in the highlighted quadrant, price slopes downward while momentum slopes upward, a configuration often interpreted as buyers quietly absorbing supply. Descending Channel And Key Support Line The current structural context lends weight to the signal. Since topping out in November above $0.48, price is retracing inside a descending channel. Within that broader channel, Dogecoin is now retesting a former down-sloping resistance line—which provided stiff resistance throughout March and April this year—that it finally broke in early May and is now acting as crucial support near $0.163. Just below this back-test sits the multi-year ascending trendline which now sits close to $0.142. Should both of those levels falter, the true lower boundary of the descending channel waits a fraction lower around $0.139, giving bulls only a narrow buffer of roughly three cents to defend. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Enters ‘Alarm Zone,’ Major Move Coming? From a Fibonacci perspective, the 0.786 retracement at $0.1826—coupled with the 20- and 50-day exponential moving averages as well as the channel midline at $0.172—forms the first ceiling that must be cleared to shift near-term momentum. A breakout above that area would expose the 0.618 level at $0.247 and the 100-day EMA. Successive hurdles then stack at the 0.5 retracement ($0.292), the 0.382 ($0.338), and the 0.236 ($0.3939), each corresponding to prior congestion zones during the winter advance. Volume has begun to taper as price approaches support, while the 14-period RSI remains anchored in the mid-30s—still technically oversold, but showing a slight uptick that mirrors the bullish divergence Cantonese Cat flagged. For bears, a decisive daily close beneath the multi-year trendline would invalidate that divergence setup and likely drive DOGE toward the horizontal liquidity band between $0.135 and $0.13, with a final capitulation target around $0.10—site of last October’s base.

On Thursday, Italy’s economy minister , Giancarlo Giorgetti, called the bloc’s current budget system “stupid and senseless” and said it needed to be overhauled to give member states more leeway to boost military spending without fear of financial penalties. Those comments came as the eurozone finance ministers assembled in a critical meeting in Luxembourg, where the bloc is fighting over whether to maintain a balanced budget or step up its investment in Europe’s security while being urged to ease its focus on fiscal discipline. Most recently, the European Commission has debuted new clauses permitting greater leeway in the bloc’s fiscal rules, or the Stability and Growth Pact. The goal is to allow governments to expand defense spending in the face of growing security threats, particularly from Russia. Members would agree to be permitted to increase their defense budgets by 1.5% of GDP annually over four years. This holds even if their national budget deficits break the EU’s longstanding 3% of GDP limit, which usually prompts correction. However, this new leeway would only be relevant for countries not already under EU disciplinary procedures over debt. It would leave out Italy, the country now receiving all the attention. “It is essential to find ways to bring these rules up to date with the crisis we are experiencing so that they do not seem stupid and senseless,” the minister said in a statement issued by his staff on the sidelines of a meeting with Eurozone peers in Luxembourg. He insisted that Italy was being punished for its past deficits, even as it tried to play its part in Europe’s collective defense. Rome resists a flexibility clause to protect its financial reputation Italy has pledged to reduce its budget deficit from 3.4% of GDP in 2024 to 2.8% by 2026. Embracing the EU’s new defense spending flexibility might support NATO efforts, but would make it impossible for Italy to achieve that fiscal goal. Two of the Italian government’s most senior figures seconded his concerns, and they also said that Rome wanted to avoid taking any measures that could put its relationship with the financial markets under pressure. Investors have noticed Italy’s policing of its budget, and credit rating upgrades in recent months have reflected that progress. In May, Moody’s upgraded Italy’s credit outlook to “positive.” That came just after S&P Global raised the country’s credit rating to “BBB+” from “BBB,” a show of confidence in Italy’s economic management. Giorgetti cautioned that applying different criteria to different countries risked dividing the EU at a time when it needed to come together. Italy pushes EU to fund defense through joint debt Giorgetti said it was more necessary than ever to have a common financial capacity to address Europe’s growing defense needs. He added that Italy wanted the European Union to borrow jointly to increase military spending, arguing that this approach would share the financial burden across all member states instead of placing excessive pressure on individual national budgets. However, such a plan would require the approval of other EU nations, which is a prospect that looks uncertain. Fiscally conservative countries such as Germany and the Netherlands have long opposed the idea of mutualized EU debt and argued that each country should be responsible for its finances. For countries like Italy, it has become a fiscal juggling exercise between meeting NATO accession commitments, respecting EU budget rules, and keeping financial markets on the side.

Qubetics Ranks in the Best Cryptos to Buy This Month with 4349% Projected Gain,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-xrp-qubetics-ranks-in-the-best-cryptos-to-buy-this-month-with-4349-projected-gain/,"XRP remains a key reference point in the crypto sector. As the native token of the XRP Ledger, it once reached a high of $3.84, becoming a core asset for global financial transfers and blockchain adoption. Early community members saw significant returns, but with XRP now trading 43% below its all-time high and its lowest price recorded over a decade ago, the early wealth-building phase has passed. Many buyers joined XRP after its rapid climb, only to see modest or delayed gains. This shift has intensified the search for the best cryptos to buy this month. Buyers are now focused on projects that combine practical value with growth potential. The crypto market rewards those who act early, and recent trends show that established coins may not always offer the same rapid growth that once defined the sector. Qubetics ($TICS) now draws attention as a project that meets today’s rising standards. Its ongoing crypto presale provides an alternative for those seeking strong utility, transparent economics, and a fair entry point. The platform’s focus on advanced features is positioning it among the best cryptos to buy this month, particularly for those looking to participate in the next phase of blockchain development. Qubetics: Practical Interoperability for a Connected Crypto Sector Qubetics is built on the principle of interoperability. This allows users, businesses, and platforms to move digital assets and data across multiple blockchains without friction. In a world where many networks remain siloed, this approach addresses major challenges for both enterprises and individuals. For example, a global logistics company managing payments across various countries often struggles with incompatible networks. With Qubetics’ interoperability, cross-border settlements can occur instantly, regardless of the original blockchain used. A design studio working with international clients may need to receive and send payments in different cryptocurrencies, Qubetics enables seamless transfers without converting funds or waiting for network approvals. Freelancers, content creators, and e-commerce shops often handle assets on several blockchains. Qubetics makes it possible to manage everything in one place. This not only saves time but also reduces transaction fees and increases operational flexibility. Large enterprises integrating supply chains and procurement across decentralized platforms will find this feature critical, as it ensures consistency and reduces manual intervention. The Qubetics interoperability model is built to scale with real-world demands. Whether it’s connecting DeFi protocols, enabling new payment channels, or streamlining business processes, this feature places Qubetics among the best cryptos to buy this month. The utility for both professionals and enterprises highlights why adoption is growing in the current crypto presale. Final Stage: Qubetics Crypto Presale Reaches $18 Million Milestone Qubetics has entered its final presale phase, Stage 37, offering $TICS tokens at $0.3370. Over 516 million tokens have been sold to a community of more than 28,100 holders, raising $18 million to date. With less than 10 million tokens remaining and supply reduced from 4 billion to 1.36 billion, the focus now shifts to the public, as 38.55% of all tokens are made available for early buyers. The final crypto presale stage presents a clear opportunity: buyers at this point secure tokens ahead of an expected 20% listing surge to $0.40. Market analysts anticipate strong upward movement after listing, with $TICS price projections between $5 and $10 in the months ahead. Scarcity and rising demand are now central to Qubetics’ strategy, ensuring that current participants benefit from market-driven price growth. This structure makes Qubetics stand out among the best cryptos to buy this month. As the token approaches its exchange debut, the ongoing crypto presale is attracting buyers who missed the earliest stages of major crypto projects. Urgency is mounting as the final stage of the presale draws to a close. Qubetics $15,000 Entry: Potential Gains A $15,000 purchase at the current $0.3370 price yields approximately 44,500 $TICS tokens. When $TICS reaches its anticipated listing price of $0.40, those tokens would be worth $17,800, representing a 20% increase on listing alone. If the token rises to $1, that amount grows to $44,500, a 196% return. At $5, the projected value is $222,500. Should Qubetics reach $10, the total climbs to $445,000. Early adopters who joined at Stage 1 for $0.01 are already seeing substantial growth. While the initial round has ended, there is still strong potential for returns for those entering during the final stage of the crypto presale. Time is limited, and the chance for maximum gains remains only while tokens are still available. XRP: From Early Growth to Missed Opportunities XRP’s history is closely linked to the broader development of cryptocurrency. Developed to make global transfers faster and more affordable, the XRP Ledger quickly became recognized for its speed and efficiency. Over the years, the network has seen major upgrades, such as increased transaction throughput and lower fees, which have helped it serve a growing user base. However, the all-time low for XRP was recorded 11 years ago, and its all-time high was set seven years back. Many people joined after these milestones, often seeing only modest or delayed gains compared to those who entered early. Today, XRP remains a respected asset in the digital finance sector. It is still widely used for cross-border payments and innovative financial applications. Recent network upgrades have improved its performance and reliability, while regulatory changes and global adoption trends continue to shape its future. Despite these advancements, the pace of growth for XRP is now more gradual, reflecting its maturity and established market presence. For those aiming for significant returns, the opportunity that once existed with XRP has largely passed. This reality has renewed interest in finding the best cryptos to buy this month, projects that offer both utility and the potential for rapid growth. As the market looks ahead, new options like Qubetics are drawing attention for their promise of practical solutions and early-stage value. The Final Thoughts Market cycles often present new opportunities for those seeking growth. While XRP delivered significant returns in its initial years, today’s market environment demands forward-thinking projects. Qubetics, with its emphasis on interoperability and a transparent presale structure, is now drawing attention among those looking for the best cryptos to buy this month . Current analysis and market participation indicate that Qubetics is building momentum as a community-driven platform with expanding real-world application. As the final stage of the presale continues, interest remains strong. Rather than focusing on past opportunities, the focus shifts to what can be accomplished now, positioning Qubetics as a project to watch in the months ahead.

As a result, traders are redirecting their focus toward altcoins with clearer upside potential. While well-known assets like Polygon, Chainlink, Polkadot, and Uniswap await fresh catalysts, a new contender — MAGACOIN FINANCE — is drawing investor attention with a sharp surge in interest and a uniquely structured approach. MAGACOIN FINANCE Captures Attention With Structural Strength MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly being seen as a serious player in the altcoin space. This is not just another meme-driven surge — it’s a result of credible fundamentals and calculated tokenomics. With a total token supply permanently capped at 170 billion and staking now live, the project has transitioned from hype to high-conviction territory. What’s making analysts take notice is how investor behavior has shifted: On-chain data shows more accumulation than churn Wallet growth is steady without major sell pressure Audited smart contract from HashEx adds confidence No VC manipulation or centralized control Even more compelling, traders now have access to a limited-time bonus under the promo PATRIOTS100X , giving them a strategic edge ahead of broader market discovery. The project’s setup aligns perfectly with what seasoned investors look for — scarcity, utility, and early participation. Polygon (MATIC) Waits for a Technical Catalyst Polygon (MATIC) remains a respected name in scaling solutions, but its market activity has quieted. Despite strong technology and enterprise collaborations, MATIC’s price has struggled to ignite due to lackluster trading volume. Developers continue to build within the Polygon ecosystem, yet short-term traders are increasingly seeking more dynamic assets as MATIC lingers below key resistance levels. Chainlink (LINK) Maintains Stability but Lacks Spark Chainlink (LINK) continues to provide essential oracle services for the blockchain industry. However, LINK’s movement has been largely sideways, with few spikes in volatility to attract high-frequency traders. While it remains a long-term infrastructure play, LINK hasn’t captured breakout momentum — leading some investors to explore more active, high-reward altcoin opportunities. Polkadot (DOT) Focuses on Ecosystem Growth Polkadot (DOT) is progressing steadily, especially with its parachain rollout and multichain interoperability focus. But from a trading standpoint, DOT is currently in a holding pattern. Although fundamentally sound, the token has not seen sharp price movements in recent weeks, and investors are watching to see whether developer traction can translate into renewed market energy. Uniswap (UNI) Navigates Governance Challenges Uniswap (UNI) remains a top decentralized exchange by volume, but its token hasn’t gained much ground. Recent governance proposals and fee debates have added complexity to its investment appeal. While UNI has long-term value due to the protocol’s usage, traders seeking quick upside are looking elsewhere until a new catalyst emerges. Final Thoughts As Bitcoin cools and coins like MATIC, LINK, DOT, and UNI search for renewed traction, MAGACOINFINANCE is moving in the opposite direction — upward. With a locked supply, live staking, and mounting investor confidence, it’s quickly becoming one of the most watched assets of the month.

XRP fell to $2.16, while Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) dropped over 1%. Ethereum (ETH) also dipped 0.7%, giving up its recent gains. XRP is trading around $2.159, down 0.3% today, after failing to hold above the $2.30 resistance zone. After a rally to $2.35, sellers regained control, and pushing the price back toward $2.11. Earlier, XRP had surged above $2.40, exciting traders and fueling hopes of a breakout. But the rally didn’t last. The price fell back near $2.15, turning what looked like a bullish breakout into a fakeout. The brief spike was driven by whale activity, hopes of an SEC settlement, and strong sentiment, but the momentum faded soon. XRP Stuck in a Tight Range, Will It Revisit Lower Levels? Now, XRP is stuck in a narrow range between $2.00 and $2.50. Analysts say a breakout above $2.50 could target $3.50, but if the price drops, it could fall to $1.85 or even lower. Technical indicators like MACD are showing selling pressure. XRP is forming a symmetrical triangle, which often precedes a major move, up or down. To regain momentum, XRP must reclaim $2.206 and break through resistance around $2.18–$2.21. A successful push above $2.236 could open the way to $2.35 and beyond. But if it slips below $2.113, XRP could revisit support levels at $2.02, $1.92, and even $1.83. Over the past month, XRP has traded between $2.05 and $2.40. Several analysts say the current setup resembles the 2017 price action, which led to a massive breakout to all-time highs. XRP’s 2017 Setup Repeating? XRP has been consolidating between $1.90 and $2.90 for nearly 200 days. Analysts like see similarities to the 2017 triangle pattern that led to a 1,300% rally. With an even longer consolidation this time, a similar rally from the $0.63 breakout zone could push XRP to $8–$10. $XRP I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE 2017 UPCOMING RALLY VIBES pic.twitter.com/5joFCPyViK — Mikybull Crypto (@MikybullCrypto) June 16, 2025 Analyst Dark Defender believes XRP is nearing a crucial breakout point.

Analysts and early movers agree that this next stretch could determine who captures significant gains and who gets left watching from the sidelines. If you’re looking to realign your crypto holdings before the next leg up strategically, here are five adjustments worth considering, led by the altcoin that insiders are calling the breakout force of 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Top Pick for 2025’s Altcoin Ascent Among every token vying for attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly establishing itself as the undeniable frontrunner for the next big breakout. Crypto insiders are already moving in, citing vigorous early wallet activity, interest from smart money, and a powerful brand narrative that mirrors the early days of Ethereum and XRP. For investors who missed the rise of Shiba Inu or Dogecoin, this could be the perfect second chance—only this time, the fundamentals are even stronger. MAGACOIN FINANCE is not just riding a trend—it’s driving one. With momentum accelerating daily and analyst forecasts pointing toward massive upside, early positioning could offer asymmetric returns. Some analysts suggest this project may outperform every token in its category during this cycle. And while you’ll never see specific numbers shared, what’s clear is that every stage before has sold out rapidly, reinforcing the urgency for those still waiting to act. The exclusive PATRIOTS100X bonus offer is also generating high-conviction demand from early adopters. Rebalance Toward Layer-1 Giants With Real-World Adoption After MAGACOIN FINANCE, seasoned investors are rotating capital into battle-tested Layer-1s that continue to attract developer ecosystems and institutional attention. Names like Ethereum and Solana are proving their staying power as core infrastructure players. Ethereum’s upcoming scalability upgrades and regulatory optimism are setting the stage for a potential push to new highs. Meanwhile, Solana is drawing attention for its high-speed throughput and rapid institutional onboarding, making it both a viable core holding and a suitable investment option. But remember, these are foundation plays. For explosive upside, investors are still prioritizing early entries like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Add Exposure to Real-World Asset (RWA) Projects Tokenized real-world assets are shaping up to be one of the most promising narratives of late 2025. As regulatory clarity improves globally, RWAs offer a bridge between traditional finance and DeFi. Projects leveraging real estate, treasury bonds, and commodities through blockchain infrastructure are becoming strategic allocations for high-net-worth individuals and institutions. Positioning a small portion of your portfolio in this segment could offer downside protection with upside potential. Reduce Overexposure to High-Supply Meme Coins Meme coins continue to attract volume, but investors are becoming more selective. Tokens with vague utility or hyperinflated supplies may struggle to maintain relevance in the next leg of the bull run. Rather than gambling on the next hype wave, many are opting for early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the branding power of a meme meets disciplined tokenomics and real investor traction. Hedge With Mid-Cap Innovators in AI, Privacy, and Cross-Chain Tech Finally, smart portfolio builders are adding a hedge by diversifying into mid-cap innovators, especially those working at the intersection of AI, privacy, and interoperability. These projects might not yet be household names, but they solve real problems and have the potential to outperform in niche market rallies. Just be sure to avoid overstretching. Keep MAGACOIN FINANCE as your high-conviction anchor and rotate smaller capital into these areas based on personal risk tolerance. Final Thoughts: Don’t Wait for the Headlines By the time most people hear about a token like MAGACOIN FINANCE, the breakout will already be underway. The second half of 2025 could belong to those who act on conviction, not headlines. From high-momentum altcoins to Layer-1 juggernauts and strategic RWA plays, now is the time to realign your portfolio with bold but smart bets. MAGACOIN FINANCE leads that charge confidently, and without compromise.

While established tokens like Cardano (ADA), Ethereum (ETH), Optimism (OP), and VeChain (VET) continue to attract headlines, the stealthy moves by large holders suggest a new wave of momentum is building for MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOINFINANCE: The Breakout Altcoin of the Season MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly outpacing competing tokens this quarter, earning recognition from analysts as one of 2025’s strongest pre-sale contenders. Its accelerating growth has positioned it as a top choice for ROI-driven investors. Notably, a single 72.95 ETH transaction, now the largest early-stage crypto buy of the year—has highlighted rising whale interest and institutional-scale confidence. Combined with its capped token supply, this momentum is driving exceptional demand and establishing MAGACOIN FINANCE as the breakout altcoin of the season. XRP: Volatility and Diversification XRP’s recent whale movements have sparked volatility, with over $60 million in tokens transferred to exchanges and long positions liquidated, raising concerns of a potential price downturn. Despite these jitters, some XRP whales are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE, betting on its early-stage upside as regulatory uncertainty lingers. Solana: Retail Growth and Strategic Accumulation Solana, meanwhile, is seeing record retail growth and a surge in whale wallets, with more than 11.6 million addresses holding at least 0.1 SOL. As the Solaxy ICO and ecosystem expansion drive optimism, SOL whales are strategically adding MAGACOINFINANCE to their portfolios, seeking high-multiple returns ahead of its public listing. ADA, ETH, OP, and VET: Market Outlook Cardano (ADA) is consolidating near $0.64–$0.72, with bullish momentum expected if key support holds. Ethereum (ETH) is targeting a return to the $2,800–$2,900 zone in June, buoyed by strong institutional flows. Optimism (OP) and VeChain (VET) are also forecasted for gains, but the spotlight is now on MAGACOIN FINANCE as the smart money’s top early-stage play. Final Thoughts With XRP and Solana whales leading the charge, MAGACOINFINANCE is quickly becoming the altcoin to watch in 2025. As ADA and ETH continue to show resilience, the growing accumulation of MAGACOIN FINANCE by major players highlights its potential as the next breakout star in the crypto market.

On-Chain Signals Say ‘Watch This Level’,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-bitcoin-gearing-up-for-a-breakout-on-chain-signals-say-watch-this-level/,"Bitcoin continues to trade below its recent all-time high as selling pressure and macroeconomic developments keep the asset in consolidation. At the time of writing, BTC is priced at $104,835, down 2.1% over the past week and around 6.3% off from its peak of $111,814 recorded last month. Despite the broader trend, on-chain data reveals emerging patterns that may signal what could come next in the market. Following the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged in its latest policy meeting, analysts have noted diverging trends in Bitcoin’s price and derivatives market activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Momentum Wobbles—Analyst Predicts Correction Below $94K Derivatives Deleveraging and Liquidation Clusters Shape Price Structure According to Amr Taha, a contributor on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, BTC has been hovering above the $104,000 support zone, where strong demand appears to be absorbing sell pressure. However, Taha pointed out that open interest on Binance has declined, forming lower lows, a sign that the derivatives market is undergoing progressive deleveraging. Taha’s analysis emphasized a technical divergence: while price has remained relatively stable around the $104,000 level, open interest has been falling. This divergence suggests that traders are reducing leveraged positions, possibly due to market uncertainty or as a response to the Fed’s cautious stance. Notably, the $104K region has emerged as a critical liquidity pocket, with data showing long positions being liquidated massively in this area. The dominance of long-side liquidations, with few short liquidations, reflects a flush-out of recent entrants attempting to ride the previous rally. The analyst argued that this deleveraging phase could pave the way for a price rebound if macro conditions remain favorable. Historically, Bitcoin has responded positively to rate pauses, often resuming upward movement when signs of seller exhaustion appear. The stabilization of open interest, combined with reduced liquidations, might act as a foundation for a new upward push in the near term. Bitcoin Whale Activity on Binance and Shifts in Market Behavior In a separate analysis, another CryptoQuant analyst, Oinonen, highlighted growing whale activity on Binance. Since 2023, the whale ratio metric on the exchange has surged dramatically, climbing from 0.08 in mid-2023 to as high as 0.77 in 2025. This shift marks a 400% increase and indicates significant accumulation behavior among large holders. Whale inflows and retention on Binance have generally coincided with longer-term confidence during periods of market volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Channel Break Below $105,000 Sparks Panic, Analysts Predict Further Crashes Moreover, the data shows that during recent episodes of elevated volatility, Binance users have leaned toward holding rather than exiting positions. Inflows to the platform have remained low, particularly from both whales and retail participants, suggesting that market participants are refraining from panic selling and instead are anticipating future price appreciation.

The move follows a key government-backed trial that confirmed it is technically feasible to verify users’ ages and integrate those checks into current digital platforms. However, some tech companies remain skeptical about the reliability of age-detection technologies. With the trial results now in, the legislation is on track to be implemented by the end of the year. Tony Allen raises concerns about protecting those under 16 from social media Following the social media ban, analysts have speculated that the findings could help clear a legal pathway for other jurisdictions to follow Australia’s example. This speculation has been raised in the era when nations around the world struggle to figure out how to shield children from harmful content online. The Age Assurance Technology Trial, which the government commissioned, highlighted that age verification can occur in Australia and be private, strong, and effective. Tony Allen, the project director of the trial, weighed in on the situation. Allen highlighted that no major technological obstacles prevent 16-year-olds from getting social media accounts. Therefore, based on his argument, these solutions are technically possible, can be easily added to current services, and can help protect children’s safety and rights online. The trial examined various approaches and technologies, such as facial scans, inferring a user’s age from his or her behavior, age verification, and parental controls. “We discovered many different methods that work for various situations, but we did not find one solution that would work for every case,” the trial stated. Australia considers imposing bans on social media for minors Australia considered banning social media for kids under 16 after a massive debate consumed the nation. The move sets a standard for other countries worldwide and is one of the most stringent regulations for big tech companies. According to polls, the ban was opposed by privacy campaigners and some child rights groups, but 77% of the population supported it. A parliamentary inquiry was held in 2024 to hear from parents whose children had self-harmed as a result of being bullied on social media. In the meantime, the domestic media campaigned for a ban led by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, the largest newspaper publisher in the country, under the banner “Let Them Be Kids.” This ban was, however, likely to test Australia’s delicate friendship with its most important ally, the United States. Apart from this, the ban had also raised conflict between Australia and some of the tech giants based in the US. Earlier, Australia forced social media platforms to pay news organizations for their content, and now it wants to fine those companies if they do not take down online scams. Elon Musk, the owner of X, commented on the situation. In a post, Musk said this seemed like a backdoor method to manage how all Australians access the internet.

While familiar names like XRP, Solana, Kaspa, and TRON still hold relevance, the spotlight is now swinging toward MAGACOINFINANCE — a fast-emerging altcoin redefining what early conviction looks like. MAGACOINFINANCE: The New Favorite Among Strategic Investors MAGACOINFINANCE is quickly becoming the go-to pick for traders stepping away from stagnant leaders and into high-conviction altcoins. This project isn’t just benefiting from hype — it’s building on real structural decisions that traders trust. With staking now live and a hard-capped supply of 170 billion tokens, the fundamentals are aligning with investor behavior. On-chain activity shows long-hold patterns, reduced churn, and a notable lack of post-entry sell pressure. Combine that with a smart contract audited by HashEx and no centralized control, and you get a token that stands out — not just for what it promises, but for what it’s already proving. For those looking to move early before listings expand visibility, MAGACOINFINANCE is ticking all the boxes. XRP Approaches Critical Regulatory Crossroads XRP is entering a pivotal phase. With the SEC litigation nearing resolution and a joint motion to release $125 million from escrow now on the table, optimism is building. Traders are cautiously hopeful that an end to regulatory uncertainty could drive institutional flows. However, with price action still volatile and split analyst sentiment, some investors are taking profits and exploring newer assets with fewer legal overhangs and a cleaner growth path. Solana (SOL) Holds Strong but Faces Rotation Pressure Solana continues to perform well on-chain, maintaining its position as one of the most active blockchain ecosystems. Its strong technical reputation and thriving developer base give it long-term staying power. But for traders seeking sharper ROI in the short term, SOL’s recent lack of explosive catalysts has prompted a shift toward assets with more immediate upside potential. Kaspa (KAS) Stays Quiet During Broader Repositioning Kaspa (KAS) has been quiet this cycle. Despite its solid infrastructure and consistent development, it hasn’t captured significant market attention in recent weeks. Without new narratives or major announcements to spark volume, traders are slowly redirecting funds toward newer opportunities that offer greater narrative momentum and more pronounced price movement. TRON (TRX) Maintains Stability, But Momentum Fades TRON is stable, functional, and widely used — particularly in the stablecoin space. But for many seasoned traders, its lack of excitement is starting to limit its appeal. TRX remains a useful layer for passive exposure, but in terms of active trading opportunities, it’s being overshadowed by more dynamic plays. Final Thoughts The real movement right now is happening around MAGACOINFINANCE . With seasoned traders already making the switch, the window for early positioning may not stay open for long.

In this edition, Molly, Head of HTX MO Centre, discussed pivotal themes: the legacy of the HTX brand, the platform’s robust performance, user trust-building initiatives, the roadmap for future brand development, and opportunities for women in Web3. She also offered a sneak peek at genuine user benefits planned for HTX’s 12th Anniversary. Molly emphasized that for HTX to become the top choice for both the industry and users, it must adopt a user-centric perspective, act with genuine sincerity, and build trust through steady, practical problem-solving. HTX’s Branding Strategy Q: As HTX promotes a “return to a user-centric perspective” for its 12th anniversary, what is its branding strategy in today’s competitive market? Molly: We don’t rely on nostalgia to capitalize on past glory. An emotional connection must be built on genuine sincerity. This year, our strategy centers on “sentiment + culture”. We’re rewarding long-term users to cultivate a stronger sense of companionship, while nurturing a dynamic and youthful crypto culture. For example, our slogan for May 20th (a Chinese internet-born Valentine’s Day), “You can share anything but your private key” , is designed to make crypto relatable and engaging, helping it reach a broader audience. Establishing a Unique User Moat Q: Amid the fierce competition in marketing and innovation, how will HTX establish a unique user moat? Are there any major marketing campaigns on the horizon? Molly: HTX doesn’t employ gimmicks and values genuine sincerity. We genuinely distribute rewards, and our rules are clearly written. From awarding HTX Affiliates to allocating 70% of rewards to regular users, and adopting the slogan “You have the talent, we have the resources” , HTX seeks to transform every sincere effort into lasting user trust. “Co-building” isn’t just a catchphrase — it means actively integrating user feedback into products and providing a platform for their voices. Restoring User Trust via “Trust Marketing” Q: Given ongoing regulatory shifts and declining trust in centralized platforms, how does HTX intend to restore user trust via “trust marketing”? What specific strategies will be used? Molly: Trust isn’t built with words; it’s earned bit by bit by solving real problems. HTX has its shortcomings, and we don’t shy away from them. We’re not afraid of users raising questions; what we fear is having no one there to respond. We’ll solve what we can immediately and report what we can’t with honesty. “Real Talk with HTX Executives” isn’t for show — it’s a commitment to transparency and making open dialogue the norm. The “Miss HTX” Program and Women in Web3 Q: Why is HTX continuing to develop the “Miss HTX” program? What are your views on opportunities for women in Web3, and what’s the story behind this year’s theme of “Discover Web3 Future Queen”? Molly: I’ve been part of the journey from the first to the third season, watching many women rise from being doubted to being valued. Gold shines, but not everyone has a stage. HTX is willing to build a platform where truly talented and insightful women can be seen and recognized. They are not just participants; they have found turning points in their lives on our platform. Women in Web3 should not be labeled but should become builders in this industry, using their wisdom and perspectives to make the crypto world more prosperous. Balancing Compliance and Innovation Q: How does HTX maintain a balance between compliance and innovation? Molly: This isn’t a matter of choosing one over the other, but rather developing multiple systems that work in tandem and improve constantly. In the long run, our value lies in identifying and offering users reliable, high-quality assets. At the end of 2023, Justin Sun proposed that HTX should evolve into a platform that attracts top-tier projects and helps users screen for truly investable assets. This initiative isn’t about hype, but about establishing a secure trading environment. HTX’s Biggest Challenges Approaching its 12th Anniversary Q: As HTX approaches its 12th anniversary, what is the biggest challenge it faces? Molly: Our focus is not on existing users within the crypto space but on how to best serve the next wave of newcomers, especially those coming from traditional finance and internet sectors. These users care more about long-term value and effective risk management. HTX isn’t just in a user-acquisition race; we’re working to define the framework for a safer, more mature market. A truly trustworthy exchange should take responsibility for managing risks and empower users to achieve sustainable growth.

The move marks a “major turning point,” said Michael Sonnenshein, COO at Securitize, as it provides another option for collateral provision, reported Forbes on June 18. BUIDL is BlackRock’s first Ethereum-based tokenized money market fund backed in part by US Treasuries. It enables these traditional financial products to be traded as cryptographic tokens on blockchains. BlackRock’s $2.9B tokenized Treasury fund $BUIDL is now live on Deribit, and accepted as yield-bearing collateral. Read more via @Forbes https://t.co/ldcFF98lLV — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) June 18, 2025 Keep on BUIDLing Crypto investors have traditionally faced a difficult choice when posting collateral on exchanges and lending platforms. They can use stablecoins that don’t generate big returns, or volatile crypto assets that risk amplifying losses during market downturns. There is now a third option that is both stable and yield-generating. BUIDL currently pays around 4.5% annually, which is better than most high street banks, and it also maintains stability. Additionally, exchanges can offer lower minimum collateral requirements since it’s less risky, and investors can earn yield on their collateral instead of leaving it idle while more capital is freed up for actual trading. “We’re really starting to see not just the emergence but a real solidification of tokenized securities becoming a challenger to stablecoins as the common denominator across the crypto ecosystem,” Sonnenshein said. “They’re now becoming what we would consider programmable productive capital, as opposed to just a passive investment instrument used for yield or a safe place to park capital.” BUIDL has grown to $2.9 billion in assets under management since launching in March 2024. Meanwhile, Crypto.com will offer it to institutional clients across all trading services, and Deribit, which was acquired by Coinbase, where it will soon be accepted, will accept it for futures and options trading. Deribit CEO Luuk Strijers said 80% to 85% of the firm’s business is institutional, “and we are getting more of these traditional firms that don’t necessarily hold a lot of crypto but hold a lot of dollars and don’t want to miss out on yield.” RWA Tokenization Outlook The tokenized real-world-asset sector currently has just shy of a record $24 billion tokenized onchain, according to RWA.xyz. It has seen more than 50% growth since the beginning of this year, and BUIDL has the largest asset market share with 12% of the total. Ethereum remains the industry standard for tokenized RWA with a network market share of almost 60%.

Frustrated XRP supporters are blaming the SEC for the delay. However, a legal expert has clarified some important details of the case. Who Is Behind the Delay? According to attorney Bill Morgan, it’s actually Ripple that is causing the delay. In a recent post, the expert explained that Ripple wants the court to remove the injunction on how it can sell XRP. Surprisingly, the SEC is cooperating and even helping with the process. Wrong. Ripple is the source of the delay. It wants the injunction dissolved. Rather than cause the delay the SEC is actually bending over backwards to help ripple have the injunction dissolved. Ripple and the SEC would have settled months ago but for Ripple wanting to dissolve… https://t.co/1YPRgxes0n — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 18, 2025 While many expected a quick settlement months ago, the case has been held up because Ripple is focused on getting those restrictions lifted first. One user asked Morgan if dissolving the injunction is necessary for Ripple to move forward. Morgan said, “Ripple needs it, not the XRP investors,” making it clear that the move primarily benefits Ripple’s ability to sell XRP to institutions. Another question was raised: Can the judge remove the injunction but still keep the fine? The attorney confirmed that the judge has the authority to do that. Judge’s Ruling To Arrive Sooner? The community is frustrated over the ongoing delays in the Ripple vs SEC case. The next update in the Ripple vs. SEC case is set for August 15, 2025. But former SEC official Marc Fagel said that date is not a deadline, and the case is not delayed until then. He explained that the judge could decide on the pending motion at any time, whether in a few hours, days, or even weeks. The SEC case is NOT delayed until August 15. The district court judge can rule on the motion pending before her in hours, days, or weeks (or months or years, for that matter, but it obviously won't come to that). — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) June 18, 2025 In an earlier tweet , Fagel also clarified that Judge Torres had already ruled against Ripple last year, issuing a $125M fine and a permanent injunction. The case continues only because both Ripple and the SEC appealed and are now seeking changes, which is something that is on them, and not the judge. According to Morgan, a decision could come sooner. Any further delay could trigger new appeals and slow down the settlement talks. Both parties have signed the deal, paused their appeals, and filed the necessary motions. Now, everything hinges on Judge Torres issuing a ruling. Once approved, Ripple will pay a $50M fine, the injunction will be lifted, and both appeals will be dropped.",Uncategorized|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-20 03:52:16

Here’s the range that could end up deciding the direction of the break. Dogecoin Is Nearing The End Of A Triangle Pattern In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how Dogecoin is currently looking from a technical analysis (TA) perspective. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 1-day price of DOGE. As displayed in the graph, the daily Dogecoin price has been trading inside what appears to be a triangular channel. A triangle is a TA pattern that forms whenever an asset’s price observes consolidation between two converging trendlines. Related Reading: Solana Plunges 13%: Can Key On-Chain Support Stop The Fall? The upper line of the pattern is likely to provide resistance to the price, while the lower one support. A break out of either of the lines can signal a continuation of trend in that direction. There are a few different types of triangles, with a few popular ones being the Symmetrical, Ascending, and Descending variations. The orientation of the trendlines decides the type of the triangle. In a Symmetrical Triangle, the lines converge at a roughly equal and opposite slope. This means that as the price travels inside the pattern, both upward and downward volatility shrinks in an even manner. For the Ascending and Descending versions, however, there is a bias to the upside or downside. In the former, the upper trendline is parallel to the time-axis and the price progressively makes higher lows. Similarly, the latter involves lower highs with a flat support level. From the chart, it’s apparent that the Triangle that Dogecoin has been moving inside for the past few months is similar to a Symmetrical Triangle, but it has a slight tilt toward the downside. It’s also visible that DOGE is nearing in on the end of the triangle. Generally, triangle breakouts become more likely to occur as the asset approaches the apex, as the consolidation range squeezes tight in this region. Related Reading: These Altcoins Are Bucking The Trend—But Can They Keep It Up? Considering that Dogecoin may be in this zone now, it’s possible that its spring may be ready to uncoil. Based on the pattern forming in the daily price, the analyst has noted that DOGE looks primed for a 60% move. As for which way a break would happen, that naturally comes down to which line the memecoin exits the triangle from. ” All you need to do is wait for a daily close outside of the $0.16 to $0.22 range to determine the direction of the trend,” notes Martinez. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.168, down more than 11% over the last seven days.

Pi Waits for Listing & NEAR Targets $3,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-x-series-miner-rollout-starts-july-7-pi-waits-for-listing-near-targets-3/,"Crypto users are always looking for the next breakout project with real use cases. Pi Network and Near Protocol continue gaining traction thanks to their focus on mobile mining and blockchain scalability. Yet, BlockDAG (BDAG) is attracting serious attention with its energy-efficient, low-barrier approach to mining. It is set to begin shipments of its X-Series miners from July 7 onwards. Instead of relying on expensive equipment, BlockDAG’s X-Series enables smoother participation in mining without the high expenses usually involved. Compared with Pi Network and Near Protocol, its forward steps highlight why many are looking at BlockDAG as a potential standout in 2025. Progress Update: BlockDAG X-Series Miner Delivery Starts July 7th BlockDAG is advancing fast as it prepares to roll out its X-Series miner units. The first 100 X30 and X100 models will be sent to select early testers starting July 7. These test units are meant to confirm their performance under real-use conditions before a broader release planned for October. This stage is crucial in bringing decentralized mining directly to users within the BlockDAG network. The shift from internal tests to live use marks a key turning point for BlockDAG, setting the foundation for wide-scale deployment. These miners are designed for energy-saving mining and eliminate the need for power-hungry setups, creating easier access to mining for more users. BlockDAG’s performance is also supported by major milestones. The crypto presale has already raised $312 million, with over 22.8 billion coins sold. The current batch price is $0.0276, yet a limited-time offer at $0.0018 remains active until June 20. Since batch 1, early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds. With 2 million users on the X1 app and the live deployment phase underway, BlockDAG is becoming one of the most sought-after assets heading into 2025. Pi Network Price Analysis: Signs of a Strong Price Jump Pi Network continues gaining followers due to its app-based mining method, allowing users to earn via smartphone without draining battery life or needing special hardware. This simple method has helped Pi Network grow a large user community, making it one of the most discussed digital currencies. In terms of Pi Network price analysis, its value is expected to climb sharply when the mainnet is fully live. As more users interact with the system, Pi’s supply will expand, pushing its market influence higher. With growing interest in the upcoming exchange listings, many experts expect a major surge in Pi Coin’s price. Excitement remains high, suggesting Pi may be heading toward a strong market run soon. Near Protocol Price Rally: Crucial Resistance Levels to Monitor Near Protocol is seeing fresh momentum, with its price uptick sparking interest. Latest indicators show that a 30% increase is within reach, supported by steady development and market positivity. Known for its low-cost and scalable blockchain structure, Near is carving a solid role in the app-building sector. The $2.00 support level has held firm, triggering a push toward the $2.35-$2.40 area, where resistance has recently been cleared. If the price holds above this range, the next key levels to watch are $2.80 to $3.00. Continued bullish movement could help Near stretch even higher. Final Say! As Pi Network and Near Protocol show potential for continued traction in 2025, BlockDAG is building serious momentum through its efficient mining setup. With the transition to live deployment already in motion and 20 exchange listings already revealed, BlockDAG is gearing up to begin the shipment of its mining equipment. Its focus on easy-access, eco-friendly mining gives it an edge over complex and costly setups. While other projects develop their ecosystems, BlockDAG’s real progress and wide reach are paving the way for a strong year ahead.

With Bitcoin (BTC) maintaining its dominance and altcoins like Optimism (OP), Arbitrum (ARB), Sei (SEI), and Litecoin (LTC) making headlines, attention is turning to rising stars with breakout potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as a contender, drawing interest from both seasoned traders and new entrants eager to catch the next wave of exponential growth. Premier Launch Status Secured by MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly establishing itself as a premier crypto launch for 2025, drawing strong interest from both retail and institutional investors.

The genomics and diagnostics firm listed on Nasdaq has invested $20m to acquire 187.42 BTC, becoming the first publicly traded healthcare company to do so, according to an announcement this week. This move sent the firm’s stock 23% higher. The Hong Kong-headquartered company is known for its DNA testing platform CircleDNA and its broader health sciences initiatives, but it is now making waves for reasons outside the clinic. Its Bitcoin holdings, secured via a Kraken custody account, mark the start of what Prenetics calls a long-term digital asset strategy. At an average purchase price of just over $106,000 per Bitcoin, the investment is a clear signal of conviction.

It plans to allocate the majority of its balance sheet to Bitcoin, with board approval already in place. According to CEO Danny Yeung, the company sees a future where genomics, longevity science and digital assets converge. “To execute this vision at scale, we need substantial Bitcoin holdings,” he said. The company has also brought in heavyweight crypto experience. Andy Cheung, former COO of exchange OKEx, is joining its board to provide direct oversight as Prenetics integrates digital assets into its operations. Cheung’s appointment strengthens the firm’s ability to navigate what remains a complex and volatile market. Prenetics Follows MicroStrategy’s Playbook, But Adds A Healthcare Twist Beyond buying and holding, Prenetics will actively manage its Bitcoin. The firm outlined plans for alpha-generating strategies that include lending, yield optimization and structured financial products. In parallel, it will begin accepting cryptocurrency payments across its direct-to-consumer health platforms, building what it calls a full-stack Bitcoin ecosystem. Prenetics raised its 2025 revenue forecast to as much as $100m and expects to turn profitable by the fourth quarter of next year. The Bitcoin strategy, the company says, reflects confidence in its business trajectory and its ability to manage risk. Its move comes as dozens of public companies add Bitcoin to their treasuries. Sixty-one firms not traditionally involved in crypto have adopted similar strategies , according to Standard Chartered. Many are attempting to follow in the footsteps of MicroStrategy , which began its Bitcoin accumulation in 2020 and has since seen its stock rise over 3,000%.

Recent data from CryptoQuant suggests a potential shift is underway, and it’s something every crypto investor should understand. Chief Analyst Julio Moreno has issued a warning, indicating that the robust Bitcoin demand seen recently may be starting to cool off. What’s Happening with Bitcoin Demand? According to the latest analysis shared by CryptoQuant’s lead, the pace of Bitcoin demand growth has slowed considerably. Following a period where interest surged, pushing the price towards significant levels, the momentum appears to be waning. While there was still an increase in spot demand over the last 30 days, adding roughly 118,000 BTC to holdings, this figure represents a significant drop from the peak observed just weeks earlier. On May 27th, the 30-day change in spot holdings hit a high of 228,000 BTC. The current number is less than half of that recent peak, signaling a noticeable deceleration in buying pressure. This slowdown in Bitcoin demand is a key metric for analysts trying to gauge market sentiment and potential future price movements. Sustained high demand typically supports upward price trajectories, while a decrease can signal weakening conviction or a shift in investor focus. Insights from CryptoQuant Analysis CryptoQuant is well-known for its deep dive into on-chain data, providing unique perspectives on market dynamics that go beyond simple price charts. Their CryptoQuant analysis relies on examining transactions and holdings directly on the blockchain, offering transparency into the behavior of different market participants, from retail investors to large institutions and long-term holders. The recent warning from CryptoQuant is based on several converging data points, all pointing towards a potential dip in aggressive accumulation. By tracking metrics like spot exchange reserves, wallet movements, and the activity of specific cohorts like whales and short-term holders, they can build a comprehensive picture of where demand is coming from and how it’s evolving. This granular level of detail is crucial for understanding the underlying health of the market and anticipating potential shifts. Are Bitcoin Whales Slowing Down? One of the critical indicators highlighted in the CryptoQuant analysis is the behavior of Bitcoin whales. These large holders, often defined as wallets holding significant amounts of BTC, have a considerable impact on market dynamics due to the sheer volume they control. Historically, periods of strong whale accumulation have often preceded significant price rallies. The data shows that the growth rate of Bitcoin whales holding has decreased. Over the past month, whale holdings grew by approximately 1.7%. While any growth is positive, this is a noticeable decline from the 3.9% month-over-month growth rate observed previously. This suggests that even the largest players in the market might be becoming more cautious or are simply less aggressively adding to their positions at current price levels. A slowdown in whale activity can reduce overall buying pressure and potentially make the market more susceptible to downward price movements if selling pressure increases. Impact of Slowing Bitcoin ETF Flow Another major factor influencing Bitcoin demand over the past year, particularly in the United States, has been the introduction and subsequent activity of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). These investment vehicles have opened up a new avenue for traditional finance participants to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. ETF inflows have been a significant source of demand, absorbing large amounts of BTC from the market. However, the CryptoQuant data indicates a slowdown in this area as well. Daily purchases by U.S. Bitcoin ETF vehicles have reportedly fallen. The average daily inflow has decreased from a peak of around 9,700 BTC to approximately 3,300 BTC. This represents a substantial reduction in institutional buying pressure entering the market through these regulated products. Given the scale of previous ETF inflows, this deceleration is a key contributor to the overall cooling trend in Bitcoin demand. Potential Bitcoin Price Analysis and Support Levels So, what does this cooling demand potentially mean for the Bitcoin price? According to the CryptoQuant analysis, weakened demand could lead to price corrections. The analyst points to key on-chain support levels based on the ‘realized price’ of different cohorts of holders. The realized price represents the average cost basis of all Bitcoin currently held, calculated by valuing each UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) at the price it last moved on the blockchain. Based on this on-chain data, a significant support level could form around the $92,000 mark. This level likely corresponds to the aggregate cost basis of a large portion of recent buyers. If demand continues to weaken and this $92,000 level fails to hold, the analysis suggests the price could potentially dip further, with the next significant support identified around $81,000 . Understanding these potential support zones, derived from on-chain metrics rather than just technical chart patterns, can provide valuable context for investors evaluating risk and potential entry/exit points. Key Takeaways from the Analysis: Spot Bitcoin demand growth has slowed significantly from its recent peak. Bitcoin whales are accumulating at a slower rate. U.S. Bitcoin ETF inflows have decreased substantially. Weakening demand could lead to price testing key on-chain support levels. Potential support levels are identified around $92,000 and $81,000. What Does This Mean for Investors? While this analysis flags potential headwinds, it’s important not to panic. Market cycles involve periods of both strong demand and consolidation or correction. This data provides valuable insight into the current state of buying pressure. Challenges: The primary challenge is the increased risk of price volatility and potential downside if demand continues to fall and selling pressure mounts. The failure of key support levels could lead to further price drops. Actionable Insights: Investors can use this information to re-evaluate their risk exposure. Understanding potential support levels ($92k, $81k) can help inform decisions about setting stop-losses or identifying potential buying opportunities if those levels are tested and hold. It also reinforces the importance of looking beyond just price action and considering underlying market structure and participant behavior as revealed by on-chain data. Summary: Navigating the Cooling Market The latest CryptoQuant analysis serves as a timely warning for the Bitcoin market. While demand hasn’t disappeared entirely, the data clearly indicates a slowdown in the aggressive buying that characterized the market leading up to recent highs. Decreases in spot demand growth, slower whale accumulation, and reduced Bitcoin ETF inflows are all contributing factors to this cooling trend. Investors should pay close attention to how the market reacts around the potential support levels of $92,000 and $81,000, as identified by on-chain metrics. Staying informed with data-driven analysis like that provided by CryptoQuant is essential for navigating the potential volatility ahead.

Here’s Why These Coins Deserve Your Attention",https://thecoinrise.com/4-top-altcoins-to-watch-in-2025-blockdag-toncoin-stellar-avalanche-heres-why-these-coins-deserve-your-attention/,"The crypto space is always moving fast. In 2025, a few big names are reaching key stages that could lead to exciting new growth. Many people wonder which top altcoins are worth watching right now. It can be hard to keep up when so much is changing. But here’s some good news: a handful of projects are making clear progress, and that can help guide your choices. In this article, we’ll look at four names that are standing out: BlockDAG, Toncoin, Stellar, and Avalanche. From new tools to growing networks, these projects are giving strong signals. Read on to see what makes them worth following this year. 1. BlockDAG: $312M Raised & X Series Miners Set to be Shipped Soon If you’re looking at which projects are making steady progress, BlockDAG (BDAG) is hard to miss. The project is set to start shipping its X10 miners by August 15. These devices are small, energy-efficient, and easy to use, perfect for those new to mining. You won’t need complex or costly setups to get started. The X10 miners support BlockDAG’s wider goal: making mining simple and open to more people. The X30 and X100 models are built for larger setups, but the X10 lets anyone join with ease. Right now, BlockDAG has raised $312 million in its presale. It is in Batch 29, with a coin price of $0.0276. Those who joined in Batch 1 have already seen gains of 2,660%. So far, 22.8 billion coins have been sold. For a short time, the frozen price of $0.0018 will end in just 2 days. With the mainnet on the way and miners soon to ship, BlockDAG remains one of the top altcoins to watch this year. 2. Toncoin: Fast Growth Through Telegram’s Reach Toncoin is quickly gaining ground, thanks to its deep link with the Telegram app. Users can easily send small payments or tips inside Telegram chats. Since Telegram has a massive user base across many countries, this gives Toncoin real-world value. While Toncoin’s price has seen ups and downs, many in the crypto world see these price dips as good entry points. Often, the top altcoins are the ones seeing real use and growing interest. Toncoin fits this pattern well. As messaging apps and financial tools continue to blend, Toncoin’s role in these spaces could bring fresh momentum. This is why many are keeping it on their watchlist for 2025. 3. Stellar: Speed and Real-World Uses in Digital Currency Stellar (XLM) continues to focus on real-world solutions, such as cross-border money transfers, digital assets, and central bank digital currency projects. Its network is built for speed and low fees, which is why many public and private projects still choose it. In 2025, new pilot programs with large financial firms have brought fresh attention to Stellar. With prices still well below past peaks, many see this as a great chance to get in early. Among the top altcoins in this space, Stellar stands out for its clear purpose and active use cases. Anyone following blockchain’s role in everyday finance should be keeping an eye on XLM this year. 4. Avalanche: Growing Through Subnets and New Use Cases Avalanche (AVAX) is moving ahead strongly with its “subnet” system. This allows apps and businesses to build their own custom blockchains, making the network faster and more flexible. Lower costs and faster speeds are attracting both small teams and big companies. In 2025, new subnets are launching, and Avalanche is seeing more use in gaming and business tools. Recent price dips have also created new chances for people to join in. AVAX continues to rank among the top altcoins because of its focus on real utility and constant growth. As more builders and users come on board, Avalanche is set to stay a key player in the crypto world. Summing Up! Choosing the right coins today means more than just following the hype. What really matters are useful products, good timing, and strong communities. BlockDAG’s X10 miners make mining easy for more people. Plus, the project’s presale numbers and upcoming launch present strong signs. Toncoin and Stellar are delivering real value through payments and transfers. Avalanche keeps growing by helping others build and scale. For anyone looking at top altcoins in 2025, these projects deserve attention. When tools work well, timing is right, and communities grow, the signs are clear: this could be the moment to act. The post 4 Top Altcoins to Watch in 2025: BlockDAG, Toncoin, Stellar, Avalanche!

For the uninitiated, the inverse head & shoulders is a bullish chart pattern that signals a potential reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend. It consists of three troughs, a lower low – called the “head” – between two higher lows – called the “shoulders.” This is followed by a breakout above the “neckline” resistance, indicating rising buying pressure.

For example, noted analyst Jelle pointed out that BTC has formed a major bullish pennant above previous highs – another positive technical signal. BTC is also poised to benefit from shrinking supply on trading platforms. In an X post shared earlier today, crypto commentator Master of Crypto noted that Bitcoin balances on exchanges are about to fall below two million – the lowest level since 2017. Depleting BTC balances on exchanges suggest that investors are moving their Bitcoin to long-term storage, reducing the amount available for immediate sale. This supply constraint can create upward pressure on price, especially if demand continues to rise. Meanwhile, another Bitcoin analyst, apsk32, highlighted BTC’s ongoing alignment with the power curve cycle. Remarkably, Bitcoin has followed this cycle consistently for 15 years, and if the trend holds, the next cycle top could occur in November or December 2025. BTC Quantity More Important Than Price In a separate X post, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki emphasized that the number of BTC one holds is more important than its current price. In a detailed thread, he predicted that Bitcoin could reach as high as $1 million by 2030. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Warning: Short-Term Holder Selling Accelerates Amid Price Correction While a $1 million price target may seem ambitious, other analysts also forecast new highs in the near term. For example, CryptoQuant analyst Carmelo Aleman recently projected that BTC could top out at $205,000 by the end of 2025. In addition, exchange data suggests an impending supply crunch, as whales continue withdrawing large amounts of BTC while exchange inflows remain subdued. At press time, BTC is trading at $104,359, down 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

The proposal, released during the London Policy Summit, signals a growing urgency within the industry to see the UK regulations take a leading role in shaping the future of global finance. Ripple has long been working with regulators, unlike many crypto firms just starting. It has actively collaborated with policymakers in regions like Singapore, Dubai, and the EU, where clear crypto rules already exist. At Ripple’s UK Policy Summit earlier this year, one message was clear: the time to act is now: https://t.co/7VDmJ3eVDa Recommendations for UK policymakers: Build a growth-driven framework Lead on global standards Advance stablecoin adoption Tackle tokenization… — Ripple (@Ripple) June 18, 2025 Policy Momentum Builds Ripple $XRP has released a report on how the UK can better adopt and integrate crypto assets:""opportunity for the UK is huge.""""enhance financial inclusion and solidify the UK’s position as a competitive global financial centre."" pic.twitter.com/XQPjVHGW5b — ALLINCRYPTO (@RealAllinCrypto) June 19, 2025 The summit, hosted by Ripple alongside the UK Centre for Blockchain Technology and Innovate Finance, brought together officials and industry figures to assess the UK’s progress on crypto policy. The conversation followed a string of recent moves by the UK government, including draft legislation from HM Treasury and consultations from the Financial Conduct Authority on key issues like stablecoins, custody, and prudential standards. Even though the UK wants to ace the crypto space, they need strong crypto rules at first, and Ripple is all set to help them with their innovative plan. Singapore and Dubai are true examples of laying crypto-friendly rules without being too lenient and over-protective. Moreover, talking about the EU’s MiCA regulations , it offers a strong blueprint for managing the fast-paced crypto sector. Ripple, familiar with such systems, is now helping the UK build its framework without having to start from zero. There has also been early experimentation with blockchain-based infrastructure. A digital bond pilot backed by the UK government, DIGIT, has launched, and new players have joined the Financial Conduct Authority’s Digital Securities Sandbox, signaling growing institutional interest in tokenized assets. Ripple’s Four Priorities Ripple’s paper calls for the swift finalization of the UK’s crypto regulatory framework. The firm argues that clarity is key to attracting serious investment and ensuring the UK doesn’t fall behind in the race to shape digital markets. Next, Ripple suggests aligning domestic rules with international standards to avoid overlapping requirements for global firms. It also advocates for expedited progress on stablecoin regulation , including provisions that would allow non-UK-issued stablecoins to be used locally without additional barriers. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Tax in Australia May End : Here’s Why , Finally, Ripple is pressing for broader structural reform to remove tax and legal obstacles to tokenization, a technology it believes will play a central role in modernizing financial markets. A Chance to Lead While the report stops short of specific timelines, the tone suggests the window of opportunity is closing. Ripple believes the UK has a chance to establish itself as a global leader if it acts quickly and decisively. With more than 90% of financial institutions expected to be engaged with crypto assets by the end of this year, the firm says getting the rules right now could define the UK’s role in the next chapter of financial innovation. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The team will distribute 5% of its total $MGO supply to early users, testnet participants, and community contributors. The eligibility checker is now live, where users can connect their wallets and complete a three-step process to confirm and eventually claim their rewards. Distribution begins on June 24, with tokens issued in the order of claim. To begin, users must “bind” their Twitter accounts, which involves linking their Twitter profile to Mango’s platform to verify their identity and activity. They must also follow BeingDEX, Mango’s ecosystem partner. Mango Network TGE and Airdrop is coming. Check your eligibility for $MGO now! Thank you for being with us every step of the way. You helped build this, and now it’s time to witness the rewards. Note: Claiming will open after TGE. Please be aware of scams. — Mango Network (@MangoOS_Network) June 20, 2025 Airdrop Claiming Starts June 24, With Eligibility Based On Weighted Points After linking their profile, users can proceed to verify their airdrop share. A countdown timer on the site marks the time left to confirm eligibility. Then, users can view and confirm their airdrop share. Once confirmed, the final step will allow users to claim their rewards when the claim window opens at 17:50 UTC on June 24. Unlike typical airdrops based solely on point totals, Mango uses a weighted system. Token allocation will reflect not just the number of points a user has, but also the quality of their testnet participation and any community roles they held, such as OG status. All Tokens To Be Unlocked At Claim, With Caution Urged Against Fraud All tokens will be fully unlocked at the time of distribution. However, the team has urged users to remain cautious of scams. They said that only official Mango channels should be trusted for claiming instructions. Meanwhile, Mango Network has positioned itself as a next-generation blockchain. It aims to solve two of Web3’s toughest problems — fragmented liquidity and poor user experience. To do this, the project uses a multi-VM, full-chain infrastructure. This design promises a smoother experience for both developers and users. Now, with the airdrop underway, Mango is rewarding those who helped build its foundation. At the same time, it offers a glimpse into what the future of its ecosystem could look like.

Recent global events, from geopolitical conflicts to shifts in monetary policy, have tested various markets. Yet, amidst this uncertainty, a striking narrative is emerging: Bitcoin resilience . What Makes Bitcoin Show Such Incredible Resilience? Elliot Johnson, CEO of the Bitcoin Treasury Corporation, recently highlighted Bitcoin’s remarkable ability to withstand significant external pressures. Speaking to BeInCrypto, Johnson noted that despite the heightened tensions from the Israel-Iran conflict and the Federal Reserve’s seemingly hawkish stance on interest rates, Bitcoin has remained “incredibly resilient.” This observation isn’t just anecdotal; it points to fundamental characteristics of the cryptocurrency that allow it to weather storms that might significantly impact traditional assets. Several core factors contribute to Bitcoin’s resilience: Decentralization: Unlike traditional currencies or company stocks, Bitcoin is not controlled by any single government, central bank, or corporation. Its distributed ledger technology means no single point of failure exists, making it immune to direct political manipulation or corporate collapse. Scarcity: With a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, Bitcoin’s inherent scarcity provides a strong store-of-value narrative, often compared to digital gold. This limited supply contrasts sharply with fiat currencies, which can be printed indefinitely, potentially leading to inflation. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin operates 24/7 on a global network. It is accessible to anyone with an internet connection, transcending national borders and traditional banking hours. This makes it a potential safe haven asset for individuals in regions experiencing economic instability or capital controls. Maturing Infrastructure: The Bitcoin ecosystem has evolved significantly. Robust exchanges, secure wallets, and increasing regulatory clarity in many jurisdictions provide a more stable environment for investors compared to its earlier days. Institutional interest has also grown, bringing more sophisticated capital into the market. Protocol Security: The Bitcoin network is secured by a vast amount of computational power through mining, making it extremely difficult and prohibitively expensive for any single entity to compromise the network’s integrity. These factors combine to create an asset class that behaves differently from traditional equities, bonds, or commodities, particularly during times of geopolitical or economic stress. Understanding these underlying strengths is crucial for any comprehensive crypto market analysis . How Do Macro Factors Influence Bitcoin Price Prediction? The interplay between macroeconomic forces and Bitcoin’s price has been a subject of intense debate. Traditionally, assets like Bitcoin were seen as uncorrelated or even negatively correlated with traditional markets. However, as institutional adoption has grown and Bitcoin has become more integrated into the global financial system, its correlation with risk assets, particularly tech stocks, has increased at times. Let’s consider the two macro factors highlighted: 1. Geopolitical Conflict (e.g., Israel-Iran): Geopolitical tensions often lead to market uncertainty. Historically, assets perceived as safe havens, like gold or certain government bonds, might see inflows. Bitcoin’s reaction to such events has been mixed. Sometimes it acts as a risk-on asset, selling off alongside stocks during fear. Other times, its ‘digital gold’ narrative comes to the forefront, attracting investors seeking an alternative store of value outside traditional systems. Johnson’s observation suggests that in the recent conflict, Bitcoin leaned more towards demonstrating resilience rather than succumbing to panic selling, perhaps indicating a growing confidence in its role as a non-sovereign asset. 2. Federal Reserve Monetary Policy: The Fed’s stance on interest rates and quantitative easing significantly impacts liquidity and investor sentiment globally. A hawkish Fed, implying higher rates and tighter liquidity, generally makes riskier assets less attractive as borrowing costs rise and safer investments (like bonds) offer better returns. Cryptocurrencies, often viewed as high-beta risk assets, have historically been sensitive to Fed policy. However, Bitcoin’s ability to remain resilient despite the current hawkish signals could suggest that its price action is increasingly being driven by factors beyond just liquidity, such as fundamental adoption, long-term holding conviction, or specific market structure dynamics. Analyzing these macro factors crypto correlation is complex and constantly evolving. Bitcoin’s narrative shifts between being a speculative tech asset and a long-term store of value, influencing how it reacts to different external stimuli.

Elliot Johnson’s assertion that it will be difficult for the “psychological support level of $100,000 to collapse” is a bold statement, especially considering Bitcoin has not yet reached that price point. However, it speaks to the significance of price levels in market psychology and the potential for strong support once a new milestone is achieved or even widely anticipated. What does a “psychological support level” mean? It refers to a price point that market participants collectively believe is significant, often due to round numbers or previous historical importance. When a price approaches such a level, buying interest tends to increase as investors see it as a potential floor or a key level to defend. While $100,000 is currently a future target, the idea of it becoming a strong support level implies several underlying assumptions: Strong Upward Momentum: Reaching $100,000 in the first place requires significant buying pressure and positive sentiment. Investor Conviction: For $100k to act as support, a large number of holders must be unwilling to sell below this price once it’s reached, viewing it as a fair value or a level worth defending. Institutional Buy-in: Increased institutional adoption and large capital flows into Bitcoin could provide the necessary demand to establish and hold higher price floors. Reduced Volatility at Higher Levels: Some argue that as Bitcoin’s market cap grows, its price volatility might decrease, potentially making it easier to maintain key support levels. Predicting exact price levels is notoriously difficult in any market, let alone one as dynamic as Bitcoin. However, the concept of $100k becoming a strong support level is tied to the broader bullish case for Bitcoin’s long-term adoption and value proposition. It suggests confidence not just in reaching that price, but in the market’s ability to consolidate and build a new foundation at significantly higher valuations than seen previously. Challenges and Opportunities for Bitcoin Despite its demonstrated resilience and bullish long-term outlooks like the potential for $100k support, Bitcoin faces ongoing challenges: Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: While progress is being made, regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies vary widely across jurisdictions and can change rapidly, posing risks. Market Volatility: Despite periods of resilience, Bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset, subject to rapid price swings that can deter risk-averse investors. Competition: While Bitcoin is the dominant cryptocurrency, the broader digital asset space is constantly evolving with new technologies and competitors. External Shocks: While resilient, extreme macro events or black swan incidents could still trigger significant downturns. Opportunities: Increasing Institutional Adoption: More companies, asset managers, and even potentially sovereign wealth funds adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets or portfolios could provide sustained buying pressure. Technological Advancements: Ongoing development on the Bitcoin network (e.g., Lightning Network) can improve scalability and usability. Growing Global Awareness: As more people understand Bitcoin’s principles and potential, adoption could increase organically. Macroeconomic Headwinds for Fiat: Continued concerns about inflation, currency devaluation, or economic instability in traditional systems could drive more people towards alternative stores of value like Bitcoin. Navigating these challenges and capitalizing on opportunities is key for investors analyzing the potential trajectory of Bitcoin’s price. Actionable Insights for Investors Given Bitcoin’s resilience and the ongoing market dynamics, what should investors consider? Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s history is marked by significant volatility. A long-term perspective, often referred to as “HODLing” (holding on for dear life), has historically been a successful strategy for many investors. Focus on the fundamental adoption trends rather than short-term price swings. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Given the volatility, regularly investing a fixed amount of money into Bitcoin, regardless of its price, can help reduce the risk of buying at a market peak and average out the purchase price over time. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Bitcoin is a high-risk, high-reward asset. Allocate a portion of your portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance. Stay Informed: Keep track of major macroeconomic indicators, regulatory news, and developments within the Bitcoin ecosystem. However, be wary of hype and sensationalism. Focus on credible sources for your crypto market analysis . Understand the $100k Narrative: While $100k is a significant psychological target and potential future support, treat it as a possibility based on bullish factors, not a guarantee. Understand the drivers that could lead to such levels (adoption, macro environment) and the risks that could prevent it. These insights are not financial advice but offer a framework for approaching Bitcoin investment in light of its unique characteristics and the external forces influencing it. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Enduring Strength Elliot Johnson’s comments underscore a crucial aspect of Bitcoin’s identity: its remarkable ability to absorb shocks from the global stage. The confluence of geopolitical uncertainty and shifting monetary policy creates a complex backdrop, yet Bitcoin continues to demonstrate resilience. This isn’t accidental; it’s a function of its decentralized nature, finite supply, and growing global acceptance. While the path to price targets like $100,000 is never linear and faces its own set of challenges, the underlying strengths that enable Bitcoin’s resilience suggest that such milestones are not merely speculative fantasy but potential outcomes driven by fundamental shifts in how the world perceives and utilizes digital assets. As the market matures and faces new tests, Bitcoin’s enduring strength remains a key factor for investors and analysts to watch.

Starting July 1, the platform will remove support for the ZKsync Era network from its aggregation feature. This decision marks a strategic move aimed at optimizing the platform’s performance and better aligning with current user needs and market dynamics. For anyone navigating the complexities of multi-chain DeFi, understanding these platform changes is crucial. What’s Happening with KyberSwap and ZKsync Era? The core of the announcement is straightforward: Kyber Network is ceasing the aggregation of liquidity sources on the ZKsync Era network within its DeFi aggregator service. This means that when users utilize KyberSwap’s aggregator to find the best trading routes and prices across various decentralized exchanges (DEXs), it will no longer include DEXs operating specifically on ZKsync Era in its search results. Here are the key details of the change: Effective Date: July 1 Affected Feature: KyberSwap Aggregator (finding best trade prices across DEXs) Unaffected Feature: KyberSwap’s cross-chain bridge functionality Reason Cited: To enhance platform efficiency and align with user demand This adjustment is part of the ongoing evolution of DeFi platforms, which must constantly adapt to the rapidly changing blockchain landscape and user activity patterns. While ZKsync Era has gained traction, KyberSwap’s data suggests that its integration within the aggregator was not meeting the desired efficiency or user interaction benchmarks compared to other supported chains. Why is KyberSwap Making This Change? According to Kyber Network, the primary drivers behind this decision are platform efficiency and user demand. Aggregating liquidity across multiple blockchains and numerous DEXs is a technically complex process that requires significant resources. By removing chains that may have lower user engagement on the aggregator or present integration challenges that impact overall performance, KyberSwap can potentially: Improve the speed and reliability of trade aggregation on the remaining chains. Allocate development resources more effectively to enhance features on more actively used networks. Streamline the user experience by focusing on the most popular and efficient trading paths. This strategic pivot allows KyberSwap to double down on optimizing the experience for the majority of its users, ensuring that the core aggregation service remains robust and competitive in the crowded DeFi market. It highlights the operational challenges faced by multi-chain platforms in maintaining seamless integration with every emerging Blockchain network. What Does This Mean for KyberSwap Users? For users who primarily trade on chains other than ZKsync Era using the KyberSwap aggregator, this change is likely to have minimal to no negative impact. In fact, they might experience a slight improvement in performance if the removal enhances overall system efficiency. However, users who frequently relied on KyberSwap’s aggregator to find the best swaps on ZKsync Era will need to find alternative methods or platforms for those specific trades after July 1. This might involve using native DEXs on ZKsync Era or other aggregators that continue to support the network. It’s crucial for users to understand the scope of this change: it only affects the DeFi aggregator . KyberSwap offers multiple services, and the delisting is specific to one of them. Users should verify which feature they utilize before making assumptions about their access to ZKsync Era via KyberSwap. Which Blockchains Remain Supported? Despite the removal of ZKsync Era from the aggregator, KyberSwap maintains support for a robust list of other major blockchains. This ensures that users still have access to a wide array of trading opportunities across popular networks. The platform will continue to aggregate liquidity on approximately 15 different chains. Key supported chains include: Ethereum Base Arbitrum Optimism Polygon BNB Chain Avalanche Fantom Cronos Polygon zkEVM Linea Scroll ImmutableX zkSync Lite (Note: This is different from ZKsync Era) And others… This extensive list demonstrates KyberSwap’s continued commitment to being a multi-chain platform, focusing its aggregation efforts on networks with significant liquidity and user activity. Beyond Aggregation: KyberSwap’s Continued Support for ZKsync Era An important point highlighted in the announcement is that the delisting is *only* from the aggregator service. KyberSwap’s cross-chain feature, which allows users to move assets between different blockchains, will continue to support ZKsync Era . This means users can still use KyberSwap to bridge assets to and from the ZKsync Era network. This distinction is vital for users who rely on KyberSwap for bridging rather than just finding the best swap price on a single chain. The continued cross-chain support indicates that KyberSwap still sees value in enabling connectivity to ZKsync Era, even if its aggregation performance didn’t meet internal thresholds. Navigating the Ever-Changing Crypto News Landscape This move by KyberSwap is a reminder of the dynamic nature of the Crypto News cycle and the DeFi space. Platforms are constantly evaluating their integrations and strategies based on technical performance, user behavior, and the evolving market. For users and participants in the ecosystem, staying informed about these changes is key to navigating DeFi effectively. Understanding why a platform makes such a decision—be it for efficiency, security, or strategic focus—provides valuable insight into the operational realities of building and maintaining complex multi-chain protocols like a DeFi aggregator . It underscores the fact that support for a blockchain isn’t static and can change based on various factors. Conclusion: Adapting to KyberSwap’s Aggregator Update KyberSwap’s decision to delist ZKsync Era from its aggregator on July 1 is a strategic step aimed at enhancing the platform’s efficiency and optimizing the user experience on its core supported chains. While it means users will need to find alternative methods for finding best swap prices specifically on ZKsync Era via KyberSwap, the platform continues to offer robust aggregation services across 15 other major networks and maintains cross-chain support for ZKsync Era. This development is a pertinent piece of Crypto News that highlights the ongoing evolution and adaptation within the DeFi ecosystem, emphasizing the importance of platform efficiency and targeted user demand in shaping service offerings.

According to QCP, on the macroeconomic front, the FED kept interest rates steady in line with expectations. However, the policy committee maintained its hawkish stance, stating that short-term inflation expectations remain high. The statement stated that customs duties stand out as a significant upward risk. Authorities reiterated that they will continue with a “wait-and-see” strategy until the course of inflation becomes clearer. On the other hand, markets no longer react as sensitively to geopolitical developments, especially the Israel-Iran tensions, as they used to. Related News: Big Bull Anthony Scaramucci Drops a Bold Prediction: “I Think It Will Surpass Ethereum” However, QCP states that the risk of a trade war is starting to come back to the agenda. The expiration of the European Union’s tariff suspension period against the US on July 9 stands out as a significant turning point in this regard. The US has only been able to reach an agreement with one of its more than 195 potential trading partners. While negotiations have reached a deadlock, the market’s lack of reaction to the leaked news and gradual tariff steps is striking. QCP Capital listed the upcoming critical dates as follows: July 14: EU expected to begin imposing retaliatory tariffs on US August 12: China-US 90-day tariff truce ends August 31: Long-term tariff exemptions for Chinese imports expire These dates could trigger periodic pullbacks in risk assets. Still, QCP says its baseline scenario is optimistic: Given the overlapping interests between China and the US, negotiations are more likely to reach a stable conclusion, which could support a rally in risk assets. Finally, it is stated that the hedging trend in the markets continues and short-term correction expectations are maintained. *This is not investment advice.

The announcement, published in a June 19 blog post, positions Kraken alongside a growing wave of institutions leveraging Babylon’s staking infrastructure. Kraken customers can now use Babylon’s protocol to assign their Bitcoin ( BTC ) to proof-of-stake blockchains while still keeping complete ownership of their assets. Kraken’s strategy avoids the trade-offs associated with traditional staking solutions, which often require wrapping or bridging Bitcoin to other networks. The underlying Bitcoin is never lent out or rehypothecated. Instead, it stays on the Bitcoin blockchain. Through Babylon’s smart contract-based delegation mechanism, staked assets help to secure PoS networks. In return, users receive rewards in BABY, Babylon’s native token. The service features a seven-day unbonding period, transparent reward tracking, and cryptographic penalties for bad actors. You might also like: Kraken launches Kraken Prime, a brokerage service for institutional crypto clients Kraken’s global head of consumer, Mark Greenberg, described the launch as an opportunity to put idle BTC to productive use. “A substantial amount of Bitcoin currently sits idle on our exchange,” he said. “Clients can now earn a return while strengthening the infrastructure of emerging PoS blockchains.” Kraken joins other platforms like Binance and BitGo that have embraced Babylon’s infrastructure to offer native Bitcoin yield opportunities. Over 57,000 BTC, worth over $5.6 billion, have already been staked on Babylon’s Genesis mainnet since it launched in April 2025, demonstrating growing institutional interest in Bitcoin-native decentralized finance protocols. Until now, less than 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply is involved in DeFi, primarily due to the technical complexity and security risks of bridging BTC to other chains. By enabling trustless delegation from Bitcoin to PoS networks, Babylon’s approach reduces those frictions while extending BTC’s utility in the broader crypto ecosystem. Kraken’s new staking service is now live across all interfaces, including Kraken Pro. Staking yields up to 1% APR, with weekly BABY rewards, though rates may vary. The company noted that staking involves risk and is subject to regional restrictions. BABY token prices climbed nearly 5% decentralized finance Kraken’s announcement but has since cooled.

The update was first spotted by a Cardano-focused X page on June 19, which shared a screenshot showing Cardano ( ADA ) live in the wallet interface. This follows an official announcement from May, when Input Output, Cardano’s core development firm, and Brave Software confirmed plans to integrate full Cardano support into Brave’s browser-native crypto wallet. https://twitter.com/stakewithpride/status/1935719586202276249?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw The integration allows users to send, receive, swap, and sign transactions using Cardano assets within the privacy-focused browser. It also lets Cardano owners manage tokens like Midnight’s NIGHT, engage with decentralized apps, and participate in governance. Despite the update, which is expected to improve Cardano’s exposure massively, price action has yet to reflect a strong response. At press time, Cardano is trading at $0.6002, down 0.5% on the day and near the lower end of its 7-day range between $0.5913 and $0.6556.

Looking at the technical picture, ADA is still declining in a clearly defined downtrend, trading near its lowest level since mid-April. The price is below all significant moving averages, ranging from the 10-day to the 200-day, indicating strong bearish momentum. Cardano price analysis. Credit: crypto.news The Bollinger Bands have been narrowing, with the lower band around $0.5899 acting as nearby support. ADA is hugging this lower band, which is usually an indication that selling pressure is present. Momentum indicators, on the other hand, show a neutral to bearish picture. With a value of 32.8, the relative strength index is getting close to oversold territory but hasn’t displayed any reversal signals yet. The moving average convergence divergence is still in negative territory, while the stochastic RSI shows that ADA is deeply oversold but lacks a definite bullish divergence. Although there may be a short-term rebound indicated by the Commodity Channel Index at -124, the general trend direction is still downward. A bullish RSI crossover and fresh volume may support a sustained move above $0.63. ADA could move toward the $0.70 resistance zone if it breaks above the 20-day estimated moving average close to $0.65. Conversely, a continuation of low volume and rejection at the 10-day EMA around $0.6265 would validate the current downward trend. A deeper decline toward $0.55 might be possible if the price fails to stay above the $0.59 support.

Bitget has secured a license to operate in Georgia’s Tbilisi Free Zone, enabling it to offer spot, futures, and copy trading within a locally regulated environment. At the same time, the company has launched QR-based stablecoin payments in Vietnam, broadening crypto’s real-world utility. Meanwhile, OKX has partnered with Consensys to integrate its DEX aggregator and MEV protection tool SERVO into MetaMask, enhancing decentralized trading speed, liquidity access, and user safety. OKX and Consensys Partner to Bring High-Speed DEX Aggregator to MetaMask Global crypto exchange OKX has partnered with Ethereum software powerhouse Consensys to integrate its DEX aggregator directly into MetaMask, which is one of the most widely used wallets in the Web3 ecosystem. The integration is designed to deliver faster trade execution and reduced slippage across a multichain landscape, marking a significant advancement in decentralized trading accessibility and performance. According to a press release, the collaboration links OKX’s advanced decentralized exchange (DEX) API with MetaMask, unlocking access to liquidity from over 500 DEXs across 25 blockchains. By embedding OKX’s aggregator into MetaMask’s swap feature, the companies aim to enhance trade efficiency and asset discoverability for millions of users navigating the increasingly fragmented DeFi space. Swapping tokens using OKX DEX aggregator (Source: OKX) “MetaMask’s ambitious multichain strategy toward becoming a universal wallet for the Web3 ecosystem aligns with the connected blockchain ecosystem we’re helping to build,” said Jeff Ren, founder of OKX Ventures. “We share a vision of a more accessible blockchain ecosystem where technical barriers disappear.” Ren added that the OKX DEX aggregator connects MetaMask users to a vast network of liquidity sources, executing trades in under 100 milliseconds — a speed that rivals centralized exchanges (CEXs) and represents a milestone for DEX infrastructure. Beyond performance improvements, the partnership also includes a critical security enhancement. OKX Wallet has integrated Consensys’ SERVO, a solution developed to protect users against Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) attacks — a notorious threat in DeFi where malicious actors manipulate transaction order for profit. This is the first time SERVO has been integrated into a third-party wallet, and Consensys views it as a meaningful step toward user-aligned DeFi innovation. “MEV remains a complex challenge,” said Jason Linehan, chief strategy officer at Consensys. “OKX’s integration of Consensys SERVO reflects a strong commitment to user safety and protocol-aligned innovation.” Decentralized Trading Reaches New Heights The OKX-Consensys alliance arrives at a pivotal moment for onchain trading. With advances in aggregator speed and liquidity access, decentralized trading platforms are approaching execution parity with centralized counterparts, blurring the line between DEX and CEX performance. DEX to CEX volume ratios continue to climb, Ren noted, citing increased demand for self-custodial trading alternatives. He emphasized that the future of crypto trading will rely on a healthy interplay between DEX aggregators, specialized decentralized protocols, and centralized venues — each playing a role in liquidity optimization and ecosystem resilience. This vision resonates with a broader trend across DeFi: reducing user friction while enhancing protocol security, especially as more capital migrates to onchain markets. This isn’t the first time OKX’s DEX infrastructure has made headlines in recent months. In March, the company temporarily shut down its DEX aggregator after identifying an exploit attempt linked to North Korea’s infamous Lazarus Group. The incident occurred amid an ongoing EU regulatory probe into the role of OKX Web3 and its wallet tools in facilitating illicit transactions following the $1.5 billion Bybit hack. In response to these developments, OKX has significantly fortified its defenses. New features include real-time blocking of suspicious addresses, transaction warnings, and third-party audits from firms like CertiK, Hacken, and SlowMist. The platform has also launched a bug bounty program to proactively detect and address vulnerabilities. A New Era for Wallet-Native Trading The partnership between OKX and Consensys signals a transformative moment for Web3 wallets, which are rapidly evolving from passive asset managers into full-service financial interfaces. MetaMask’s integration with a high-speed aggregator and MEV defense layers shows the wallet’s growing ambition to become a central hub for multichain DeFi engagement. As wallets like MetaMask evolve and protocols like SERVO become standard defenses, user expectations are shifting toward CEX-grade performance with DeFi-native security and control. In this context, the OKX-Consensys collaboration is not just about aggregation — it’s about redefining what self-custody trading can look like in the next generation of Web3. Bitget Secures Regulatory Approval in Georgia, Expands Crypto Services Amid Global Growth Push Meanwhile, crypto exchange Bitget has received official regulatory approval to operate within Georgia’s Tbilisi Free Zone (TFZ), a move that marks a significant milestone in its European expansion strategy and broader global ambitions. The approval enables Bitget to offer a full suite of digital asset services, including spot trading, futures, and copy trading, in a fully compliant, locally regulated environment. In a statement issued Thursday, Bitget confirmed its status as a registered digital asset exchange and custodial wallet provider under Georgian jurisdiction, granting the platform enhanced credibility and operational leeway within a region known for its crypto-forward stance and favorable tax climate. Georgia: A Strategic Launchpad for European Crypto Expansion Bitget’s entry into Georgia underscores the country’s growing significance as a crypto hub in Eastern Europe. While the European Union continues implementing its Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) framework, Georgia offers a proactive, business-friendly regulatory landscape that enables crypto companies to operate with more flexibility. As Europe moves toward MiCA implementation, Georgia stands out as a key market providing regulatory clarity, tax advantages, and real user adoption, according to Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget. She emphasized that the move enhances the platform’s ability to serve users with secure infrastructure, including proof of reserves transparency and a dedicated protection fund for user assets. Georgia’s Innovation and Technology Agency (GITA) has also contributed to the country’s growing crypto ecosystem by offering grants and incentives to blockchain startups and digital asset firms. The government has been actively engaging with crypto companies to shape legislation that fosters both innovation and compliance. Bitget’s regulatory footprint continues to widen across the continent as MiCA legislation, which aims to unify crypto regulation across the EU, gradually comes into force. Through its affiliate Archax, Bitget holds authorization from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Additionally, it is formally registered with Italy’s Organismo Agenti e Mediatori (OAM) and operates as a virtual asset service provider (VASP) in Poland, Bulgaria, Lithuania, and the Czech Republic. Bitget’s progressive alignment with regulatory frameworks across Europe gives it a competitive edge, especially as governments across the EU move toward tighter compliance and licensing requirements. For users, this means increased trust in the platform’s custodial capabilities and greater assurance of regulatory oversight. Bitget Wallet Expands into Southeast Asia with QR Payments in Vietnam In a parallel announcement reflecting the company’s global PayFi initiative, Bitget Wallet has launched national QR crypto payment support in Vietnam, using the country’s VietQR standard to allow everyday crypto transactions. Vietnam is the first market to implement this feature, enabling stablecoin payments for goods and services with major retailers and small businesses alike. “Users in Vietnam have already used Bitget Wallet to pay with stablecoins for everyday expenses like food, groceries, and retail items simply by scanning VietQR codes,” said Jamie Elkaleh, Chief Marketing Officer at Bitget Wallet. The new feature supports payments in USDT, USDC, and other stablecoins across various blockchain networks including Ethereum, Tron, Solana, Base, TON, and BNB Chain. An upcoming update will introduce auto-swap functionality, allowing payments with any token by automatically converting it at the point of sale. The QR payment integration is made possible through a partnership with AEON’s crypto payment framework, connecting Bitget Wallet to over 55 financial institutions, including VietinBank and Vietcombank. With over 2 million merchants nationwide accepting VietQR, the move positions Bitget Wallet as a front-runner in real-world crypto utility. Bitget’s QR initiative arrives at a time of evolving regulatory clarity in Vietnam. Just days ago, the National Assembly passed the Law on Digital Technology Industry, which for the first time formally recognizes crypto assets within a legal framework. Effective Jan. 1, 2026, the law establishes distinct definitions for crypto assets and virtual assets, while also introducing cybersecurity and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements that align with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) global standards.

Things are always moving fast, especially when it comes to regulation. A significant development making waves is the latest forecast from the decentralized prediction market platform, Polymarket. Traders there are placing high odds on a major piece of Stablecoin Regulation passing in the United States. What Does the Latest Polymarket Prediction Tell Us? According to reports, traders on Polymarket are indicating a significant 89% probability that the proposed stablecoin regulation bill, known as the GENIUS Act, will officially become law in the United States. Polymarket allows users to bet on the outcome of future events, essentially pooling collective intelligence to form predictions. While not a guarantee, such a high percentage on a platform used by informed traders is a strong signal of perceived likelihood. Why is this prediction getting attention? Prediction markets like Polymarket can sometimes offer insights into market sentiment and expectations regarding specific events, especially those with clear, verifiable outcomes like legislative votes. The high confidence level suggests that many participants believe the stars are aligning for this particular bill. Breaking Down the GENIUS Act So, what exactly is the GENIUS Act, and why is it considered a potential benchmark for US Stablecoin Law ? This proposed legislation aims to establish a clear regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers operating in the United States. Here are some of its key provisions: Licensing Requirements: The bill would mandate that stablecoin issuers obtain specific licenses to operate. This is a common approach in financial regulation to ensure entities meet certain standards. 100% Reserves: A crucial part of the bill is the requirement for stablecoin issuers to maintain reserves equal to 100% of the value of the stablecoins they have issued. This aims to ensure that every stablecoin is backed by an equivalent amount of high-quality, liquid assets, making them more stable and trustworthy. Audit Requirements: For larger issuers, specifically those with a market capitalization of $50 billion or more, the bill imposes regular audit requirements. This adds a layer of transparency and accountability, allowing regulators and the public to verify that reserve requirements are being met. Regulation for Foreign Issuers: The bill also includes provisions to regulate stablecoin issuers based outside the U.S. but serving U.S. customers. This is important for preventing regulatory arbitrage and ensuring a level playing field. These provisions are designed to address concerns about stablecoin stability, consumer protection, and potential systemic risk within the financial system. If passed, the GENIUS Act could provide much-needed clarity for the industry and potentially pave the way for broader adoption of stablecoins within a regulated environment. The Legislative Journey: Where Does the Bill Stand? The path to becoming US Stablecoin Law involves several steps through the U.S. legislative system. The GENIUS Act has already cleared a significant hurdle: It previously passed the final vote in the U.S. Senate. This indicates a level of bipartisan support or at least sufficient consensus to move forward from the upper chamber of Congress. The bill is now awaiting a vote in the House of Representatives. This is the next major test. The House has its own procedures and priorities, and getting a bill passed requires navigating various committees and political dynamics. If it successfully passes the House, the final step would be obtaining President Donald Trump’s signature to officially enact it into law. While the prediction market suggests a high likelihood, the legislative process can sometimes be unpredictable, with potential delays or amendments. What Could This Mean for Crypto Regulation US ? The potential passage of the GENIUS Act is a significant event for the broader landscape of Crypto Regulation US . Stablecoins are a critical bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world, often used for trading, payments, and lending within the digital asset ecosystem. Regulating them is seen by many policymakers as a necessary step to integrate digital assets more safely into the financial system. Potential Benefits: Increased Clarity: A clear federal framework could reduce uncertainty for businesses and investors. Enhanced Trust: Reserve and audit requirements could build confidence in stablecoins among mainstream users and institutions. Foundation for Future Regulation: The GENIUS Act could set a precedent and provide a template for regulating other types of digital assets. Potential Challenges: Compliance Burden: Meeting the requirements, especially for smaller issuers, could be costly and complex. Impact on Innovation: Some worry that strict regulations could stifle innovation in the stablecoin space. Jurisdictional Issues: Regulating foreign issuers presents unique challenges. The outcome of the House vote and presidential signature will be closely watched by everyone in the crypto space, from individual traders to large institutions. Actionable Insights: What Should You Watch For? Given the high Polymarket Prediction , it’s prudent to stay informed. Here’s what to keep an eye on: House of Representatives Schedule: Monitor news regarding when the GENIUS Act is expected to come up for a vote in the House. Debate and Amendments: Pay attention to any debates or proposed amendments in the House, as these could alter the bill’s final form. Industry Reaction: Observe how stablecoin issuers and other crypto companies react to the potential passage and prepare for compliance. Market Impact: While difficult to predict, the passage or failure of the bill could potentially impact the broader crypto market sentiment. This potential move towards federal Stablecoin Regulation highlights the growing interaction between the fast-paced world of digital assets and traditional government processes. The high probability indicated by Polymarket suggests that many believe this interaction is about to result in concrete legislation. Summary The decentralized prediction market Polymarket indicates a strong 89% chance that the GENIUS Act, a bill proposing significant US Stablecoin Law , will be enacted. This bill, having passed the Senate, awaits a House vote and presidential signature. It includes key provisions like licensing, 100% reserves, and audits, aiming to create a robust framework for Stablecoin Regulation . Its potential passage is a major development for Crypto Regulation US , promising clarity but also posing compliance challenges. The high Polymarket Prediction underscores the market’s expectation of this regulatory shift, making it a critical event for the crypto community to monitor.

While familiar names like XRP, Solana, Kaspa, and TRON remain key players in the broader crypto conversation, a growing wave of investor attention is flowing toward MAGACOINFINANCE — a project increasingly seen as the next early-mover opportunity in a shifting market. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early Entries Signal Growing Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing strategic capital at a rapid pace — and for good reason. Traders are no longer just speculating — they’re positioning. The project’s early fundamentals are resonating across the crypto space, particularly among those looking for asymmetric returns ahead of broader listing activity. What’s fueling the shift: Token supply is permanently capped at 170 billion — no hidden minting risks Staking is live, giving investors passive income and deeper engagement Smart contract fully audited by HashEx, boosting trust and credibility 100% community-owned model with no VC overrides or centralized treasury On-chain behavior shows long-term holders accumulating rather than exiting Limited-time promo offer PATRIOTS100X adds an extra incentive for early entries These elements are combining to push MAGACOINFINANCE beyond meme territory and into the category of structured, growth-ready altcoins. XRP Sees Renewed Hope as Legal Finish Line Nears XRP is inching closer to regulatory resolution. The SEC and Ripple have jointly filed to release $125 million from escrow, signaling that long-running litigation may finally be nearing its end. This has re-energized investor interest, especially as speculation rises around a potential XRP ETF and institutional adoption. However, uncertainty still lingers, leading some traders to look elsewhere while final decisions play out. Solana (SOL) Maintains Strong On-Chain Activity Solana (SOL) continues to perform well under the hood. Its transaction speed, active user base, and expanding developer ecosystem keep it competitive among Layer 1s. Yet, in the absence of a new headline catalyst, SOL’s price action has remained relatively range-bound. Traders are still optimistic but are increasingly allocating capital toward newer assets with shorter feedback loops and more aggressive reward structures. Kaspa (KAS) Flies Under the Radar Kaspa (KAS) hasn’t generated major excitement recently, but that doesn’t mean it’s out of the picture. It remains a favorite among infrastructure-focused traders who appreciate its technical foundation. However, the lack of breakout narratives or momentum shifts has limited broader investor attention, prompting a shift toward tokens with more active market behavior and strategic positioning. TRON (TRX) Stays Reliable, But Slow to Move TRON (TRX) remains a stable force in the crypto world, especially in the stablecoin space. Founder Justin Sun continues to promote the ecosystem, and the network consistently ranks high in usage metrics. Still, TRX hasn’t produced the kind of movement traders seek during fast rotations, leading some to exit in favor of more immediate opportunities like MAGACOINFINANCE. Final Thoughts With Bitcoin and Ethereum stabilizing and coins like XRP, SOL, KAS, and TRX maintaining mixed signals, investors are actively seeking a stronger edge — and MAGACOINFINANCE is quickly stepping in to fill that gap. From staking to smart tokenomics, it’s earning the trust of early movers who know the value of getting in before the rest of the market catches on.

CryptoQuant Flags Historic Demand Collapse,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-crash-ahead-cryptoquant-flags-historic-demand-collapse/,"The post Bitcoin Price Crash Ahead? CryptoQuant Flags Historic Demand Collapse appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin continues to hover around $104,500, despite growing geopolitical tensions. Some analysts see this calm as a sign of a maturing market, while others warn of potential downside. CryptoQuant’s June 19 report issues the most alarming call situation in the crypto space as BTC could fall to $92,000 or even $81,000 if demand weakens further. Key indicators show ETF flows are down over 60% since April, and whale accumulation has halved. Their demand momentum tracker has hit a historic low, raising red flags. However, Glassnode isn’t sounding the alarm. Instead, they interpret the lull as a natural shift toward a more institutionalized market. On-chain activity is quiet, but large transfers remain consistent, signaling increased use by major players. Derivatives volume now outpaces spot by up to 16x, suggesting deeper, more strategic market behavior. Flowdesk, a trading firm, offers a middle-ground view. It calls the market “coiled” rather than cracking and notes growth in tokenized assets like gold-backed XAUT and RWAs. This could signal a breakout ahead, direction unknown. Institutional vs Retail: A Tipping Point The balance between institutional accumulation and retail retreat seems to be the key tension. With retail interest fading, institutional moves could drive big swings in price, up or down. Even betting markets like Polymarket are split between BTC dropping to $90K or rallying to $120K by month-end . Bitcoin's elite vs. mortal wallets are moving in two different directions as its market value sits just north of $104.3K. Wallets with 10+ $BTC : +231 Wallets in 10 Days (+0.15%) Wallets with 0.001 to 10 $BTC : -37,465 Wallets in 10 Days (+0.15%) When large wallets… pic.twitter.com/uhZf6rPYvq — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 19, 2025 According to on-chain data provider Santiment, this split in sentiment between elite investors and retail participants could be a key signal for Bitcoin’s next move. According to Santiment, large Bitcoin wallets holding 10 or more BTC have grown by 231 in the last 10 days. Meanwhile, smaller wallets, those with between 0.001 and 10 BTC, have declined by over 37,000. This classic pattern, where retail runs while whales accumulate, has often preceded bullish reversals in the past. With BTC still hovering near $104.3K, some see this as a sign that smart money may be positioning for a leg up. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Altcoin Season Delayed?

The global crypto market is experiencing a slight downturn. Bitcoin is hovering around $104,500, with other major tokens also seeing minor dips, indicating cautious investor sentiment. Why is Bitcoin price down today? Bitcoin’s price dip is largely attributed to weakened demand, a significant drop in ETF inflows, and decreased whale accumulation, as per CryptoQuant’s analysis. Geopolitical tensions also play a role. How low can Bitcoin price go during this crash? Some analysts like CryptoQuant suggest Bitcoin could fall to $92,000 or even $81,000 if demand continues to weaken. Others like Peter Schiff have predicted even lower, around $20,000, if correlation with Nasdaq holds.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-20 05:30:44

US West Texas Intermediate crude for July, which did not trade on Thursday because of a holiday, was up $0.53, or 0.7%, at $75.67 a barrel. Earlier on Thursday, prices spiked by nearly 3% after Israel struck what it called nuclear-related sites in Iran, and Iran responded with missile and drone attacks on Israel following an overnight strike on an Israeli hospital. The week-old clash between the two countries showed no signs of easing. However, gains were trimmed on Friday when the White House press secretary said President Donald Trump would decide within the next two weeks whether to commit U.S. forces to the Israel-Iran fight. “Oil prices surged amid fears of increased U.S. involvement in Israel’s conflict with Iran. However, the White House press secretary later suggested there was still time for de-escalation,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at The Price Futures Group. Iran, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, extracts about 3.3 million barrels of crude oil each day, making it the group’s third-largest producer. Roughly 18 million to 21 million barrels per day of oil and oil products pass through the Strait of Hormuz along Iran’s southern coast. Traders and analysts worry that any widening of the conflict could disrupt shipments and tighten global supplies. “The ‘two-week deadline’ is a tactic Trump has used in other key decisions. Often these deadlines expire without concrete action, which would see the crude oil price remain elevated and potentially build on recent gains,” noted Tony Sycamore, an analyst at IG. US stock futures slipped on Thursday eve US stock futures slipped on Thursday evening as investors weighed the prospect of US military involvement in the Israel-Iran war and a two-week deadline set by President Trump for a decision on entering the conflict. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell more than 0.4%, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped roughly 0.3%. Markets were closed on Thursday for Juneteenth, giving traders a pause as global news grew tense. On Wall Street, investors were also digesting remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. After the Fed kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, Powell said policymakers were not in a hurry to cut rates and would base decisions on incoming data. According to CME Group, most traders expect a rate cut by the Fed’s September meeting. President Trump renewed his criticism of Powell on Thursday, accusing him of costing the US “hundreds of billions of dollars” by keeping rates high. He added a personal attack, calling Powell “one of the dumbest, and most destructive, people in Government.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Recent events surrounding the Abstract Chain hack serve as a stark reminder of the ever-present dangers lurking in the digital realm. Reports indicate that the official X (formerly Twitter) account belonging to Abstract Chain was compromised, leading to the promotion of a fraudulent memecoin scam. What Happened During the Abstract Chain X Account Hack? According to community reports circulating online, the official X account for Abstract Chain was taken over by malicious actors. These hackers wasted no time, leveraging the account’s credibility to push a scam. The core of their scheme involved promoting a supposed new “ABS” meme coin said to be launching on the Solana blockchain. They even went so far as to share a contract address, a common tactic to lend a false sense of legitimacy to the fake token. This type of incident highlights a critical vulnerability: official social media channels. Projects invest heavily in building a following and trust on platforms like X. When these accounts are compromised, the scammers gain immediate access to a large, engaged audience who might mistakenly believe the fraudulent posts are official communications from the project team. Why Are Memecoin Scams and Solana Scams So Prevalent? The recent surge in popularity of memecoins, particularly on networks like Solana, has unfortunately created fertile ground for scammers. Memecoins are often characterized by their viral nature, community-driven hype, and sometimes, a lack of clear utility beyond speculation. This environment of rapid price swings and fear of missing out (FOMO) can make individuals less cautious than they might be with more established cryptocurrencies. Solana, known for its speed and low transaction costs, has become a popular network for launching new tokens, including memecoins. While this fosters innovation, it also lowers the barrier for bad actors to deploy scam tokens and execute rug pulls. A Solana scam often preys on the excitement surrounding the ecosystem’s growth. Common tactics in memecoin scams include: Promising unrealistic returns or guaranteed profits. Creating fake social media hype and using bots to simulate community interest. Deploying tokens with malicious code that prevents users from selling. Performing “rug pulls,” where the creators suddenly drain liquidity after attracting investments. Using compromised official accounts, as seen in the Abstract Chain hack , to lend false credibility. How to Spot a Potential Crypto Scam: Actionable Insights Protecting yourself from a crypto scam requires vigilance and a healthy dose of skepticism. Here are some actionable steps you can take: Verify Information Sources: Always cross-reference announcements. If you see something on social media, check the project’s official website, Discord, or other established channels. Does the announcement appear elsewhere? Are there official blog posts or press releases? Be Wary of Unsolicited Promotions: Be extremely cautious of sudden, unexpected announcements, especially those urging you to act quickly or send funds immediately. Legitimate projects usually have planned announcement schedules. Scrutinize Contract Addresses: Never interact with a contract address shared only on social media, especially after a reported hack. Verify the official contract address through reliable, official project documentation (like their whitepaper or official website). Use blockchain explorers to check the contract’s activity and code if you have the technical knowledge. Research the Project and Token: Before investing in any new token, especially a memecoin, research its purpose, team (if public), tokenomics, and community sentiment (beyond just hype). Look for red flags like anonymous teams, vague roadmaps, or overly aggressive marketing. Understand Memecoin Risks: Recognize that memecoins are inherently high-risk and speculative. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Not every new coin will be the next success story. Check for Social Media Anomalies: If an account suddenly starts posting content that is drastically different from its usual style, or posts about unexpected token launches, it could be a sign the account has been compromised. Look for strange links, poor grammar, or urgent calls to action. Strengthening Your Crypto Security Against Social Media Hacks Beyond spotting scams, enhancing your own crypto security is paramount. A compromised X account, while damaging to the project, can also impact users who interact with malicious links or contract addresses posted from it. Tips for users: Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): This is non-negotiable for all your online accounts, especially crypto exchanges, wallets, and social media used for crypto news. Use authenticator apps (like Authy or Google Authenticator) or hardware keys over SMS-based 2FA, which can be vulnerable to SIM swap attacks. Use Strong, Unique Passwords: Never reuse passwords. Use a password manager to create and store complex, unique passwords for each account. Beware of Phishing Attempts: Be cautious of unsolicited emails, direct messages, or links that ask for your private keys, seed phrase, or login credentials. Scammers often impersonate legitimate projects or support staff. Educate Yourself: Stay informed about common scam tactics and security best practices in the crypto space. For crypto projects and individuals managing official accounts: Implement Robust Account Security: Use the strongest available security measures on social media accounts, including mandatory 2FA for all team members with access. Limit Account Access: Restrict who has posting privileges on official accounts. Have an Incident Response Plan: Know exactly what steps to take if an account is compromised, including how to communicate the hack to the community immediately through alternative, secure channels. Monitor Accounts: Regularly check official accounts for any unauthorized activity. The Challenge of Trust in the Wake of a Social Media Hack Incidents like the Abstract Chain X account hacked situation pose a significant challenge to trust within the crypto community. When official channels are compromised, it erodes confidence in the project and the platforms used for communication. Rebuilding that trust requires transparency, swift action, and reinforced security measures. It serves as a critical reminder that even seemingly legitimate sources can be compromised. Users must develop their own robust verification processes and not rely solely on social media announcements, especially concerning financial decisions. Conclusion: Staying Safe in the Crypto Wild West The Abstract Chain hack promoting a memecoin scam on Solana is just one example in a continuous stream of malicious activity targeting the crypto space. While the potential rewards in crypto can be significant, so are the risks, particularly from scams and security breaches. By understanding how these scams operate, recognizing the red flags, and implementing strong personal and project-level security measures, we can navigate this exciting but challenging landscape more safely. Always verify, stay skeptical of easy money promises, and prioritize the security of your accounts and assets.

The healthcare tech firm plans to achieve this through equity offerings, debt financing, and cash flow, with the goal of holding 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and 42,000 by 2026. To lead the initiative, Semler appointed Bitcoin researcher Joe Burnett as director of Bitcoin strategy. While the move aligns with the broader corporate trend of accumulating Bitcoin as a treasury asset, analysts also raised concerns about potential risks if the firm’s stock declines further. Meanwhile, Kraken launched a Bitcoin staking product via Babylon Labs that will allow users to earn rewards without leaving the exchange. Additionally, XBTO and Arab Bank Switzerland introduced a Bitcoin yield product targeting institutional clients looking for non-speculative BTC income strategies. Semler Scientific Targets 105,000 Bitcoin Semler Scientific Inc., a healthcare technology firm, unveiled an ambitious plan to expand its Bitcoin holdings nearly 28-fold over the next two-and-a-half years. The company currently holds 3,808 BTC, and plans to reach 105,000 BTC by 2027. Semler plans to hold 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, increase that to 42,000 BTC by the end of 2026, and ultimately achieve its target using a mix of equity offerings, debt financing, and operational cash flow. Announcement from Semler Scientific To spearhead this strategy, Semler appointed Bitcoin researcher Joe Burnett as its new director of Bitcoin strategy. Burnett brings experience from his previous roles at Unchained and Blockware Solutions, as well as a background at Big Four firm EY. He pointed out that the movement among public companies to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset is gaining more momentum. Semler’s commitment to Bitcoin began in 2024 and already earned it the 13th spot among public companies with the largest Bitcoin holdings, based on data from BitBo. The company’s plan mirrors the growing trend of businesses prioritizing Bitcoin accumulation, sometimes even ahead of their core operations. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet, for example, also announced its goal to acquire 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. If Semler achieves its target, it will control 0.5% of Bitcoin’s fixed 21 million supply. However, this aggressive strategy isn’t without its critics. VanEck researcher Matthew Sigel recently warned that firms heavily dependent on Bitcoin purchases and at-the-market equity programs could face challenges if their stock prices fall too close to their net asset values. In such scenarios, issuing more shares could result in shareholder dilution rather than value creation. Sigel specifically pointed to Semler as it is nearing this critical point. This is because its stock declined almost 41% year-to-date and is approaching pre-Bitcoin purchase levels. Semler Scientific YTD share price (Source: Google Finance ) Despite this, Semler's Bitcoin bet has so far been profitable. On June 3, the company reported an unrealized gain of $177 million on its Bitcoin holdings, which is a 287% yield. Among public firms holding Bitcoin, Semler boasts the fourth-highest Bitcoin-per-share ratio at 0.00034. Kraken Launches Bitcoin Staking with Babylon Buying is not the only way companies are taking advantage of Bitcoins current momentum. Kraken launched a new Bitcoin staking service through an integration with Babylon Labs, offering users a way to earn rewards on their Bitcoin without relying on bridging, wrapping, or lending mechanisms. The service was introduced on 19 June, and it allows Kraken users to stake their BTC directly from the exchange. Instead of moving their assets to external wallets, users can lock their Bitcoin in a secure vault on the Bitcoin blockchain, which is then delegated via the Babylon protocol to support proof-of-stake networks. In return, participants receive rewards in the form of Babylon’s native BABY token , which saw a nearly 5% price increase after the announcement was made. Kraken’s global head of consumer, Mark Greenberg, explained that a large portion of Bitcoin on the exchange sits idle, which is a missed opportunity both for clients and the broader ecosystem. He stated that the Babylon integration makes it possible for clients to put their Bitcoin to work while also supporting emerging PoS blockchains by contributing Bitcoin’s economic weight to their security and validation processes. This initiative is part of the trend known as BTCFi, or Bitcoin-based decentralized finance, which aims to bring more utility to Bitcoin beyond its traditional role as a store of value. While early BTCFi efforts include the now-legacy Omni Layer used to move Tether before Ethereum, newer projects like Babylon are allowing Bitcoin holders to participate in staking through native, time-locked mechanisms that don’t require intermediaries. The BABY token accrues from 8% annual inflation split equally between BTC and BABY stakers. It also enables participation in governance and pays for transaction fees. BTCFi TVL growth (Source: Binance ) Other BTCFi examples include Bitcoin sidechains like Rootstock, the Liquid Network, and Bitcoin’s Lightning Network combined with Taproot Assets for tokenization. Recent developments showed that there is growing traction for these protocols. In early May, Rootstock saw a major uptick in network security and mining activity, while Binance reported in April that the total value locked in Bitcoin-based DeFi had surged over 2,700% in the past year. XBTO and Arab Bank Launch Bitcoin Yield Product Crypto investment firm XBTO recently partnered with Arab Bank Switzerland to launch a Bitcoin yield product that is tailored for the bank’s wealth management clients. The offering is an answer to the growing institutional demand for structured yield strategies that allow Bitcoin holders to generate returns without liquidating their assets. XBTO will apply its proprietary “diamond-hands” strategy, which combines the sale of Bitcoin options to collect premiums with a long-term accumulation approach during market dips. This strategy, used in XBTO’s regulated Bitcoin yield fund in Bermuda, has produced annualized returns of approximately 5% with comparatively low volatility. Javier Rodriguez-Alarcon, XBTO’s chief investment officer, shared that institutional clients are no longer satisfied with just price exposure and are looking for more sophisticated digital asset solutions. Romain Braud, head of digital assets at Arab Bank Switzerland, pointed out that their clientele has increasingly shown interest in yield-generation strategies that are implemented in a controlled risk environment. Traditionally, Bitcoin was seen only as a buy-and-hold asset, with yield generation largely inaccessible outside of speculative trading or lending. However, the maturation of the crypto market and the evolution of financial tools like derivatives and staking models allowed holders to earn income from their BTC positions. Despite the appeal, Bitcoin yield products are not without risks. As pointed out by OneSafe , these products can be impacted by impermanent loss, uncertain regulatory frameworks, high volatility, and vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Nevertheless, a number of firms are entering the space with similar offerings, including Hilbert Capital’s Bitcoin Yield Solution, Purpose Investments’ Purpose Bitcoin Yield ETF, NEOS’ Bitcoin High Income ETF, and Coinbase’s recently launched Bitcoin Yield Fund.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-20 05:49:02

This event is slightly larger than last week’s options expiry, but the impact on spot markets is likely to be minimal. They have been on the back foot all week, losing $30B since Monday, as crypto assets cool amid rising Middle East tensions. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s tranche of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 1.16, meaning that there are more short sellers than longs, but not by much. There is also a max pain point of $106,000, around $1,500 above current spot prices, which is where most losses will be made on contract expiry. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at strike prices between $115,000 and $140,000, with more than $1.7 billion at each price, as bullish speculators remain confident, according to Deribit.

In addition to today’s Bitcoin options, there are around 215,000 Ethereum contracts that are also expiring, with a notional value of $546 million, a max pain point of $2,600, and a put/call ratio of 0.68. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $3.9 billion. Crypto Market Outlook Total market capitalization has fallen a further 2% on the day to $3.37 trillion, but it remains within a range-bound channel that formed in early May. Bitcoin has been flat over the past 24 hours with a slight dip to $104,600 at the time of writing. However, it has fallen 3.8% from its weekly high of $108,770 on Tuesday, but support levels continue to hold despite the escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Ethereum prices are also holding above support at $2,500, and the asset has moved very little over the past 48 hours.

Bitcoin BTC hovered near $104,700 during Asia hours, slipping 1.2% over 24 hours, while ether ETH traded just below $2,860, down 1.8% on the day. The soft price action tracks with broader macro unease following Wednesday’s FOMC hold, where the Fed kept rates unchanged but reiterated a cautious, inflation-sensitive stance. Seasonality is starting to show Historically subdued during the June-July stretch, crypto markets have entered a lull with BTC front-end implied volumes slipping under 40%, erasing the risk premium from recent geopolitical tension, Singapore-based QCP Capital noted in a Thursday market broadcast. Open interest across BTC and ETH perps remains flat, and option markets skew negative, with puts trading at a premium to calls – a sign of traders hedging against short-term pullbacks. “There’s been no change to the technical picture, which remains supportive of another push to the topside,” said Joel Kruger, strategist at LMAX Group, in an email to CoinDesk. “BTC continues to consolidate bullishly, and a move through recent highs could set up a run toward $145,000.” Ether still lags its 2021 highs but is gaining momentum, he added. “Clearing $2,900 could bring $3,400 into play,” Kruger said. One bright spot for crypto is the U.S. Senate’s passage of a stablecoin framework, which adds another building block to what is becoming a more regulatory-friendly global environment. That’s reinforced a broader institutional conviction. “Globally, we’re seeing continued progress that promises greater clarity and a more welcoming environment for institutional crypto adoption,” Kruger added. Still, the near-term setup remains cautious. Month-end OPEX flows, systematic rebalancing, and a lack of fresh catalysts could keep BTC stuck in its $ 102,000–$ 108,000 band for now. But with H2 historically strong for crypto, some desks are already looking ahead. “The worst may be behind us,” Kruger said. “And the next leg up could catch many off guard.”",Markets|Market|Bitcoin|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-20 05:53:28

It added that a “clear divergence” has emerged between market valuation and network activity, indicating that large institutions are becoming more dominant in network activity. Daily Bitcoin transactions have dropped from peaks of over 730,000 to around 320,000 to 500,000 in 2025. This has been primarily due to a sharp decrease in non-monetary transactions such as Inscriptions and Runes, it noted. Since the start of 2025, non-monetary activity has “declined significantly, heavily contributing to the recent contraction in overall network throughput.” Despite #Bitcoin ’s elevated price, a clear divergence has emerged between market valuation and network activity. In this report, we explore activity across both on and off-chain markets, and examine how network metrics have changed this cycle. Discover more in the latest Week… pic.twitter.com/vLhL7sllKK — glassnode (@glassnode) June 19, 2025 Transaction Size Matters One of the key findings from the analysts was a change in transaction size. The economic volume settled on the network has remained historically elevated, with a yearly average of $7.5 billion settled per day, it noted. However, the average transaction size has grown to around $36,000, indicating larger entities are increasingly dominating network usage. Additionally, transactions over $100,000 now account for 89% of network volume, up from 66% in 2022. “This trend implies that larger entities continue to utilize the Bitcoin network, with the throughput per transaction rising even as overall activity by count declines.” Glassnode also reported that transaction fees have dropped, creating a historical divergence. Typically, bull markets near all-time highs see fee spikes due to network congestion, but current fee pressure remains subdued despite elevated prices. This combination of low transaction count and a heightened volume throughput suggests “large entities” are becoming increasingly dominant for on-chain activity, it stated before concluding: “This shift highlights the maturation of the derivative complex around digital assets, and a move toward more stable risk management practices.” Retail Losing Confidence Meanwhile, Santiment reported that “elite” wallet and “mortal” wallet activity are also diverging. “When large wallets accumulate as retail loses confidence, this is historically the right combination for bullish momentum to inevitably return to crypto markets,” analysts noted. Additionally, traders are showing signs of “impatience and bearish sentiment,” it noted in a separate post, adding that markets “historically move in the opposite direction of retail’s expectations.” Meanwhile, the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index, which measures market sentiment, has returned to neutral as the asset continues to trade sideways.

Analyst Forecasts $130 Retest Before Next Wave Up,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-correction-about-to-end-analyst-forecasts-130-retest-before-next-wave-up/,"Amid the geopolitical turmoil, Solana (SOL) has retraced 10% in the past week. Some analysts believe that the altcoin’s correction is about to end, but warned that a dip below a key support level might come first. Related Reading: SUI Preparing For New Highs As Falling Wedge Breakout Targets $5 Solana Eyes Key Retest Before Breakout After retesting the $168 resistance last Wednesday, Solana has fallen back to a key level fueled by the recent market pullback. The cryptocurrency has seen a 15% retracement from its monthly highs, trading around the $140 zone for the past three days. SOL has been hovering between the $145-$180 price range since its May breakout, falling to the range lows during the June market shakeouts. Since then, the altcoin has struggled to reclaim the $160-$170 mid-zone. Nonetheless, market watcher Lluciano considers that Solana “may dip a bit more, but the ultimate target is seriously huge.” The analyst highlighted SOL’s performance since April, noting that it ended its multi-month downtrend after breaking above its descending resistance at the end of March. After this price action, SOL retested the $100-$120 demand zone before breaking out to its current range in the following weeks. Now, the altcoin’s chart displays a one-month falling wedge pattern, with the upper boundary sitting around the $155-$160 area. To the analyst, a breakout from this pattern could send the cryptocurrency toward May’s $187 high resistance before propelling the price to retest the $240 mark. Similarly, trader Rose noted that SOL has been consolidating above the key $145 resistance and 50-day Moving Average (MA), signaling a potential breakout. “If confirmed, the price could rise toward targets at $165, $183, and $220,” they suggested. SOL To Underperform In Coming Months? Market watcher Crypto Bullet suggested that Solana’s correction is coming to an end. The analyst forecasted that SOL could soon lose its current range and retest the April consolidation range, around the $125-$135 area, to complete the correction. This would be followed by a bounce back into the current range before surging past the $200 barrier toward the $220-$250 targets, for “one more wave up” this cycle. Meanwhile, Altcoin Sherpa affirmed Solana won’t outperform like it did during the first half of the cycle. According to the analyst, the cryptocurrency won’t outperform Bitcoin (BTC) on any long-term timeframe “other than a few blips here and there.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Setting Up For ‘Large Move’ Amid $103,000 Retest – Key Levels To Watch He explained that the cycle’s leading altcoin isn’t “dead,” but that he doesn’t “see it having a run like it did in 2021/2024.” Notably, SOL is currently retesting its late November 2023 support levels against BTC, which previously sent it to yearly lows after failing to hold them. Altcoin Sherpa concluded that Solana will likely continue to climb against its USDT pair but continue to bleed in its SOL/BTC chart. As of this writing, Solana is trading at $145, a 12.1% decline in the monthly timeframe.

While established players like Chainlink (LINK), Polkadot (DOT), Polygon (MATIC), and Cardano (ADA) remain closely monitored, Bitcoin (BTC) continues to anchor the broader market. Against this backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging from underdog status to become a standout gainer, drawing growing interest from strategic investors across the space. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Frontrunner in 2025’s Crypto Presale Landscape MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as a leading contender in the 2025 pre-sale arena, drawing significant interest from seasoned investors. Its capped supply strengthens its appeal, while the project’s blend of meme-driven identity and practical utility sets it apart in a crowded market. All smart contracts have been successfully audited by HashEx , reinforcing security and trust. Access remains limited through the official website, with a 100% bonus available for contributions using PATRIOTS100X . Chainlink (LINK): Bullish Momentum and Price Targets Chainlink (LINK) has seen a 29% gain over the past week, trading above $16.70 and showing strong upward momentum. Analysts forecast LINK could reach $24.54–$25.67 by September 2025, with bullish sentiment supported by increased DeFi adoption. As LINK continues its steady rise, some traders are rotating profits into MAGACOIN FINANCE, seeking sharper early-stage returns. Polkadot (DOT): Interoperability and Steady Growth Polkadot (DOT) is trading near $7.56, with technical indicators pointing to a potential move above $6.00 by year-end. DOT’s unique parachain technology and growing ecosystem are attracting developer and investor interest. However, as growth moderates, traders are increasingly allocating to MAGACOIN FINANCE for higher upside exposure. Polygon (MATIC): Layer-2 Utility and Rotation Trends Polygon (MATIC) is holding steady, with forecasts for June 2025 suggesting a range between $0.22 and $0.24. While MATIC remains a favorite for Ethereum scaling, the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing capital from MATIC holders seeking early-cycle gains. Cardano (ADA): Struggling for Support as Traders Diversify Cardano (ADA) is struggling to reclaim support above $0.65, facing bearish momentum in June. As ADA’s price action remains constrained, many traders are diversifying into MAGACOINFINANCE, attracted by its scarcity-driven tokenomics and parabolic growth potential. Final Thoughts With Solana, XRP, and Bitcoin providing stability, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the breakout story of 2025. As traders rotate out of established altcoins like LINK, DOT, MATIC, and ADA, the early accumulation in MAGACOIN FINANCE signals strong conviction in its future upside.

In an X post, Sun explained that their discussion revolved around how TRON and blockchain technology could bolster US dominance in digital assets. He argued that the support for the GENIUS Act has played a key role in pushing forward essential crypto policy reforms. Sun commented, “It was a pleasure meeting Bo Hines to discuss how TRON and blockchain technology can support US leadership in digital assets. Your support for the GENIUS Act has helped accelerate much-needed progress in crypto legislation.” He also thanked the Digital Sovereignty Alliance for bringing about these important discussions and for their significant help in advancing the GENIUS Act forward. Conversations between Sun and the political influencer Hines have roused crypto enthusiasts, mainly regarding how some legislation can impact the future of blockchains within the US. Analysts believe that earning political support could accelerate growth for the TRON ecosystem, especially in altcoins like TRX, which often react strongly to ecosystem-specific news. Most crypto community members who responded to Sun’s post reacted positively to their meeting, some claiming TRON is driving real change and expect bullish results. The president named Bo Hines, a former US congressional candidate and up-and-coming star, to become the executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets. Trump wants him to create crypto-friendly regulations and roll back the Biden administration’s crackdown on the cryptocurrency industry. Hines has fast become like a crypto prince, with crypto CEOs, venture capitalists, and lobbyists wanting to meet him. During his first 30 days on the job, Hines met with over 50 industry players, such as Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Andreessen Horowitz partners Chris Dixon and Marc Andreessen. Tron’s Sun and SRM agreed on a $100 million equity investment deal Justin Sun recently announced he would take his Tron blockchain platform public in the US through a reverse merger. On Monday, SRM Entertainment , a souvenir and toy manufacturer, confirmed that they agreed on a securities purchase with the TRON founder for a $100 million equity investment. It also claimed it would issue preferred shares and warrants to raise the deal’s value to about $210 million. So far, SRM has about 17.2 million common shares outstanding. The company added that it would change its name to Tron Incorporation, with Sun joining as the advisor. Then any gains from the investment will be directed toward establishing a Tron crypto token treasury, following the model popularized by Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Strategy, now adopted by multiple firms. SRM shares spiked by over 460% after the announcement, increasing the firm’s market cap to $140 million. Eric Trump, a son of US President Donald Trump, has denied reports that he will be involved in blockchain network Tron’s intent to pursue a public offering in the United States. However, he had positive things to say about the project’s founder, Justin Sun. “I’m the biggest fan of Tron,” Trump said on social media, adding that he admires Sun and considers him a “great friend and icon in the crypto space.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",News|TRON,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-20 06:00:38

The memecoin continues to show a bearish trend, with its price falling through June. It is now hovering above a key support level at $0.00001000. A breakdown below this level could send it lower, toward $0.00000900. PEPE Faces Downtrend, Technicals Remains Bearish Technical indicators also support a bearish outlook. Short to mid-term moving averages are signaling sell, and the RSI sits at 38, indicating weak momentum but not yet oversold. The MACD and momentum indicators also reflect selling pressure. While there are minor signs of a short-term bounce, they remain weak for now. The chart continues to show a clear downtrend, dominated by red candles and low buying volume. Unless fresh momentum comes in, a strong recovery is not likely right now. PEPE Eyes Breakout as Traders Load Up Analyst Lev Arden sees a bullish cup & handle forming on PEPE’s weekly chart. A breakout above $0.000014 could quickly push it to $0.0000227. He also notes a $74M surge in open interest, which shows that traders are ready to act. Can PEPE Hit $1? Despite the recent decline, Pepe Coin remains a top choice. But reaching $1 or even $0.01 for the token is extremely unlikely given its 420 trillion supply. Hitting $0.01 would require a multi-trillion-dollar market cap, which seems unrealistic in today’s market. Nevertheless, on-chain data shows that whales are increasing their holdings, and exchange balances are falling, which are positive signs. Pepe has formed a bullish flag and double-bottom pattern, which often signal potential breakouts. If the trend continues, Pepe could witness a strong rally. How High Can Pepe Go? Key Predictions Ahead Currently, Pepe’s market cap is around $4.3 billion. According to an analysis from CoinDCX, the short-term price targets for 2025 show Pepe could trade between $0.000006 and $0.000008 on the lower end and it could reach up to $0.000024 if momentum builds. Long-term targets might push it to $0.000031 or $0.000409, but those depend heavily on market conditions and sentiment. According to CoinCodex, Pepe Coin is expected to end 2025 between $0.00000805 and $0.00000829. For 2026, it expects Pepe to trade between $0.00000800 to $0.00002771.",News|Crypto news|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|PEPE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-20 06:02:22

All eyes are shifting toward Little Pepe (LILPEPE) —a newcomer priced under $0.0015 that has already caught fire in the crypto community. While DOGE continues its sluggish attempt to $1, LILPEPE is blazing through its presale stages with a momentum that screams breakout. And with a price goal of $0.30, many early buyers believe it will leave Dogecoin in the dust long before DOGE ever touches $1. This isn’t just hype for hype’s sake. LILPEPE is doing things differently, building a real ecosystem around meme coin culture with serious tech under the hood and a loyal, rapidly growing community behind it. The DOGE Fatigue Is Real DOGE would need to rally 155% from the current price to reach the neckline at $0.568. Beyond this, theoretical forecasting methods suggest another 90% move to reach $1.088. However, the crypto market outlook remains shaky due to concerns about a Bitcoin price crash. 1-Week DOGE/USD Chart Showcasing Adam & Eve Chart Pattern Latest data from Polymarket indicates a 68% chance of a DOGE ETF approval in 2025. Even though the SEC recently delayed approval of the Dogecoin spot ETF. Holders have grown weary. There’s no significant development on the Dogecoin network, no real roadmap, and no evolving utility. The market recognizes that DOGE’s move to $1 will necessitate extraordinary macroeconomic support, which may not arrive quickly enough. Meanwhile, upstarts like LILPEPE are outpacing DOGE in both community growth and technological innovation. LILPEPE Is More Than a Meme Priced currently at $0.0012 in its third presale stage, LILPEPE is being hailed as the meme coin to beat in 2025. And the reasons are obvious. Unlike most meme tokens, LILPEPE is launching its own dedicated Layer 2 chain, tailored explicitly for the meme coin ecosystem. It will be the first blockchain built exclusively for meme coins, offering speed, near-zero gas fees, and scalability. Even more revolutionary is the project’s bot-resistant architecture, which prevents sniper bots from hijacking launches—an issue that has plagued every major meme coin presale, including PEPE and FLOKI. This feature alone is generating massive buzz across Telegram and Twitter groups, as retail investors finally feel they have a level playing field. Add to that the LILPEPE Meme Launchpad, a dedicated platform that will allow other meme coin projects to launch safely and seamlessly on the LILPEPE chain. It’s infrastructure, not just hype—and that’s what gives this project staying power. Presale Selling Out Fast: $ 1.3 M+ Already Raised The presale tells the story. Stage 1 sold out in under 72 hours, and Stage 2 ended even faster, bringing total funds raised to over $1.3 million. Now, with Stage 3 underway at $0.0012, the price is still microscopic compared to the projected post-launch target of $0.30. At current pricing, a $1,000 investment in LILPEPE could potentially yield $250,000 if the token reaches its goal. The presale is available only through the official website littlepepe.com , where users can connect their crypto wallets to purchase tokens directly. Massive $777K Giveaway Adds Firepower. Fueling even more attention is the team’s $777,000 giveaway. In this promo, 10 lucky winners will each walk away with $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens—a staggering reward structure that has made LILPEPE the talk of social media. It’s not just about the money—it’s a clear statement from the team that they’re playing big-league ball and rewarding community loyalty in ways few projects do. This giveaway, alongside the presale success and growing media attention, has already helped push the project into the top tier of trending tokens. Could LILPEPE Hit $0.30? Skeptics will say $0.30 is a stretch for a token priced at less than $0.0015. But in crypto, these are precisely the bets that make fortunes. Dogecoin did a similar jump in 2021. PEPE did a 10,000% rally in 2023. If LILPEPE can continue its trajectory, especially with exchange listings and chain launch on the horizon, a $0.30 price target isn’t out of reach—it may even be conservative. The LILPEPE team has already confirmed upcoming listings on two top-tier centralized exchanges and has hinted that all preparations are in place for a debut on the largest global exchange. If those plans come through, LILPEPE could make history in record time. Final Thoughts Dogecoin will always be the pioneer of meme coins, but Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is shaping up to be the evolution. With a dedicated chain, anti-bot technology, a presale that’s selling out faster than anyone expected, and a wildly generous giveaway, LILPEPE has all the ingredients to hit $0.30 long before DOGE sees $1. And for investors who missed the boat on PEPE or DOGE’s early days, this may just be your second shot at turning a small bag into a life-changing portfolio.

The company argued that this drop was a signal that often occurs ahead of significant volatility or trend change in Bitcoin price.

The weaker the correlation, the stronger this signal becomes.” Related News: Big Bull Anthony Scaramucci Drops a Bold Prediction: “I Think It Will Surpass Ethereum” The company noted that Bitcoin miners are the most established elements in the crypto ecosystem, and that they currently hold more BTC than all ETFs combined.

According to a June 19 report by local media Yonhap News, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) has submitted a new crypto roadmap to the Presidential Committee on Policy Planning. The plan sets the stage for launching spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and regulating stablecoins by the second half of 2025. Regulators will build the necessary legal and technical infrastructure to support the ETFs, including rules around fund structuring, custody, pricing, and investor protection. The FSC’s push aims to align the local digital market scene with global standards, following increased calls from advocates within the region who argue that without action, the country risks falling behind other major markets. You might also like: Hong Kong accelerates stablecoin licensing to tap into global market boom Earlier this year, South Korea’s newly elected President, Lee Jae-myung , pledged to legalize spot crypto ETFs as part of his campaign. He also promised to create a unified oversight system to better protect investors and increase market transparency. In addition to the ETF reforms, the commission is working on legislation to govern the issuance of Korean Won-based stablecoins . It will also tighten rules around how virtual assets are listed and disclosed, as well as how local crypto businesses and service providers operate. Another major focus of the roadmap is tougher enforcement. The FSC plans to introduce stricter penalties for misconduct, including permanent bans and heavy fines for individuals or firms involved in illegal activities. Local exchanges will also be required to cut trading fees and improve transparency by publicly disclosing and comparing fees. This aligns with President Lee’s earlier pledge to lower transaction fees from the current average of 0.05% to around 0.015%, as part of efforts to support young traders. While the roadmap marks a major step forward in the nation’s ambitions, the FSC has emphasized that none of the proposals are confirmed or finalized yet, suggesting that the plan is still in its early stages.

According to a recent blogpost by Cisco Tallos, the PylangGhost is exclusively used by North Korea-affiliated cyber threat actors to infiltrate the hardware belonging to job seekers looking for roles in the crypto industry. The PylangGhost is a new kind of Python-based remote access trojan that functions similarly to the previously documented GolangGhost RAT that was discovered by Cisco Talos back in December 2024. Most recently, the cybersecurity firm found that it has been actively used by the hacking group called Famous Chollima to infiltrate Windows systems, while continuing to deploy a Golang-based version for MacOS users. So far, open-source data indicates that most of the victims affected by the malware are based in India . Famous Chollima is also nicknamed “Wagemole” because of their repeated attempts to steal passwords and infiltrate user’s crypto wallets as well as nab other sensitive information through fake job openings online. You might also like: Printer exploit reveals new threat to cryptocurrency wallets How do North Korean hackers catch their victims? According to the report, the hacker group lures its victims in through fake job interview campaigns using social engineering. The attackers then create fake job sites that impersonate major crypto firms, including Coinbase , Robinhood and Uniswap among others. The victims are then required to take part in multiple steps, initiated by fake recruiters. They are then invited to open fraudulent skill-testing websites where their personal information is gathered. When preparing for the fake interview, the user is then tricked into enabling permission for the site to access their camera and microphone access. During this phase, the fake recruiter will ask them to copy and execute malicious commands under the pretense of installing updated video drivers. Upon command execution, the malware is able to infiltrate their device. The command enables remote control access of the infected device and grants attackers access to cookies and credentials from over 80 browser extensions. These include access to password managers and cryptocurrency wallets, including MetaMask, 1Password, NordPass, Phantom, Bitski, Initia, TronLink and MultiverseX. As previously reported by crypto in April, another North Korean hacking collective, Lazarus Group, have also used similar methods to lure in users. The attackers would deploy fake job applications with at least three strains of detected malware linked to North Korean cyber operations.

On June 17, 2025, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an official order to begin proceedings on whether to approve or disapprove the proposed rule change that would allow Cboe BZX Exchange to list and trade shares of the Franklin XRP ETF. While the commission has yet to make a final decision, Generation Infinity (@GenfinityIO) noted that this is a significant action that places the fund under detailed regulatory scrutiny and also puts pressure on the SEC to decide on the ETF. Details Behind the ETF Proposal The Franklin XRP Trust aims to issue an ETF that holds physical XRP, with Coinbase Custody Trust Company serving as custodian. If approved, the ETF would track the CF Benchmark CME XRP-Dollar Index. The fund would only hold XRP, cash, and cash equivalents, and calculate net asset value daily at 4:00 p.m. ET using the benchmark index. The process began on March 13, 2025, when Cboe BZX submitted its proposal . It was published in the Federal Register on March 19. On April 29, the SEC exercised its authority to extend the review period to June 17. By June 17, the Commission had decided to formally open proceedings to determine whether the proposal was consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act. According to Generation Infinity, the next major deadline is expected around September 9, which marks the 180-day review threshold. $XRP ETF UPDATE (June 17) The SEC has officially opened proceedings to determine whether to approve or disapprove the proposed listing of the Franklin XRP ETF on Cboe BZX.

This provision requires that exchange rules be designed to prevent fraud and manipulation and protect investors and the public interest. According to the order, the SEC will conduct additional analysis and is actively requesting written public comments . The key concern is whether the XRP market is structured in a way that supports fair pricing and can resist manipulation. Interested parties are invited to submit written comments regarding the sufficiency of the Exchange’s arguments and whether the fund should be approved. In particular, the Commission is seeking opinions on whether the proposal raises “any new or novel concerns” not addressed in past decisions. All submissions are due by the end of July. Other countries are already taking the lead, as Canada recently launched its first spot ETF . The SEC will need to expedite the process if it plans to follow Trump’s agenda of making the U.S. the global leader in cryptocurrency.

Following a June 19 motion in the Senate, House Bill 2324 is headed back to the Arizona House of Representatives for reconsideration. The measure, which had previously failed to pass the House on May 7, was brought back after a narrow 16-14 Senate vote . Republican Senator Janae Shamp, one of the lawmakers who initially voted against the bill, filed the motion to reconsider. It must now secure a majority vote from the 60-member House, where Republicans hold 33 seats, after which it will proceed to Governor Katie Hobbs’ desk for potential approval. You might also like: Arizona governor signs bill to create Bitcoin and digital assets reserve fund What is HB 2324? HB 2324 proposes the creation of a “Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund” to manage assets seized through criminal forfeiture. It updates Arizona’s existing forfeiture laws to formally include digital assets such as cryptocurrencies, expanding legal definitions to cover virtual currencies and other digital-only items with economic value. The bill outlines new procedures for law enforcement agencies to seize, access, and store digital assets, including requirements to use secure, state-approved digital wallets. Under the proposed allocation system, the first $300,000 worth of forfeited digital assets would be directed to the Attorney General’s office. Any remaining value would be split, 50% to the Attorney General, 25% to the state’s general fund, and 25% to the newly established reserve fund. HB 2324 also clarifies regulations governing property forfeiture by adding protections for innocent owners and establishing limits on when other property types, such as vehicles, may be seized. Supporters of the bill argue the changes are needed to keep pace with the growing role of digital assets in criminal investigations and economic activity. HB 2324 differs significantly from House Bill 2749, which Governor Hobbs signed into law on the same day the former was initially rejected. HB 2749 allows the state to claim digital assets that have remained unclaimed for at least three years. These assets must be transferred to the Arizona Department of Revenue in their original digital form. Unlike HB 2324, HB 2749 does not deal with criminal forfeiture or law enforcement procedures. Instead, it establishes a regulatory process for identifying and managing abandoned assets, along with a reserve fund that may receive staking rewards or airdrops. Importantly, HB 2749 prohibits the use of taxpayer money, focusing only on assets already in state possession due to abandonment. Both bills involve the creation of a “Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund,” but the funding mechanisms and purposes differ. HB 2749’s fund is sourced from unclaimed property and is subject to legislative appropriation, while HB 2324’s version is tied to seized assets from criminal proceedings. Arizona is not the only state taking steps toward integrating digital assets into public finance. Earlier this year, New Hampshire passed House Bill 302, becoming the first U.S. state to authorize its treasurer to invest up to 10% of public funds in Bitcoin and other qualifying digital assets with a market cap of over $500 billion.

While Bitcoin (BTC) remains the market’s foundation, attention is quickly shifting to high-upside altcoins backed by strong fundamentals and vibrant community support. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the dark horse of the cycle, capturing the interest of analysts and traders who see it as a potential market leader before year-end. Powerhouse Performance: MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Early Investment Surge MAGACOIN FINANCE is now positioned as a front-runner for exponential growth, emerging as a powerhouse in the altcoin presale market. The presale’s exclusivity, combined with a 100% token bonus for larger buyers using PATRIOTS100X, is creating a surge in demand. The project’s transparent token distribution and capped supply are central to its appeal. Industry leaders anticipate strong post-listing performance and sustained investor interest. Highlights of the project: Contract audited by HashEx Transparent and capped tokenomics Potential major CEX listing and bullish updates on the horizon For those seeking a strategic entry with real fundamentals and viral momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a must-watch for 2025 . Solana (SOL): Bullish Structure and Institutional Support While Solana continues to impress with robust institutional support and a price hovering near $158–$165, many traders are now diversifying into MAGACOINFINANCE, recognizing its unique blend of scarcity, transparency, and community energy as the next evolution in high-growth altcoins. As SOL eyes a breakout above $165, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly seen as a parallel opportunity for outsized returns. Toncoin (TON): Breakout and Bullish Reversal Toncoin’s technical breakout above $3.20 has caught the attention of momentum traders, but the smart investors’ interest is around MAGACOINFINANCE’s ability to capture early-stage hype and convert it into sustained growth. As TON continues its bullish reversal, savvy investors are hedging with MAGACOIN FINANCE for asymmetric upside. Optimism (OP): Uptrend and Price Forecasts Optimism’s strong weekly gains and Layer-2 leadership keep it in the spotlight, yet many OP holders are rotating profits into MAGACOINFINANCE. The project’s audited smart contracts and transparent tokenomics offer a rare combination of security and upside, making it a compelling alternative for those seeking the next big winner. Sei (SEI): Strong Uptrend and Bullish Sentiment Sei’s uptrend and expanding ecosystem are drawing attention, but MAGACOINFINANCE’s viral community and real on-chain growth are setting a new standard for early-stage success. As SEI targets $1.08, the parallel surge in MAGACOIN FINANCE participation underscores growing market conviction in its breakout thesis. Final Thoughts With Solana, Toncoin, Optimism, and Sei all making headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as the dark horse that could outpace the entire market in 2025. Its unmatched fundamentals, security, and momentum make it a top pick for bold investors this year.

This latest surge came just after the U.S. Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill aiming to create a national framework for regulating stablecoins like USDC, which Circle issues. President Trump publicly supported the bill, calling on the House to pass it swiftly. Market reaction was swift too: Coinbase stock jumped 16% , reflecting broader investor optimism around U.S.-regulated digital assets. Circle’s USDC is the second-largest USD stablecoin globally, holding a $61.4 billion market cap and accounting for 25% of all stablecoins in circulation. As banks and tech giants explore the stablecoin space, CRCL’s rise could also set the stage for upcoming IPOs from firms like Kraken and Gemini. Three key takeaways: Circle stock (CRCL) is up over 530% since its $31 IPO , now nearing $200. The GENIUS Act boosts market confidence , with strong political and investor backing.

The latest government data , published Friday, showed that core CPI rose 3.7% year-on-year in May, outpacing forecasts of 3.6% and speeding up from April’s 3.5%. Inflation has now gone over the BOJ’s 2% target for more than three straight years. That makes it harder for the central bank to delay its next move, even with Donald Trump’s trade threats clouding the economic outlook. This jump in prices isn’t being driven by fuel or fresh vegetables, it is all about food that people actually eat every day. Prices for essentials like rice have doubled since May 2024. A rice ball now costs nearly 20% more, and a simple bar of chocolate is up 27%, based on the official figures. And it doesn’t stop at goods. Inflation in services—like restaurants, haircuts, and healthcare—also ticked up to 1.4% from April’s 1.3%, showing that businesses are slowly pushing more of their labor costs onto customers. BOJ faces tariff risk as prices rise across the board The situation is messy. The BOJ already ended its huge stimulus program last year and raised short-term rates to 0.5% in January because it believed Japan was close to sustainably hitting the 2% inflation target. But now things have changed. Global risks are back on the table. Trump is back in the White House, and his renewed tariff agenda is making Japan’s export-heavy economy look fragile again. That’s why the BOJ is holding off … for now. Ryosuke Katagi, market economist at Mizuho Securities, said the central bank is being cautious: “Given heightened uncertainty over US tariff policy, the BOJ is taking a wait-and-see approach to scrutinize developments in bilateral trade talks. When looking just at price moves, conditions for additional rate hikes will likely stay in place throughout 2025.” That’s supported by a different inflation measure, one that cuts out fuel and fresh food, which climbed 3.3% in May compared to 3.0% in April. That’s the fastest increase since January 2024, when it hit 3.5%. The BOJ watches that specific number closely, since it gives a better sense of whether inflation is being driven by strong demand or just external costs. The same pattern is showing up in Tokyo. Analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the capital’s core inflation to slow to 3.3% in June, down from 3.6% in May. Tokyo’s numbers tend to be early signals for the whole country, but the drop isn’t big enough to calm the central bank. Especially not with non-fresh food prices up 7.7% from a year earlier, higher than April’s 7.0%. BOJ split on timing while economists warn of price spiral Inside the central bank, the debate is heating up. Minutes from the BOJ’s April 30–May 1 meeting showed a divided board. Some members are worried inflation will keep climbing past projections. The idea of a wage-price spiral is also being taken seriously now. A research paper published by the bank said that raising rates slowly, while raw materials stay expensive, could trigger an upward loop between wages and consumer prices. Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, said, “Inflation is overshooting expectations. The rise in food costs is particularly big and re-accelerating this year.” He also added that “firms seem keen to raise prices further.” Yoshiki expects core inflation to go below 3% in August and possibly under 2% by early 2026, but warned the slowdown might be weaker than expected. The BOJ still claims that cost-push pressure will ease later this year, and with expected wage growth, they hope to see more domestic consumption. That’s the logic they’re using to avoid another hike for now. They want inflation to hit 2% because of demand, not just because food prices are out of control. Still, patience is running out. A Reuters poll of economists found that a slight majority expect the next 25-basis-point rate hike to happen in early 2026. But with this latest CPI report, that timeline could easily get pulled forward—especially if inflation keeps jumping and Trump’s tariff agenda starts to damage exports even more.

In a new Bloomberg interview, Sacks says the passing of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) in the U.S. Senate and the potential signing of the piece of legislation into law offers “regulatory clarity and stability” for the stablecoin crypto sector. According to Sacks, the GENIUS Act could trigger massive demand for US government debt from various parts of the world. “… the [stablecoin] float is expected to grow from, call it, roughly $250 billion to trillions of dollars. And that would create more demand for the US dollar internationally. I think you could see other economies start to dollarize from the bottom up as their citizens would prefer to use US digital dollars as opposed to whatever fiat currency they’re using. And that would create potentially trillions of dollars of new demand for US treasuries.” The GENIUS Act will also spur innovation in the payments industry, according to the White House advisor. “And I think that the bill will provide the framework that will give confidence to a lot of traditional financial players to enter the space. And so I think you’re going to see new stablecoin products. And I think you will also see stablecoins being used as payments. I think this is one of the really exciting things about the bill, is that blockchain infrastructure will be used as a new kind of dollar-based payment system, that’s faster, more efficient, smoother. It’s a payment system of the future.” ?

In 2026, it will range between $0.5404 and $0.6531, with an average price of $0.5558. In 2030, it will range between $2.21 and $2.73, with an average price of $2.29. Algorand’s capabilities make it an interesting prospect for investors and developers interested in smart contracts and blockchain interoperability. A 2019 video featured Gary Gensler, former Securities and Exchange Commission chair, referring to Algorand as a great technology and using it as an example when discussing the decentralization of cryptocurrencies. Will ALGO go up? Can it reach $10? Where will ALGO be in 5 years? We explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction.

Per our technical indicators, ALGO is bearish, with the fear and greed index showing a greed sentiment among investors. Data analysis shows that activity on decentralized finance applications has stagnated, with the charts showing that it will drop further in the coming days. Recent news: Algorand foundation- TVL is not correlated with price performance Algorand researchers are attempting to answer the question of whether TVL could predict the performance of a crypto, and after analyzing over 300 cryptocurrencies from 2023 to 2024, they did not find any outperformance, regardless of how the data was adjusted for known issue. The study will be published on June 10. Why is ALGO down? ALGO is dropping from previous highs set in the last quarter of 2024, The drop could be attributed to the crypto market’s correction, which saw Bitcoin drop below $99,000. Will ALGO reach $1? Per our Algorand price forecast, ALGO will break above $1 in the period ending in 2028. Can Algorand reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $10 in the period ending in 2031. Can Algorand reach $20? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $20 in the period ending in 2031. Can ALGO reach 100 dollars? At $100, Algorand’s market capitalization has to rise above $700 billion from the current $1.2 billion. In comparison, Ethereum’s market capitalization is at $400 billion. Per our price prediction, Algorand is highly unlikely to reach $100. Is there a future for Algorand? Like most mega-altcoins, Algorand is trading at its lowest level this year. A break below 30 RSI will be crucial to sending it to previous highs. Looking ahead, ALGO will register new all-time highs in the coming years. What will Algorand be worth in 2025?

Source: CoinStats Algorand held its token sale in June 2019 at $2.40 each. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to CoinMarketCap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from its ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.64 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. So, in 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.30 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 below the $0.40 mark in January, $0.35 in February, $0.21 in March, and $0.20 in May and June.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-20 07:15:00

Le Monde reported Thursday that his clearance, which takes effect on July 10, marks the second time Durov has been allowed temporary relief from a strict judicial supervision order following his arrest in Aug. 2024. The decision comes after French authorities denied a similar request in May when Durov had planned to speak at the Oslo Freedom Forum. Unable to attend in person, he delivered his keynote speech remotely. Pavel Durov Granted Looser Court Restrictions in France Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov has been allowed to temporarily leave France starting July 10 — for up to 14 days — to visit Dubai, where his family lives and Telegram’s offices are based. Durov told the court that his… pic.twitter.com/4agQVpqwPJ — NEXTA (@nexta_tv) June 19, 2025 The Human Rights Foundation, which hosts the forum, had criticised the travel restriction, while supporters saw it as a broader signal of pressure on tech entrepreneurs facing legal scrutiny. Telegram Founder’s Arrest Sparks Global Debate on Digital Accountability Durov’s legal battle began last August, when he was arrested at Le Bourget Airport near Paris . He was later indicted on charges tied to a wider French investigation into Telegram’s alleged role in facilitating criminal activity. Authorities argue that the app’s lack of content moderation, combined with its support for encrypted communication, disposable phone numbers and crypto payments, has created a fertile ground for illicit activity. Released on a €5m ($5.75m) bail, Durov remains under judicial supervision. He must report to police twice a week and get prior approval to leave France. Although limited, the temporary approval to travel to Dubai is seen as a rare concession. The case continues to raise difficult questions about platform accountability, user privacy and free expression. Telegram Tightens Moderation as Legal Pressures Mount on Encrypted Platforms The case has attracted global attention from privacy advocates and the tech industry. Notably, figures like Edward Snowden and Elon Musk have criticised French authorities, calling the move an overreach. Since Durov’s arrest, Telegram has changed how it handles illegal content. As a result, the platform now warns users about the risks of sharing prohibited material. If they do, their IP addresses and phone numbers could be passed to authorities. This marks a big shift from Telegram’s earlier, more privacy-focused approach. Meanwhile, the episode has reignited interest in The Open Network , a blockchain project initially launched by Telegram under Durov’s leadership. Although TON was abandoned in 2020 due to pressure from the US SEC, it continues to operate as a separate ecosystem backed by the crypto community. Supporters now see Durov’s legal battle as a broader test for decentralized platforms. They are watching closely to see how far developers can be held responsible for how their technologies are used.

The move comes ahead of the region’s Stablecoin Ordinance legalization. In an exclusive interview with China Business Network, Group President of Animoca Brands Evan Auyang stated that the web3 has entered into a joint venture with Hong Kong’s Standard Chartered Bank and Hong Kong Telecom in anticipation for the region’s new Stablecoin Ordinance coming into effect. According to Auyang, the purpose of the joint venture is to open the door for Animoca Brands to pursue a stablecoin issuer license and set up an established web3-based ecosystem for users to utilize its native stablecoin. “We currently have a joint venture company through which we intend to apply for a license to issue stablecoins . The specific details will be announced at a later time,” said Auyang in his statement. The firm aims to mobilize customers into web3 through application scenarios at the same time. In order to establish an ecosystem that can drive customers to shift from web2 to web3 would require collaboration with leading companies in different industries, such as Standard Chartered and Telecom.

Animoca Brands plans to use HKD-pegged stablecoin for three purposes: to carry out transactions within the firm’s gaming and NFT ecosystems, cross-border trade settlements and to popularize HKD-backed stablecoins on an international scale. After the United States passed the GENIUS Act with the purpose of advancing its stablecoin market, Hong Kong industry players like Animoca Brands and JD.com have been preparing themselves for the issuance of a Hong Kong dollar-pegged stablecoin. The move is aimed at carving a place in the market for Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoins in an effort to combat U.S. stablecoin dominance. On June 6, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government announced that it will start implementing its stablecoin regulation, the Stablecoin Ordinance in August 2025. The new law would allow for companies to register for a license to issued stablecoins pegged to the Hong Kong dollar.

Key Takeaways: South Korea’s financial regulator has submitted a roadmap to approve spot crypto ETFs. The plan reflects President Lee’s push to modernize digital asset regulation. The FSC’s shift marks a break from its previous stance that crypto ETFs posed financial risks. The move signals a possible shift in regulatory posture under President Lee Jae Myung, who campaigned on easing restrictions around digital assets. The roadmap proposes implementation measures for spot crypto ETFs in the second half of 2025 and marks a significant departure from the FSC’s long-standing position that such products pose financial stability risks. South Korea’s FSC Previously Blocked Crypto ETFs Over Volatility Concerns Until now, the FSC had barred crypto ETFs from being issued or traded in South Korea, citing concerns over volatility and the suitability of cryptocurrencies as base assets. The change aligns with President Lee’s pledge to modernize South Korea’s financial landscape and offer more opportunities for younger investors to build wealth through regulated digital asset exposure. The roadmap also reportedly includes plans to introduce regulatory frameworks for Korean won-based stablecoins by late 2025. President Lee previously emphasized the importance of developing a domestic stablecoin market to reduce capital flight and retain liquidity within South Korea’s economy. Following the media coverage, the FSC issued a statement clarifying that the reported proposals are not finalized.

Wild this happened the 2nd day I am in South Korea. pic.twitter.com/NkXfe0AaIy — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) June 3, 2025 The commission emphasized that the roadmap remains under review, and details may change as consultations continue. Even before the latest filing, the FSC had been gradually opening the door to institutional crypto involvement. Earlier this year, it began processing phased approvals for institutional investors to gain limited access to the digital asset market. Beyond crypto, the FSC is also considering broader reforms, including a proposal to double trading hours at Korea Exchange, extending them from 6.5 to 12 hours daily. South Korea is home to one of the most active retail crypto markets globally. By the end of 2024, local investors held approximately 104 trillion won (about $75.7 billion) in digital assets, according to FSC data. South Korea’s Ruling Party Proposes Stablecoin Bill South Korea’s Democratic Party has introduced a bill to legalize stablecoin issuance by domestic firms, marking the first major crypto policy under newly elected President Lee Jae-myung. The proposal sparked a sharp rally in crypto-related stocks, with KakaoPay jumping 18% as investors welcomed the government’s apparent commitment to digital asset innovation. The bill, part of the broader Digital Asset Basic Act, would allow stablecoins backed by reserves and issued by firms with a minimum capital of 500 million won. It also calls for the creation of a Presidential Digital Asset Committee and mandates regulatory oversight by the Financial Services Commission through an approval and reporting process. Despite growing political momentum, the initiative faces resistance from the Bank of Korea. Governor Rhee Chang-yong has warned that stablecoins issued by non-bank entities could interfere with monetary policy and argues that the central bank should control any development of a won-based digital currency.

It is rightly said that history shows a rhythm in market behavior, while many claim “this cycle is different,” the data says otherwise. From BTC dominance and institutional inflows to the Altcoin Season Index hitting rock bottom, all signs point to a forthcoming shift in liquidity. In this analysis I take you through crypto analyst Tracer’s thesis on altseason. Bitcoin Is Soaring, But Alts Are Sleeping? It has been disappointing to the marketers that, despite the total market cap sitting at $3.24 trillion, altcoins are still significantly underperforming relative to Bitcoin. Data reveals that most alts remain down 80–90% from their all-time highs. This is all while BTC continues breaking new streaks. The analyst highlights that this discrepancy isn’t new, as in past cycles, altseason only kicked off after Bitcoin concreted its top. The Altcoin Season Index currently sits at 21/100, deeply into “Bitcoin Season” territory. Historically, these levels have marked the start to capital rotation from BTC into alts once Bitcoin shows signs of topping out. Institutions Are Still Going All-In on Bitcoin? Institutional behavior has tilted heavily toward Bitcoin. From Strategy’s billion-dollar buys to publicly traded firms and sovereign institutions building BTC treasuries. Coming to the M2 global money supply, a key liquidity driver, shows a strong correlation with BTC, especially with a 76-day offset. As M2 expands, Bitcoin absorbs the initial liquidity. But when this flow saturates, past actions suggest altcoins often catch the spillover, triggering the true altseason. Key Market Signals Flashing the Setup The following market indicators are pointing to a classic pre-altseason setup: Bitcoin Dominance: Currently hovering at record highs. Past patterns show that when BTC.D drops below 55% , it’s a clear sign that capital is rotating into alts. Trading Volume Divergence: BTC’s volumes have recently dipped compared to previous bull cycles from 2016 and 2021, and alt volumes remain sluggish. A simultaneous volume spike in alts, along with a BTC.D drop, will be a major trigger. Fear & Greed Index: Sitting neutral at 48 , indicating indecision, a common trait to market transitions. Also worth noting is the geopolitical tension with Iran, which has temporarily frozen liquidity. However, such geopolitical dips tend to resolve swiftly and provide golden buying opportunities. Keen on BTC’s future? Read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! FAQs When will the altcoin season start?

As ETH flirts with key resistance near $2,547, a $127m whale buy revives bullish hopes, while presale stars like Pepeto and Wall Street Ponke hint at what’s next in altcoin action. Table of Contents ETH technical outlook: $2,800 or $2,400? Blockchain bridges: Real use across chains Pepeto exchange preview + 278% APY staking rewards Another one to watch: Wall Street Ponke Ethereum ( ETH ) is trading near $2,547 at press time, and big investors are starting to move. A whale just bought over $127 million worth of ETH, 48,825 coins, at an average price of $2,605. This buy came during a price dip, showing real belief in Ethereum’s future. This isn’t just random. The same whale reportedly made $30 million in profit from past Ethereum trades. While tensions in the Middle East and over 242,000 expiring ETH options shook the market, this bold move helped bring back confidence. With a put-call ratio of 1.20 and the pain point set around $2,700, analysts are watching closely. ETH technical outlook: $2,800 or $2,400? Ethereum is moving between two important price levels : Bullish scenario: • Entry: Close above 38.2% Fib ($2,568) and 50 EMA • Stop-loss: Below $2,500 • Targets: $2,607 and $2,647 Bearish scenario: • Entry: Drop below $2,518 • Stop-loss: Above $2,540 • Targets: $2,440 and $2,300 Blockchain bridges: Real use across chains Bridges in blockchain let users move tokens and data between different networks. Think of it like sending ETH across to a BTC chain. Key bridge features: • Smooth token transfers across chains • Options for centralized or decentralized bridges • Makes crypto easier for everyone This is where Pepeto shines.

According to a June 19 article by CryptoQuant’s head of research Julio Moreno, the pace of Bitcoin ( BTC ) accumulation has notably slowed over the past few weeks following its rise toward an all-time high near $112,000 in May. Apparent demand growth has dropped to 118,000 BTC over the past 30 days, almost half of the 228,000 BTC growth observed in late May. Moreno also noted that whales and U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds have cut their Bitcoin purchases by over 50%, while short-term holders have shed 800,000 BTC since May 27, a sign that new investor participation is waning. Following Bitcoin’s failure to hold above $110,000, futures data shows a tactical shift as traders locked in profits and started new short positions. As Bitcoin fell toward the $105,000 range, there was a rise in short interest, according to CryptoQuant’s Traders’ Behavior Dominance metric. You might also like: Arizona reconsiders Bitcoin reserve plan using forfeited digital assets Darkfost, another CryptoQuant analyst, pointed out that the true problem is stagnating demand, even though realized profits are still small, less than $1 billion, and do not yet indicate a market peak. The current market is balanced, with no major profit-taking or panic selling, but also lacking the strong demand that typically fuels the next leg higher. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at about $104,707, down 6.5% from its peak of $111,814 on May 22 and nearly flat for the day. The price has fluctuated between $103,645 and $108,771 over the last week. On the daily chart, Bitcoin is trading just below the 20-day Bollinger Band midline, which is at $105,854, and faces resistance around the $108,000 zone. The Bollinger Bands are slightly narrowing, indicating decreasing volatility, while the relative strength index is at 47.75, indicating neutral momentum. Bitcoin price analysis. Credit: crypto.news Since the May high, the price has been in a short-term downward trend and has not been able to recover the upper range of the consolidation zone. Should demand weaken further, Bitcoin may test the $101,000 support, with the $92,000 level, marked by CryptoQuant’s Traders’ On-chain Realized Price, acting as the next major cushion. A breakout above $108,000 on high volume, which might re-target the $111,814 high, is necessary for a bullish scenario. On the other hand, a decline below $101,000 might indicate the start of more significant retracements.

Its holdings are now second only to those of the Ethereum Foundation. SharpLink was able to fund this acquisition partly using $79 million that it raised in May 2025. The company will use most of its ATM proceeds to grow its Ethereum (ETH) holdings, which have already yielded around 11.8% growth in ETH per share since the start of June 2025. The company is actively staking over 95% of its holdings, which contributes to the security of ETH while generating yield for the company. According to the CEO, the purchase is a strategic move that marks a major move towards institutional adoption of crypto. What This Means For Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Before the bold move by SharpLink, crypto purchases had been piecemeal for most mainstream firms. They have limited their exposure to the sector, only purchasing what they can afford to lose. This bold move could signal changing attitudes towards the crypto sector. For instance, it could inspire institutional investors to start taking a closer look at presales. So far, one of the presales that is receiving massive attention from the crypto sector is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is being discussed in crypto circles, especially on Telegram, for its potential to deliver life-changing returns for its holders. MUTM Token Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token presale is currently in the fifth phase, where tokens are selling for $0.03 each. In the current phase, the tokens are selling for a 50% discount to the planned listing price of $0.06. So far, over $10.8 million worth of MUTM tokens have been sold to around 12,200 buyers. The participation pace has recently picked up speed, with 40% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 of the presale already sold, barely two weeks after they launched. A major reason for this fast pace is the expected increase in the presale price by 16.67% in the upcoming phase 6 to $0.035 per token. Another major source of motivation is the ongoing $100,000 giveaway . In this giveaway, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will give ten lucky participants in the presale $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. To qualify for this giveaway, you only need to purchase $50 worth of MUTM tokens in the ongoing presale. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Has To Offer The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project offers users access to a decentralized, non-custodial lending protocol where they can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, they can deposit their assets in a pool in exchange for interest payments. The interest rate they receive on their assets is based on the pool utilization rate. As the number of borrowers taking assets from a pool rises, so does the utilization rate. That causes the interest rate to rise, encouraging borrowers to repay loans to avoid the higher rates. At the same time, it attracts more lenders looking to benefit from the increased yields. Over time, this lowers the interest rate, ensuring optimal capital efficiency. Lenders also get access to the full liquidity of their assets via mtTokens. When a lender deposits $2,300 worth of BNB in a pool, for instance, they get mtBNB tokens in return on a 1:1 ratio. These tokens represent the value of their deposit plus any interest accrued. Consequently, they provide a convenient means for holders to actively track their deposits in a pool. At the same time, holders do not need to actively claim or compound their gains. Since mtTokens are based on the ERC20 token standard, they can be actively traded on any exchange that accepts the standard. This allows holders to actively benefit from market opportunities in real time, while still earning interest on their deposits. To make the benefits of the Mutuum Finance protocol accessible to a wider audience, Mutuum Finance plans to expand across multiple blockchain networks. Protocol Safeguards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to offer the highest level of protection for lenders’ deposits. In line with this, all loans taken from the pools will be overcollateralized. Additionally, it will use strict parameters, such as a liquidation threshold and the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, to monitor active loan positions. If a loan falls outside of the set parameters, it will be eligible for partial or full liquidation. The liquidators will step in and purchase the debt at a discount, helping to stabilize the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a CertiK-audited project that could soon attract the attention of institutional investors. With the presale picking up speed, the current price of $0.03 per token could represent your best opportunity to ride the coming altcoin wave. Do not be left out of this massive crypto market opportunity that could deliver gains of 20x or more.

This failure to perform has put intense bearish pressure on the altcoin market as a whole, and the resulting price action has triggered what is seemingly a bear market for altcoins. Even now, the Ethereum price has not shown any signs of a bullish recovery, with expectations remaining bleak at this level, and analysts predicting further crashes. Why The Ethereum Price Is Headed Below $2,000 Crypto analyst Maddox Metrics has given the short and long-term outlook for the Ethereum price, and it seems the current market decline is nowhere near its end. In the short term, Maddox expects the Ethereum price to continue to decline and, in fact, fall below some major support levels. Related Reading: XRP Addresses Holding 1M Coins Reach 12-Year High As Experts Predict Move Above $4 As the crypto analyst explains, investors are already expecting the ETH price to actually fall lower toward the $1,900 target. And as shown in the analyst’s chart, this would actually be the second wave of the 5-wave count as Ethereum moves into its long-term potential. While there has been a lot of buying, especially among institutional investors and ETF issuers, the Ethereum price continues to trend low. The analyst attributes this to the rising war tensions in the Middle East, as fears of World War 3 grow more intense. At this level, the analyst cautions investors to look toward a more patient strategy, saying that “Money is made in the sitting, weathering volatility, not flipping in and out of trades on every bit of news and price movement.” Thus, it is better to hold positions until the market finds its stable point. ETH Still Bullish In The Long-Term Despite the wave pattern pointing to a crash below $2,000 in the short term, the analyst says the long-term outlook for the Ethereum price remains bullish. The current decline, which is a Wave 2 retracement, the analyst explains, marked the end of a motif wave at the $2,700 resistance. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Price Set To Repeat History As 2017 Playbook Returns? Why This Time Could Be Bigger This suggests that once the current wave ends, there is the next wave, which is the bullish Wave 3. Once this is underway, the analyst’s chart shows a possibility of this wave carrying through to a new all-time high just under $5,000. The 4th wave is naturally bearish and will trigger a crash, while the 5th and final wave will send the Ethereum price to $7,000. The timeline for this to happen, as shown in the chart, will be through the year 2025 and into the early months of 2026.

With traders rotating out of slow movers and into more aggressively positioned projects, MAGACOINFINANCE is beginning to emerge as a serious target for those chasing the next cycle’s big opportunity. Meanwhile, Polygon, Ethereum, Aptos, and Injective remain in the mix — each navigating different stages of growth and investor attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Quiet Build Behind the Surge While the broader market has been following Bitcoin and Solana’s strength, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quietly entered a new phase of acceleration. Early-stage investors are recognizing the timing — not just because of the capped 170 billion supply or staking feature, but because of how the community is positioning itself. The narrative isn’t being driven by influencers or marketing stunts — it’s being built on visible accumulation, low turnover, and commitment from long-term participants. What separates MAGACOIN FINANCE in this cycle is the structure beneath the momentum. The project has an audited codebase, transparent tokenomics, and no centralized gatekeeping. Those ingredients — paired with the bonus incentive currently live under PATRIOTS100X — are creating a unique environment where calculated traders feel confident stepping in early. This isn’t reactionary hype; it’s coordinated positioning with a clear view toward the next big price wave. Polygon (MATIC) Searches for a Fresh Catalyst Polygon (MATIC) has faced cooling sentiment lately as traders await major upgrades or breakout announcements. While it maintains strong fundamentals and enterprise partnerships, its on-chain activity has plateaued. The lack of volatility has prompted short-term capital to look elsewhere, with many watching to see whether upcoming technical improvements can rekindle momentum. Ethereum (ETH) Holds Strong Despite Slower Gains Ethereum (ETH) continues to attract institutional interest, particularly around ETF speculation and treasury allocations. Yet its price has remained relatively range-bound, with macroeconomic pressure and Bitcoin’s dominance slowing ETH’s independent movement. Investors remain bullish long term, but short-term focus is drifting toward smaller-cap assets offering stronger upside potential in the near term. Aptos (APT) Benefits from Ecosystem Growth Aptos (APT) is quietly climbing in rankings, thanks to increasing developer activity and network engagement. It ranks high in daily active addresses, suggesting expanding adoption. Still, its price movement has been less explosive than traders hoped for, leading some to reallocate capital toward altcoins offering clearer staking rewards or high-speed token cycles. Injective (INJ) Retains DeFi Value But Loses Market Heat Injective (INJ) remains an efficient protocol with strong integration across decentralized finance tools. However, its recent price action hasn’t kept pace with more aggressively moving altcoins. Traders appreciate INJ’s fundamentals but are increasingly reserving their short-term positions for assets with stronger retail momentum and incentive mechanics. Final Thoughts While Polygon, Ethereum, Aptos, and Injective each continue to shape the Layer 1 and DeFi narratives, it’s MAGACOINFINANCE that is quietly taking advantage of the current market setup. Backed by strong internal mechanics and the ripple effects of larger market rallies, it’s quickly being viewed as a smart early entry for those tracking the next breakout story.

The debt has surged as policymakers increased government spending and implemented stimulus measures. Head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities, Gennadiy Goldberg, said that the crux of the $37 trillion problem is that no one knows at what level the debt becomes unsustainable. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged that the U.S. government has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. U.S. spending bill threatens to increase national debt The U.S. national debt just passed $37 trillion dollars. This is unsustainable. Tick, tock. pic.twitter.com/KYIwaZaQXJ — Natalie F Danelishen (@Chesschick01) June 20, 2025 Goldberg agrees with Bessent’s argument but states that the U.S. also does not tax much compared to both the size of the country’s GDP and government outlays. He believes that either taxes have to go up, spending has to come down, or some combination of the two, but warned that it’s very complicated to figure out. The White House said on June 7 that the GOP tax bill significantly improves the country’s fiscal trajectory by including $1.7 trillion in mandatory savings, while Trump’s tax cuts will spur economic growth. Democrats have pointed to analyses showing the bill’s tax cuts will benefit wealthier Americans far more than low- and middle-income workers while also adding to the national debt. “No single piece of legislation in my time here in Congress will do more to add to the national debt than this one.” – Brendan Boyle , U.S. Representative for Philadelphia. Economists at Goldman Sachs said Tuesday the spending bill passed by House Republicans, combined with increased tariff revenue, will slightly lower the budget deficit when excluding interest payments. Goldman’s Manuel Abecasis, David Mericle, and Alec Philips believe that, coupled with borrowing costs, the bill leaves the total deficit’s course essentially unchanged. According to the Goldman team, higher real interest rates have put U.S. debt and interest expense as a share of GDP on much steeper trajectories than appeared in previous cycles. The team argued that the scale of the debt going forward depends greatly on how interest rates move over the next couple of decades. The economists highlighted that the $37 trillion accounts for more than 120% of the U.S. GDP, and that the Treasury Department borrows more just to meet the rising cost of servicing it. They also said the U.S. pays more in interest on its debt than it spends on Medicare and defense. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the version of the GOP spending bill passed by the House would increase deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade. The White House and some Republican lawmakers argue that the projection should not include the cost of extending Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire this year without the bill. Soaring interest payments push national debt past $37T According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data, the U.S. spent $1.1 trillion in interest on its debt in 2024, almost double the amount it was paying five years ago. Data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute also shows that the U.S. spends more on interest payments than on defense. An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office on June 5 revealed that those costs could surge even more under the Republican tax and spending bill now being considered in the Senate. The nonpartisan agency projected that the version of the tax legislation passed by the White House last month would increase the federal deficit by $2.4 trillion over the next decade. CBO forecasts that the surge would require the government to raise additional debt, resulting in additional interest payments of about $550 billion over the next decade. The nonpartisan think tank also estimates that by 2035, interest on the nation’s debt could reach $1.8 trillion. Chris Edwards, an expert on federal tax at the Cato Institute, said interest costs are now bigger than defense spending. He believes that the increasing federal costs will crowd out all the other priorities in the federal budget that policymakers want to spend on. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data, federal interest payments as a share of the nation’s gross domestic product stood at 3% last year. The nonpartisan Peter G. Peterson Foundation also estimates that if the current trend holds, that could rise to 4.15% of GDP by 2035. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on June 5 that Congress is spending “America into bankruptcy,” pointing to data showing that interest payments have risen from $416 billion in 2014 to more than $1 trillion in 2024. Moody’s Ratings also revealed that persistent and large fiscal deficits will increase the government’s debt and interest burden.

While BTC has been moving within a narrow range in recent days, CryptoQuant said that the risk of a very serious downside for Bitcoin continues. Accordingly, CryptoQuant analysts said that Bitcoin could drop to $92,000 if demand continues to decline. At this point, CryptoQuant analysts said on June 19 that spot Bitcoin ETF inflows have fallen by more than 60% since April. Analysts stated that in addition to the decrease in ETF inflows, whale accumulation has also decreased by half, and that this situation indicates a bearish trend for BTC. According to the data, short-term investors have also sold around 800,000 BTC since the end of May. As a result, all these indicators suggest that demand for Bitcoin is decreasing, as CryptoQuant’s demand momentum indicator has also dropped to negative 2 million BTC, making it its lowest level ever. At this point, CryptoQuant warned that if demand continues to fall, BTC could fall to $92,000, or even $81,000 if the situation worsens. *This is not investment advice.

Ripple (XRP) XRP experienced another week with flat price action, closing with a modest 1% gain. This comes after buyers failed to break the $2.3 resistance, which continues to challenge any potential uptrend. In the past month, the volume has also been declining, which eroded the momentum needed to challenge the key resistance. Should it fall further, then XRP may revisit the support at $2, where buyers showed interest in the past. Looking ahead, this cryptocurrency has been moving sideways since May without any clear signal that it will break its current market structure. For this reason, XRP is likely to remain around $2 in the short to medium term. Chart by TradingView Cardano (ADA) ADA lost its support at $0.64 this week and fell by 6%. This level will now act as a key resistance, and it may take quite a while until it is reclaimed, considering that the momentum is bearish. With that key level lost, this cryptocurrency has to find new support with good candidates at $0.55 and $0.5. This downtrend is likely to return ADA to price levels last seen in April when it briefly visited $0.51. Looking ahead, Cardano is in a difficult spot, being unable to sustain an uptrend. Since it peaked at $1.3 in late 2024, the price has been making lower highs that fueled the current bearish sentiment. Until this changes, a recovery appears unlikely. Chart by TradingView Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin tried to break the resistance at $692 in late May, but sellers rejected its attempt. This pushed the asset into a correction that continued this week as well, when it closed with a 1% loss. While this is not too concerning, the price remains in a downtrend since late May and could revisit the support at $630 and $600. It is critical for BNB to stay above $600 if it wants to retain a bullish bias on higher timeframes. With the overall market undecided, BNB could end up ranging above $600. While volume remains low, buyers could show up as soon as the price approaches $600 to push it higher again. Chart by TradingView Solana (SOL) The sentiment around Solana is deteriorating. This is made worse by its price, which is found in a downtrend after it was rejected at the $186 resistance. While the price is at similar levels to last week, the recent fall under $150 puts sellers on the offensive again. If this downtrend continues, then bears have a good shot at pushing SOL towards $130 next. If the bearish sentiment increases, then sellers have a good shot at revisiting $118 as well. Without buyers, Solana is found in a difficult position considering its tokenomics, which are inflationary. Hopefully, buying interests resumes once the price approaches $130, which would be a good candidate for a relief bounce. Chart by TradingView Hype (HYPE) The hype around HYPE appears to have vanished this week after the price broke below its uptrend at around $39. At the time of this post, the price is down by 10% this week and does not show any signs of stopping. This correction is likely to be quite significant considering the prolonged uptrend. Compared to its all-time high at $46, HYPE has now slumped by over 20% and is currently around $35. If the price continues to fall, then good support is found at $34 and $30. Looking ahead, HYPE retains a very strong fundamental basis to make new highs after this correction is over. Until then, it’s best to wait for the price to find a bottom somewhere around $30 or even lower, around $28.

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino announced today that the company is preparing to launch PearPass, a fully local, open-source password manager built without reliance on cloud infrastructure. “The cloud has failed us. Again,” Ardoino said on X, referencing a newly discovered data breach exposing 16 billion login credentials reported yesterday. PearPass aims to address the growing distrust in centralized data storage by ensuring that all user credentials are stored only on users’ devices, eliminating any external point of failure or surveillance. “Just you — and your keys, stored securely on your devices,” wrote Ardoino. You might also like: Cryptocurrency: How to Avoid a Data Breach Ardoino’s announcement follows the exposure of what appears to be the largest data breach ever confirmed. According to a Cybernews investigation , 16 billion records have been uncovered in multiple massive datasets linked to infostealer malware . These logs include login credentials for virtually every major online platform, including Apple, Facebook, Google, GitHub, Telegram, and even government services. Researchers warned that this data breach isn’t just old data resurfacing. Many of the credentials are recent, complete with tokens, cookies, and metadata. The structure of the records — URLs paired with usernames and passwords — mirrors how modern infostealers collect information, suggesting much of the data was siphoned directly from infected machines. “This is not just a leak – it’s a blueprint for mass exploitation. With over 16 billion login records exposed, cybercriminals now have unprecedented access to personal credentials that can be used for account takeover, identity theft, and highly targeted phishing ,” researchers said. The good news is that the exposure was brief. The datasets were exposed just long enough for researchers to discover them, but not long enough to identify who was behind them. However, researchers said that enormous new datasets continue to surface every few weeks.

As of writing, Ethereum ( ETH ) was trading at $2,508, representing a gain of over 70% from its year-to-date low. Its market cap stood above $300 billion. While ETH remains 32% below its 2025 peak, analysts suggest it could be approaching a significant breakout. According to pseudo-anonymous analyst Crypto GEMs, who has over 422,000 followers on social media, Ethereum appears to have reentered a multi-week parallel channel on the daily chart. Source: X/cryptogems555 The structure resembles a similar pattern from earlier this year, which preceded an 80% rally within a month. If ETH replicates that trajectory, a move toward the $5,000 level could materialize by year-end. Technical indicators appear to support this outlook. Ethereum is on the verge of forming a golden cross, with its 50-day simple moving average close to crossing above the 200-day SMA, a historically bullish signal.

ETH 50-day EMA chart — June 20 | Source: crypto.news Should bullish momentum continue, the next upside target lies near the $3,500 level, which aligns with the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement and serves as a key psychological resistance. A confirmed breakout above that level could pave the way for a rally up to $5,000, in line with the analyst’s projections. Multiple catalysts appear to be aligning in support of this outlook. Spot Ether ETFs have regained traction among institutional players. Data from SoSoValue indicates that these products have seen $860 million in net inflows so far in June, a 52% increase from May. One of the most notable contributors to this demand is BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, which has accumulated over $750 million worth of ETH since the beginning of June. BlackRock has not sold any of its holdings during this accumulation phase, which is a sign of strong institutional conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value. Further, large holders controlling between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH have ramped up accumulation, marking the highest net position increase in months despite market turbulence. GM guys! Seems like the $ETH whales don’t care about the market shakeouts. They keep adding non stop 👀 pic.twitter.com/PcFd8B57pw — Crypto Rand (@crypto_rand) June 20, 2025 On-chain signals also reinforce the bullish sentiment. Data from Santiment shows that new wallet creation on the Ethereum network has surged, with between 800,000 and 1 million new addresses being created weekly. This marks a notable rise compared to the 560,000–670,000 range seen during the same period last year. Santiment attributes this growth to improved network utility and broader ecosystem engagement. All this could continue to strengthen Ethereum’s underlying market structure, paving the way for a potential breakout.

This price consolidation, however, appears to reflect a balanced market as on-chain metrics point to neither excessive profit-taking nor aggressive accumulation. Realized Profits Stay Subdued The 7-day moving average of realized profits indicated that profit-taking activity remains subdued, with figures holding below $1 billion, comparable to levels observed during the October 2024 correction, according to CryptoQuant’s latest update . Even during Bitcoin’s surge to a new all-time high earlier this year, realized profits failed to match the peaks seen in January 2025. This was indicative of a lack of urgency among investors to cash out. Such a limited selling pressure has contributed to the current consolidation phase and signaled a cautiously optimistic sentiment. However, what’s preventing a stronger bullish breakout is the apparent weakness in demand. The ratio of newly issued supply to dormant supply (inactive for over a year) shows demand. While still positive, it has been steadily declining since the local high in May. A ratio above zero typically reflects healthy demand, but the gradual drop suggests that buying interest is cooling off. Despite this, the demand remains sufficient to absorb the existing selling pressure, which is keeping the market stable. Overall, Bitcoin appears to be in a state of equilibrium, where moderate realized profits and slowly waning demand offset each other – an environment that supports consolidation rather than a sharp directional move in the near term. While on-chain activity reflects a balanced market, sentiment indicators are beginning to tilt bearish. A Classic Contrarian Buy Signal Emerges Santiment’s latest data shows a spike in retail bearish sentiment toward Bitcoin. Interestingly, this trend often signals a potential rebound. Currently, there are just 1.03 bullish comments for every bearish one – levels not seen since April 6th, when fear peaked amid initial tariff-related market reactions. Historically, such negative sentiment among traders has preceded upward price moves, as markets tend to act contrary to retail expectations. Similar fear in early April marked a strong buy opportunity, which suggests current conditions could offer a repeat setup for crypto bulls The post Macro Uncertainty Meets Market Balance in Bitcoin’s On-Chain Activity appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-20 07:38:27

The development marks a meaningful structural shift in the current trend. According to technical analyst CasiTrades (@CasiTrades), this backtest could be a prelude to further downside movement. The chart indicates a failed attempt to reclaim $2.25. Following the breakdown, price action rebounded slightly on the back of a lower-time frame bullish divergence. This brief rally, however, encountered rejection at the former support zone, which has now flipped to resistance. The price was $2.239 at the time of her analysis, unable to break convincingly above the new ceiling. It has fallen since then and is currently trading at $2.17. Quick #XRP Update – Backtest Occurs After $2.25 Break! The $2.25 support officially broke and when backtested, it's now showing signs of resistance. That’s a key shift in structure, and it makes the deeper support levels even more likely to get tested. The slight dip… pic.twitter.com/M7e5BJHWbZ — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) June 12, 2025 Support Levels to Watch While other analysts have maintained a bullish outlook , CasiTrades expects a short-term downturn. The current market structure suggests XRP is approaching a key inflection point, and the analyst recently revealed that the market is out of time and XRP must decide on a direction. The chart highlights a converging triangle pattern, with XRP nearing the apex. A breakdown from this tightening range would likely send the asset’s price toward lower support zones. The next significant support levels lie at $2.01 and $1.90, with further potential downside toward $1.55. The Fibonacci target of 1.236 is marked at $2.0200, reinforcing the importance of the $2.01–$2.02 zone as a probable landing point should the downward pressure persist. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Momentum Divergence and RSI Pressure The relative strength index (RSI) is also approaching a wedge-shaped breakout zone. The RSI has been forming lower highs while maintaining a horizontal base; a breakout or rejection here will likely coincide with a directional price move. RSI currently hovers near the neutral 50 mark, and momentum has not reclaimed higher ground despite the earlier bullish divergence. Unless a divergence forms on higher timeframes, the rejection at $2.25 could intensify. XRP’s Next Direction With time running out before the price reaches the convergence point, XRP is poised for a decisive move. If the $2.25 level continues to act as resistance, the bearish case strengthens, particularly given the unfulfilled Fibonacci levels and the visible bearish retest pattern. Although she suggests a short-term downturn, CasiTrades noted that “this is likely a final support touch before a major breakout.” Another well-known analyst recently predicted a notable 725% rally for the digital asset, and XRP’s tightening Bollinger Bands suggest that the asset could experience a sharp rebound, invalidating the bearish move and potentially targeting new highs.

BCH remains close to $500, with increasing social media mentions. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is yet another ‘dinosaur’ coin to reawaken in the past few months. As BTC made new all-time highs, traders returned to BCH, renewing its narrative after years of neglect. BCH already broke above $600 during the November 2024 rally, showing it was still capable of tapping market hype. The coin added more than 10% in a day, sparking hopes for an even larger breakout. Traders also noted BCH is trying to eat through a sell wall, potentially jumping to a higher range once the selling pressure decreases. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) posted almost non-stop gains in the past month, sparking renewed social media interest after years of low mindshare. | Source: CoinGecko Currently, BCH trades just under $500, after consecutive weeks of extended gains. The coin also extended its trading volumes to a three-month peak, at over $627M. The recent Bitcoin Cash rally seems to be driven by social media hype. Mentions surged as the price began to recover, pushing it to a new peak for 2025. Based on social media metrics , BCH is having its 2025 moment. Recently, BCH even flipped SUI, one of the trending L1 chains with expanding usage and DeFi. However, until recently, BCH social media were mostly silent, as this time there were no influencers to boost the asset’s adoption. Compared to newer assets, BCH is considered a dead chain, as it has lagged behind the recent Web3 use cases. The coin retains its usage as a simple payment tool, due to the predictable fees. BCH open interest increased to a six-month high, at over $364M. The coin’s long to short ratio is balanced, with no potential for a short squeeze. Bitcoin Cash usage still lags The recent spike in BCH price activity is not reflected by on-chain metrics. Bitcoin Cash is still a niche coin, with relatively low usage. The recent price rally may increase long-term holding, in expectation of a recovery to a higher price range. Currently, only around 300K BCH change hands each day, despite the relatively low fees, moving just 1.5% of the supply. The chain carries around 55K daily active addresses, as BCH still mostly serves as a regular coin, with limited DeFi use cases and cross-chain capabilities. Formerly, the BCH team focused on solving the issues of flexible difficulty adjustment, to avoid the effects of competing BTC miners switching between chains. The BCH mining activity fluctuated between 3 and 7 EH/s in the past year. Previously, BCH was used by mining pools with spare SHA-256 capacity, as miners switched to the other chain when the rewards were more favorable. In the past year, the Bitcoin Cash hashrate has not seen any dramatic fluctuations, as BTC miners kept to their own network with sufficient profitability. Only on occasional days is the BCH hashrate slightly higher, though quickly falling to the baseline. BCH is currently profitable to mine even for older equipment, keeping the network relatively stable. Despite this, BCH mining rates have remained close to the levels of 2018, while the BTC network expanded by more than 20 times.

On Polymarket , a popular crypto prediction platform, the odds of approval have soared to 90%, up from 70% just weeks ago. This spike in sentiment reflects growing optimism that XRP could follow in the footsteps of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which already boast spot ETFs in the U.S. A Game-Changer for XRP? If approved, the spot XRP ETF would make the token more accessible to mainstream investors by listing it on traditional stock exchanges. This eliminates the need for digital wallets, making XRP easier to buy, sell, and hold, especially for institutions that typically avoid direct crypto exposure. The approval could usher in fresh liquidity and draw in large-scale players like hedge funds and asset managers. The Polymarket prediction contract has already seen over $95,000 in volume, signaling strong conviction among participants. The platform’s markets often react to regulatory news and broader sentiment, offering a snapshot of what traders believe could happen next. SEC Delay Keeps Market on Edge Despite the surge in betting odds, the U.S. SEC is keeping the crypto market in suspense. It recently announced a 35-day delay in its decision on Franklin Templeton’s proposed spot XRP ETF , along with a similar delay for a spot Solana ETF . The agency instead opened a public comment period, pushing any final decision into the second half of 2025. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is XRP a Good Investment Right Now? , Canada Takes the Lead While U.S. regulators stall, Canada has already taken a step forward. Canadian firms like Purpose Investments, 3iQ, and Evolve have already received approval from the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) and launched their ETFs. Purpose has even waived its management fees until February 2026, making its XRP ETF the first to offer zero fees for early investors. With $8.3 million in assets under management already, Canada’s clear and proactive regulatory stance is driving real-world product rollout, unlike the U.S., where uncertainty continues to hold back progress. XRP’s current Market Snapshot As anticipation builds around upcoming XRP ETFs, the XRP price remained surprisingly stable despite extreme market turbulence. Over 12 hours, XRP experienced an abnormal 8,466% spike in long-to-short liquidation imbalance, with over $508,000 wiped from bullish positions. Yet, XRP’s price barely moved, gaining just 0.20% and staying around $2.15. This suggests that while traders were overly bullish, possibly fueled by ETF optimism, the price itself resisted major swings, highlighting XRP’s resilience amid rising institutional interest. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

They’re vitally important for the health of crypto markets, yet they must engage in a delicate and intricate balancing act that few people understand. Without market makers, the liquidity in crypto would likely dry up in a matter of minutes, causing tremendous volatility that would shake the bones of even the most seasoned traders. Why Does Crypto Need Market Makers? These days, almost every new cryptocurrency project utilizes the services of market makers to ensure their tokens can be traded. In fact, they often engage with multiple market makers, for insufficient liquidity is just about the fastest way to wreck an entire token economy. Projects need to ensure there is ample liquidity to attract retail and institutional investors to their tokens. After all, people are only going to invest serious money in an asset if they’re sure there’s sufficient demand to offload it quickly when they need to. Market makers can also help token creators to boost the accessibility of their assets by listing them on multiple exchange platforms, so they can ensure it’s available to buy from any location in the world. Indeed, many of the most reputable centralized crypto exchanges require that tokens have a contract with a reputable market maker as a precondition for listing them. In addition, market makers can also help crypto teams to make the most efficient use of their treasury supply. By placing liquidity on strategic decentralized exchange platforms, they can ensure that liquidity follows the price, without exposing those critical assets to impermanent loss. How Do Market Makers Operate? Market makers utilize a number of strategies to ensure a constant flow of liquidity. Exactly how they may go about doing this differs from market maker to market maker, as each one has its own, carefully crafted algorithmic trading software. For instance, Wintermute is one of the best known market makers. It utilizes algorithmic trading software that makes use of trading bots to provide fast liquidity for exchange platforms and token creators. Another market maker, GSR , provides “bespoke” liquidity and risk management solutions for digital asset creators, while also supporting institutions that want to trade large volumes of crypto assets. ‘ Another well known crypto market maker is Kairon Labs , which uses a proprietary algorithmic trading platform that it can quickly customize to meet the unique needs of any project. It bills itself as a boutique market maker, seeing each project it takes on as a partnership. For instance, its business model is designed to ensure that it only wins when its clients also win. Although each market maker has its own approach, as a rule of thumb they generally follow the below process: Post continuous orders: The main goal of the market maker is to continuously provide two prices – the bid and the ask price – to the orderbook. These quotes are made visible to every trader, ensuring there is always a standing offer for anyone who wants to trade the asset in question. In doing this, the market maker makes sure that someone can always buy or sell the desired asset, without having to wait until another human trader is willing to match their asking price. This job means that the market maker must be ready and willing to trade at its quoted prices, fulfilling orders even when the market is quiet or imbalanced. By making sure they are always available, the market maker prevents liquidity from drying up, so traders can buy and sell smoothly at all times. Maintain inventory: For market makers to be continuously available to buy and sell, they must maintain an inventory of the asset they’re covering. So if a buyer places an order, the market maker has enough of the asset to complete that sale. Or if someone wants to sell, it must have enough of the paired asset to enable that trade to go ahead. In this way, it’s constantly adding to, and taking out capital from its inventory, and it will need to ensure it always has enough of the asset available. Absorb imbalances: A sufficiently large inventory is required to help deal with orderbook imbalances, which may occur when there is news-driven volatility. For instance, if there’s a sudden spike in demand for a crypto asset, the market maker must be able to step in on the other side and sell a large volume of the underlying asset. Alternatively, if there is a large number of sellers, the market maker must be prepared to keep buying to prevent a sudden drop in its underlying price. By doing this, market makers can help the asset to ride out volatile conditions and prevent any significant changes in its underlying price. Dynamically adjust prices: It’s important to understand that just because market makers keep prices stable, they cannot prevent the price from changing, and nor should they try to do so. Rather, their job is to ensure liquidity is available, and this requires them to keep tabs on the prevailing market conditions, including the volume of buy and sell orders, price movements and market sentiments. By analyzing these metrics, it can then adjust its bid and ask prices to reflect the market condition and effectively manage its inventory levels to ensure it can meet trader’s demands. Execute immediately: Perhaps the most important task of all for market makers is to be able to execute immediately, so that traders aren’t left waiting. After all, profitable trading requires being able to move quickly in order to take advantage of asset price swings, so traders cannot be left waiting for their orders to complete. They need them to be executed the moment they click that button, and so the market maker must be ready to do this in an instant. Ethical Market Making For crypto projects to succeed, it’s important to understand the difference between legitimate market makers and the cowboy operators that have given the industry a bad name. Ethical market makers look to ensure sufficient liquidity, whereas the cowboy operators exist simply to try and pump token prices, using manipulative strategies such as wash trading. Although their activities may look similar, there’s a stark difference in what they actually do. Pumping token prices is relatively simple, and involves using automated bots to inflate trading volumes far beyond their real level, by constantly buying and selling from one another in an effort to make it look like there’s lots of supply and demand. Legitimate market makers, on the other hand, will only make as many maker and taker orders as necessary to maintain a healthy supply of liquidity. It can be difficult to understand the difference between ethical liquidity suppliers and token price manipulators, which is why companies like Kairon Labs provide deep analytics tools for customers to audit its activities across any exchange platform. This ensures they can keep tabs on what it’s doing to ensure it’s not artificially inflating trading volumes. Market Makers Make Markets Work From this understanding of how market makers operate, it becomes clear that they are essential to create healthy, functioning crypto markets. If market makers didn’t exist, it would be almost impossible for people to buy and sell their assets instantly, making trading a much slower, more volatile and unpredictable experience. If people’s trades are constantly delayed and their transactions often fail, that’s going to dissuade a lot of investors from entering the market, leading to negative consequences for the entire crypto industry. Market makers, by narrowing the bid-ask spread and ensuring transactions are processed immediately, help to reduce costs and keep trading more predictable. They help crypto assets to ride out brief moments of volatility and enable more efficient price discovery, with prices that are a true reflection of supply and demand.",Information,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-20 07:45:29

As of June 20, 2025, XRP is trading at about $2.15, a massive jump of over 334% from $0.49 a year ago. But is XRP a good investment right now? Let’s break down the facts, recent trends, and what experts are predicting. XRP Holds Steady Despite Concerns Over the past few years, XRP’s price growth was held back by its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but its recent performance has been mixed. In March 2025, the price dropped by 2.56%, followed by a 4.84% gain in April, and a slight dip of 0.78% in May. Meanwhile, in June, XRP has been mostly flat, with prices hovering around $2.17. This shows that it’s in a consolidation phase, waiting for the next big push. However, on-chain activity is low, with active wallets dropping from 100,000 to under 20,000 since December. This shows many are holding, not using XRP — a concern for long-term utility. Key Factors to Watch Several factors influence whether XRP is a good investment: Regulatory Clarity: The ongoing settlement talks between Ripple and the SEC have helped reduce legal uncertainty, now, all eyes are on August 15 . XRP ETF Approval : The key catalyst for XRP ETF approval is its security status. Despite this, Polymarket predicts a 89% chance the XRP ETF to get approved by the end of 2025. Institutional Adoption: Ripple’s partnerships with banks and payment networks are crucial. Currently, XRP is being used in real-world payments, boosting demand. It’s now linked with Thor Chain, UAE banks like Xand Bank and Momo, and tokenized real estate. Ripple has also acquired big firms like Metaco and Hidden Road, which handle $3 trillion yearly. Expert Predictions: XRP Price Eying $14 Although crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto says XRP’s current pattern mirrors 2017. Back then, XRP stayed flat for months before soaring 1,300% to $3.38. If the same happens now, XRP could jump from $2.19 to around $14, signaling a big rally ahead. Despite the optimism, XRP’s price is still volatile. Analysts say if adoption slows or rules get stricter, it could drop or stay flat around $1.80 to $2.",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-20 07:48:16

Hold Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) and Get Ahead of the Market with Early Signals XRP Struggles Amid Market Downturn, Key Levels in Focus XRP is currently trading between $2.06 and $2.31, reflecting a period of volatility for the cryptocurrency. Recent data shows a downward trend that has captured the attention of market observers. Over the past week, XRP's price has fallen by 5.01%. The decline is more pronounced over the past month, with a decrease of 9.45%. Looking at the last six months, XRP has seen a total drop of 5.32%. This sustained downward movement suggests bearish sentiment among traders. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for XRP stands at 46.34. An RSI below 50 often indicates that an asset is losing momentum, which could lead to further price declines. The nearest support level is at $1.94. If the price falls below this point, it might signal additional downward movement. On the other hand, the nearest resistance level is at $2.45. Breaking above this level could signal a potential reversal of the current trend. However, given the recent price declines and RSI reading, XRP may continue to face challenges in the short term. Conclusion Despite recent bullish trends, established cryptocurrencies like XRP show limited potential for significant short-term growth. Market predictions for XRP reaching $5 seem less promising, and other well-known coins face similar hurdles in achieving substantial immediate gains. In contrast, Codename:Pepe crypto is generating excitement with its innovative approach to maximizing profits. By leveraging advanced artificial intelligence to analyze market trends and automate trading strategies, it offers a unique opportunity for impressive returns. Its community-driven model and strategic tokenomics position it as a promising contender in the rapidly evolving crypto market.

On June 19, the California-based med tech firm announced that it would significantly expand its Bitcoin holdings over the next two and a half years, targeting 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, 42,000 BTC by the end of 2026, and ultimately 105,000 BTC by 2027. The purchases would be funded through a combination of equity and debt financing, along with operational cash flow. Semler has also appointed Joe Burnett as director of Bitcoin strategy. Burnett, a long-time Bitcoin advocate and former market research director at Unchained, is tasked with steering the firm’s treasury expansion. Under his leadership, the company will look to establish “one of the largest corporate Bitcoin treasuries in the world,” a goal Burnett described as aligned with the company’s long-term conviction in Bitcoin as the “ultimate long-duration asset” to hold. Semler has already achieved a 287% Bitcoin yield and $177 million in unrealized gains on its BTC holdings as of June 3.

Recent filings and public disclosures show that Semler acquired 894 BTC in the first quarter of 2025 at a total cost of $90.7 million. Subsequently, on April 30, the firm disclosed the acquisition of 165 BTC for $15.7 million. Just a week later, it announced another 167 BTC purchase for $16.2 million, bringing total holdings to 3,634 BTC. By mid-May, the figure had reached 3,808 BTC, with a total cost basis of $340 million and a fair value of $387.9 million at the time. Despite ongoing operating losses in its healthcare business, Semler’s Bitcoin strategy has driven positive returns . The company reported a 22.2% BTC yield in the first quarter of 2025 and a total unrealized gain of $177 million by early June. It also has one of the highest Bitcoin-per-share ratios among U.S. public companies, with 0.00034 BTC per share. Semler’s approach mirrors a broader trend among publicly traded companies in the United States and beyond that have turned to Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Tokyo-listed Metaplanet is one such example. The firm surpassed 10,000 BTC in holdings as of June 16, reaching its year-end 2025 target six months early. Metplanet is eyeing a more ambitious target of holding 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026 and 210,000 BTC by 2027, equivalent to 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply.

Schiff has long positioned himself as a gold advocate and has repeatedly dismissed Bitcoin as an asset with little to no real value.

Some pointed out that despite years of similar warnings, Bitcoin has continued to grow, both in value and adoption, defying his long-standing criticism. All Bitcoin will disrupt is the fortunes of those who buy it. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) June 20, 2025 In a follow-up reply to a commenter, Schiff doubled down. He claimed that people are “foolishly buying” Bitcoin instead of silver, adding that all the crypto king will ultimately do is “destroy the fortune of those who buy it.” Despite the criticism, BTC currently commands a greater market share than silver. As of now, Bitcoin ranks 7th among global assets by market capitalization at approximately $2.079 trillion, just ahead of silver, which holds the 8th spot at around $2.007 trillion. Schiff’s latest remarks come as Bitcoin’s performance has softened in recent weeks, though it remains relatively steady amid rising geopolitical tensions. At the time of writing, BTC is trading just above $104,700, down approximately 3.8% from its weekly high of over $108,000.

The bulls still hold strong at the level but the exhaustion might cause SOL to retrace further.

The 4-hour chart reinforces this downward trend with a bearish dominance in the MACD and the RSI falling into unfavorable territory, signaling potential continued downward momentum as SOL retraces to $144. The bulls find strong support at $145 suggesting the price may bounce back. The bullish market sentiment supports the notion and the increasing trade volume is also bullish.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-20 08:00:00

Yet it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s capturing the spotlight—driven by explosive presale momentum, political relevance, and rapid community expansion. Analysts are now positioning it as the altcoin with the strongest potential to echo Bitcoin’s (BTC) historic rise in this cycle. Anticipation Grows for MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Market Debut One of 2025’s most followed independent crypto analysts has identified MAGACOIN FINANCE as the top contender to outperform all memecoins and altcoins this cycle—and early market data is reinforcing that outlook. With limited access via the official website, the project continues to attract strong interest for its capped supply and bold, meme-driven branding that resonates across investor segments. Industry experts are closely tracking MAGACOIN FINANCE as it positions itself as a potential frontrunner in the altcoin space . A 100% bonus is available on all contributions using PATRIOTS100X . XRP: Lawsuit Outcome and ETF Hopes Drive Volatility XRP is trading near $0.54, up 4.6% in the last day, as the market awaits the pivotal June 16 Ripple lawsuit decision. With over $2.1 billion in daily trading volume and speculation around an XRP spot ETF, investor engagement is at a high. As XRP’s legal clarity unfolds, many traders are also diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE for early-stage upside. Bitcoin (BTC): Bullish Forecasts and Market Leadership Bitcoin continues to anchor the market, with forecasts suggesting a climb to $137,554 by June 2025 and a floor above $107,962. As BTC maintains its leadership and sets the tone for the entire sector, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing attention as the next possible breakout stories, offering a rare chance to get in early on a coin with viral momentum and strong fundamentals. Kaspa (KAS): Steady Growth but Cautious Outlook Kaspa is trading around $0.082, with a market cap exceeding $2.1 billion and mixed short-term signals. While KAS is forecast to remain range-bound between $0.077 and $0.082 through the summer, analysts see limited explosive upside compared to earlier cycles. In contrast, MAGACOINFINANCE’s presale and its strategic price point is drawing both retail and institutional capital looking for higher-multiple returns. Polkadot (DOT): Interoperability and Consistent Gains Polkadot is trading near $7.56 and has posted a 16% weekly gain, with technicals pointing to a steady climb toward $6.00–$7.00 by year-end. DOT’s interoperability focus is winning over developers and investors, but as the pace of gains moderates, more traders are rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture the kind of early-stage growth that defined Bitcoin’s ascent. Final Thoughts With Bitcoin, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE leading the narrative for 2025, the next crypto cycle could see MAGACOIN FINANCE tracking BTC’s legendary path. As live catalysts unfold for XRP, KAS, and DOT, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale momentum and analyst confidence make it a top candidate for breakout success.

Because ETH and most altcoins are still far from their previous ATHs. At this point, while investors are still waiting for a major altcoin season to come, a survey drew attention. TheBlockchainMedia recently conducted a poll asking users to vote for the altcoin they are most bullish on. The poll included Hedera (HBAR), Algorand (ALGO), Cardano (ADA), and XRP. While the survey is not yet complete, Cardano has emerged as the top performer, ahead of XRP, HBAR, and ALGO. The results quickly caught the attention of the community, and even Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson. Hoskinson backed the election and its results with the phrase “a nice poll.” Although Hoskinson's comment was brief, the community said the poll could be an early signal of a shift in investor focus and a bullish move. Experts said this vote showed strong confidence and support for ADA despite market volatility. Charles Hoskinson recently proposed swapping 100 million ADA tokens for Bitcoin. Although this proposal received backlash, Hoskinson argued that the BTC swap did not pose a risk to the ADA price.

In the post, Farina frames the negative coverage and skepticism surrounding XRP as intentional and designed to divert public attention from its underlying potential. According to his argument, these narratives are part of a broader effort to steer the general population toward Bitcoin (BTC) while keeping them uninformed about alternatives such as XRP. Farina states , “The mainstream campaign against $XRP tells you everything you need to know.” He follows this with the suggestion that public sentiment is being manipulated to focus on Bitcoin while ignoring other digital assets that, in his view, may offer superior utility or strategic relevance. He continues, “They want the masses to blindly bet their entire net worth into BTC while distracting them from the real deal.” Farina concludes the tweet with a rhetorical remark, “When was the last time the masses were right? History says this won’t end well for 99%.” His message implies that historical patterns of mass behavior often end in poor outcomes for most participants, and that the current push towards Bitcoin dominance may ultimately be no different. The mainstream campaign against $XRP tells you everything you need to know. They want the masses to blindly bet their entire net worth into BTC while distracting them from the real deal. When was the last time the masses were right? History says this won’t end well for 99%. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 18, 2025 Supportive and Critical Reactions from the Online Community The post attracted commentary from various users on the X platform, with a mix of agreement and disagreement. A user named Caspian endorsed the core sentiment, stating, “Distracting narratives favor control over clarity. Real leverage grows by understanding the system beneath the noise, and positioning yourself where lasting value is quietly built.” Caspian’s remark aligns with Farina’s comment that media and institutional emphasis on Bitcoin may be crowding out attention from lesser-publicized projects that could offer long-term value. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another user, Tara369, shared a different perspective, challenging the assumption that the general public is heavily invested in Bitcoin. She said, “I don’t think the masses care about btc. No one I know owns it. In addition the masses can’t afford their groceries I’m sure btc is the last on their mind.” Her response describes economic hardship as a more immediate concern for most individuals, implying that the conversation around digital assets may not even be relevant to large segments of the population at this time. Ongoing Market Tensions Over Narrative Control and Investment Direction Farina’s position underscores a belief held by certain segments of the XRP community that media, corporate, and financial institutions elevate Bitcoin while undermining digital assets such as XRP , which they argue possess unique technological advantages and practical use cases. While critics argue that this view lacks substantiated evidence and stems from confirmation bias, supporters continue to call attention to regulatory actions, inconsistent reporting, and market behavior that they interpret as reinforcing their stance. Farina’s commentary suggests that for retail investors, understanding the motivations behind public messaging is as important as analyzing the technical or financial fundamentals of any given asset. Whether or not the public has embraced Bitcoin to the degree claimed, his statement contributes to the ongoing discourse around trust, transparency, and the role of influence in the digital asset economy.

Mehdi Farooq, an investment partner at Hypersphere and ex-Animoca Brands exec, revealed in a post on X on Thursday that he lost a large portion of his life savings in a Zoom hack linked to the North Korean hacking group Lazarus. The scam began when Farooq received a Telegram message from Alex Lin, a professional acquaintance. Lin asked to catch up, and Farooq shared his Calendly link to schedule a call. The next day, shortly before the meeting, Lin messaged again, asking to switch the call to Zoom Business “for compliance reasons,” explaining that one of his limited partners, Kent — whom Farooq also knew — would be joining. The Zoom meeting appeared legitimate. Both participants had their cameras on, but there was no audio. In the Zoom chat, they said they were having technical issues and asked Farooq to update his Zoom client. Within minutes of installing the fake update, six of Farooq’s crypto wallets were drained. It was only afterward that Farooq realized Lin’s account had been hacked. The scheme was later linked to Lazarus, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group. “It was surreal and completely violating. But in the darkest moment, whitehat hackers stepped up — complete strangers offering help when I was at my lowest. Turns out I was compromised by DPRK affiliated threat know as dangrouspassword,” wrote Farooq. You might also like: Manta Network co-founder targeted by Lazarus in Zoom phishing attack This incident echoes a recent phishing attempt targeting Manta Network co-founder Kenny Li, who narrowly avoided a similar fate. Li recounted that the attackers impersonated known contacts during a Zoom call, used fake video feeds, and insisted on a suspicious Zoom update download. Suspecting foul play, Li suggested switching communication platforms, prompting the attackers to block him and erase messages. Security analysts say that this attack vector — where hackers pose as trusted contacts, fake technical glitches, and push malware disguised as Zoom updates — is a hallmark of Lazarus operations and has been used repeatedly to steal millions in crypto. Other crypto industry leaders, including founders from Mon Protocol , Stably , and Devdock AI , have reported similar phishing attempts, highlighting how widespread and targeted these attacks have become.

The web3 revolution promised a decentralized utopia where users would control their assets and data in an open, borderless digital economy. Instead, we have built a maze of isolated networks, each demanding its own wallet, gas token, and operating rules. This industry-wide fragmentation can hinder innovation and deter new users from adopting the technology. Interoperability between chains is not just a technical improvement; it is the foundational layer for the mainstream future of web3. You might also like: Warning to builders: L2s are leaking value, L1 appchains are the smarter bet | Opinion The current fragmentation of web3, with its multiple networks and need for diverse wallets and tokens, hinders adoption and contradicts the promise of frictionless value exchange. However, recent initiatives such as Ethereum’s ERC-7930 and ERC-7828 standards , along with the vision of a “ meta-blockchain ” proposed by Solana’s ( SOL ) co-founder, are promising steps toward unifying the ecosystem. These and other advances promise to reduce complexity and costs, paving the way for a more seamless and interconnected user experience for a new and improved web3 generation. Web3 is currently fragmented The current multi-chain ecosystem is a usability nightmare. Users must manage multiple wallets, memorize different seed phrases, and navigate inconsistent interfaces just to interact with basic services. A DeFi enthusiast might hold Bitcoin ( BTC ) in a hardware wallet, trade Ethereum ( ETH ) tokens on MetaMask, and stake Cardano ( ADA ) assets through Lace Wallet. Each step requires manual bridging, fee calculations, and security reviews. This fragmented experience is not just inconvenient; it is a systemic failure that contradicts blockchain’s promise of frictionless value exchange. The problem goes beyond individual workflows because wallets, decentralized applications (dApps), and block explorers follow conflicting conventions: Ethereum uses hexadecimal addresses, Bitcoin uses Base58, and newer blockchains adopt proprietary formats. This inconsistency creates what Galaxy researchers call “asset fragmentation,” where identical tokens bridged across chains become non-fungible, confusing users and diluting liquidity. Without standardization, web3 will remain like a Tower of Babel, where communication between chains is more akin to translation than transaction. Transaction fees: The silent killer of UX Cross-chain transactions impose a hidden tax through cumulative transaction fees. Users pay fees for transactions on the source chain, execution on the destination chain, and relay services. With this structure, if the user is not careful, they could incur costs exceeding the value of the assets being transferred. ERC-20 token swaps on Ethereum can incur fees exceeding $10 during congestion spikes, while bridging between layer-2 networks adds further complexity. These costs are not only financial but also cognitive. New users must learn the commission dynamics of each chain, from Ethereum’s gas auctions to Solana’s fixed fees, creating a steep learning curve that discourages adoption. Layer-2 solutions, such as Arbitrum ( ARB ) and Optimism ( OP ), offer partial relief by reducing commissions by up to 95%, but introduce new fragmentation, as mentioned by Solana co-founder Anatoly Yokovenko . For example, a user bridging USDC ( USDC ) from Arbitrum to Polygon must still navigate distinct rollup architectures, completion times, and liquidity pools, a process more like exchanging currencies at a border than enjoying a seamless experience. True interoperability requires abstracting these complexities, not just optimizing them. Towards a frictionless cross-chain UX The ultimate goal is not cross-chain transactions , but chain-agnostic transactions. Users should access DeFi pools, NFT markets, and DAOs through unified interfaces that abstract underlying networks. Imagine a wallet that automatically selects the cheapest chain for swaps, routes transactions over optimal bridges, and consolidates transaction fees into a single stablecoin payment, all while maintaining self-custody and security. This level of functionality requires new technological innovations, such as DeFAI , to fully demonstrate its potential. If interchain transactions were more integrated, AI agents could already be handling most transactions in decentralized finance; however, to reach this point, there is still a long way to go. Moreover, true interoperability requires deeper integration. Smart contracts should run cross-chain without custom wrappers, while decentralized identities (DIDs) and other dApps should be ported frictionlessly between ecosystems. Interoperability developments should focus on this path to create super wallets that facilitate the use of web3 in its entirety. A call for collaborative innovation, with safety as a non-negotiable pillar Interoperability should never compromise security. Cross-chain bridges remain prime targets for attacks, with more than $2 billion stolen in 2023 alone. Centralized validators and opaque code plague many solutions, betraying the decentralized spirit of blockchain. The answer lies in new cryptographic tools, such as zero-knowledge proofs, that verify cross-chain events without the need for trusted intermediaries. The industry must adopt high security standards, ensuring that interoperability protocols meet the security guarantees of their underlying chains. For this, more cooperative initiatives must be formed to create standards, such as the Linux Foundation’s Decentralized Trust and the EEA DLT Interoperability Specification, led by Dr Weijia Zhang, a pioneer in blockchain interoperability standards. Solving the UX crisis in web3 requires collaboration across ecosystems. Developers must prioritize interoperability in base protocols, not as an afterthought. Standardization bodies must accelerate initiatives, while users must demand interoperability from wallet and dApp providers . Either we tear down the walls between chains, or we condemn users to a future of digital border controls and cognitive overload, which hurts us all as an industry. Interoperability between blockchains is a great unifier The blockchain’s potential depends on interconnection, just as TCP/IP unified computer networks on the Internet, interoperability protocols can weave isolated web3 chains into a cohesive digital economy. The technical blueprints exist, from ERC-7930 address formats and “meta-blockchain”, for example. What is lacking is collective will. As an industry, we must stop building isolated kingdoms and start laying the railroads between them. Only then will web3 transcend its niche and fulfill the promise of an open and user-centric Internet, with a user-friendly experience. The choice is clear: interoperate or stagnate.

Mehdi Farooq, now an investment partner at Hypersphere Ventures, revealed that six of his cryptocurrency wallets were emptied after he unknowingly installed a fake Zoom update. Mehdi Farooq @MehdiFarooq2 · Follow One minute I was prepping for a Zoom call. Ten minutes later, large part of my life savings were gone.It started with a message on Telegram from Alex Lin — someone I knew. He wanted to catch up.I shared my Calendly link.He booked a slot for the next day.A few minutes 6:29 AM · Jun 19, 2025 1.2K Reply Copy link Read 290 replies The elaborate scam exploited social trust, professional networks, and video conferencing software to carry out one of the most sophisticated wallet-draining attacks reported this year. Hackers impersonated contacts through Telegram and Zoom The phishing scheme began with a Telegram message sent to Farooq from someone appearing to be Alex Lin, a known acquaintance. After some back-and-forth, Farooq agreed to a call and shared his Calendly link to schedule a meeting. The day of the meeting, the same account messaged again, citing compliance reasons to move the conversation to Zoom Business. Farooq was told that another known industry contact, Kent, would be joining the call. The Zoom meeting appeared legitimate. The participants had their cameras turned on, but no audio could be heard. Instead, a message appeared in the meeting chat explaining there were technical difficulties and requesting Farooq to update his Zoom client. He complied, and within minutes of installing the file, all six of his crypto wallets were compromised and emptied. The attackers used malware disguised as a Zoom update to gain access to Farooq’s system. The communication and social engineering techniques employed align with previous incidents linked to Lazarus Group, a well-known North Korean hacking unit accused of multiple high-value crypto thefts in recent years . Lazarus linked through behaviour patterns and malware type The phishing attack bore several hallmarks of Lazarus operations. These include impersonation of known industry contacts, the use of malware-laced installers, and manipulation of video conferencing platforms. In this case, the attackers staged a convincing video call while disabling audio, a tactic that may have distracted Farooq from questioning the legitimacy of the situation. Farooq’s experience comes just weeks after a similar phishing attempt targeted Kenny Li, co-founder of Manta Network. In that case, attackers used identical techniques—fake Zoom calls, impersonated contacts, and malware download prompts. Li avoided falling victim by suggesting a switch to another communication platform, at which point the attackers disappeared. Security researchers believe these coordinated attacks indicate Lazarus has refined its methods and increased its focus on exploiting trust between professionals. The malware used in both incidents closely resembles code used in other Lazarus-attributed attacks, especially the “dangrouspassword” exploit noted by analysts. Multiple founders report similar tactics in recent weeks The attack on Farooq is part of a growing trend of sophisticated phishing campaigns targeting cryptocurrency executives and developers. Founders and team members from Mon Protocol, Stably, and Devdock AI have also reported receiving suspicious messages that attempted to lure them into compromised Zoom environments. On 11 March, Nick Bax from the Security Alliance shared a breakdown of the Lazarus-linked phishing strategy in a post on X, outlining how attackers use genuine social connections, coupled with video conferencing, to install remote access tools and steal crypto assets.

Over $50M has been taken through Telegram deals, promising a discounted price against a vesting schedule. Telegram users have reported channels where discounted offers were made for potentially trending altcoins. An estimated $50M has been taken from buyers, who were promised a sale of altcoins at a discount, while agreeing on a vesting schedule. The scammers offered altcoins with sufficient liquidity and presence on social media, promising potential rallies. The offers included SUI, NEAR, SEI, and Axelar (AXL). The offers came from Tier-1 coins, which were considered reliable and liquid, with a lower risk profile compared to memes. The scam started with the first sale rounds in November 2024, just as crypto was entering another hype cycle. The first round of coins offered 50% discount on The Graph (GRT), Aptos, SEI, WELL, and others. On-chain data showed the tokens were available in designated wallets, and the scheme built up trust. Scam revealed by Aza Ventures Bulletin on Telegram Following a few rounds of OTC sales, the deals expanded in size, again including Axelar, NEAR, GRASS, and other tokens. The last offer came on June 1, for FLUID tokens. Token teams started being aware of the potential loss, with SUI and EGold (EGLD) warning about the OTC deals. The teams explained there is no program or deal for deep discounts and vesting. Even on-chain investigator ZachXBT warned about the risk of doing deals on Telegram, offered by an unknown VC fund. Despite this, the subscribers showed trust and demand for the deals, due to the track record of some of the participants. Until recently, the team sent out excuses that the deals would go through, citing project delays and technicalities. The Azra Ventures Bulletin channel on Telegram claimed new OTC deals were coming until the last moment. | Source: Telegram In the past two weeks, the main source of deals, referred to as Source 1, disappeared from the OTC channel Aza Ventures Bulletin. The channel announced that part of the deals were in fact Ponzi schemes, while others were legitimate and some value could be salvaged. Aza Ventures is a Tier-4 crypto VC fund, with 71 investments in relatively small projects. The channel admin is now dealing with the three main originators of OTC deals, aiming to recoup the funds by the end of June. Authorities and exchanges have been notified, with the possibility to freeze funds. Up to $50M have been taken from buyers, which include whales, KOLs and other projects. The deals included multiple trending tokens, including Kava Fluid, OG, Aethir, Movement, The Sandbox, Ronin, Celestia, Wormhole, Arkham, Berachain, and more. The offers showed awareness of crypto trends, offering some of the hottest trending altcoins and projects. Scammer linked to Binance-listed crypto project One of the biggest blows against trust in crypto is the person referred to as Source 1. For now, the channel is guarding their identity, though there are claims the seller is also the founder of another significant crypto project, with a reputation and a listing on Binance. Initially, the OTC deals channel will not dox the identity of Source 1, aiming to use the leverage for recouping as much value for investors as possible. “ I want to be clear: the only reason I am not currently disclosing Source 1’s identity is because I believe keeping this confidential for now gives us the best chance to recoup both your and my investments. If, at a later stage, the community feels it is better to dox them and proceed differently, I am open to that. But at this point, disclosure could jeopardize recovery efforts,” announced the channel admin. However, Source 1 may have leaked his real personality, by trying to differentiate his social profile from the scam. Recently, Ravindra Kumar posted on X, stating he was not involved with OTC deals. Kumar is one of the founders of Self Chain (SLF), formerly known as Frontier.

Scale of the Breach Uncovered In one of the largest known breaches of its kind, cybersecurity researchers have confirmed the exposure of more than 16 billion login credentials online, triggering serious concerns across the crypto industry and digital security landscape. The discovery follows multiple reports earlier this year about an unprotected database containing 184 million records found on a public server. However, fresh investigations suggest that initial find was only a fraction of a much larger breach. According to researchers cited by Forbes, at least 30 separate datasets have now been uncovered, each containing up to 3.5 billion records. These datasets reportedly include login credentials for a broad range of services, spanning social media, cryptocurrency exchanges, developer platforms, VPN services, and even government accounts. Crypto and Financial Platforms at Risk The potential for these stolen credentials to enable unauthorised access to wallets, exchange accounts, and DeFi platforms is of particular concern to the cryptocurrency sector. Given the irreversible nature of blockchain transactions, compromised accounts could lead to instant asset theft without any recourse for victims. The datasets were briefly accessible online via Elasticsearch databases and object storage instances, leaving them vulnerable to anyone aware of their presence. Cybernews, which reported on the breach, warns that this is not outdated or irrelevant data, but fresh, actionable information likely harvested through modern infostealer malware. Origins Remain Unclear The precise source of the leak remains unknown. Investigators believe the datasets are likely an amalgamation of information harvested from various infostealers, credential stuffing operations, and previous leaks. While there’s a chance that some of the data may have been compiled by security researchers monitoring breaches, it’s widely assumed that cybercriminal groups were responsible for aggregating much of this information. Experts note that massive troves of this nature enable cybercriminals to scale up operations ranging from identity theft and phishing attacks to account takeovers. Even a low success rate can translate to millions of compromised victims when working with billions of credentials. Crypto Security Community Urges Vigilance In light of the breach, security experts are advising crypto users and platform operators to adopt enhanced protective measures. Regularly updating passwords, using strong, unique credentials for every service, and scanning systems for malware are now considered essential. While the breach’s full impact is still being assessed, the crypto industry, which is often targeted for its financial assets and decentralised platforms, remains particularly vulnerable. As long as ownership of the leaked datasets remains unidentified, experts warn that users will have limited control over mitigating risks, underscoring the importance of proactive cyber hygiene.

Gain secure, regulated exposure to global payment innovation… pic.twitter.com/Z7McANo6B4 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 18, 2025 Regulated Access to XRP via ETF Structure According to the advertisement, the Purpose XRP ETF aims to offer investors secure and streamlined access to XRP’s performance without the complexities of directly purchasing and storing the asset themselves. The fund is described as providing “secure, regulated exposure to global payment innovation through an ETF holding XRP directly.” By structuring this exposure through a familiar investment vehicle, Purpose Investments intends to lower the barrier to entry for traditional and institutional investors who might otherwise avoid direct engagement with digital asset exchanges. The ETF is eligible for Canadian TFSA and RRSP accounts and is supported by dual custodians: Gemini Trust Company, LLC, and Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC. This dual-custodian structure is designed to bolster investor confidence by ensuring robust safekeeping standards and regulatory compliance. The fund is audited by Ernst & Young LLP, adding another layer of institutional-grade accountability. Positioning XRP as Core Infrastructure for Global Payments The promotional material asserts that XRP is more than a digital currency, describing it as a foundational element in the next generation of financial infrastructure. “With the XRP Ledger’s powerful blockchain technology and XRP’s increasing adoption by financial institutions globally,” the document states, “we believe this digital asset is poised to reshape the future of cross-border payments.” This perspective aligns with ongoing narratives in the fintech space that view XRP and its underlying ledger as viable technologies for institutional-grade financial settlements . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Data within the advertisement reinforces these claims. As of March 31, 2025, XRP stood at a market capitalization of $130 billion, compared to Bitcoin’s $1.663 trillion and Ethereum’s $217.8 billion. However, XRP leads both assets in transaction throughput, processing approximately 1,500 transactions per second at an average fee of $0.0002, according to figures cited from Coingecko and ycharts.com. The promotional material contrasts these numbers with Ethereum’s $0.3611 and Bitcoin’s $0.2760 per transaction, suggesting XRP’s cost-efficiency is a competitive advantage in high-volume environments. Comparative Simplicity for Investors A visual comparison of the materials outlines how the Purpose XRP ETF simplifies investor access to XRP. Traditional acquisition of XRP typically requires evaluating a digital marketplace, opening and funding an exchange account, creating a compatible wallet, and manually executing purchases. By contrast, investors in the Purpose XRP ETF simply buy into the ETF through standard investment accounts such as TFSA or RRSP, with the fund manager handling the direct XRP acquisition and custody process. This ease of access is likely to appeal to both institutional and individual investors who prefer indirect exposure through professionally managed vehicles. Backed by Recognized Institutions and Transparent Oversight The advertisement also lists other key stakeholders in the ETF’s structure. Purpose Investments serves as the manager, with valuation provided by CIBC Mellon Global Securities Services Company. TSX Trust Company is listed as the registrar and transfer agent. The presentation and branding underscore a concerted effort to position XRP within a regulated and familiar investment framework. The tone and content of the advertisement reinforce the message that XRP is not only viable but desirable for long-term participation in the evolving digital finance landscape.

The two companies have registered a trust called Invesco Galaxy Solana ETF, according to public records. Various firms have registered trusts, seeking SEC approval for a crypto ETF. Using trusts allows them to have the legal framework ready, and is a major signal to regulators and investors of their intent. Momentum For SOL ETF Builds Up The new developments from Galaxy and Invesco come at a time when momentum for a spot SOL ETF is building up. According to recent Polymarket data, the possibility of a Solana ETF being approved in 2025 currently stands at over 90%. This optimism is based on recent reporting that suggests the SEC could approve SOL ETFs as early as July 2025. How Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Could Benefit Amid this potential launch of a spot SOL ETF, it could open an opportunity for investors to benefit from the expected altcoin wave. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently one of the most exciting presales in the market, which has raised over $10.8 million to date. With market optimism at over 90%, a SOL ETF could send presale participation into overdrive, with the momentum expected to carry over into the token listing. Investors are keenly eying Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and are seeking to make massive gains on the token listing. Its commitment to utility and the ongoing $100,000 giveaway are some of the main drivers of the presale. The $100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has organized a massive $100,000 giveaway for presale participants. The team plans to give away $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens to ten lucky winners each. To qualify for this giveaway, all you need to do is participate in the presale with at least a $50 purchase. The giveaway is meant as a reward to early supporters of the project. In addition to the $10,000 prize, presale participants will also be ranked on a leaderboard on the presale dashboard. The top 50 participants in the presale will be eligible for bonus MUTM tokens. The MUTM Token Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of the presale, where tokens are going for $0.03 each. To participate in the presale, all you need is to connect your wallet containing one of the accepted assets. You can then buy as much or as little as you desire. The current price of the tokens is a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. This stepped increase in the token price is meant to ensure that the earliest supporters of the vision will receive the biggest rewards. So far, around 12,200 unique buyers have participated in the presale, raising over $10.8 million. The presale has been a massive success, with 40% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 of the presale already sold, barely two weeks after it launched. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. Analysts are extremely optimistic about the price of MUTM tokens once they go live. They are predicting that the token price could go up by 2,450% when the tokens go live. Based on that projection, a $1600 investment in the presale could grow to $39,200. That is a massive return that every investor wants to get hold of while the opportunity still lasts. Planned Beta Launch Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to launch a beta version of the platform on the token listing day. That event is expected to produce massive buying pressure for the MUTM tokens. The beta launch will help to convince doubters who have been on the sidelines since phase 1 of the token presale. It will act as proof of concept and allow future users to test the platform’s features for themselves. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is expected to list on top-tier exchanges, and the beta version launch could provide the last spark needed to drive prices to the stratosphere. Other elements of the projects have also excited investors, including the planned launch of a stablecoin. This stablecoin launch will further boost market participation in the MUTM protocol, helping to boost the price of MUTM tokens. With the planned expansion to multiple blockchain networks, it will ensure that as much of the market as possible can benefit from the numerous profitability opportunities offered on the protocol. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an exciting project in the presale market that has attracted the attention of investors and analysts alike. The upcoming SOL ETH launch could trigger the start of altcoin season, and MUTM tokens provide the perfect vehicle to ride this wave. At the current low price of $0.03 per token, you are getting your tokens at a 50% discount compared to those who hold their purchase until the token listing price of $0.06.

The events unfolding in this sector in 2025 have significant implications for innovation, AI development, and global tech dynamics. Let’s look at the key moments from the first half of the year. Tracking the 2025 US Semiconductor Market The year 2025 has proven eventful for the US semiconductor industry. The industry is central to the ongoing ‘AI race’, making its developments highly relevant. From leadership changes at major companies to significant policy shifts and market reactions, the landscape is constantly evolving. Navigating AI Chip Export Restrictions Export restrictions on advanced AI chip export have been a dominant theme. These rules, aimed at limiting China’s access to cutting-edge AI technology, have directly impacted major players like Nvidia and AMD. The proposed, then rescinded, ‘Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule’ by the Biden administration and subsequent guidance from the Trump administration highlight the volatile nature of this policy area. Companies are grappling with compliance while trying to maintain global market share. Intel’s Strategic Shifts and Intel Layoffs Intel, a foundational company in the US semiconductor market , has seen substantial activity. A major change came with the appointment of Lip-Bu Tan as CEO in March. His focus on revitalizing the company as ‘engineering-first’ quickly led to strategic decisions. In April, planned Intel layoffs of over 21,000 employees were announced, intended to streamline management and rebuild engineering focus. This was followed by news in June that specific layoffs, impacting 15-20% of the Intel Foundry staff, would begin in July. The company also announced spinning off noncore assets and exploring joint ventures, such as the rumored deal with TSMC in April. Nvidia AI Chips Face Export Headwinds Nvidia, a leader in Nvidia AI chips , has felt the direct impact of export controls. The H20 AI chip faced new licensing requirements in April, resulting in significant charges. In May, Nvidia reported a $4.5 billion charge in Q1 related to these rules, anticipating an $8 billion hit in Q2 revenue. By June, CEO Jensen Huang stated the company would exclude the Chinese market from future forecasts, signaling acceptance of the ongoing restrictions and their financial consequences. AMD Acquisitions Expand AI Capabilities AMD has been actively expanding its AI portfolio through strategic AMD acquisitions . In May, AMD acquired Enosemi, a silicon photonics startup, highlighting interest in advanced data transmission tech. This was followed by acquiring AI software optimization startup Brium in June, aimed at making AI software more compatible across different hardware platforms, including AMD’s. Another notable move in June was the ‘acqui-hire’ of the team behind Untether AI, specializing in AI inference chips, further strengthening AMD’s competitive position against rivals in the AI hardware space. The first half of 2025 underscores the intense competition, geopolitical pressures, and rapid technological advancements shaping the US semiconductor industry. Companies are adapting through leadership changes, strategic investments, workforce adjustments, and navigating complex regulatory environments. These developments will continue to influence the broader tech landscape, including areas relevant to the crypto and blockchain ecosystem that rely on advanced processing power.

The California-based company aims to increase its Bitcoin stash from the current 3,808 BTC to a staggering 105,000 BTC over the next two and a half years—equivalent to roughly 0.5% of Bitcoin’s total capped supply of 21 million. Semler outlined its roadmap in a statement on Thursday, revealing it plans to accumulate 10,000 BTC by the end of 2024, 42,000 BTC by 2026, and finally hit the 105,000 BTC milestone by 2027. The company said it would use a mix of equity offerings, debt financing, and operational cash flow to fund its Bitcoin strategy. Notably, it has appointed Bitcoin analyst Joe Burnett as its new Director of Bitcoin Strategy to lead the initiative. Joe Burnett to Spearhead Semler Scientific’s Bitcoin Strategy Burnett brings extensive experience in Bitcoin markets, having previously served as director of market research at Unchained and head analyst at Blockware Solutions. Prior to entering the crypto industry, Burnett worked at the accounting giant Ernst & Young. Speaking on his new role, Burnett stated, “The trend to adopt Bitcoin as part of corporate treasury is clearly accelerating.” Semler first entered the Bitcoin space in May 2024 and quickly climbed to 13th place among public companies in terms of BTC holdings, according to BitBo. Its move follows a broader trend among listed firms using Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Japan’s Metaplanet also recently unveiled a plan to acquire 210,000 BTC by 2027, signaling growing institutional appetite for digital assets. Critics Raise Concerns Amid Stock Price Dip However, not everyone is on board with Semler’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy. Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, warned that companies pursuing large-scale Bitcoin purchases risk diluting shareholder value if their stock prices fall too low. Sigel noted that while no firm has yet reached that breaking point, Semler is “now approaching parity.” Shares in Semler Scientific (SMLR) have dropped nearly 41% this year and are nearing the levels seen before its Bitcoin investments began. Despite the stock pressure, Semler has recorded a paper gain of $177 million as of June 3, thanks to a 287% yield on its Bitcoin buys. With 0.00034 BTC per share, the company now ranks fourth in Bitcoin exposure per share among 130 public firms tracked by BitcoinTreasuries.NET.

Get ready for some groundbreaking news that underscores just how quickly the digital asset world is integrating with traditional finance. A recent report from leading crypto infrastructure firm Fireblocks paints a vivid picture: institutional crypto adoption for payments is not just a future concept; it’s happening now, at scale. Institutional Crypto Adoption: The Striking Reality Imagine nearly half of the world’s major companies and financial institutions already leveraging digital currencies for their payment needs. That’s exactly what Fireblocks’ May 22 report, published on their official blog, reveals. According to their findings, a significant 49% of global institutions are actively using stablecoins for payments right now. But the momentum doesn’t stop there. An additional 41% are either in the piloting phase or actively planning their stablecoin payment strategies. This means a staggering 90% of surveyed institutions are already engaged or preparing to engage with stablecoins for transactional purposes. This isn’t just a niche trend anymore. It’s a fundamental shift in how businesses are thinking about moving value across borders and within their operations. The data suggests that the perceived barriers to entry are lowering, and the tangible benefits are becoming too compelling to ignore. Why Are Stablecoins Becoming Essential for Business Payments? The rapid move towards stablecoins for business payments isn’t happening without good reason. Stablecoins, typically pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, offer the best of both worlds: the efficiency and speed of cryptocurrencies combined with the relative price stability of traditional fiat currencies. This stability is crucial for businesses that need predictable transaction costs and value transfer. Here are some key benefits driving this adoption: Speed and Efficiency: Traditional payment systems, especially cross-border ones, can be slow, taking days to settle. Stablecoins can settle in minutes or seconds, enabling faster business cycles. Reduced Costs: Transaction fees on blockchain networks using stablecoins are often significantly lower than traditional banking fees, particularly for international transfers. 24/7 Availability: Unlike banks that operate during business hours, blockchain networks are always on, allowing businesses to send and receive payments anytime, anywhere. Transparency and Traceability: Transactions are recorded on a public or permissioned ledger, offering greater transparency and easier reconciliation. Programmability: Stablecoins can be integrated into smart contracts, enabling automated payments, escrow services, and complex financial operations. Access to New Markets: Stablecoins can facilitate payments in regions where traditional banking infrastructure is limited or costly. These advantages directly address pain points that businesses face daily, making stablecoins a powerful tool for modern finance. Cross-Border Payments Crypto: Leading the Charge One area where stablecoins are particularly impactful is cross-border payments crypto . The Fireblocks report specifically highlights strong momentum in North America, detailing the specific use cases where institutions are deploying stablecoin-based payment flows. Cross-border transfers lead the pack, with 39% of North American institutions using stablecoins for this purpose. Why is this use case so popular? International payments are notoriously slow, expensive, and opaque using traditional methods. Stablecoins offer a near-instantaneous, cost-effective alternative that bypasses complex correspondent banking networks. This is a game-changer for companies operating globally, enabling faster supply chain finance, easier international payroll, and quicker settlement with international partners. Beyond cross-border transfers, North American institutions are also leveraging stablecoins for: Use Case % of North American Institutions Using Stablecoins Cross-Border Transfers 39% Payment Acceptance 22% Merchant Settlement 18% Internal Treasury Operations 12% B2B Invoicing 9% This breakdown shows that stablecoins are finding diverse applications within the enterprise, from handling external payments (acceptance, settlement, invoicing) to optimizing internal financial flows (treasury operations). Enterprise Blockchain Payments: Fueled by Regulatory Confidence The Fireblocks report also sheds light on a crucial factor accelerating enterprise blockchain payments , particularly in North America: regulatory outlook. A striking 88% of North American respondents expressed a positive outlook on stablecoin regulations. This high level of confidence in the regulatory environment is a significant driver for institutional adoption. Regulatory clarity is often cited as one of the biggest hurdles for traditional institutions entering the crypto space. The positive sentiment in North America suggests that efforts by regulators and policymakers in the region are building confidence among businesses. As institutions feel more secure about the legal and compliance frameworks surrounding stablecoins, they are more willing to invest in and deploy these technologies for core business functions. This regulatory comfort reduces perceived risk and encourages further exploration and implementation of digital asset strategies within large organizations. The Future of Payments Stablecoins: What’s Next? With nearly half of global institutions already on board and another 41% planning their move, it’s clear that the future of payments stablecoins is bright. The trend highlighted by Fireblocks suggests we are moving towards a world where digital currencies are a standard tool in the corporate finance toolkit. What can we expect to see next? Expansion of Use Cases: Expect stablecoins to be used for more complex financial activities like tokenized real-world assets, supply chain finance automation, and even potentially for employee payroll. Increased Integration: Stablecoin payment solutions will become more seamlessly integrated into existing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and treasury management platforms. Global Harmonization (Eventual): While North America shows strong positive sentiment, regulatory clarity is needed globally to unlock the full potential of cross-border stablecoin payments worldwide. Rise of CBDCs and Other Digital Currencies: The success of stablecoins may pave the way for the adoption of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and other forms of digital money within the enterprise. The report indicates a clear trajectory towards greater digital asset utilization in corporate finance. Actionable Insights for Businesses If your business isn’t yet exploring stablecoins for payments, this report is a wake-up call. Here are some actionable steps: Educate Your Team: Understand what stablecoins are, how they work, and their potential benefits and risks. Identify Key Pain Points: Where in your current payment processes (especially cross-border) are you facing delays, high costs, or lack of transparency? Stablecoins might offer a solution. Start Small: Consider piloting stablecoin payments for a specific use case, like settling with a particular international vendor or accepting payments from a specific group of customers. Choose the Right Partner: Work with reputable crypto infrastructure providers (like Fireblocks and others) who can offer secure, compliant, and scalable solutions for institutional needs. Stay Informed on Regulation: Keep track of regulatory developments in your operating regions. Ignoring this trend could mean missing out on significant efficiency gains and cost savings. Conclusion: A New Era of Enterprise Payments is Here The Fireblocks report provides compelling evidence that institutional crypto adoption is rapidly transforming the global payment landscape. With nearly half of global institutions already using stablecoins for payments and a vast majority either using, piloting, or planning their integration, the momentum is undeniable. Stablecoins offer tangible benefits in terms of speed, cost, and efficiency, making them increasingly attractive for everything from cross-border transfers to internal treasury operations. Fueled by growing regulatory clarity, particularly in regions like North America, businesses are gaining the confidence needed to leverage these digital assets at scale. The future of enterprise payments is digital, and stablecoins are playing a pivotal role in making that future a reality today.

The breach reportedly exposed 16 billion usernames and passwords from platforms including Apple, Facebook, Google, and several government services. Ardoino shared the news via social media platform X, lambasting the security flaws of cloud-based storage. “The cloud has failed us. Again,” he wrote . “It’s time to ditch the cloud.” His statement was in direct response to the breach that experts have called a “blueprint for mass exploitation.” Tether CTO mulls new password manager Ardoino, whose company Tether issues the world’s most-used stablecoin, USDT, described PearPass as the solution to failures in cloud-based security systems. He reiterated that PearPass will be “fully local” and “open-source,” meaning users will store all their data, including passwords and encryption keys, directly on their devices rather than on remote servers. “ No cloud. No servers. No leaks. Ever ,” Ardoino remarked. Tether has not confirmed if PearPass will be integrated with any existing platforms. However, the company’s previous ventures provide some clues. The cloud has failed us. Again. 16 billion passwords just leaked. It’s time to ditch the cloud. That’s why we’ve been building PearPass — coming soon. A fully local, open-source password manager. No cloud. No servers. No leaks. Ever. Just you — and your keys, stored securely… https://t.co/FkL1wrdpCo pic.twitter.com/wynlieJ2E4 — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) June 19, 2025 In 2022, Tether partnered with Holepunch and Synonym to launch Pear Credit, a peer-to-peer financial system enabling decentralized lending. Largest credential leak exposes password hashes According to a report from Forbes , the private information dump involves login credentials harvested from several platforms and online services, the most known breach of its kind. Cybersecurity researchers have identified 30 distinct datasets linked to the breach, each containing an average of 3.5 billion records. The compromised data was supposedly stolen from social media platforms, VPN providers, developer portals, and both corporate and government accounts. Investigators noted that many of the stolen credentials appear to have been gathered as recently as early 2025 Another analysis of the dataset said it includes stolen data from infostealer malware, credential stuffing operations, and repackaged leaks from previous breaches. There is currently no reliable method to determine how many unique users have been affected due to overlapping records, but analysts confirmed that the data follows a pattern of URLs, followed by login details and a password hashes. This format is used by modern infostealers and involves malicious software that can extract sensitive data such as credentials, browser cookies, and tokens from infected devices. “ The inclusion of both old and recent infostealer logs, often with tokens, cookies, and metadata, makes this data particularly dangerous ,” researchers noted. Philosophy of security in technology The timing of PearPass’s announcement is against the backdrop of CEO Ardoino’s advocacy for technologies that function independently of centralized infrastructure. In a June 19 podcast talk with tech investor Anthony Pompliano, he explained his vision for “worst-case scenario” tools. “ If we are living in a disaster scenario, we need to be able to have technology that works locally first ,” Ardoino said. “ My mission is to prove that you can build great technology that is human-first. ” He mentioned the work of Tether’s encrypted P2P platform HolePunch, and a new artificial intelligence runtime, Tether AI, as examples of this philosophy. Tether AI is being designed as a device-agnostic, open-source AI framework that can run offline and integrate directly with crypto wallets through Tether’s wallet development kit (WDK). Outside of developing security solutions, the US Department of Justice credited the stablecoin issuer earlier this week for the seizure of roughly $225 million in USDT, linked to a global “pig butchering” scheme.

If you’ve been wishing for a fresh chance to catch the next meme‑coin rocket before liftoff, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) might just be the under‑the‑radar gem you’ve been waiting for. The meme token landscape: why timing matters Crypto history is littered with coins whose best days are behind them. Early Shiba holders reveled in 100,000x gains, but now, SHIB trades well above the dollar‑per‑token range retirees dream of. Dogecoin’s community remains passionate, yet its mainstream price reflects much of that optimism already baked in. Pepe Coin exploded once, but its parabolic climb came with brutal corrections. In a market where timing defines success, a lower entry point—coupled with fresh momentum—can tilt the scales in your favor. Enter Little Pepe: a Layer 2 chain built for memes Little Pepe isn’t another token slapped onto Ethereum or Solana. It’s the first blockchain designed exclusively for meme projects, running as a Layer 2 solution on Ethereum’s foundation. Little Pepe offers laughably low fees and rock‑solid security by handling transactions off the main chain. Think of it as giving every meme creator and hodler a private highway for sending frogs around the globe, without waiting in the tollbooth line or watching their ETH vanish in gas. Tokenomics that reward true believers It’s one thing to have a catchy name and bold promises. It’s another to back them with thoughtful token distribution. Little Pepe launched with a total supply of 100 billion LILPEPE tokens. Half of that came straight to presale participants, ensuring early believers share directly in any upside. Ten percent fuels liquidity pools, and another ten percent is locked for DEX listings, so when LILPEPE hits exchanges, the market won’t dry up. Marketing gets a ten‑percent slice, powering viral campaigns and influencer partnerships without draining community funds. Thirteen and a half percent goes to staking rewards, encouraging diamond‑handed loyalty. The remaining tokens bolster chain reserves, ready for smooth upgrades and ecosystem growth. Presale performance: proof in the pudding A true test for any token is how it performs before it even lists. Little Pepe’s presale wasn’t just a slow trickle—it was a tsunami. The first stage, priced at a mere $0.0011 per token, sold out in 72 hours. The second stage vanished even faster, putting over $1.18 million in the project’s coffers. Now, as the presale approaches its final chapter, latecomers can still stake a claim before LILPEPE rockets onto public exchanges. And if that weren’t enough, Little Pepe launched a $777,000 giveaway—10 lucky winners will each pocket $77,000 worth of tokens, further electrifying the community atmosphere. Roadmap to meme‑chain supremacy Little Pepe’s journey reads like an epic saga. It began in the cryptowomb, with Whales and Frog‑fans buzzing about for a presale launch. Next came the birth: listing on top decentralized and centralized exchanges, an aggressive marketing blitz, and a moon‑ready market cap target that has the community chanting “BRRRR.” As LILPEPE gains steam, the network will morph from novelty to necessity—hosting meme launchpads, onboarding developers eager to drip on its Layer 2 rails, and crowning Little Pepe as the undisputed king of meme chains. The 100x equation: cheap entry, massive potential At just $0.0011 in early presale, Little Pepe gives newcomers a chance at astronomical upside without emptying their wallets. To turn $100 into $10,000, you don’t need a top‑20 coin—what you need is a project with room to grow, a path to real usage, and a community that refuses to let the dream die. With its outstanding presale metrics, layered tokenomics, and singular focus on meme‑chain performance, LILPEPE ticks all the boxes for anyone hunting that next 100x return. Final thoughts: are you ready to hop on? Little Pepe offers a fresh narrative and a genuine technological edge in a market where everyone’s chasing last cycle’s heroes. It’s built by meme lovers, for meme lovers, combining zero taxes, lightning‑fast confirmations, and fair presale opportunities into one potent package. If you’ve ever watched the rocket launch post‑mortem and thought, “If only I’d known sooner,” this is your moment. The next golden meme age isn’t a distant prophecy—it’s unfolding right now. And Little Pepe is leading the charge. Miss this chance, and you may find yourself back on the sidelines when the froggy frenzy takes off. Buy cheap. Hold tight. Enjoy the ride.

Posting on X , CZ cautioned that even video call verifications may soon be unreliable. He urged the community to avoid installing any software from unofficial links, especially when prompted during suspicious interactions. Reason to panic? Here’s everything we know. Crypto Influencer Hacked After Deepfake Zoom Call CZ’s warning came after Japanese crypto influencer Mai Fujimoto revealed that her main X account was hacked. The breach happened after she joined a Zoom call, believing she was speaking with a trusted friend. What she didn’t know was that her contact’s Telegram account had already been compromised. During the call, a deepfaked version of the acquaintance told her to click a link to fix an audio issue. That’s when the attack happened. ‘She shared a link for audio settings adjustment, and that’s when the attack occurred,’ Fujimoto wrote. Soon after, her Telegram and Metamask accounts were also accessed, putting her crypto assets at risk. A Growing Trend of AI-Powered Scams Fujimoto’s trial is part of a disturbing pattern. On Thursday, reports surfaced of BlueNoroff , a North Korean-linked cybercrime group, targeting a cryptocurrency foundation employee with the same tactic. Over weeks of Zoom calls, the victim saw AI-generated deepfakes of company executives. A prompted download for a “microphone fix” installed a malicious extension, unleashing a keylogger, screen recorder, and crypto-stealing malware. These attacks show how AI can assist hackers in making scams, especially against crypto workers and remote employees. Zhao Urges the Community to Stay Alert CZ’s message is simple but serious: don’t trust software links from unofficial sources, and question the authenticity of video calls. As deepfake technology improves, online scams are becoming harder to detect. AI already used in new types deepfake hacking. Even a video call verification will soon be out of the window. Don't install software from a non-official link, especially NOT from your ""friends"" (they are most likely hacked). https://t.co/kfRSDPiJWb — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) June 20, 2025 For anyone in the crypto space, staying cautious is no longer optional.

Nonetheless, the token has still been a somewhat profitable investment for early adopters. Here’s how much you’d have if you’d had the foresight to invest $10,000 in SHIB back in June 2022. A $10,000 investment in SHIB in 2022 On June 20, 2022, Shiba Inu was trading at an opening price of $0.000008208, according to data from CoinMarketCap. In other words, a $10,000 investment back then would have translated to roughly 1,217,920,0002 SHIB tokens in your crypto wallet . The price at that point was the culmination of a gradual downtrend that started in October 2021. While the price had its short-term ups and downs in the following period, the token only managed to pick up some steam 20 months later, in February 2024. As a result, the price climbed to $0.00003504 on March 10, 2024. Afterwards, SHIB went on another decline. It briefly recovered in the final weeks of 2024, trading at $0.00003198 on December 8. But, as mentioned, the price started to drop continuously at the beginning of January 2025. How much SHIB would you have now? At the time of writing, June 20, 2025, SHIB price sits at $0.00001165, meaning it’s up 41.94% from its price exactly three years ago, on June 20, 2022. The 1,217,920,0002 SHIB you could’ve acquired for $10,000 three years ago would now be worth $14,189. In other words, you would’ve made $4,189, making a 41.89% return on your investment.

While that’s reassuring for long-term ETH holders, it pales in comparison to what’s unfolding around Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). With 150% potential locked into its launch structure and more than $5 million already raised, BTC-S isn’t a project investors are waiting to rise; it’s one they’re racing to join. For those who missed out on ETH early or sold BTC too soon, this might be the cleanest second chance crypto has offered in years. Ethereum Remains Solid, But Bitcoin Solaris Moves Faster Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency for a reason. It was the first to truly unlock decentralized smart contracts and continues to evolve with upgrades like staking and sharding. But even with all its influence, Ethereum still struggles with high gas fees, limited mobile accessibility, and occasional congestion. That’s where Bitcoin Solaris is gaining attention. It solves problems Ethereum still faces while building for the mobile-first world of 2025 and beyond. It’s not just Ethereum’s future rewritten. It’s a smarter, fairer, more inclusive ecosystem. Let’s compare the two: Feature Ethereum Bitcoin Solaris TPS ~15 (Layer 1) 10,000+ with 2-second finality Consensus Proof-of-Stake Hybrid Proof-of-Work + DPoS Energy Use Moderate Ultra-efficient hybrid model Smart Contract Language Solidity Rust Mining Not available Available via mobile + browser Launch Gains Organic growth Structured 150% presale ROI Validator Rotation Static 24-hour rotation for decentralization Core Highlights of Bitcoin Solaris What makes BTC-S a standout in the 2025 altcoin space isn’t just price projections; it’s the depth of the ecosystem. From high-speed architecture to real-world accessibility, here are the most exciting features: Dual-consensus model combining Bitcoin’s SHA-256 PoW with lightning-fast DPoS. Validator rotation every 24 hours to maintain decentralization and reduce collusion. Rust-based smart contracts, ideal for DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise-grade apps. Bridge infrastructure for seamless cross-chain asset transfers. Security features include zero-knowledge proof support, slashing for bad validators, and adaptive performance scoring for miners. This isn’t theory. These features are already functional or actively under development, making BTC-S one of the most advanced blockchain launches of the year. What Ethereum Promised, Bitcoin Solaris Is Actually Delivering Wealth Building Through the Solaris Nova App One of Bitcoin Solaris’s most powerful differentiators is its mining accessibility. Through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova app, users can mine BTC-S across smartphones, laptops, desktops, and even in-browser. Benefits of this model include: Real-time mining dashboards and adaptive energy-saving modes Competitive leaderboards and gamification elements for consistent engagement Smart contract-powered Mining Power Marketplace to buy or rent hash power Easy earning estimation via the BTC-S mining calculator The result is a mining system that isn’t exclusive to whales or tech experts; it’s for everyone. 150% Presale Potential And Time’s Running Out The BTC-S presale is currently in Phase 8, priced at $8. The next price jump to $9 is imminent, and the final launch price is locked at $20. That means: Over $5M raised so far 11,500+ unique users already in Only 6 weeks left until the July 31, 2025 launch What’s more, the presale is being called the shortest and most explosive in the space right now. It’s being featured across analyst channels like Crypto Show , where influencers are breaking down exactly why BTC-S has the mechanics to outperform.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin Solaris is offering a structured, verified path to 150% returns within weeks, not months. It has a clear roadmap, real-time development momentum, and a mobile-first model that invites anyone to participate. It’s not just the next big token. It’s a new way of building crypto wealth.

Back then, its community-driven fervor and low‐cost entry point made it the talk of every Twitter thread. Today, however, SHIB finds itself grappling with stiff resistance. Trading volumes have cooled from their peak, and even dedicated holders admit that sustaining those past parabolic moves will require fresh catalysts—a challenge in an increasingly crowded meme‐coin arena. The token’s supply remains vast, and without regular token burns or a surge of mainstream adoption, SHIB’s price action struggles to break through critical ceilings. Meanwhile, a new kid on the block is set to make crypto millionaires in the next bull run. The grand entry of Little Pepe Just when many assumed the meme‐coin party was slowing down, a fresh contender emerges from the swamp. Little Pepe—known by his token symbol LILPEPE —isn’t content to follow the playbook. Rather than chase social media hype alone, this baby frog is building its pond: a dedicated Layer‑2 blockchain designed specifically for memes. The goal is bold yet simple: combine ultra‑low fees with lightning‑fast transaction speeds, all wrapped in the irreverent spirit of meme culture. At its core, Little Pepe promises a platform where users can not only trade LILPEPE tokens without fearing exorbitant gas fees but also launch their meme projects using a built‑in meme launchpad. The architects behind the project—seasoned developers known for guiding previous top‐tier memes—aim to eliminate rug pulls and tax mechanics that so often sully the DeFi space. Instead, they’ve baked in zero‑tax trading and robust liquidity measures to ensure a safer, more transparent environment. A frenzied presale signals massive appetite Behind the playful branding lies a carefully engineered token structure. Half of the entire supply is set aside for presale participants—a clear nod to rewarding the believers who spotted Little Pepe before it became a household name. Little Pepe’s presale phases have showcased the community’s hunger for a truly decentralized meme coin. The initial stage sold out within seventy‑two hours, and the second phase closed even faster than anticipated. To date, the project has pulled in over $1.18 million—all before the official launch. That kind of traction speaks volumes: it’s not just hype, but tangible demand from investors eager to back a fresh narrative in the meme‐coin universe. LILPEPE currently trades at a modest $0.0011 during presale, but the real draw lies in its upside potential. With a total supply capped at 100 billion tokens, the groundwork is laid for meaningful scarcity once the token enters broader markets. Early backers are already daydreaming about the moment the presale wraps and LILPEPE appears on Uniswap and leading centralized exchanges. A roadmap written in meme magic Little Pepe’s journey is mapped out in three whimsical yet meaningful stages: Pregnancy, Birth, and Growth. During Pregnancy, the project was cooked in the “cryptowomb,” building community buzz and forging partnerships. Now, at Birth—marked by the presale’s blistering success—the baby frog is poised for liftoff, eyeing top‐tier listings and a monumental marketing blitz. Finally, Growth envisions the moment Little Pepe secures its place as a top‑100 market cap contender, cementing its Layer‑2 blockchain as the undisputed home for all things meme. This roadmap isn’t just a clever story; it’s a blueprint for execution. Each phase unlocks new utilities and network effects, transforming LILPEPE from a niche wonder to a mainstream contender. And unlike many vapor‑projects that fizzle before their first birthday, Little Pepe carries the backing of experienced developers and a clearly defined path forward. Why a 19044% surge isn’t out of the question In the crypto world, dramatic percentages tend to follow disruptive ideas. The combination of a meme‑fueled community, a dedicated Layer‑2 infrastructure, and tokenomics designed for growth gives Little Pepe the ingredients for an outsized rally. As transaction fees on Ethereum remain a barrier for many, a zero‑tax, gas‑friendly alternative crafted just for memes could redirect a flood of capital into LILPEPE. Moreover, the promise of sniper‑bot immunity—ensuring fair launches—and planned listings on major exchanges could amplify buying pressure at key moments. When nostalgia for meme culture meets the frictionless mechanics of modern DeFi, explosive moves become far more than wishful thinking. A new chapter in the meme‑coin saga Shiba Inu’s quiet stall has opened space for the next legend to rise. Little Pepe might just claim that mantle, uniting the irreverence of meme culture with genuine blockchain innovation. As 2025 unfolds, those willing to look beyond the familiar shiba silhouette might find themselves holding the very token that ushers in the Golden Meme Age—complete with blazing‑fast blocks, barely‑there fees, and the kind of breakout story that legends are made of.

This move by the top healthcare brand, which is tied directly to Donald Trump’s renewed policy focus on crypto, has triggered widespread crypto market interest. Now, analysts are taking notice of a lesser-known altcoin, FloppyPepe (FPPE) , which they believe could deliver major returns in the current market cycle. Top Healthcare Brand Backs Donald Trump-Led Strategy As Bitcoin (BTC) Nears Breakout The recent addition of Lopez, the Donald Trump insider to the top healthcare brand, Prenetics Global’s $20 million Bitcoin (BTC) strategy, underscores the company’s commitment to capitalizing on the digital asset space. The appointment of this former Donald Trump advisor coincides with a widely circulated chart comparing Bitcoin’s (BTC) price to the Global M2 Money Supply, suggesting a major breakout may be near. With M2 surging and Bitcoin (BTC) historically lagging such moves by around 100 days, analysts now forecast a potential rally to $150,000, a move this top healthcare brand appears to be strategically positioning for. Bitcoin’s (BTC) Move Sparks Altcoin Frenzy: FloppyPepe (FPPE) Emerges As Contender As Bitcoin (BTC) gains renewed legitimacy through Donald Trump’s endorsement and institutional moves like the top healthcare brand’s $20 million allocation, the spotlight is also shifting to assets with massive potential. One such crypto asset, FloppyPepe (FPPE), is quietly building the kind of real-world functionality that analysts say could trigger exponential growth. The altcoin project is deploying AI-powered platforms like FloppyX AI Agent and Meme-o-Matic that are already functional in beta , allowing users to create and monetize their content at scale. Key practical utilities already live or are in testing: AI Meme Contests that reward creators with token prizes Interactive storytelling with evolving AI personalities Automated video production tailored to current trends These tools don’t just entertain, they build economic value. By empowering users to produce, own, and trade viral content, the platform creates a functional, tokenized media ecosystem that analysts believe could deliver outsized returns. In combination with the altcoin’s low-cap valuation and a fast-growing community, FloppyPepe (FPPE) exhibits the capabilities of turning early utility into massive upside. 80% Bonus And Low Entry Backs FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Explosive Potential While top healthcare brands and other institutional buyers scoop up Bitcoin (BTC), FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) presale continues to gain momentum. Priced at just $0.00000035 , with an 80% token bonus activated using code FLOPPY80 , the project has already secured over $2,400,000 in liquidity within just a few months. Now, with the bonus still live, early participants have a rare opportunity to lock in massive token allocations at near-ground-floor prices — a setup analysts say could yield substantial returns in the coming weeks. This isn’t just hype; the altcoin’s floppynomics are specifically engineered for sustainable growth: Deflationary model with 1% annual token burn 1% redistribution to holders on every transaction 1% to charity, aligning purpose with profit Zero transaction tax for frictionless trading SolidProof-audited smart contract and locked liquidity Floppypepe (FPPE) is also preparing to roll out cross-chain bridges to Solana and Binance Smart Chain (BSC), dramatically increasing accessibility and liquidity across ecosystems. Coupled with global brand partnerships and the onboarding of top crypto influencers, this altcoin is building a scalable framework to support its meteoric rise. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Low Entry Presale Is Where Massive Upside Lives Bitcoin’s (BTC) value proposition as digital gold is solidifying, with figures like Donald Trump guiding its treasury role, as top healthcare brand Prenetics makes its latest move. However, despite Donald Trump’s backing and Bitcoin’s (BTC) increased institutional capital inflow, sharp analysts believe the altcoin space is where exponential upside lives and FloppyPepe (FPPE) is quickly becoming the standout candidate. The ongoing presale discount at $0.00000035 , bolstered by the 80% bonus code: FLOPPY80 , presents a rare early-stage opportunity to acquire tokens before Tier 1 exchange listings and major AI platform launches. As the presale window narrows, the risk isn’t just in waiting; it’s in missing the breakout moment of this altcoin. Projects with this level of early momentum, tech backing, and deflationary structure don’t stay under the radar for long, making their current phase one of the most lucrative early entries in this bull market.

For Bitcoin, the expiring options have a maximum pain price of $105,000 and a put-to-call ratio of 1.00. This ratio suggests a relatively even distribution between bearish (put options) and bullish (call options) positions among traders. However, an examination of call and put open interests indicates a slight prevalence of put options, which could suggest a mild bearish sentiment or hedging activity. Conversely, Ethereum’s expiring options show a lean towards bullish sentiment, with a put-to-call ratio of 0.69 and a maximum pain price of $2,600. The maximum pain point is a metric that indicates the price level at which the majority of options contracts would expire worthless, potentially resulting in the largest financial loss for traders. Ethereum is trading below its maximum pain level, which might align with the observed bullish outlook and a higher concentration of call options, indicating bets on price increases. Bitcoin is currently trading above its maximum pain level, showing increased buyer activity. Markets typically stabilise after options expirations as traders adjust to new price conditions. Given the high volume of today’s expiration, a similar outcome could occur, potentially influencing broader crypto market trends into the weekend. Bitcoin Pepe continues momentum Bitcoin Pepe is carving a unique niche in the crypto market by combining meme appeal with tangible real-world functionality. Unlike typical meme tokens that thrive solely on hype, Bitcoin Pepe distinguishes itself with a clear technical roadmap and a focus on infrastructure development. The investors are rewarding the token as the project has successfully raised more than $15 million through its ongoing presale. The team has announced that Bitcoin Pepe’s native token, BPEP, will soon be listed on MEXC and BitMart. These listings are anticipated to significantly boost the token’s visibility, liquidity, and credibility as it prepares for a wider launch. The team has also released images showing the work they are doing to ensure the project is up to high standards. The project team is set to make a listing announcement on June 30. The team is taking time to secure additional partnerships with centralised cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs), aiming for a more impactful launch for the BPEP token. In a move to reward early supporters, all existing investors who have already purchased BPEP tokens will also receive a 30% bonus on their holdings.

For institutions looking to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the opportunities within crypto, the landscape is becoming increasingly sophisticated. A major development is the launch of institutional restaking vaults by Renzo Protocol in partnership with Concrete finance, built on the innovative EigenLayer network. What are Renzo’s Institutional Restaking Vaults? Renzo Protocol, known for its liquid restaking solutions, has teamed up with Concrete finance, an infrastructure provider, to create a dedicated pathway for institutional participation on EigenLayer . These new Institutional Restaking Vaults are not just another crypto product; they are specifically tailored for major players in the financial world. Imagine a secure, customizable gateway designed for: Asset issuers Financial institutions Curators Networks These vaults offer a structured way for these entities to engage with liquid restaking opportunities available through EigenLayer, as initially reported by PR Newswire. It’s about providing a compliant and familiar framework for sophisticated investors to access the yield and security benefits offered by restaking. Why is Institutional Restaking a Game Changer? The introduction of specialized vaults for institutions marks a pivotal moment. Historically, DeFi participation for large financial entities has been challenging due to regulatory uncertainty, operational complexities, and the need for tailored solutions that meet their specific risk and compliance requirements. Institutional restaking addresses many of these hurdles. By providing a dedicated channel, Renzo and Concrete are essentially building a bridge. This bridge allows institutions to: Access novel yield-generating strategies on EigenLayer . Participate in securing various decentralized networks. Manage their exposure within a framework designed for their scale and needs. This move is expected to unlock significant capital and expertise from traditional finance, potentially accelerating the growth and maturity of the entire restaking ecosystem. Exploring the Benefits of These Vaults for Institutions What makes these vaults particularly attractive to institutional players? The benefits are numerous and directly address the pain points institutions face when entering DeFi: 1. Tailored Compliance and Structure: Unlike public DeFi protocols, these vaults can be customized to adhere to specific regulatory requirements and internal compliance frameworks that institutions must follow. Concrete finance’s infrastructure plays a key role here. 2. Enhanced Security Measures: Institutional capital requires the highest level of security. These vaults are built with additional layers of security protocols and operational safeguards designed to protect large asset bases. 3. Customizable Restaking Strategies: Institutions have diverse investment goals and risk appetites. The vaults allow for tailored strategies regarding which Actively Validated Services (AVSs) on EigenLayer they interact with, enabling them to optimize for specific yield or security profiles. 4. Operational Efficiency: Managing restaking across multiple protocols can be complex. These vaults streamline the process, providing a single point of access and management for institutional-scale liquid restaking . 5. Access to Unique Yield Opportunities: Restaking on EigenLayer offers yields derived from providing security and services to various decentralized protocols. These vaults provide institutions with structured access to these potentially attractive, uncorrelated yield sources. 6. Partnership with Established Players: Working with Renzo Protocol and Concrete finance offers institutions the confidence of engaging with known entities building on the robust EigenLayer framework. This structured approach is crucial for institutions accustomed to regulated and predictable financial environments. It lowers the barrier to entry while maintaining necessary standards. Are There Challenges or Considerations for Institutional Restaking? While the benefits are compelling, institutions considering institutional restaking should also be aware of potential challenges: Regulatory Evolution: The regulatory landscape for crypto and DeFi is still evolving globally. Institutions must navigate this uncertainty and ensure their participation remains compliant with current and future regulations. Smart Contract Risk: Like all DeFi protocols, restaking involves smart contract risk. While audits and security measures are in place, the possibility of bugs or exploits cannot be entirely eliminated. Market Volatility: The underlying assets and yields in DeFi can be highly volatile. Institutions need robust risk management frameworks to handle potential fluctuations. Operational Complexity: Although the vaults aim to simplify things, integrating DeFi operations with existing institutional systems can still present technical and operational challenges. Understanding and mitigating these risks is paramount for successful institutional restaking participation. Examples and Use Cases for Institutional Restaking Vaults How might institutions actually use these vaults? The possibilities are diverse: Asset Managers: Could use vaults to allocate a portion of their portfolio to gain exposure to DeFi yields generated through liquid restaking on EigenLayer , potentially enhancing overall fund performance. Treasury Management: Corporations holding significant crypto assets could utilize vaults for treasury management, generating yield on otherwise idle assets. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): Large DAOs with substantial treasuries might use these vaults for diversified yield generation or to support specific protocols building on EigenLayer. Custodians: Could integrate vault access into their services, allowing their institutional clients to participate in restaking through a trusted provider. These examples highlight how institutional restaking can be integrated into various financial strategies, offering new avenues for growth and participation in the decentralized economy. Actionable Insights for Institutions and Protocols For institutions watching this space, the launch of these vaults by Renzo Protocol and Concrete finance is a signal that the infrastructure for serious participation is maturing. It’s time to move beyond just observing and begin exploring: Evaluate your internal readiness for engaging with DeFi technologies. Assess the potential benefits of liquid restaking yields within your existing investment strategies. Engage with providers like Renzo and Concrete to understand the specific features and compliance frameworks of their institutional restaking solutions. For protocols and AVSs building on EigenLayer , the increased institutional access means a potential influx of significant capital and a greater need for robust, well-documented, and secure services that meet institutional standards. Conclusion: A New Era for Institutional DeFi on EigenLayer The collaboration between Renzo Protocol and Concrete finance to launch institutional restaking vaults on EigenLayer represents a significant step forward in bringing traditional finance and DeFi closer together. By offering tailored, compliant, and secure solutions, they are lowering the barriers for asset issuers, institutions, curators, and networks to participate in the innovative world of liquid restaking . While challenges remain, the benefits in terms of accessing unique yields and contributing to decentralized network security are clear. This development is poised to drive further institutional adoption, bringing more liquidity, stability, and legitimacy to the restaking ecosystem and the broader DeFi landscape.

The California-based company first entered the Bitcoin market in May 2024 and has since significantly ramped up its treasury strategy. With its current holdings already among the highest in the corporate world, Semler is now positioning itself to become one of the most aggressive institutional Bitcoin accumulators globally. Semler Scientific’s bold treasury transformation Semler Scientific’s Bitcoin strategy marks a significant shift from its traditional focus on healthcare technology. In a press release on June 19, the company confirmed its three-year roadmap to accumulate over 100,000 BTC through a combination of equity financing, debt instruments, and cash flow from operations. The firm’s updated plan aims to hold 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, scale up to 42,000 BTC by the end of 2026, and ultimately reach 105,000 BTC before the close of 2027. According to its latest disclosures, Semler currently holds 4,449 BTC, valued at approximately $464 million at prevailing market prices. This recent figure reflects the company’s continued commitment to growing its Bitcoin reserves, having started its accumulation journey just over a year ago. Joe Burnett appointed to head the Bitcoin Strategy To guide this bold transformation, Semler Scientific appointed Joe Burnett as its Director of Bitcoin Strategy. Burnett, a well-known figure in the Bitcoin ecosystem, previously worked at Unchained as Director of Market Research and held earlier roles at Blockware Solutions and EY. Under his leadership, Semler’s treasury strategy will be anchored in a deep conviction that Bitcoin is the “ultimate long-duration asset.” Burnett has emphasised that this strategy is not a short-term bet but rather a long-term position designed to deliver lasting shareholder value. He also pointed to a broader shift in corporate finance, where an increasing number of firms are adopting Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. Semler has registered notable gains from its BTC investment Semler Scientific has already reported impressive results from its Bitcoin investments. As of June 3, the company recorded a 287% Bitcoin yield, with an unrealised gain of $177 million on its BTC holdings. Despite ongoing losses in its core healthcare operations, the company’s Bitcoin strategy has driven overall portfolio gains and market attention. According to BitcoinTreasuries.net , Semler has one of the highest Bitcoin-per-share ratios among public companies, currently standing at 0.00034 BTC per share. This ratio highlights the exposure each investor receives through equity ownership, a metric that is growing in importance among Bitcoin-focused stock traders. The price of Semler Scientific shares jumped upon the announcement Following the June 19 announcement, shares of Semler Scientific surged by more than 11% to close at $28.53 and were up +2.26 (7.08%) to $34.20 in the pre-market today at press time, signalling strong investor interest in the firm’s bold pivot. Semler Scientific stock price |Source: Google Finance However, the plan has not been without criticism or concern from market analysts and institutional players. Matthew Sigel, a crypto analyst at VanEck, warned that firms relying heavily on at-the-market equity programs to finance Bitcoin purchases may face share dilution risks. He noted that if stock prices fall too close to net asset value, companies like Semler may struggle to justify continued equity issuance. Despite these warnings, Semler remains firm in its commitment to Bitcoin, framing its strategy as a calculated and accretive move for long-term holders. The growing trend among public firms Semler’s aggressive expansion mirrors a rising trend among public companies choosing to allocate treasury reserves to Bitcoin. Japan’s Metaplanet has also announced plans to hold 210,000 BTC by 2027, equivalent to roughly 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Semler, on its part, is aiming for 0.5% of the total Bitcoin supply, underscoring the magnitude of its goal. With market conditions favourable and institutional appetite rising, Semler Scientific’s vision to become a major Bitcoin (BTC) treasury player is rapidly taking shape.

RXS Set to Soar After Listing on MEXC, BitMart & LBank appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Rexas Finance (RXS) is firing on all cylinders as it launches on three big-name crypto exchanges, including MEXC, BitMart, and LBank. Some investors now believe that a 20x rally may be in the cards, given that the launch of the token is occurring at just $0.25 following a hugely successful presale. Exchange Listings to Boost Liquidity and Exposure According to the announcement, RXS is launched on June 19, 2025, and listed on top exchanges, including BitMart, MEXC and LBank. These exchanges rank among the largest centralized crypto exchanges in daily trading volume. The platforms are highly liquid and have millions of users. It is anticipated that such exposure will cause high demand in RXS by both retail and institutional traders. Greater access by these exchanges also yields a good foundation of price discovery. There is a tight supply, as 499 million RXS tokens out of the 500 million presale allocation have already been sold, raising over $55.9 million. This represents a 99.9% completion rate for the presale. The launch price of $0.25 offers early buyers a built-in 25% gain before RXS even hits the open market. From $0.03 to $0.25—A 600% Presale Growth RXS started at just $0.03 in its first presale stage and has grown to $0.20 in its final phase that marking a 600% increase. This steady increase has been driven by good fundamentals, investor demand and a vision to see real world assets such as real estate, gold and art tokenized. As opposed to meme coins and hype-driven tokens, RXS has real use cases. The token can enable a fractional ownership of assets and makes accessing of traditional markets by investors easy using blockchain technology. Further, the launch of RXS staking provides a fresh utility layer for token holders ahead of the exchange debut. Will RXS Deliver a 20x Return? A 20x increase in the RXS presale price would leave RXS at $5. Although it may seem like a lofty goal, it is not unrealistic considering the structure of tokens, favorable presale returns, and future exchange listings. According to analysts, the expanding interest in asset-backed crypto products and institutional interest in tokenizing real-world assets (RWA) are factors that will likely drive the price of the coin in the future. An audit by CertiK is driving its positive reputation and community support. In addition, it’s simple to use token creation tools and one million token giveaways are creating the buzz. Conclusion As RXS becomes available on MEXC, BitMart, and LBank on June 19, a significant price pump may happen in a few days. Based on the scarcity of tokens, established utility, and increased exposure, Rexas Finance is one of the strongest candidates to gain 20x during the current bullish cycle.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized non-custodial lending protocol, is offering more than just price speculation—it’s offering a full financial ecosystem where users can earn passive income and unlock new utility with every deposit. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already making waves in its presale, having raised over $10.8 million in Phase 5 with more than 12,200 holders onboard. And while DOGE holders wait for the next hype cycle, early adopters of MUTM are positioning themselves for a more sustained and scalable opportunity. With the current price set at just $0.03, an investment of $1,000 now would turn into $15,000 if the token rises 15x to $0.45—a figure that doesn’t sound far-fetched considering the extensive roadmap, smart tokenomics, and innovative features being implemented. Smart Lending and mtTokens Power Passive Income At the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lies a robust P2C (peer-to-contract) lending model. This system allows anyone to become a lender by depositing assets like ETH, DAI, or AVAX into liquidity pools and earning interest that adjusts based on market demand. When borrowing demand is high, utilization increases, causing interest rates to spike and drawing in more lenders. This self-balancing mechanism incentivizes participation on both sides, creating dynamic earning opportunities without centralized control. Depositors don’t just sit idle either—they receive mtTokens, such as mtDAI or mtETH, representing their stake in the pool along with accrued interest. These mtTokens can be traded, held, or even staked within Mutuum’s safety module to earn additional MUTM tokens. Unlike DOGE, which relies primarily on community sentiment and social media triggers, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) allows users to actively generate returns through smart contract interactions. The platform will also introduce a passive dividend system, distributing a portion of protocol revenue to users who stake their mtTokens. These distributions are fueled by buybacks of MUTM on the open market, creating consistent upward pressure on price while directly rewarding long-term supporters. Over time, this cycle of buyback and reward will help deepen protocol liquidity and establish stronger price floors. Scalable Design, Strong Tokenomics, and CertiK Security Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just a high-yield opportunity—it’s also a deeply considered technical solution to some of DeFi’s biggest pain points. The protocol is being built with Layer-2 integration, ensuring faster, lower-cost transactions and higher scalability. For the average user, this means fewer fees and better usability—a welcome shift from the congestion issues seen on traditional Ethereum-based dApps. A decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin is also in the works. Unlike USDT or USDC, which rely on centralized fiat reserves, Mutuum’s stablecoin will be backed by assets held directly in its protocol. This system will allow minting based on on-chain collateral, enhancing transparency and reducing third-party risk. Additionally, interest from borrowing this stablecoin will funnel back into the protocol’s treasury, supporting sustainability while giving MUTM holders more utility and yield-generating options. From a security perspective, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already undergone a CertiK audit—the gold standard in DeFi smart contract review. With a Token Scan Score of 80.00, and methods including both manual review and static analysis, the audit reinforces confidence in the protocol’s design and execution. This commitment to security is essential, especially for a protocol aiming to handle significant volumes of user deposits and lending activity. Beta Launch, $100K Giveaway, and a Path Toward 15x Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not operating on promises—it’s delivering on its roadmap. The team plans to launch a beta version of the platform by the time the token goes live, giving early users access to core features such as lending, borrowing, staking mtToken for testing. This rollout will help create early liquidity, user feedback, and a functioning use case for MUTM from day one. Alongside development, the project is running a $100,000 giveaway campaign to expand its reach and reward the growing community. These strategic incentives are aimed at both increasing visibility and building a loyal user base ready to interact with the protocol upon launch. With a total supply of 4 billion MUTM and a listing price of $0.06 on the horizon, the upside for early investors is highly attractive. Based on the ongoing momentum and depth of utility, a 15x increase to $0.45 is within reach. A $2,000 investment at $0.03 would then be worth $30,000—demonstrating why smart investors are looking past DOGE and toward real DeFi builders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is setting a new standard for what a DeFi protocol can be. With smart yield mechanics, passive income options, scalable infrastructure, and a roadmap aligned with delivery, it offers a compelling opportunity for anyone seeking returns beyond the next meme-driven pump. In an industry flooded with noise, Mutuum is delivering signal—and the time to listen is now.

Understanding the broader landscape of geopolitical risk is crucial for any investor, and recent intelligence warnings regarding the Iran nuclear program highlight just how quickly stability can be threatened. Understanding the Latest Intelligence on the Iran Nuclear Program According to recent reports citing senior U.S. intelligence officials via the New York Times, a significant shift in Iran’s nuclear posture could be triggered by specific, critical events. The assessment suggests that Iran might move towards pursuing a nuclear weapon Iran has long claimed it doesn’t seek, under two potential scenarios: An attack by the United States on its uranium enrichment facility at Fordo. The killing of its supreme leader by Israel. This isn’t just a hypothetical exercise; it’s a high-stakes evaluation of red lines that, if crossed, could fundamentally alter the security landscape in the Middle East and beyond. For those monitoring global stability, which is intrinsically linked to market sentiment and thus, indirectly, to assets like cryptocurrencies, this intelligence is a somber reminder of underlying vulnerabilities. Why is the Fordo Facility So Critical? The Fordo facility is not just any nuclear site in Iran. Its location and design make it particularly significant and controversial: Location: It is built deep inside a mountain near the city of Qom, making it heavily fortified and difficult to attack with conventional weapons. This inherent protection has long been a point of international concern. Purpose: Fordo is primarily used for enriching uranium. While Iran states this is for civilian purposes, the level of enrichment achieved here (previously up to 20%, and more recently even higher under specific circumstances) is a key step towards weapons-grade material. Symbolism: For Iran, Fordo represents a point of national pride and a symbol of its nuclear capabilities. For the international community, particularly the U.S. and Israel, it represents a potential breakout site for rapid enrichment towards a weapon. An attack on such a deeply buried and symbolically important site would likely be seen by Tehran as a direct assault on its core national security interests and its sovereign right to pursue nuclear technology, regardless of international agreements or inspections. This is why U.S. officials believe it could be a trigger for Iran to abandon any remaining pretense and actively pursue a nuclear weapon Iran has previously stated is against its religious principles. The Weight of Leadership: The Supreme Leader Scenario The second trigger identified by U.S. intelligence is the killing of Iran’s supreme leader by Israel. This scenario highlights the deeply personal and ideological dimensions of the conflict between Iran and Israel. The supreme leader holds ultimate authority in Iran’s political and religious system. His death, particularly at the hands of a perceived enemy like Israel, would be viewed as an existential attack on the regime itself. Such an act would likely provoke an extreme response, potentially including the most drastic step available: seeking a nuclear deterrent. This scenario underscores that the potential for a nuclear weapon Iran possesses is not solely tied to technical capabilities or facility security, but also to the highest levels of political and religious leadership and the intense regional rivalries at play. The Long Shadow of Iran US Tensions These specific triggers exist within a broader, long-standing context of Iran US tensions . Relations between the two countries have been fraught for decades, marked by: The 1979 Islamic Revolution and the hostage crisis. Decades of mutual suspicion and proxy conflicts in the Middle East. The controversy surrounding Iran’s nuclear activities and international sanctions. The U.S. withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the 2015 nuclear deal. Increased military posturing and incidents in the Persian Gulf. The U.S. intelligence assessment about Fordo and the supreme leader is a direct reflection of the high level of distrust and potential for miscalculation that defines Iran US tensions . Both sides operate with a deep awareness of the other’s capabilities and potential actions, constantly evaluating red lines and potential responses. This dynamic creates a persistent state of geopolitical risk that global markets must contend with. Geopolitical Risk: How Global Tensions Impact Markets (Including Crypto) While this news might seem distant from your crypto portfolio, it’s essential to recognize the interconnectedness of global events. Significant escalations in geopolitical risk can have profound effects: Market Uncertainty: Increased tensions create fear and uncertainty, often leading investors to move away from riskier assets. Oil Prices: The Middle East is critical to global energy supply. Conflict or instability can send oil prices soaring, impacting inflation and economic stability worldwide. Sanctions and Economic Fallout: Further escalation could lead to new or stricter sanctions, disrupting global trade and financial systems. Safe Haven Flows: In times of crisis, traditional safe havens like gold or certain fiat currencies (e.g., USD) often see inflows. This can draw liquidity away from other markets, including crypto. Supply Chain Disruptions: Major conflicts can disrupt shipping lanes and supply chains, impacting businesses globally. For the crypto market, which is still relatively young and sensitive to macroeconomic shifts and global sentiment, a significant increase in geopolitical risk stemming from the Iran nuclear program or Iran US tensions could lead to increased volatility and potential price corrections. While Bitcoin is sometimes touted as a digital safe haven, its performance during geopolitical crises has been mixed, demonstrating that it is not immune to global shocks. Challenges and Potential Consequences The intelligence warning highlights several significant challenges and potential consequences: Escalation Risk: Any attack on Fordo or targeting of the leader carries an immense risk of rapid and unpredictable escalation. Proliferation Threat: If Iran decides to pursue a nuclear weapon Iran has the technical knowledge to build, it would fundamentally alter the regional power balance and could trigger a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Diplomatic Deadlock: This intelligence complicates already difficult diplomatic efforts to revive the nuclear deal or find a de-escalatory path. Regional Instability: Increased tensions between Iran, the U.S., and Israel fuel proxy conflicts and instability across the region. Navigating this complex landscape requires careful statecraft and a clear understanding of the potential triggers and red lines identified by intelligence assessments like this one. Actionable Insights for the Aware Investor While you can’t directly influence geopolitical events, being aware of intelligence like this can inform your approach to markets: Stay Informed: Monitor global news, not just crypto-specific headlines. Understand the major sources of geopolitical risk . Assess Risk Tolerance: Understand how potential global shocks align with your personal risk tolerance and investment strategy. Diversification: Consider the benefits of a diversified portfolio that isn’t solely concentrated in one asset class, acknowledging that even crypto is subject to macro factors. Long-Term Perspective: Geopolitical events can cause short-term volatility. A long-term perspective can help weather temporary storms. The potential for the Iran nuclear program to escalate is a stark reminder that global stability is fragile and influences all markets. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture The U.S. intelligence assessment regarding Iran’s potential pursuit of a nuclear weapon Iran has long disavowed, contingent on attacks on the Fordo facility or the killing of its leader, represents a critical warning. It underscores the severe consequences of crossing certain red lines in the ongoing Iran US tensions and the broader regional conflict. This news is a powerful illustration of significant geopolitical risk that has the potential to impact global security, economic stability, and financial markets, including the world of cryptocurrencies. Staying informed about such developments is not just about understanding international relations; it’s about recognizing the forces that shape the environment in which all assets, digital or otherwise, operate.

Here’s What History Says,https://timestabloid.com/can-solana-beat-ethereum-this-cycle-heres-what-history-says/,"Remittix (RTX) has emerged as a strong contender in the crypto space, drawing comparisons with legacy networks like Ethereum and Solana. Built for fast and affordable cross-border payments, Remittix has already raised over $15.8 million at $0.0781 per token. As new blockchains battle for dominance, RTX is carving out its own niche in the payment sector with real-world adoption. Solana’s Speed Advantage Is Real Solana is making headlines for its unmatched speed and affordability. With a 400ms block time and fees under $0.01, it’s a clear leader in performance over Ethereum, which averages 12 seconds per block and charges over $1 in gas fees. Data from CoinTrust shows that Solana’s monthly new address growth (100M+) now dwarfs Ethereum’s. Its DEX volume has also hit $90B in 30 days, outpacing Ethereum’s $66B. However, the latter still leads in total value locked and ecosystem maturity. Ethereum Holds Its Institutional Crown Despite Solana’s user metrics, Ethereum remains the heavyweight when it comes to institutional trust. It dominates with over 54% of all TVL and has solidified its role as the home for DeFi and NFTs, according to OKX . Source: TradingView Backed by ETF listings and tokenized financial instruments, Ethereum enjoys the confidence of major financial institutions. As noted in ICOHolders , Ethereum may not grow the fastest, but its foundation is the deepest. Remittix Disrupts The Payment Layer While Solana and Ethereum fight for the smart contract crown, Remittix is winning quietly in real-world use cases. Freelancers in Asia and Africa are already using RTX to receive international payments without delays or excessive fees. With a planned wallet launch in Q3 and fast-growing community support, RTX is being tipped by some analysts as the next breakout project in crypto payments. CryptoNews expects RTX to become a preferred asset for global remittances due to its low cost and fast transactions. Conclusion: Is Flippening Coming? Solana might win this cycle in terms of price appreciation and retail traction. But Ethereum’s grip on institutions and DeFi remains solid, as reinforced in Standard Chartered’s outlook . The flippening is not off the table, but it’s far from guaranteed. While Solana and Ethereum race for the crown, Remittix is quietly becoming the go-to crypto for real-world payments. If you’re looking beyond speculation and into adoption, RTX might be your smartest move this cycle.

DOGE’s price has consolidated at around $0.16-$0.18, but a major price swing could be incoming. Ripple’s XRP is also showing signs of approaching volatility, as the Bollinger Bands have recently squeezed. What’s New Around Pi Network? The controversial crypto project, which introduced its Open Network in February, recently celebrated its first 100 days since its launch. The team outlined some important developments that happened within that timeframe, such as the launch of Pi Network Ventures – a $100 million investment program designed to support startups and companies focused on expanding PI’s real-world use and accelerating its adoption. They also noted the introduction of new games to users, which are “at the intersection of several key strengths – social interactions, the attention economy, and virtual goods.” Recall that less than a month ago, Pi Network launched FruityPi – a game application integrated with multiple products within the ecosystem, including the native cryptocurrency, Pi Wallet, and Pi Ad Network. Additionally, the team mentioned the Pi Day 2025 event, which took place from March 14 to March 21 and was the first PiFest after the Open Network saw the light of day . The event garnered serious engagement from the community, with more than 125,000 registered sellers and over 1.8 million Pioneers taking part. Meanwhile, the price of PI remains in deep red territory on a monthly scale, and its future dynamics heavily depend on several vital factors. Those curious to explore that matter in detail can check our dedicated article here . How’s DOGE Doing? The largest meme coin in terms of market capitalization has been trading within a tight range of $0.16-$0.18 over the past week. However, the renowned analyst on X, Ali Martinez, envisioned a major 60% price swing if this consolidation ends. He argued that the direction of the move is yet to be determined: a breakout beyond $0.22 would benefit the bulls, while a plunge below $0.16 would mean good news for the bears. Other industry participants who have recently shared their thoughts on the matter include Crypto ELITES and Kamran Asghar. The former set a price target of $5, while the latter thinks DOGE “is going straight to the moon” due to the potential approaching of a golden cross. XRP Volatility Incoming? Ripple’s cross-border token has also registered slight price fluctuations over the past few days, currently trading at around $2.17. The squeezing Bollinger Bands on its chart, however, indicate that a significant move could be incoming, as X user xoom recently warned. This metric is used to spot overbought or oversold conditions, potentially signaling a shift in trend. When the bands narrow, it reflects low market volatility, often hinting that a significant pump or drop could be on the horizon. The indicator has been a precursor of a major bull run on a couple of occasions in the past. The bands squeezed in December 2024 when XRP was worth around $2.10, whereas a few weeks later, the valuation almost matched its all-time high of $3.40. Meanwhile, Glassnode recently estimated that a rising number of XRP investors have started offloading their holdings since the beginning of June, with an average realized profit of almost $70 million per day. This heightened selling pressure could reinforce the case for a short-term bearish scenario.

John Deaton Predicts Huge Buyout, Names 11 Crypto and TradFi Giants appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Could one of XRP’s biggest backers be getting scooped up? A bold tweet from pro-Ripple lawyer John Deaton is stirring speculation that crypto exchange Uphold could be acquired – and if that happens, it might be one of the most strategic deals in the XRP ecosystem yet. In a recent tweet, Deaton suggested that Uphold could be bought by a major player. His list? It’s the who’s who of crypto and traditional finance powerhouses. “I put on Uphold being acquired by a major player,” Deaton tweeted . He tagged names like Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, Robinhood, Binance, Ripple , and TradFi giants JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Fidelity, Citi, and PayPal . So what makes Uphold such a hot target? XRP Is the Backbone of Uphold Uphold isn’t just another crypto platform listing XRP, but is built around it. According to the latest transparency report, XRP makes up nearly 70% of Uphold’s total reserves, holding $4.54 billion out of $6.61 billion. The numbers get even more interesting: Uphold has processed over 26 million XRP transactions, and just this week, it launched USDC support on the XRP Ledger, showing its deep commitment to the XRP ecosystem. Add to that a fully-backed model with 100.6% reserves, and it’s clear that this is a platform built with XRP utility in mind. Strategic Shake-Up Already in Motion Is this just Deaton shooting arrows in the dark? Well, no. Uphold’s own CEO, Simon McLoughlin, recently confirmed the exchange is exploring an IPO or a potential sale. The company brought on FT Partners to weigh its options. While no valuation has been officially disclosed, a source close to the matter says the target could go north of $1.5 billion. That’s not hard to imagine – Uphold’s revenue is expected to hit over $300 million in 2025, up from just $80 million in 2022, thanks to partnerships with firms like IG Group and a German bank. One Big Variable: The CEO’s XRP Belief There’s one twist that could complicate a buyout. McLoughlin is a massive XRP fan and a true believer in the XRPFi vision. That personal conviction could mean he’s unlikely to sell unless the buyer shares his vision or is willing to pay a steep premium. Still, the interest is real and the timing couldn’t be more aligned. XRP is gaining momentum, institutions are circling, and Uphold sits at the center of that growing demand. Whether it goes public or gets picked up, Uphold isn’t staying quiet for long. And if Deaton’s instincts are right, this could be a defining move in the next phase of XRP’s rise.

Launched on May 19, 2025, at block height 6,624,500, this upgrade marks the Odyssey phase, a pivotal moment of technical breakthroughs and community-driven growth. With a robust suite of technical advancements, generous Airdrop rewards, enhanced ME Pass 3.0 features, and a lineup of high-profile 2025 events, Meta Earth is inviting users worldwide to join its transformative journey. Here’s why ME Network 2.0 marks a pivotal shift—and what it means for those looking to participate. ME Network 2.0: A Technical Powerhouse ME Network 2.0 introduces a modular architecture that decouples the execution layer (RollApp), settlement layer (ME-Hub), and data availability layer (ME-DA), delivering unmatched scalability, security, and ecosystem compatibility. This three-layer design enables sovereign Rollup chains to process transactions in parallel with customizable virtual machines (EVM/WASM), slashing storage costs by 98% through data availability sampling (DAS) and 2D erasure coding. The result is skyrocketing throughput, optimized costs, and rapid iteration for decentralized applications (DApps). The network’s economic model is equally revolutionary. MEC, the native token, unifies all layers, with cross-chain mappings (MEC-CI for RollApp gas fees and governance, MEC-DA for the data layer) replacing native tokens to create a closed value loop. Users pay only local RollApp gas fees, while Sequencers handle cross-layer costs, streamlining transactions. The decentralized Sequencer network, powered by CometBFT consensus, enhances security with slashing mechanisms for malicious nodes, fraud proofs, and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) compression via the Groth16 algorithm, cutting gas costs by 90%. A Watch Relayer monitors anomalies in real time, ensuring robust protection. Cross-chain communication is another standout feature. The Multi-Blockchain Communication (MBC) protocol addresses Optimistic Rollup pain points, enabling instant withdrawals through market maker prepayments and incentivizing fraud detection. EVM compatibility, via Ethermint integration, supports Solidity 0.6.0–0.8.17 and tools like MetaMask, while dual EVM/WASM virtual machines bridge Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. A DID-based identity system stores only certificate hashes on-chain, encrypting private data off-chain for privacy and enabling cross-chain verification. Additional improvements include dynamic gas pricing to counter Sybil attacks, optimized relayers for trustless communication, and enhanced security requiring two-thirds honest nodes. The ME-DA layer’s initial validator nodes, staked with 552,900 MEC from regional treasuries (India, China, ME_EARTH, USA), underscore community-driven governance, with future allocations guided by transparent DAO proposals. These advancements position ME Network 2.0 as a scalable, secure foundation for the next generation of Web3 applications.

Launched on May 19, 2025, at block height 6,624,500, this upgrade marks the Odyssey phase, a pivotal moment of technical breakthroughs and community-driven growth. With a robust suite of technical advancements, generous Airdrop rewards, enhanced ME Pass 3.0 features, and a lineup of high-profile 2025 events, Meta Earth is inviting users worldwide to join its transformative journey. Here’s why ME Network 2.0 marks a pivotal shift—and what it means for those looking to participate. ME Network 2.0: A Technical Powerhouse ME Network 2.0 introduces a modular architecture that decouples the execution layer (RollApp), settlement layer (ME-Hub), and data availability layer (ME-DA), delivering unmatched scalability, security, and ecosystem compatibility. This three-layer design enables sovereign Rollup chains to process transactions in parallel with customizable virtual machines (EVM/WASM), slashing storage costs by 98% through data availability sampling (DAS) and 2D erasure coding. The result is skyrocketing throughput, optimized costs, and rapid iteration for decentralized applications (DApps). The network’s economic model is equally revolutionary. MEC, the native token, unifies all layers, with cross-chain mappings (MEC-CI for RollApp gas fees and governance, MEC-DA for the data layer) replacing native tokens to create a closed value loop. Users pay only local RollApp gas fees, while Sequencers handle cross-layer costs, streamlining transactions. The decentralized Sequencer network, powered by CometBFT consensus, enhances security with slashing mechanisms for malicious nodes, fraud proofs, and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) compression via the Groth16 algorithm, cutting gas costs by 90%. A Watch Relayer monitors anomalies in real time, ensuring robust protection. Cross-chain communication is another standout feature. The Multi-Blockchain Communication (MBC) protocol addresses Optimistic Rollup pain points, enabling instant withdrawals through market maker prepayments and incentivizing fraud detection. EVM compatibility, via Ethermint integration, supports Solidity 0.6.0–0.8.17 and tools like MetaMask, while dual EVM/WASM virtual machines bridge Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. A DID-based identity system stores only certificate hashes on-chain, encrypting private data off-chain for privacy and enabling cross-chain verification. Additional improvements include dynamic gas pricing to counter Sybil attacks, optimized relayers for trustless communication, and enhanced security requiring two-thirds honest nodes. The ME-DA layer’s initial validator nodes, staked with 552,900 MEC from regional treasuries (India, China, ME_EARTH, USA), underscore community-driven governance, with future allocations guided by transparent DAO proposals. These advancements position ME Network 2.0 as a scalable, secure foundation for the next generation of Web3 applications.

With Ethereum priced at $2,498.97 and Dogecoin at $0.1690, large holders are catching their breath. Meanwhile, smaller altcoins like Aura and Pi Network are absorbing fresh capital and so is one fast-rising project called Remittix. Investors Shift Focus from Ethereum to New Utility-Based Projects The keyword this week is rotation. In spite of Ethereum having a market capitalization of $301.6 billion, its volume is lower by 28.73% in trading. Dogecoin’s volume also fell 34.06% , although the price moved a little higher. Institutional wallets seem to be searching for the next breakout plays and they’re discovering them in smaller, real-world-utility tokens. Projects like Aura, Pi Network and Remittix (RTX) are accumulating more hype due to their real-world impact and faster market momentum. Remittix Emerges as the Leading Crypto This Week Among these altcoins, Remittix is quickly standing out from the crowd. Designed to facilitate cross-border payments, it allows users to transfer cryptocurrency like BTC, ETH and XRP directly to bank accounts in real-time. Priced at $0.0781 per token, with over 545 million+ tokens sold and $15.8 million+ in funds raised, Remittix is seeing explosive traction. The project is still available with a 50% token bonus, with the goal of reaching its $18M softcap and interest is growing by the day. Investors are especially optimistic about the Q3 release of the Remittix wallet, which will offer faster, easier crypto-to-fiat transactions in a number of territories. Why Remittix Might Fuel the Next Rotation Wave Unlike meme coins or DeFi tokens that are speculative in nature, Remittix solves a legitimate real-world problem: simpler and faster worldwide money transfers. That places it squarely in the middle of a $190 trillion payments market. Analysts have already started calling Remittix a stellar project, comparing it to early Ripple and Stellar with more near-term utility. The platform simplifies complexity, introduces speed and bridges traditional finance and the blockchain something Ethereum and Dogecoin aren’t actively solving. With Ethereum whales heading to the sidelines, smart money appears to be searching for the next high-utility play. And to many, that play is Remittix. While the Giants Sleep, New Contenders Take the Stage Ethereum and Dogecoin may still capture headlines, but investor funds are moving elsewhere. New players like Pi Network, Aura and Remittix are quickly stealing the show. With growing momentum, a Q3 wallet release imminent and a growing investor base, Remittix (RTX) is beginning to look like one of the more intriguing altcoins of 2025. As savvy investors rotate into assets with utility, Remittix continues to be front and center and for good reason.

This calm has confused the traders, suggesting either an underlying strength or a position on a fault line. Bitcoin has printed green on the 7-day time frame despite being down by just 0.23% over the last 30 days. Analyst suggests that low volatility, tight price action, and fading retail interest might mean that whales are now settling down the tone. Retail out, whales in According to Santiment data, Bitcoin’s elite and mortal wallets are moving in two different directions as the biggest crypto hovered around the $104k-$105 zone. It highlighted that the market added 231 wallets holding more than 10 BTC in the last days (approx. 0.15% surge). On the other hand, wallets holding 0.001 to 10 Bitcoins saw a drop of around 37,465 wallets over the 10 days. Data mentioned that when large wallets accumulate and retail investors loses confidence, it leads to a historically known combination for bullish momentum to return to the crypto markets. CryptoQuant’s data reported that short-term holders now have 4.5 million BTC. It has been down by 0.8 million since 27 May. It added that demand momentum has dropped to 2 million BTC, which is said to be the worst on record. This suggests that new money is drying up in Bitcoin. New money is drying up in Bitcoin. Short-term holders now hold 4.5M BTC, down 0.8M since 27 May. Demand momentum sinks to –2M BTC, the worst on record. pic.twitter.com/ollWBXHdll — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 20, 2025 Spot ETF demand is still rising, but lagging far behind trend lines. Despite hitting straight 9 days of inflows, the influx has dropped by almost 60% since April. US Spot BTC ETFs have recorded an inflow of $1.02 billion last week and $1.39 billion before the prior week. Big transfers dominate Bitcoin Glassnode data hints that beneath Bitcoin’s strong holding over $100k, something surprising is happening as its on-chain activity is unusually quiet. It mentioned that throughout 2023 and 2024, daily Bitcoin transactions surged while peaking at 734k per day. Meanwhile, since the start of 2025, that number has fallen sharply, now ranging between just 320k and 500k transactions per day. It turns out non-monetary transactions like inscriptions, ordinals, and other blockchain-based data activity have collapsed since January. These were a major driver of last year’s transaction boom. It added that even though fewer transactions are happening, the Bitcoin network is still settling massive amounts of value, averaging $7.5 billion per day. However, it peaked at $16 billion when BTC hit its older ATH last November. The average value per transaction now sits around $36,200. It is a clear signal that high-value players are continuing to use the network. On-chain data further shows that large transactions over $100K have grown to dominate the network. These big-ticket transfers accounted for 66% of all Bitcoin volume in late 2022, but now they make up about 89% of it. Bitcoin price saw a sudden spike over the last 24 hours as it surged to regain the $106k level from the $104k zone. BTC is trading at an average price of $106,029 at press time. Its 24-hour trading volume is still down by 18% to stand at $37.4 billion. The cumulative crypto market cap posted a marginal jump over the last day to stand at $3.29 trillion with a trading volume of $86.5 billion.

In a tweet, SMQKE stated, “Ripple is positioned for Fedwire interoperability via ECS Fin partnership.” The tweet was accompanied by two images sourced from ECS Fin’s official materials, outlining their technical framework and partnerships, with Ripple explicitly listed among supported payment technologies. RIPPLE IS POSITIONED FOR FEDWIRE INTEROPERABILITY VIA ECS FIN PARTNERSHIP This is documented. pic.twitter.com/xMGr7HxVtR — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 18, 2025 Documents Show Ripple Support within ECS Fin’s IMS Payments System The first image is a datasheet for ECS Fin’s IMS Payments platform, which provides an end-to-end enterprise payment solution for banks and financial institutions. It supports numerous external channels, including mobile, web, host-to-host, and third-party APIs. The platform complies with various gateways and standards, such as ACH, SWIFT , CHIPS, and ISO 20022. Notably, Ripple and blockchain are listed alongside these protocols, indicating ECS Fin’s readiness to integrate distributed ledger technology solutions. The datasheet further explains that IMS Payments enables banks to digitize payment operations through a built-in microservices architecture. It manages workflows across the entire transaction lifecycle, from pre-payment tasks like validation and compliance to final settlement and reporting. Ripple’s mention in this infrastructure highlights its role as a supported protocol within a system that is already being used by financial institutions preparing for large-scale modernization. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 ECS Fin’s Direct Engagement with the Federal Reserve The second image is from ECS Fin’s official website under the “Partners” section. It references its involvement with the Federal Reserve Banks’ initiative to adopt the ISO 20022 messaging standard for Fedwire. ECS Fin is described as a software provider working directly with the Federal Reserve to support this transition, offering solutions and dedicated connections for FedWire, FedACH, and FedNow. This positioning underscores ECS Fin’s integral role in helping financial institutions modernize payment operations in line with U.S. central banking infrastructure. The inclusion of Ripple as a supported protocol in ECS Fin’s platform suggests that Ripple is, by extension, positioned for potential interoperability with Fedwire once institutions begin leveraging ECS Fin’s systems in full compliance with ISO 20022. Public Reactions Reflect Frustration with Price-Utility Disconnect Responding to SMQKE’s post, an X user named TcfRTB expressed appreciation for the research but also voiced concern over XRP’s market performance. He commented , “Your work is so appreciated. I do not post much but with all of this positive information on xrp… how in the world is the price at 2 dollars…. that is what I’m struggelling with….” The images shared by SMQKE show that Ripple is a documented component of ECS Fin’s IMS Payments platform, which is actively engaged with the Federal Reserve’s Fedwire modernization. While there is no direct statement that Ripple is being used within the Federal Reserve’s systems, its presence in ECS Fin’s ecosystem—which is ISO 20022-compliant and connected to U.S. payment rails—demonstrates technical readiness for future interoperability.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/the-company-that-has-been-silent-in-the-cryptocurrency-world-for-a-long-time-is-returning-to-the-market-here-are-the-details/,"Jump Crypto, which has been silent in the cryptocurrency world for a long time, is coming back to the public after years of low-profile work. Jump Crypto Breaks Silence: “We Are Ready to Rebuild and Share” In its new statement, the company emphasized that it never stopped building infrastructure despite the difficulties experienced in the past, and gave the message that “we are ready to build the next frontier of crypto technology.” While Jump Crypto is still viewed by many as a major market maker and high-frequency trader, it now wants to position itself as a serious infrastructure developer. “It would be incomplete to see us as just a trader. We are building more,” the company said in a statement. Jump Crypto attracted public attention in 2021 with its association with the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin. In December 2024, the company’s subsidiary Tai Mo Shan, which was accused of misleading investors during the UST’s short-dollarization in May 2021, signed a $123 million settlement agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Jump Crypto was also the subject of criminal investigations for allegedly manipulating the price of UST alongside Terra. The company also suffered major financial losses following the collapse of FTX and the collapse of the Terra ecosystem. One of the most notable incidents was the hacking of its own cross-chain protocol called Wormhole in February 2022. While the attackers caused a loss of $325 million, Jump Crypto had to pay $320 million in compensation to cover this loss. After these negativities, Jump Crypto had largely withdrawn from the public. However, its new statements show that the company has presented a new vision. Jump Crypto, which highlights its developer identity, states that it will focus on areas such as decentralized infrastructure, interchain interoperability and secure protocols in its future roadmap. The company, which wants to regain trust in the crypto markets, emphasizes that it has learned from the mistakes of the past and that this time it will act with the principles of transparency and responsibility. *This is not investment advice.

The Bitcoin options market is gearing up for a significant event this week. A massive chunk of Bitcoin (BTC) options, valued at nearly $3.57 billion , are scheduled to expire. This event, set for 08:00 UTC on June 20, is a key moment that traders and analysts watch closely for potential market impact. Understanding the dynamics of this Bitcoin options expiration is crucial for navigating the coming days. What’s Happening with This Bitcoin Options Expiration? According to data from the crypto options exchange Deribit, the impending expiration involves a substantial amount of open interest. Specifically: Bitcoin (BTC) Options: Nearly $3.57 billion worth are set to expire on June 20 at 08:00 UTC. The put/call ratio for this expiration is 1.01 . The max pain crypto price for this specific BTC expiration is calculated at $105,000 . Simultaneously, the Ethereum (ETH) market will also see a notable expiration: Ethereum (ETH) Options: Around $567 million worth will mature at the same time on June 20. The put/call ratio for this Ethereum options expiration is 0.69 . The max pain crypto price for the ETH expiration is $2,600 . These figures provide a snapshot of the market’s positioning leading into the expiration event. Understanding the Key Terms: Put/Call Ratio and Max Pain For those new to the crypto options market , these terms might seem technical, but they offer valuable insights: Put/Call Ratio: This ratio compares the number of open put options (contracts giving the holder the right to sell at a specific price) to the number of open call options (contracts giving the holder the right to buy at a specific price) for a specific expiration date. It’s often used as a sentiment indicator: A ratio above 1 suggests more puts than calls, potentially indicating a bearish sentiment among options traders for that period. A ratio below 1 suggests more calls than puts, potentially indicating a bullish sentiment. A ratio around 1 indicates a relatively balanced or neutral sentiment. For the upcoming Bitcoin options expiration , a ratio of 1.01 is very close to neutral, suggesting a near-even split between bullish and bearish bets placed via options for this expiry. Max Pain Price: As the input mentions, the max pain crypto price is the strike price at which the largest number of options contracts (both puts and calls) will expire worthless, causing the maximum financial loss for options holders and, conversely, potentially the maximum gain for options writers (those who sold the options). While not a guaranteed price target, some market participants believe the underlying asset’s price can be drawn towards the max pain point as expiration approaches, especially by those with large options positions looking to minimize their losses or maximize gains. The max pain calculation considers the total open interest across all strike prices for a given expiration date. It identifies the price point where the aggregate value of outstanding put and call options is minimized if the underlying asset settles at that price. It’s a complex calculation involving summing the potential losses for every strike price. Why Does a Large Options Expiration Matter? Large options expirations, particularly for major assets like Bitcoin, can sometimes correlate with increased market volatility. Here’s why: Hedging Adjustments: Traders and institutions who sold options (writers) often hedge their positions in the spot or futures market. As expiration nears, they may need to adjust these hedges, which can involve buying or selling the underlying asset, potentially influencing price. Position Unwinding: Traders holding options positions may choose to close them before expiration, either taking profits, cutting losses, or avoiding settlement procedures. This unwinding can add trading volume and price pressure. Psychological Impact: The sheer size of a multi-billion dollar expiration can create anticipation and speculation about potential price movements, leading to increased trading activity. Max Pain Influence Debate: While debated, the theory that prices might gravitate towards the max pain point can influence short-term trading decisions for some market participants. It’s important to note that the impact of options expiration is rarely a standalone market driver. It interacts with macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, spot market sentiment, and overall trading volume. However, it adds another layer of potential dynamics to consider. Comparing the BTC and ETH Expirations Let’s look at the key figures side-by-side: Metric Bitcoin (BTC) Expiration Ethereum (ETH) Expiration Expiration Date/Time June 20, 08:00 UTC June 20, 08:00 UTC Value Expiring ~$3.57 Billion ~$567 Million Put/Call Ratio 1.01 (Neutral/Slightly Bearish) 0.69 (Bullish) Max Pain Price $105,000 $2,600 The size difference is significant, with the BTC expiration being over six times larger than the ETH one. This suggests the potential impact from the Bitcoin options expiration might be more pronounced, though the ETH expiration is still substantial. The differing put/call ratios also indicate distinct sentiment biases among options traders for each asset leading into this specific expiry. Is Max Pain a Reliable Trading Signal? The concept of max pain crypto price is a fascinating one, but its reliability as a direct predictor of price movement is subject to debate. Critics argue that: The spot market, driven by overall supply and demand, institutional flows, and macro events, is the primary price driver. While options writers might try to influence price, their ability to do so is limited by the much larger volume and liquidity of the spot and perpetual futures markets. Max pain is a historical calculation based on current open interest, not a forward-looking prediction. Supporters suggest that while not a guarantee, large options positions held by sophisticated traders can exert some gravitational pull on price, especially in less liquid conditions or when other market catalysts are absent. Regardless of whether it’s a target or just a reflection of positioning, knowing the max pain price provides context about where significant options contracts are concentrated. Considering Your Options Trading Strategy Around Expiration For those engaged in options trading strategy or simply trading the underlying assets, the upcoming expiration warrants attention: Increased Volatility Awareness: Be prepared for potential choppy price action leading up to and immediately after 08:00 UTC on June 20. Monitor Price Action: Watch how BTC and ETH prices behave as the expiration time approaches. Do they seem to be influenced by the max pain levels? Context is Key: Consider the expiration alongside other market factors – recent news, overall market sentiment, technical analysis levels, and trading volume. Risk Management: If you hold options positions expiring on June 20, understand how the settlement price will affect their value. If you are trading the spot market, be mindful of potential sudden moves. Don’t Rely Solely on Max Pain: Use the max pain price and put/call ratio as indicators of options positioning, but not as the sole basis for trading decisions. Understanding these dynamics is part of developing a robust options trading strategy that accounts for various market forces. The Bigger Picture: The Growing Crypto Options Market The fact that billions of dollars in Bitcoin and Ethereum options are expiring highlights the significant growth and increasing sophistication of the crypto options market . Once a niche activity, options trading on platforms like Deribit, CME, and others has become a major component of the crypto derivatives landscape. This growth brings both opportunities for hedging and speculation, as well as potential complexities for market stability. The evolution of the market means that events like a large Bitcoin options expiration are becoming more impactful and require careful analysis by all market participants. Conclusion: Navigating the Expiration Event The upcoming June 20 expiration of nearly $3.57 billion in Bitcoin options and $567 million in Ethereum options is a notable event on the crypto calendar. While the exact impact is difficult to predict, understanding the concepts of the put/call ratio (1.01 for BTC, 0.69 for ETH) and the max pain crypto prices ($105,000 for BTC, $2,600 for ETH) provides valuable context regarding current options positioning. Traders should be mindful of potential volatility around the expiration time and integrate this information into their broader market analysis and options trading strategy , rather than viewing it in isolation. The continued growth of the crypto options market underscores its increasing relevance in the overall digital asset ecosystem.

BTC struggled to build momentum and reclaim $105,000, with the price marginally down, trading around $104,591. Recent macroeconomic developments and geopolitical tensions have dampened investor sentiment for the flagship cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, ETH is marginally down over the past 24 hours but has held above $2,500, indicating buyers are absorbing the selling pressure at that level. Ripple (XRP) is also marginally down, while Solana (SOL) is down 0.50%, trading at $145. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down over 1%, while Cardano (ADA) is down 1.20%, trading around $0.597. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Litecoin (LTC) , Hedera (HBAR) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines. However, Toncoin (TON) bucked the market trend and registered a marginal increase over the past 24 hours. DOJ Seizes $225M In Crypto Linked With Pig Butchering Scam The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced the seizure of $225 million in crypto linked to so-called “pig butchering” scams that have led victims to lose billions. The seizure is the largest linked to such scams. Federal prosecutors filed a civil forfeiture action targeting over $225 million in crypto. The assets were linked with a complex web of fraudulent investment platforms. Victims of the “pig butchering” scam were led to believe they were investing in legitimate crypto ventures, only to be scammed by criminals operating overseas. Shawn Bradsheet, special agent in charge of the US Secret Service’s San Francisco Field Office, stated, “This seizure of $225.3 million in funds linked to cryptocurrency investment scams marks the largest cryptocurrency seizure in U.S. Secret Service history.” According to the authorities, the network was connected to nearly 400 suspected victims, including dozens in the US. According to FBI data, crypto frauds were responsible for over $5.8 billion in losses last year. ARK Invest Continues Circle Stock Dump Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest continued its Circle stock dump, offloading nearly $100 million in two days. According to a market notification, the crypto-friendly investment firm dumped an additional 300,108 shares from its funds for almost $45 million. The sale came as Circle’s stock fell 1.3% from a peak of $165 to close at $149, according to data from TradingView. The decline came despite positive market developments, with the US Senate passing the GENIUS Stablecoin bill. The latest stock sale included transactions from three ARK funds, including the ARK Innovation ETF (ARRK), ARK Next Generation ETF (ARKW), and ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF). ARKK, the largest fund, sold 208,654 Circle (CRCL) shares, while ARKW and ARKF sold 65,320 and 26,134 shares, respectively. The sale accounts for nearly 14% of ARK’s 4.49 million CRCL purchase. ARK Invest bought the shares on June 5 for $373.4 million. North Korean Hackers Targeting Crypto With New Malware North Korean threat actors are targeting job seekers in crypto with a new malware designed to steal passwords for crypto wallets and password managers. According to a report by Cisco Talos, North Korean hackers were using a new Python-based remote-access trojan (RAT) called PylangGhost, linked to a hacking collective called “Famous Chollima” or “Wagemole.” The hacking group primarily targets job seekers and employees with crypto and blockchain experience, primarily in India. Attackers carry out an elaborate ruse through fake job interviews and skill tests, often using social engineering to target individuals. “Based on the advertised positions, it is clear that the Famous Chollima is broadly targeting individuals with previous experience in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies.” The attackers created fraudulent job sites impersonating legitimate companies like Coinbase, Robinhood, and Uniswap, with targets guided through a multi-step process, including interviews and contacts with fake recruiters. Candidates are then redirected to skill-testing websites where information is harvested. The victims are then tricked into enabling video and camera access during fake interviews. Here, the hackers trick the victims into copying and executing malicious commands, compromising their devices. According to Cisco Talos, PylangGhost is a variant of the previously documented GolangGhost RAT and shares similar functionality. South Korea To Reduce Exchange Fees South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) is preparing to investigate transaction fees charged by domestic crypto exchanges, indicating a shift towards user protection and cost transparency. The move is part of President Lee-Jae-myung’s pro-crypto agenda, which focuses on easing the financial burden on retail investors. According to reports, the FSC will survey domestic exchanges, their fee structure, charging methods, and revenue generated from transaction fees. The primary goal of the exercise is to determine and benchmark local fees against global standards. An FSC official stated during a policy briefing to the State Affairs Planning Committee, “We need to examine whether the current fees of domestic exchanges are an excessive burden on consumers and whether they are at an appropriate level compared to overseas cases.” However, no fee caps or targets have been set as yet. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market registered a drop on Thursday amid rising global trade concerns, geopolitical tensions, and a hawkish Fed. The flagship cryptocurrency fell to a low of $103,915 on Thursday before reclaiming $104,000 and settling at $104,631. The current session sees BTC marginally up as it consolidates. Traders remain positive about bullish price action resuming, with one pointing out that a move above recent highs could see BTC surge towards $140,000. BTC’s subdued price action contrasts with Tuesday and Wednesday when it encountered selling pressure and volatility. Price action has been muted since the FOMC meeting, which kept rates unchanged, reiterating a cautious, inflation-sensitive approach. Investors and analysts are divided on whether BTC could surge to a new all-time high or slip below $100,000, especially with the broader market trading sideways. BTC hasn’t fallen to $94,000 since May 6 but has struggled in recent sessions, losing momentum after crossing $110,000. The decline was primarily attributed to escalating geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty, which dampened market and investor sentiment. Broader financial markets are also trading sideways, with the S&P 500 down 0.48% over the past five trading days. Strategy (MSTR) shares have also dropped over 2% in the same period and nearly 11% over the past 30 days. However, US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs have registered inflows, recording $388.3 million Wednesday. While crypto bulls like Michael Saylor are confident a bear market will not return for BTC, other analysts do not share his confidence. Prominent crypto trader Rekt Capital disagreed with Saylor, stating, “People think #BTC will never see another Bear Market because it is now mainstream & too mature of an asset. One will likely occur after this Bull Market.” BTC ended the previous weekend in positive territory, closing at $105,791. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price rallied, rising over 4% to cross the 20-day SMA and $110,000 to $110,247. BTC fell to an intraday low of $108,325 on Tuesday but recovered to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,258 after a marginal increase. Sentiment changed on Wednesday as BTC fell 1.43%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $108,686. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC fell nearly 3%, falling below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,826. The price plunged to an intraday low of $102,854 on Friday as selling pressure persisted. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $106,000 and settle at $106,106, ultimately registering a marginal increase. Source: TradingView Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC registered a drop of 0.59% on Saturday before registering a marginal increase on Sunday and settling at $105,561. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC raced to an intraday high of $108,939. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $106,808, ultimately registering an increase of 1.18%. Bearish sentiment returned on Tuesday as the price fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to $104,519. Price action remained muted on Wednesday, rising 0.35% before registering a marginal decline on Thursday and settling at $104,631. BTC is up nearly 1% during the ongoing session and has reclaimed $105,000. If bulls retain control and break above $106,000, BTC could move beyond $110,000, potentially setting a new all-time high. However, if sellers regain control and BTC slips below $103,000, a drop to $100,000 or lower could be on the cards. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) price action has been subdued since Friday as it struggles to push above the 20-day SMA and $2,600. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has struggled since losing momentum after reaching an intraday high of $2,878 on Wednesday (June 11). With buyers overwhelmed at upper levels, the price plunged, dropping to a low of $2,441 on Friday before stabilizing around $2,500 and moving to current levels. Despite volatility and selling pressure, ETH has held firm above $2,500, suggesting that markets are absorbing the selling pressure. This is backed by growing institutional interest in the asset, with prominent institutional holders dominating Ethereum’s strategic reserves. According to data from the Strategic ETH Reserve Website, these strategic reserves grew to 1.190 million ETH. The reserves, worth almost $3 billion, account for 1% of ETH’s total supply. Top holders include The Ethereum Foundation, with 269,431 ETH, followed by SharpLink, a Nasdaq-listed gaming company that purchased 176,271 ETH, staking around 95% of it. ETH started the previous week on a bullish note, rising nearly 7% to cross $2,600 and the 20 and 200-day SMAs to settle at $2,680. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as the price rose over 5%, crossing $2,800 and settling at $2,816. ETH raced to an intraday high of $2,878 on Wednesday but lost momentum after reaching this level. As a result, it fell 1.56%, slipping below $2,800 and settling at $2,772. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price fell nearly 5%, falling below $2,700 and settling at $2,645. ETH plunged to an intraday low of $2,441 before rebounding to reclaim $2,500 and settle at $2,579, ultimately registering a decline of 2.48%.

However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and fell to $2,544 after a marginal decline. Price action remained bearish on Tuesday, falling 1.31% to $2,511. Buyers prevented a drop below $2,500 as the price recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.57% to $2,525. ETH registered a marginal decline on Thursday but is up nearly 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $2,565. Buyers will look to retain control and push the price past $2,600. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) has recovered over the past two sessions despite facing selling pressure, indicating that sellers may have run out of steam. SOL has struggled to regain momentum since dropping from $168. The price fell below the crucial $150 mark at the beginning of the week as bearish sentiment intensified after a brief weekend rally. Bullish sentiment could return as anticipation that regulators may approve a Solana ETF in the US grows. SOL started the previous week with a stunning rally, rising nearly 6% to cross the 50-day SMA and $160 and settle at $161. The price continued to push higher on Tuesday, rising 2.44% and settling at $165 despite selling pressure. Sellers regained control on Wednesday as SOL fell 2.48%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $161. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as the price plunged over 5%, dropping below $160 and settling at $152. The price fell to an intraday low of $140 on Friday. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $148, ultimately registering a drop of 2.48%. Source: TradingView Price action remained bearish on Saturday as SOL fell nearly 3% to $144. Despite the overwhelming bearish sentiment, the price recovered on Sunday, rising almost 6% to reclaim $150 and settle at $153. SOL raced to an intraday high of $158 on Monday. However, it could not stay at this level and fell 1.52% to $150. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell over 2%, slipping below $150 and settling at $147. SOL declined on Wednesday, settling at $146 after dropping nearly 1%. Selling pressure persisted on Thursday as the price fell to a low of $143. It recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and move to $147. The current session sees SOL up 0.53%. Buyers will look to maintain control and push the price beyond $150. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) is bracing for an important decision after Ripple and the SEC filed a renewed motion seeking to lift the ban on XRP sales and reduce a $125 million fine. A favorable ruling could prompt Ripple and the SEC to withdraw their appeals, boosting hopes for a spot XRP ETF. However, pro-crypto lawyer Bill Morgan warned a quick ruling could indicate another rejection by Judge Torres. “It only took 7 days for Judge Torres to reject the last joint motion to modify the judgment to reduce the fine and dissolve the injunction. Less than 7 days to decide the current joint motion may not be the best sign she will grant it.” XRP traded in positive territory on Monday (June 9), rising above the 50-day SMA and settling at $2.32. However, it lost momentum on Tuesday, dropping nearly 1% to $2.30. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 1.54%, slipping below the 50-day SMA and settling at $2.27.

Launched on May 19, 2025, at block height 6,624,500, this upgrade marks the Odyssey phase, a pivotal moment of technical breakthroughs and community-driven growth. With a robust suite of technical advancements, generous Airdrop rewards, enhanced ME Pass 3.0 features, and a lineup of high-profile 2025 events, Meta Earth is inviting users worldwide to join its transformative journey. Here’s why ME Network 2.0 marks a pivotal shift—and what it means for those looking to participate. ME Network 2.0: A Technical Powerhouse ME Network 2.0 introduces a modular architecture that decouples the execution layer (RollApp), settlement layer (ME-Hub), and data availability layer (ME-DA), delivering unmatched scalability, security, and ecosystem compatibility. This three-layer design enables sovereign Rollup chains to process transactions in parallel with customizable virtual machines (EVM/WASM), slashing storage costs by 98% through data availability sampling (DAS) and 2D erasure coding. The result is skyrocketing throughput, optimized costs, and rapid iteration for decentralized applications (DApps). The network’s economic model is equally revolutionary. MEC, the native token, unifies all layers, with cross-chain mappings (MEC-CI for RollApp gas fees and governance, MEC-DA for the data layer) replacing native tokens to create a closed value loop. Users pay only local RollApp gas fees, while Sequencers handle cross-layer costs, streamlining transactions. The decentralized Sequencer network, powered by CometBFT consensus, enhances security with slashing mechanisms for malicious nodes, fraud proofs, and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) compression via the Groth16 algorithm, cutting gas costs by 90%. A Watch Relayer monitors anomalies in real time, ensuring robust protection. Cross-chain communication is another standout feature. The Multi-Blockchain Communication (MBC) protocol addresses Optimistic Rollup pain points, enabling instant withdrawals through market maker prepayments and incentivizing fraud detection. EVM compatibility, via Ethermint integration, supports Solidity 0.6.0–0.8.17 and tools like MetaMask, while dual EVM/WASM virtual machines bridge Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. A DID-based identity system stores only certificate hashes on-chain, encrypting private data off-chain for privacy and enabling cross-chain verification. Additional improvements include dynamic gas pricing to counter Sybil attacks, optimized relayers for trustless communication, and enhanced security requiring two-thirds honest nodes. The ME-DA layer’s initial validator nodes, staked with 552,900 MEC from regional treasuries (India, China, ME_EARTH, USA), underscore community-driven governance, with future allocations guided by transparent DAO proposals. These advancements position ME Network 2.0 as a scalable, secure foundation for the next generation of Web3 applications.

New Stolen Datasets Emerge Weekly According to the researchers involved in the report, we’re not talking about one massive breach or even several significant leaks. Instead, we’re talking about a continuous stream of breaches, which are piling up to create a concerning picture: This is not just a leak – it’s a blueprint for mass exploitation. With over 16 billion login records exposed, cybercriminals now have unprecedented access to personal credentials that can be used for account takeover, identity theft, and highly targeted phishing. This is fresh, weaponizable intelligence at scale.’ — Researchers, Cybernews Report The situation is so bad that this 16B data leak compilation seems modest in the grand scheme of things. China’s massive 4B data leak speaks to that, as does the Mother of All Breaches (MOAB) , packing a stunning 26B leak. Cybernews exposed the latter in early 2024, the victim being Leak-Lookup, a data breach search engine. Leak–Lookup took to X to clarify that everything was the result of a firewall misconfiguration and that the problem had been fixed. To go hand in hand with this not-so-jolly news, pro-Israel hacker group Predatory Sparrow also proudly announced a $90M theft from an Iranian crypto exchange. According to the group, the goal was to weaken Iran’s military resolve in the current conflict. While no state actor took responsibility for the attack, Rafe Pilling, the director of Threat Intelligence at Sophos, stated that: ‘It bears all the hallmarks of a false persona used by a government-sponsored threat group to conduct disruptive operations against targets linked to illicit Iranian revenue generation, logistical entities, transport infrastructure and other strategic sectors.While we don’t expect to find strong technical links between Israel and Predatory Sparrow, the actions of the group align strongly with Israel’s regional priorities.’ — Rafe Pilling, The Guardian interview The problem is that most data leaks fly under the radar, and we only see the tip of the iceberg. But the real-world potential impact of this thriving cybercrime industry is gloomy, to say the least. Here is a study by Bright Defense , which details the fallout associated with cybercriminal activity in recent years. The list is too long to include in one screenshot. This makes cybersecurity more important today than ever, especially in the crypto sector, which is rife with data security concerns. Non-custodial wallets like Best Wallet may offer a solution by making your data and private keys your responsibility, rather than the exchange’s, which, as we have seen, can too easily be breached. How Best Wallet Enhances Your Crypto Security Best Wallet enhances your crypto security by being a non-custodial and no-KYC wallet. This protects your anonymity, limits your blockchain footprint, and safeguards your funds in case of a data leak. It’s also much more user-friendly than a hardware wallet and completely free to download. The wallet app has an intuitive UI, letting you swap, deposit, and stake your funds on the fly. It also features a Token Launchpad, which gives you access to tokens in presales, so you can invest in tomorrow’s top coins before they go live. One of these is Best Wallet’s native $BEST token, which has already raised $13.45M with a coin price of $0.025205. The project offers stakers a dynamic APY of 103% and consists of four phases, each with multiple long-term goals. Holding $BEST has multiple perks, such as higher staking rewards, community governance rights, reduced transaction fees, and early access to new projects. Based on the coin’s utility and provided it sees widespread adoption post-launch, our analysts expect $BEST to reach a price point of $0.072 by the end of 2025, for an ROI of 185%. A 5-year prediction sees $BEST going up to $0.82, giving an ROI of 3,153% if you invest at today’s price. This would make $BEST one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025. To get the most out of Best Wallet, buy $BEST today through the Upcoming Tokens section or at the official presale website. Will Data Leaks Damage the Crypto Sector? It’s unlikely that data leaks will disrupt or damage the crypto sector, given its relentless growth and continuous advancements in cybersecurity. Using tools like Best Wallet also contributes to your security and anonymity on the blockchain, reducing your exposure to data leaks. Don’t take this as financial advice.

Launched on May 19, 2025, at block height 6,624,500, this upgrade marks the Odyssey phase, a pivotal moment of technical breakthroughs and community-driven growth. With a robust suite of technical advancements, generous Airdrop rewards, enhanced ME Pass 3.0 features, and a lineup of high-profile 2025 events, Meta Earth is inviting users worldwide to join its transformative journey. Here’s why ME Network 2.0 marks a pivotal shift—and what it means for those looking to participate. ME Network 2.0: A Technical Powerhouse ME Network 2.0 introduces a modular architecture that decouples the execution layer (RollApp), settlement layer (ME-Hub), and data availability layer (ME-DA), delivering unmatched scalability, security, and ecosystem compatibility. This three-layer design enables sovereign Rollup chains to process transactions in parallel with customizable virtual machines (EVM/WASM), slashing storage costs by 98% through data availability sampling (DAS) and 2D erasure coding. The result is skyrocketing throughput, optimized costs, and rapid iteration for decentralized applications (DApps). The network’s economic model is equally revolutionary. MEC, the native token, unifies all layers, with cross-chain mappings (MEC-CI for RollApp gas fees and governance, MEC-DA for the data layer) replacing native tokens to create a closed value loop. Users pay only local RollApp gas fees, while Sequencers handle cross-layer costs, streamlining transactions. The decentralized Sequencer network, powered by CometBFT consensus, enhances security with slashing mechanisms for malicious nodes, fraud proofs, and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) compression via the Groth16 algorithm, cutting gas costs by 90%. A Watch Relayer monitors anomalies in real time, ensuring robust protection. Cross-chain communication is another standout feature. The Multi-Blockchain Communication (MBC) protocol addresses Optimistic Rollup pain points, enabling instant withdrawals through market maker prepayments and incentivizing fraud detection. EVM compatibility, via Ethermint integration, supports Solidity 0.6.0–0.8.17 and tools like MetaMask, while dual EVM/WASM virtual machines bridge Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. A DID-based identity system stores only certificate hashes on-chain, encrypting private data off-chain for privacy and enabling cross-chain verification. Additional improvements include dynamic gas pricing to counter Sybil attacks, optimized relayers for trustless communication, and enhanced security requiring two-thirds honest nodes. The ME-DA layer’s initial validator nodes, staked with 552,900 MEC from regional treasuries (India, China, ME_EARTH, USA), underscore community-driven governance, with future allocations guided by transparent DAO proposals. These advancements position ME Network 2.0 as a scalable, secure foundation for the next generation of Web3 applications.

These rewards make participation rewarding and inclusive, encouraging users to grow their MEC holdings while fueling ecosystem expansion. ME Pass 3.0: The Gateway to Web3 ME Pass 3.0, the cornerstone of user interaction, has been revamped to enhance the Web3 experience. Its sleek new UI offers seamless navigation, while bolstered security features, including multi-factor authentication and passkey setup, protect users' assets. Users can now manage NFTs—displaying, transferring, and browsing collections—directly in the app. Cross-chain transactions between the ME-Hub and RollApps streamline asset movement, and a new “Explore” section introduces ME Mini-Programs and an app marketplace for richer content discovery. Community features like real-time messaging, large group chats, and end-to-end encryption foster engagement, making ME Pass 3.0 a powerful tool for Web3 exploration. 2025: Discovering Meta Earth Offline Meta Earth is taking its vision global with a series of high-profile offline events in 2025, offering opportunities to connect with the community and explore ME Network 2.0 firsthand: Istanbul Blockchain Week (June): Attendees can join the event in Turkey for insights into Web3 innovation.
