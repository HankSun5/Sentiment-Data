Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Saves California on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Saves California by entering its contract address – 2mtzeaYqDPLtCemX5jNPuuq8jw65cbgNUXuT3fBra2M2 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCALI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-15 23:11:00

Similarly, Chainlink(LINK) has endured a tragic month, as its value spirals downwards. Many long-time holders of these assets are now considering alternatives, and Remittix (RTX) has become a popular choice. This modern PayFi protocol brings solutions to the longstanding problems in the cross-border payments sector, and is gearing up to carve out a large piece of this market. So are Pepe (PEPE) and Chainlink (LINK) likely to see a price resurgence in 2025, and why are so many investors shifting funds to Remittix (RTX)? Solana Price Drops 19% In 30 Days Solana (SOL) has spiralled, losing more than 19% of its value in the last month alone, and having posted a similar loss in the last week. Industry commentators are torn over whether the most recent Solana price drop has been due to whale sell offs or a general downturn in the crypto market. Technological analysis shows that Solana (SOL) has dropped below key support levels, such as the $196 200-day Exponential Moving Average, representing a bearish trend. Perhaps more worryingly, Solana's Total Value Locked (TVL) has also fallen more than 7% in a day, indicating less trust in its ecosystem. Solana (SOL) still has a $86.74 billion market cap and remains an influential player in the crypto space, though its price trajectory is looking weak going into 2025. Chainlink Finds Itself On Thin Ice Chainlink ambled through 2022 and 2023 at snail pace before a major rally in November 2024, raising questions about whether Chainlink (LINK) could make a meaningful comeback. Despite recent losses, it still holds standing as one of more modern decentralized oracle networks, facilitating secure communication between smart contracts and real worlddata. Chainlink (LINK) too has had a poor start to 2025. Over the last 30 days, Chainlink lost 37.47% of its value and is also down 21.9% in the last week, now sitting at $18.97, down a staggering 64% from its ATH in 2021. Technically, Chainlink is trading in a descending wedge pattern, which is usually a bullish reversal indicator. The key resistance level to watch is $23.92, as a breakout above this could push Chainlink towards $30. Remittix Carves Out Its Place in Cross-Border Payment Space Remittix (RTX) has entered the PayFi space with a powerful offering as it sets out to address longstanding inefficiencies in the cross-border payments space. This is a $190 trillion industry in which Remittix (RTX) is considered a game changer due to its practical, real-life utility. Remittix lets users change over 40 cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies and transfer money directly to bank accounts worldwide, solving some of the biggest problems in global finance.

With support for over 30 fiat currencies and 50 cryptocurrency pairs, Remittix is ideal for freelancers, e-commerce platforms, and international service providers. Remittix Nears $2.8 Million Raised In Presale Proactive adopters of Remittix can seize up tokens at an alluring price of $0.0207 in the current phase of the presale , which has already attracted over $2.8 million in investment. Due to the project’s practical utility within a high value sector, analysts have anticipated an 800% increase by the presale’s end, followed by a potential 5,000% rally post-launch, positioning RTX as one of the most anticipated tokens in the market.

Similarly, Chainlink (LINK) has faced a challenging month, with its value on a downward trend. Long-standing investors in these cryptocurrencies are exploring other options, and Remittix (RTX) has emerged as a favored alternative. This innovative PayFi protocol aims to tackle the persistent issues in cross-border payments and is poised to seize a significant share of this market. So, will Pepe (PEPE) and Chainlink (LINK) see a price revival in 2025, and what drives so many investors to shift their focus to Remittix (RTX)? Solana Sees a 19% Decline Over a Month Solana (SOL) has taken a hit, shedding more than 19% of its value in just the past month and showing similar losses over the past week. Experts are divided on whether this recent drop in Solana's price is due to significant sell-offs by major investors or a general decline in the crypto market. Technical analysis reveals that Solana (SOL) has fallen below crucial support levels, such as the $196 200-day Exponential Moving Average, indicating a bearish trend. Adding to the concern, Solana's Total Value Locked (TVL) has also decreased by more than 7% in a single day, suggesting diminishing confidence in its ecosystem. Despite these setbacks, Solana (SOL) maintains an $86.74 billion market cap and remains a key player in the crypto space, although its price outlook appears weak as 2025 approaches. Chainlink Faces Uncertainty After trudging through 2022 and 2023 at a slow pace, Chainlink experienced a significant rally in November 2024, sparking discussions about whether Chainlink (LINK) could stage a meaningful recovery. Despite recent setbacks, it remains a leading decentralized oracle network, enabling secure interactions between smart contracts and real-world data. Chainlink (LINK) has also started 2025 on a poor note. Over the past 30 days, Chainlink has lost 37.47% of its value and is down 21.9% in the last week, now priced at $18.97, which is a significant 64% drop from its all-time high in 2021. From a technical perspective, Chainlink is trading within a descending wedge pattern, typically viewed as a bullish reversal signal. The critical resistance level to monitor is $23.92, as breaking through this point could propel Chainlink towards $30. Remittix Establishes Its Role in the Cross-Border Payment Industry Remittix (RTX) has entered the PayFi sector with a strong proposition, aiming to resolve long-standing inefficiencies in cross-border payments.

Remittix has drawn the interest of investors looking for high-growth prospects with its ground-breaking PayFitechnology, which is intended to transform international payments. Here's a deeper look at the progress with Tron growth, ADA price volatility, and PayFi innovation. Cardano Faces Market Volatility, but Investors Remain Optimistic A notable price correction just occurred for Cardano (ADA), which fell 10% on Monday and closed at $0.91. After a period of strong performance during which the asset posted a 17.8% gain last week, there was a drop. The fall was largely caused by macroeconomic concerns, such as inflation concerns brought on by better-than-expected U.S. job data. Despite the ADA price drop, Cardano remains a significant player in the cryptocurrency industry with $1.16 billion in open interest, suggesting investor optimism. Future developments, including the incoming U.S. administration's proposed crypto tax reforms, are stoking expectations for a possible recovery. According to analysts, Cardano ADA price may soon rise toward $0.99 if it sustains support at $0.90. Cardano's capacity to withstand market swings is demonstrated by its resilience, which also emphasizes the need for diversity. Many ADA holders are looking for new options like Remittixto enhance their portfolios as they navigate this turbulent time. Tron Growth Inspires Confidence Among Investors Tron (TRX) has demonstrated remarkable performance in the cryptocurrency space, with a 95% price gain in the last 12 months and an incredible 115.73% revenue growth in 2024. According to projections, Tron TRX may hit $0.50 by 2025 as a result of ongoing network expansion and uptake. Tron is a strong rival, even outperforming Ethereum and Solana in terms of profitability, with its emphasis on quick transactions and decentralized software. And so far, Tron growth has been impressive. Nonetheless, Tron investors are alert to the market's natural volatility and are searching for new ventures with substantial upside potential. Presenting Remittix, a revolutionary payment network that combines the ease of fiat money with the speed of cryptocurrency. With its innovative features and early-stage presale, Remittix offers a compelling opportunity for Tron investors to diversify and potentially maximize returns.

Cardano's Market Challenges and Investor Optimism Cardano (ADA) recently faced a significant price drop, falling 10% on Monday to close at $0.91.

Future developments, such as the upcoming U.S. administration's proposed crypto tax reforms, are fuelling hopes for a potential rebound.

Tron's Growth Fuels Investor Assurance In the crypto realm, Tron (TRX) has shown impressive performance, with its price surging 95% over the past year and an astounding 115.73% revenue increase in 2024. Projections suggest that Tron's TRX could reach $0.50 by 2025, driven by ongoing network growth and adoption.

As reported by Ali Martinez, an on-chain analyst, the number of transactions on the network has risen to above $1 million in the last few days. Source: X According to Martinez, within one day, Santiment registered 341 transactions of more than $1 million. These high volume value transfers are believed to be made by XRP whales, individuals or entities with large number of XRP holdings. Their entry demonstrates a pick up in market participation and confidence. XRP price new high XRP has also shown significant growth as it hit $3, the first time since its previous high of $3.84 in January 2018. At the time of writing, the token is trading at $2.94. XRP went up by 14.45% in the last 24 hours. Peter Brandt, a veteran trader, recently pointed out that the half-mast flag seen on the weekly chart of XRP should be completed within the next six weeks. A half-mast flag is a neutral pattern that has the potential to go either up or down. The consolidation phase usually indicates the probability of the continuation of the trend. Source: X According to Brandt, if the pattern completes bullishly, XRP’s market capitalization might attain $500 billion, a 262% increase and a potential price of $6.40. But Brandt pointed out that the pattern needs to “rock and roll soon,” otherwise it can switch to something else. This broader bullish trend has also been seen in the meme coins on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as well. Among the most popular tokens, ARMY, LIHUA, and DROP have increased the value significantly. ARMY rose by 26.52% to close at $0.1792, while LIHUA rose by 24.89% to $0.051588. At the time of reporting, DROP was also 26.10% up and was trading at $16.66. Most of these tokens are currently being traded on the Bitrue exchange. In the last week alone, DROP has surged by a massive 95.41%. Factors driving XRP’s recent surge The price surge is happening against the backdrop of increasing rumors of the possible approval of an XRP-based ETF. Also, the anticipation for new developments by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its lawsuit against Ripple.

Despite this development, BTC traders still look apprehensive as their strategy suggests they are still bearish on the current price action. Bitcoin Traders Turn Bearish Following Price Recovery In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that Bitcoin traders have turned bearish despite the price recovery above $97,000. The crypto analyst mentioned that the percentage of traders on Binance betting BTC will rise has declined from 66.35% to 55.22% over the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Has Entered Another Bull Cycle, Puts Price Above $20 This development is significant as these Binance traders have a track record of being right most of the time. While most traders (55.22%) are still longing BTC, the decline in those betting on a rise suggests that there is the possibility that the recent price recovery is just a relief bounce and not a bullish reversal. The Bitcoin price has recovered above $97,000 after dropping to below $90,000 two days ago. This recent rally could pave the way for the flagship crypto to reclaim the psychological $100,000 price level. Crypto analyst Jelle is confident that this could happen soon, as he stated that a price breakout above $97,000 could lead to new highs for Bitcoin. However, there is still a lot of market uncertainty, which could explain why some of these Bitcoin traders are choosing not to bet on a further rally despite the recent price recovery. Recent macro data have suggested that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to implement as many quantitative easing (QE) policies as compared to last year. This is bearish for the Bitcoin price since investors could become more skeptical about investing in this risk asset. On the other hand, Donald Trump’s incoming administration provides some optimism for market participants since the US president-elect has promised to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which would lead to greater adoption of BTC. BTC’s Market Structure Has Changed Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade also provided a bullish outlook for the Bitcoin price. In an X post, he stated that Bitcoin has shifted the market structure from a downtrend to an uptrend. He explained that when BTC was in a downtrend with lower highs and lower lows, it created an equal high, signaling a “change of character.” Related Reading: Analyst Who Predicted Bitcoin Price Crash To $89,000 Reveals Where BTC Is Headed Next Now, Bitcoin has broken through the resistance to form a higher high. According to Trader Tardigrade, if BTC maintains a higher low at the support/ resistance flip level of $96,000, it could start the bull run again. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the flagship crypto could reclaim $100,000 and then rally to new highs. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $97,300, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

HBAR price analysis shows Hedera trapped between $0.25 and $0.33, hinging on Bitcoin’s next move to break free. Similarly, Bitget Token (BGB) struggles with selling pressure, falling 26% from its ATH of $8.49, and facing resistance at $6.29-$6.48. While both tokens show potential, the clear winner emerging is BlockDAG (BDAG). With its PoW-powered technology, $180.5 million raised in presale, and the game-changing LAUNCH300 campaign offering a 300% bonus, BDAG is attracting whales and positioning itself as the next big Layer-1 network. The project’s momentum, supported by an upcoming mainnet launch, sets it apart as the most promising option for investors seeking exponential gains. BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 – 300% Extra Coins Attracts Crypto Whales In the cryptoverse, institutional giants are on the lookout for smart money and they often gain the first mover advantage. Spotting the next big layer 1 is troublesome for average buyers, but what if there’s a way to follow where the smart money went and join them. BlockDAG (BDAG) is a PoW based crypto that raised over 180.5 million through presale. No other major presale has recorded such massive inflow of money in the last 5 years. So shouldn’t we listen? The layer 1 termed the successor of Kaspa (KAS) is doing everything Kaspa did but much better. Similar to what Elon Musk did with the space industry, they reinvented the wheel and they are bold about it with out-of-the-world marketing stunts in crypto history. Now the team has launched one of the biggest offers till date – the code LAUNCH300 offers buyers with 300% extra BDAG coins for a limited time. Within a few hours of the campaign launch, the project recorded massive selling pushing the coins sold to 18 billion. The momentum can partly be attributed to the upcoming mainnet launch where the coin price is planned to hit $0.05. With an altcoin season in the background, this could be the ultimate coin that could trigger massive gains in short time. HBAR Price Analysis: Will Hedera Break Free From Its $0.25-$0.33 Range? Hedera (HBAR) has been stuck in a tight consolidation range between $0.25 and $0.33 for over a month, frustrating traders eager for a breakout. HBAR price analysis suggests that its future trajectory depends heavily on Bitcoin’s performance, with a 0.65 correlation indicating that HBAR often mirrors Bitcoin’s movements. Currently trading at $0.27, HBAR faces a critical test. A dip below $0.25 could signal further bearish momentum, while flipping $0.33 into support could pave the way for a rally toward $0.39. Much of this depends on Bitcoin reclaiming $100,000 and sparking a broader market rally. For investors, HBAR’s potential upside in a bullish Bitcoin-led market makes it a worthwhile consideration. While short-term risks remain, a breakout could deliver significant gains, especially as Hedera continues to develop its ecosystem. HBAR price analysis highlights a promising opportunity for those willing to take calculated risks. Bitget Token (BGB) Struggles as Selling Pressure Mounts—What’s Next for the Price? Bitget Token (BGB) has faced significant selling pressure, dropping from its all-time high of $8.49 on Dec. 27, 2024, to $6.25 at press time—a 26% decline. This drop comes amid profit-taking and reduced buying momentum, with on-chain data showing a decrease in holding time for transacted coins. Lower holding times often indicate rising selling activity, which could extend BGB’s downward trend in the short term. Resistance between $6.29 and $6.48, highlighted by the In/Out of Money Around Price (IOMAP) metric, adds further challenges. Unless buying volume increases, Bitget Token (BGB) could face difficulty reclaiming the $7 level. Technically, BGB is trading within a descending triangle, a bearish pattern that suggests potential further declines to support levels at $5.04 or even $4.22. However, a shift in momentum could push the price toward $7.24 if buying pressure strengthens. Takeaway Among the three, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out as the most compelling opportunity. Hedera, as shown in HBAR price analysis, depends heavily on Bitcoin’s performance, leaving its trajectory uncertain. Similarly, Bitget Token (BGB) faces mounting resistance and bearish patterns, with recovery relying on a shift in buying pressure. In contrast, BDAG has already demonstrated unmatched success with $180.5 million raised, a loyal whale-backed community, and the innovative LAUNCH300 campaign. With its presale price of $0.0248 and a potential listing price of $0.05, BDAG combines high growth potential with tangible momentum.

The breach resulted in the theft of nearly 120,000 Bitcoins, valued at approximately $12 billion today. Of this, $9.3 billion worth, equivalent to 94,643 Bitcoin, has been recovered and approved for return to Bitfinex. Court Ruling: No Victims Identified in Bitfinex Hack The DOJ stated in the court filing that no identifiable victims exist in the Bitfinex hack due to the exchange’s repayment measures and loss generalization policies. GOV’S ABOUT TO HAND BACK BITFINEX BITCOIN TO REAL OWNERS So, the US government’s making crypto history by talking about returning those Bitfinex hack Bitcoins they seized back in 2016. That’s millions in BTC, getting handed back to the OGs. Sounds like a plot twist, right?… pic.twitter.com/hCOvtuXj5b — Mario Nawfal’s Roundtable (@RoundtableSpace) January 15, 2025 The filing read: “For the foregoing reasons, there is no ‘victim’ for the specific offenses of conviction in this proceeding.” The 2016 hack exploited a vulnerability in Bitfinex’s multi-signature wallet system, allowing hackers to steal vast amounts of cryptocurrency. According to the DOJ , the stolen Bitcoin was laundered using advanced methods, including crypto-mixing services. The hack led to the conviction of Ilya Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather “Razzlekhan” Morgan. Lichtenstein was sentenced to 60 months in prison for money laundering, while Morgan received an 18-month sentence for assisting in laundering the stolen funds. Their cooperation enabled the recovery of 80% of the stolen Bitcoin, marking one of the largest asset seizures in DOJ history. Despite her legal troubles, Morgan, a rapper and social media personality, recently released a music video titled “Razzlekhan vs. The United States,” dedicated to “misfits.” She is scheduled to report to prison this month. January 28 Deadline for Bitfinex Users to File Restitution Claim s Following the hack, Bitfinex implemented a repayment program to address customer losses. The exchange reduced user account balances by 36% and issued BFX tokens as compensation. These tokens were redeemable for cash or convertible into equity in Bitfinex’s parent company, Ifinex. The company also issued Recovery Right Tokens (RRT) to address potential future recoveries. Bitfinex stated that its repayment program fully compensated users, though some have argued that Bitcoin’s price increase since 2016 has left them undercompensated. While Bitfinex will receive 94,643 Bitcoin, valued at $9.3 billion, not all stolen funds could be recovered due to the complexity of laundering transactions. The plea agreements facilitated voluntary restitution to Bitfinex, focusing on assets linked to the hack. Separate forfeiture processes address other laundered funds not directly tied to the stolen Bitcoin. As part of the restitution process, affected users have until January 28, 2025, to file claims or objections to the terms. The DOJ has established a mechanism for individuals identifying themselves as affected parties to submit their claims.

The impersonators extorted $855,000 from the victim, who believed she was sending the funds to assist her lover, Brad Pitt. Perpetrators of romance scams have long preyed on lonely individuals seeking companionship with various deceptive tactics. Over the years, these methods have become fairly easy to spot and evade. However, recent developments in artificial intelligence have shifted the balance of power back to the fraudsters. Anne meets Brad Pitt Anne’s ordeal began in early 2023 when she was contacted by someone claiming to be the actor’s mother, Jane Etta Pitt. The person impersonating Brad Pitt’s mother then introduced her to another individual claiming to be Brad, who then expressed romantic interest in her. Over 18 months, the scammers strengthened the relationship using AI-generated photos and messages on several platforms, including WhatsApp and Instagram. The communications apparently helped convince Anne of their identity. After a while, the fake Brad Pitt started to ask Anne for money, claiming he needed it for cancer treatment. The scammers claimed that Pitt’s bank accounts were frozen due to his divorce proceedings with his ex-wife, Angelina Jolie. Anne, though doubtful at first, ended up transferring the large sum of money to an account in Turkey after receiving an email from the doctor who claimed to be treating Pitt. “I’m not used to social media, and I didn’t really understand what was happening to me,” Anne told TF1. Anne only realized she was the victim of a scam after seeing pictures of Pitt with his current partner, Inés de Ramon. Anne shared her story on the French television channel TF1 and rather than compassion or comfort, she was hit with a wave of mockery and trolling from the viewers of the show. The backlash got so bad that the broadcast had to be removed. Explanation about the removal of the Brad Pitt AI romance scam from social media. Source: @7a8 (X) TF1 presenter Harry Roselmack posted on his account that the broadcast would be withdrawn from the station’s platforms in order to protect the victim. AI has become a useful tool for cybercriminals This incident is just one of the many similar schemes gaining popularity in recent years. In 2024, reported scams involving Brad Pitt impersonators in Spain led to the arrest of five individuals after they conned the sum of $350,000 from two women. In 2022, romance scams ranked second among the most costly scams reported in Canada, resulting in losses of $59M from 1400 reported cases. Similarly, such scams accounted for over $652M in lost funds in the US in 2023. Romance scams aside, advancements in artificial intelligence have also made the job of identity thieves and online fraudsters easier, contributing to over $8.8M in losses in the US. Artificial intelligence gives cybercriminals easy access to sophisticated tools that amplify the effectiveness of their scams. Using AI tools available to the average, non-paying user, anyone can generate images and create deepfake videos to populate a fake profile on dating platforms or social media.

The Injective ecosystem is rolling out the governance proposal for INJ 3.0, setting the stage to elevate INJ as a standout deflationary asset. On another exciting front, Filecoin (FIL) rides a bullish wave, posting a 5% gain this week after a robust 19% increase, thanks to Bithumb’s new trading pair announcement and compelling on-chain metrics. Meanwhile, the trailblazing decentralized e-commerce platform, Web3Bay , is capturing attention with its presale, amassing over $700K from selling 200 million tokens. This surge confirms Web3Bay’s rapid ascent beyond just a decentralized marketplace. Injective Ecosystem: Latest INJ 3.0 Rollout The Injective ecosystem, vital to DeFi applications, has introduced the INJ 3.0 governance proposal, targeting to secure INJ’s position as a foremost deflationary asset in the cryptocurrency realm. This proposal is geared toward slashing the token supply with advanced burning techniques and strategic supply reduction, aligning perfectly with Injective’s vision for a sustainable ecosystem. Highlighted features include bolstered staking rewards and streamlined procedures to cut down the circulating supply. Set to launch in stages throughout the year, INJ 3.0 is poised to offer enduring benefits for traders, stakers, developers, and ecosystem partners, with anticipated substantial growth in 2025 driven by this forward-thinking approach to tokenomics. Filecoin (FIL) Price Eyes the $8.42 Mark Filecoin’s price trajectory remains bullish, climbing 5% this week to about $6.20 after a 19% upsurge last week triggered by Bithumb’s listing of a new trading pair, boosting FIL’s exposure in South Korea. The optimism is reinforced by strong on-chain metrics, with Open Interest swelling to $358.30 million and Total Value Locked hitting $93.12 million, signaling robust network activity. Technical forecasts predict potential advances for Filecoin’s price toward $8.42, propelled by a 35% surge to the Fibonacci retracement level, contingent on sustained momentum. Web3Bay’s Decentralized Marketplace: Explosive $700K Presale in Just Days! The e-commerce domain is undergoing a seismic shift, and Web3Bay is at the forefront of this revolution. As a decentralized marketplace fueled by blockchain, Web3Bay restores power to users, eliminating intermediaries, concealed fees, and data misuse—enabling secure, transparent, and effective transactions. Contrasting traditional e-commerce platforms that often involve hefty fees, privacy risks, and dependency on fallible centralized systems, Web3Bay eradicates these problems by enabling users to retain ownership of their data and assets. Thanks to its blockchain foundation, Web3Bay ensures lower costs, swifter transactions, and enhanced security. Yet, the catch is: accessing this exceptional platform requires Web3Bay’s native token, 3BAY. Possessing the 3BAY token is crucial for engaging with Web3Bay’s unique offerings. Without it, users would miss out on reduced transaction fees and the chance to shape the platform’s future through governance participation, all while enjoying rewards. Securing 3BAY tokens during its presale is not only astute due to the current affordable price but also a gateway to potentially huge returns, with the token price set to soar from just $0.0039675 to $0.1959—an astounding 4,839% ROI opportunity for early investors. As the presale has already gathered over $700,000, an increasing number of crypto enthusiasts are seizing this opportunity, driving demand and price upwards. Those interested should act quickly to participate in the presale, securing tokens at a lower price. Web3Bay crypto isn’t just another token—it’s the cornerstone of a platform poised to redefine online commerce. In Conclusion In essence, the Injective ecosystem, Filecoin’s bullish price trajectory, and Web3Bay’s pioneering decentralized marketplace are collectively spearheading a transformation in the crypto arena for 2025. Injective’s INJ 3.0 plan introduces a strategic deflationary model aimed at boosting long-term sustainability and growth. Filecoin remains a key market driver with its optimistic price forecasts supported by vigorous on-chain activity and strategic updates. Meanwhile, Web3Bay steals the limelight by reinventing e-commerce with its blockchain-integrated platform, offering unparalleled user control, transparency, and cost efficiency. Web3Bay’s booming presale and innovative approach to Web3 commerce firmly establish it as one of the leading web3 crypto coins in decentralized marketplaces and digital trade, making it an opportunity not to be missed.

The new ETF will invest in digital asset transformation businesses and products, giving investors access to the emerging digital economy. The Onchain Economy ETF, which will trade under the ticker NODE, plans to invest at least 80% of its net assets in companies and assets that support the digital asset economy. The fund was proposed on January 15 and will have two main investment streams: “Digital Transformation Companies” and “ Digital Asset Instruments”. Source:SEC The Digital Transformation Companies include companies involved in activities that are vital to the digital asset industry. Some are crypto exchanges, payment gateway service providers, mining companies, and those that provide software or infrastructure for digital asset functioning. The ETF’s investment strategy also includes exposure to companies involved in energy infrastructure, data centers, and other technologies supporting the digital asset market. While other digital asset funds will invest in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, the Onchain Economy ETF will not do so directly. Instead, it will gain exposure to digital assets through companies and instruments closely related to the sector. This approach is useful as the fund can focus on firms essential for the expansion of the digital currency industry but do not hold digital currencies. VanEck’s head of digital assets research, Matthew Sigel, said that more information about the ETF would be disclosed in the coming weeks. Increased interest in Crypto ETFs VanEck’s application is just one of many crypto-related ETFs that have been proposed to the SEC. Financial firms are looking up as they expect new regulations under the newly reelected administration. Bitwise Asset Management applied for its 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF in the last quarter of 2024. These major digital assets are listed in the index, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). Likewise, WisdomTree filed an application for an XRP-related ETF in December 2024, and Grayscale applied to transform its Solana Trust into an ETF. BlackRock is expected to roll out a Bitcoin ETF product for Canadian investors. The new iShares product will trade on CBOE Canada. Bitwise also proposed a Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF, which would track firms that hold Bitcoin in their treasuries. As reported by Cryptopolitan, in just one year, US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) broke all the rules, holding 1.13 million Bitcoins. Bitcoin ETFs alone have already grown larger than gold ETFs in terms of AUM. Gold ETFs, for instance, have only taken 20 years to get to $128 billion in AUM. Bitcoin ETFs got to $107 billion in one year only.

Coins like XRP and WIF serve as prime examples of these high-growth tokens, which transitioned from under a $1 value to remarkable expansion throughout 2024. With 2025 on the horizon and brimming with optimistic potential, we've pinpointed some leading crypto coins that could follow a similar growth trajectory in Q1. Among these tokens are Tron (TRX), Stellar (XLM), and Lunex Network (LNEX) . But what makes these coins stand out? Tron (TRX) Set to Build on Current Bullish Trends Tron has entered the new year riding a wave of positive momentum. To provide some context, Tron's price surged by over 22% in December, holding strong above the $0.25 threshold. According to CoinMarketCap , Tron saw a 136% increase in value throughout 2024, with 64% of that growth occurring in the fourth quarter. This bullish momentum has lifted Tron into the top 10 cryptocurrencies, boasting a market cap exceeding $21.8 billion. After reaching an all-time high of $0.4407 in early December, Andrew Griffiths, analyzing the Tron price chart on X, observed that Tron's price is trending within a descending channel on the one-hour timeframe. A rebound could lead to a positive shift, with Andrew's target around $0.26. Coincodex concurs, predicting that Tron's price will likely reach $0.26 in the near future. Stellar (XLM) May Be on the Verge of a Bullish Surge Recently, Stellar has experienced a correction phase, with its value dropping over 28% in the past month, as reported by market stats . This follows a period of over 500% growth from November to December, during which the token reached a yearly high of $0.56. Despite this downturn, Stellar has managed to hold support above $0.30. Crypto analyst JavonTM1 notes that Stellar is nearing a convergence point, likely sparking another bullish wave in the coming weeks. The growing DEX volume, averaging an 80% increase recently, may also steer the token towards a bullish trend. More than 20 vital market indicators are signaling buy, and the altcoin is trading above the 50-day and 200-day SMA . Although current sentiment remains neutral, the surge in market activity could drive the price to $0.63, a short-term target set by Coincodex experts. This positions Stellar as a key crypto to watch in Q1. Anticipated Launch of Lunex Network (LNEX) as Presale Momentum Builds The launch of Lunex Network (LNEX) is expected before Q1 ends, unveiling its full potential. The ongoing presale is a chance for investors to become early adopters. To date, over 2.4 billion LNEX tokens have been sold, raising more than $6M in cryptocurrency ICO funding. This figure is projected to surpass $10M by the presale's close. With its distinctive use case and growth potential, the Lunex Network project is anticipated to increase by 100x before launch. Priced at $0.0054, this is the ideal time for investors to acquire the token. Early investors have already realized over 350% ROI in just a few weeks. Similar to BNB, the Lunex Network token LNEX offers substantial utility in the DeFi exchange. Beyond serving as listing fees in the Lunex Network trading exchange, holders benefit from transaction fee discounts and a profit-sharing model rewarding active LNEX holders with additional tokens. Investors can also stake the token for as little as 30 days to earn significant APY returns. In essence, the Lunex project operates as a DeFi protocol enabling fast, secure, and non-custodial cross-chain asset transfers. The mobile exchange provides access to over 50k crypto pairs, paving the way for numerous trading opportunities that could enhance user profits. Overall, Lunex Network is a standout DeFi coin not to overlook in Q1. Which Crypto Project Should Capture Investors' Attention? Both Tron and Stellar present high-potential opportunities, especially given their recent value gains. Meanwhile, Lunex Network offers an attractive investment alternative, allowing investors to earn profits even during its presale. With pioneering features like a portfolio tracker and a merchant payment gateway, the trading exchange's adoption is set to rise, likely propelling the LNEX price above $1 sooner than expected.

For context, the price of Tron gained over 22% within the month of december to maintain support above the $0.25 mark. According to CoinMarketCap , Tron's price recorded a 136% increase in value in 2024, with 64% of the entire year's price growth coming in Q4.

The popular prediction platform expects the Tron price to hit $0.26 in the short term. Possible Bullish Wave Imminent for Stellar (XLM) Having lost over 28% of its value within the last 30 days, as per market stats , Stellar crypto is genuinely in its correctional phase. This is coming after Stellar’s price recorded over 500% growth between November and December when the token reached a year-long price high of $0.56. Meanwhile, despite the decline, the Stellar token has maintained support above the $0.30 mark. A crypto analyst, JavonTM1 , has pointed out that the Stellar token is nearing a converging point, which will likely trigger another bullish wave in the coming weeks. The increasing DEX volume growth, averaging 80% within the past few days, could also influence the token's market trend to a bullish momentum. Over 20 key market indicators are flashing buy signals, and the altcoin is trading above the 50-day and 200-day SMA . Although the Stellar market sentiment is neutral, the booming market activity is likely to propel the price towards $0.63, which Coincodex experts forecasted for the short term. This makes it one of the top crypto coins to watch out for in Q1. The Launch of Lunex Network (LNEX) Draws Closer Amid Surging Presale Momentum Before the end of Q1, Lunex Network (LNEX) will be launched, and its true potential will be revealed. The ongoing presale offers investors an opportunity to be early adopters of the project. So far, over 2.4 billion LNEX tokens have been sold, helping the team to raise more than $6M in cryptocurrency ICO funding. This value is expected to rise above $10M before the end of the presale. Given its unique use case and growth potential, the Lunex Network project has been tipped to surge by 100x before launch. At $0.0054, investors have the best chance to accumulate the token at this nascent stage. So far, early investors have made over 350% ROI within a few weeks. Just like the BNB, the Lunex Network token LNEX holds strong utility in the DeFi exchange. Outside of being used as listing fees in the Lunex Network trading exchange, holders will access discounts on transaction fees. They are also entitled to the profit-sharing model designed to reward active LNEX holders with more tokens. Investors can also stake the token for as little as 30 days and earn high APY yields. For context, the Lunex project is a DeFi protocol where members can perform cross-chain asset transfers in a fast, secure, and non-custodial exchange. The mobile exchange gives users access to over 50k crypto pairs, opening the door for various trading opportunities which will boost users' profits. Overall, Lunex Network is one of the best DeFi coins not to miss in Q1. Which Crypto Project Should Investors Zero in on? Both Tron and Stellar are high-potential crypto projects, especially now that they've gained significant value in the last quarter. Meanwhile, Lunex Network is a top investment alternative investors can jump into and start earning profits even while on presale. With robust features like the revolutionary portfolio tracker and the merchant payment gateway, the adoption of the trading exchange will surge soon, pushing the LNEX price above $1 sooner than anticipated.

Chainlink or Remittix,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/which-one-of-these-should-you-invest-for-500-gains-in-january-chainlink-or-remittix,"Investors are looking for their next opportunity as the start of 2025 is expected to be very promising for the crypto market. Chainlink (LINK) is among the best cryptos among the more spoken names. Even market analysts like Captain Faibik have made a bold price prediction. Meanwhile, an emerging token named Remittix (RTX) is also gaining mass appeal. Remittix will disrupt the cross-border payments market, which Mordor Intelligence predicts could be worth $295B by 2029. Many investors are gravitating towards this rising presale star, which has already rewarded early buyers with a 36% return. They believe it may have higher upside potential in 2025, with numbers like 500% being mentioned. Captain Faibik: The Price of Chainlink (LINK) Could Reach $200 Chainlink (LINK) is one of the top crypto coins, but it has recently seen some red price charts. According to CoinMarketCap , its value has fallen from around $30 to below $20 in the past 30 days. In other words, the Chainlink price fell over 30% in just a few short weeks. But the community is still excited about Chainlink (LINK), thanks to bullish statements by market analysts like Captain Faibik. In his recent X post , he said this altcoin will reach $200 in this bull run. The technical analysis supports this Chainlink price prediction. TradingView data shows this crypto coin is valued above its 100-day EMA ($18). Additionally, its momentum indicator of -3.369 is in the buy zone and suggests an uptrend potentially coming for the Chainlink coin. Remittix (RTX) Seen as a New Contender With Massive Upside Potential While Chainlink (LINK) is experiencing some volatility right now, Remittix (RTX) is creating a lot of positive buzz. This is because of its great performance in the crypto ICO event. Notably, Remittix has seen seven price increases and raised over $2.8M in just three weeks. Early investors in this project are already 36% richer, and more price spikes are coming. Hype for Remittix is growing fast as it could dominate the cross-border payments market. Unlike Stripe or Wise, Remittix will launch a crypto-to-fiat platform that lets users convert 40 cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies like YEN or EUR. Afterward, they can be sent to any global bank account at a flat fee with no hidden costs for FX or wires. Plus, the Remittix Pay API will allow businesses to accept crypto payments, benefiting all parties involved. Those interested now buy its native token, RTX, at a discount. To incentivize purchases, Remittix will give all RTX holders governance voting rights and staking rewards. Currently, one RTX costs just $0.0207, but the next block of tokens will cost $0.0217. With the recent CoinMarketCap listing of this altcoin, demand for RTX is bound to increase. This factor, plus a projected top-tier crypto exchange listing, could trigger a massive rally for RTX soon. Chainlink (LINK) vs. Remittix (RTX) – Which Crypto Coin Could Surge First? Chainlink (LINK) and Remittix (RTX) are the altcoins to watch this quarter, as they could both see big price gains. However, Remittix stands out as it will have a smaller market cap than LINK, which means it will need less money for its price to grow. Additionally, its groundbreaking technology could make it a fan-favorite for millions of individuals in unbanked regions. Therefore, its long-term growth potential could also be better. Because of all these factors, many investors are turning to RTX as the best cryptocurrency to buy now for potential 500% gains.

Chainlink (LINK) is one of the standout cryptocurrencies that has garnered significant attention. Even prominent market analysts like Captain Faibik have ventured bold predictions for its price. On the other hand, a new player called Remittix (RTX) is rapidly gaining popularity. This token is set to revolutionize the cross-border payments sector, a market that Mordor Intelligence forecasts could reach $295B by 2029. Many investors are flocking to this promising presale star, which has already delivered a 36% return to early adopters. They speculate it might offer even greater potential gains in 2025, with figures like 500% being suggested. Captain Faibik: Predicts Chainlink's (LINK) Price May Hit $200 Chainlink (LINK) remains a leading cryptocurrency, despite experiencing a downturn in recent price trends. According to CoinMarketCap , its value has dropped from approximately $30 to under $20 in the last month. In summary, Chainlink's price has decreased by more than 30% in just a few weeks. Nonetheless, the Chainlink (LINK) community remains optimistic due to the bullish outlook from analysts like Captain Faibik. In a recent X post , he predicted that this altcoin could soar to $200 during the current bull market. Technical analysis backs this Chainlink price forecast. Data from TradingView reveals that this digital asset is trading above its 100-day EMA ($18). Also, its momentum indicator at -3.369 suggests it is in the buy zone, hinting at a potential upward trend for Chainlink. Remittix (RTX): A Rising Star With Tremendous Growth Potential While Chainlink (LINK) faces some turbulence, Remittix (RTX) is generating significant excitement. Its impressive performance during the crypto ICO event has attracted attention. Remarkably, Remittix has experienced seven price hikes and raised more than $2.8M within just three weeks. Early backers of this venture have already seen a 36% increase in value, with further price surges anticipated. The buzz around Remittix is rapidly intensifying as it aims to lead the cross-border payments industry. Unlike services like Stripe or Wise, Remittix is set to introduce a crypto-to-fiat platform that enables the conversion of 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies such as YEN or EUR. These can then be transferred to any international bank account with a flat fee, avoiding hidden FX or transfer charges. Additionally, the Remittix Pay API will allow businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments, benefiting all users. Potential investors can acquire its native token, RTX, at a discounted rate. Remittix encourages buying by offering RTX holders governance voting rights and staking rewards. Currently, RTX is priced at $0.0207, but the cost for the next batch of tokens will rise to $0.0217. With its recent listing on CoinMarketCap, the demand for RTX is expected to grow. This, combined with an anticipated listing on a major crypto exchange, could spark a significant rally for RTX soon. Chainlink (LINK) and Remittix (RTX): Which Crypto Might Surge First? Chainlink (LINK) and Remittix (RTX) are two altcoins to watch this quarter, both holding the potential for substantial price increases. However, Remittix stands out due to its smaller market cap compared to LINK, meaning it requires less capital to drive its price upward. Moreover, its innovative technology could make it particularly appealing to millions in underserved regions. Consequently, its prospects for long-term growth might be superior. Considering these aspects, numerous investors are viewing RTX as the top cryptocurrency to invest in now for potential 500% returns.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/only-five-whales-hold-565-trillion-shib-heres-the-significance/,"The distribution of Shiba Inu tokens has come under scrutiny as five whale addresses now collectively hold 57% of the total supply, amounting to 565 trillion SHIB. This significant concentration of assets within a small number of wallets raises questions about potential market volatility and the implications for token decentralization. Among these wallets, one address alone accounts for 41.7% of the entire SHIB supply, highlighting a clear disparity between high-activity and low-activity holders. Such centralization could amplify market risks, particularly in the event of abrupt movements by these large holders. As a result, tracking the activity of these wallets is crucial for anticipating short-term price fluctuations and understanding broader market trends. SHIB On-chain Data Highlights Key Trends Recent on-chain data further sheds light on current dynamics. Over the past week, outflows from large holders have decreased by 31%, signaling reduced selling pressure from whales. This decline may contribute to greater price stability in the short term. On the other hand, inflows into large wallets have risen by 53%, suggesting that prominent investors are accumulating the token at lower price levels. From a technical perspective, the token’s price is above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) support level at around $0.00002079. If the price continues to hold above this critical threshold, this move could signal a potential shift in market sentiment. However, caution is still advised, as sustained upward momentum would require SHIB to break above resistance levels near $0.00002250 and $0.00002325. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Strategic Investor Accumulation Offers Hope The recent accumulation trends hint at growing interest from strategic investors seeking to capitalize on lower prices. Resistance levels at $0.00002250 and $0.00002325 remain key hurdles for the bulls, and breaking above these thresholds would be necessary to shift market sentiment in a positive direction. The centralization of SHIB holdings in a few wallets poses unique challenges for market stability. Large-scale transactions by these whales have the potential to significantly impact prices, underscoring the importance of monitoring their activity. As the token navigates its current support levels, market participants should approach cautiously, considering the heightened risk of volatility stemming from the concentration of assets. The coming days will likely be vital for the asset’s price trajectory. A sustained defense of the $0.00002079 support level and continued accumulation by larger players could lay the groundwork for a price rebound. However, the reliance on a small number of investors leaves the market vulnerable to sudden shifts, emphasizing the need for vigilance among traders and stakeholders. By closely observing wallet activity and technical indicators, market participants can better prepare for the potential outcomes of this concentrated asset distribution.

Trump’s Crypto Law (TRUMPLAW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPLAW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Crypto Law can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Crypto Law could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Crypto Law launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Crypto Law on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Crypto Law by entering its contract address – 7mYansF38wyaSvnj7C1Gr536FdMbGA4ufqY7PwzC7CxM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPLAW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|REGULATION|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-16 00:38:14
