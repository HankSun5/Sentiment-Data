Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Saves California on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Saves California by entering its contract address – 2mtzeaYqDPLtCemX5jNPuuq8jw65cbgNUXuT3fBra2M2 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCALI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-15 23:11:00

Similarly, Chainlink(LINK) has endured a tragic month, as its value spirals downwards. Many long-time holders of these assets are now considering alternatives, and Remittix (RTX) has become a popular choice. This modern PayFi protocol brings solutions to the longstanding problems in the cross-border payments sector, and is gearing up to carve out a large piece of this market. So are Pepe (PEPE) and Chainlink (LINK) likely to see a price resurgence in 2025, and why are so many investors shifting funds to Remittix (RTX)? Solana Price Drops 19% In 30 Days Solana (SOL) has spiralled, losing more than 19% of its value in the last month alone, and having posted a similar loss in the last week. Industry commentators are torn over whether the most recent Solana price drop has been due to whale sell offs or a general downturn in the crypto market. Technological analysis shows that Solana (SOL) has dropped below key support levels, such as the $196 200-day Exponential Moving Average, representing a bearish trend. Perhaps more worryingly, Solana's Total Value Locked (TVL) has also fallen more than 7% in a day, indicating less trust in its ecosystem. Solana (SOL) still has a $86.74 billion market cap and remains an influential player in the crypto space, though its price trajectory is looking weak going into 2025. Chainlink Finds Itself On Thin Ice Chainlink ambled through 2022 and 2023 at snail pace before a major rally in November 2024, raising questions about whether Chainlink (LINK) could make a meaningful comeback. Despite recent losses, it still holds standing as one of more modern decentralized oracle networks, facilitating secure communication between smart contracts and real worlddata. Chainlink (LINK) too has had a poor start to 2025. Over the last 30 days, Chainlink lost 37.47% of its value and is also down 21.9% in the last week, now sitting at $18.97, down a staggering 64% from its ATH in 2021. Technically, Chainlink is trading in a descending wedge pattern, which is usually a bullish reversal indicator. The key resistance level to watch is $23.92, as a breakout above this could push Chainlink towards $30. Remittix Carves Out Its Place in Cross-Border Payment Space Remittix (RTX) has entered the PayFi space with a powerful offering as it sets out to address longstanding inefficiencies in the cross-border payments space. This is a $190 trillion industry in which Remittix (RTX) is considered a game changer due to its practical, real-life utility. Remittix lets users change over 40 cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies and transfer money directly to bank accounts worldwide, solving some of the biggest problems in global finance.

With support for over 30 fiat currencies and 50 cryptocurrency pairs, Remittix is ideal for freelancers, e-commerce platforms, and international service providers. Remittix Nears $2.8 Million Raised In Presale Proactive adopters of Remittix can seize up tokens at an alluring price of $0.0207 in the current phase of the presale , which has already attracted over $2.8 million in investment. Due to the project’s practical utility within a high value sector, analysts have anticipated an 800% increase by the presale’s end, followed by a potential 5,000% rally post-launch, positioning RTX as one of the most anticipated tokens in the market.

Similarly, Chainlink (LINK) has faced a challenging month, with its value on a downward trend. Long-standing investors in these cryptocurrencies are exploring other options, and Remittix (RTX) has emerged as a favored alternative. This innovative PayFi protocol aims to tackle the persistent issues in cross-border payments and is poised to seize a significant share of this market. So, will Pepe (PEPE) and Chainlink (LINK) see a price revival in 2025, and what drives so many investors to shift their focus to Remittix (RTX)? Solana Sees a 19% Decline Over a Month Solana (SOL) has taken a hit, shedding more than 19% of its value in just the past month and showing similar losses over the past week. Experts are divided on whether this recent drop in Solana's price is due to significant sell-offs by major investors or a general decline in the crypto market. Technical analysis reveals that Solana (SOL) has fallen below crucial support levels, such as the $196 200-day Exponential Moving Average, indicating a bearish trend. Adding to the concern, Solana's Total Value Locked (TVL) has also decreased by more than 7% in a single day, suggesting diminishing confidence in its ecosystem. Despite these setbacks, Solana (SOL) maintains an $86.74 billion market cap and remains a key player in the crypto space, although its price outlook appears weak as 2025 approaches. Chainlink Faces Uncertainty After trudging through 2022 and 2023 at a slow pace, Chainlink experienced a significant rally in November 2024, sparking discussions about whether Chainlink (LINK) could stage a meaningful recovery. Despite recent setbacks, it remains a leading decentralized oracle network, enabling secure interactions between smart contracts and real-world data. Chainlink (LINK) has also started 2025 on a poor note. Over the past 30 days, Chainlink has lost 37.47% of its value and is down 21.9% in the last week, now priced at $18.97, which is a significant 64% drop from its all-time high in 2021. From a technical perspective, Chainlink is trading within a descending wedge pattern, typically viewed as a bullish reversal signal. The critical resistance level to monitor is $23.92, as breaking through this point could propel Chainlink towards $30. Remittix Establishes Its Role in the Cross-Border Payment Industry Remittix (RTX) has entered the PayFi sector with a strong proposition, aiming to resolve long-standing inefficiencies in cross-border payments.

Remittix has drawn the interest of investors looking for high-growth prospects with its ground-breaking PayFitechnology, which is intended to transform international payments. Here's a deeper look at the progress with Tron growth, ADA price volatility, and PayFi innovation. Cardano Faces Market Volatility, but Investors Remain Optimistic A notable price correction just occurred for Cardano (ADA), which fell 10% on Monday and closed at $0.91. After a period of strong performance during which the asset posted a 17.8% gain last week, there was a drop. The fall was largely caused by macroeconomic concerns, such as inflation concerns brought on by better-than-expected U.S. job data. Despite the ADA price drop, Cardano remains a significant player in the cryptocurrency industry with $1.16 billion in open interest, suggesting investor optimism. Future developments, including the incoming U.S. administration's proposed crypto tax reforms, are stoking expectations for a possible recovery. According to analysts, Cardano ADA price may soon rise toward $0.99 if it sustains support at $0.90. Cardano's capacity to withstand market swings is demonstrated by its resilience, which also emphasizes the need for diversity. Many ADA holders are looking for new options like Remittixto enhance their portfolios as they navigate this turbulent time. Tron Growth Inspires Confidence Among Investors Tron (TRX) has demonstrated remarkable performance in the cryptocurrency space, with a 95% price gain in the last 12 months and an incredible 115.73% revenue growth in 2024. According to projections, Tron TRX may hit $0.50 by 2025 as a result of ongoing network expansion and uptake. Tron is a strong rival, even outperforming Ethereum and Solana in terms of profitability, with its emphasis on quick transactions and decentralized software. And so far, Tron growth has been impressive. Nonetheless, Tron investors are alert to the market's natural volatility and are searching for new ventures with substantial upside potential. Presenting Remittix, a revolutionary payment network that combines the ease of fiat money with the speed of cryptocurrency. With its innovative features and early-stage presale, Remittix offers a compelling opportunity for Tron investors to diversify and potentially maximize returns.

Cardano's Market Challenges and Investor Optimism Cardano (ADA) recently faced a significant price drop, falling 10% on Monday to close at $0.91.

Future developments, such as the upcoming U.S. administration's proposed crypto tax reforms, are fuelling hopes for a potential rebound.

Tron's Growth Fuels Investor Assurance In the crypto realm, Tron (TRX) has shown impressive performance, with its price surging 95% over the past year and an astounding 115.73% revenue increase in 2024. Projections suggest that Tron's TRX could reach $0.50 by 2025, driven by ongoing network growth and adoption.

As reported by Ali Martinez, an on-chain analyst, the number of transactions on the network has risen to above $1 million in the last few days. Source: X According to Martinez, within one day, Santiment registered 341 transactions of more than $1 million. These high volume value transfers are believed to be made by XRP whales, individuals or entities with large number of XRP holdings. Their entry demonstrates a pick up in market participation and confidence. XRP price new high XRP has also shown significant growth as it hit $3, the first time since its previous high of $3.84 in January 2018. At the time of writing, the token is trading at $2.94. XRP went up by 14.45% in the last 24 hours. Peter Brandt, a veteran trader, recently pointed out that the half-mast flag seen on the weekly chart of XRP should be completed within the next six weeks. A half-mast flag is a neutral pattern that has the potential to go either up or down. The consolidation phase usually indicates the probability of the continuation of the trend. Source: X According to Brandt, if the pattern completes bullishly, XRP’s market capitalization might attain $500 billion, a 262% increase and a potential price of $6.40. But Brandt pointed out that the pattern needs to “rock and roll soon,” otherwise it can switch to something else. This broader bullish trend has also been seen in the meme coins on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as well. Among the most popular tokens, ARMY, LIHUA, and DROP have increased the value significantly. ARMY rose by 26.52% to close at $0.1792, while LIHUA rose by 24.89% to $0.051588. At the time of reporting, DROP was also 26.10% up and was trading at $16.66. Most of these tokens are currently being traded on the Bitrue exchange. In the last week alone, DROP has surged by a massive 95.41%. Factors driving XRP’s recent surge The price surge is happening against the backdrop of increasing rumors of the possible approval of an XRP-based ETF. Also, the anticipation for new developments by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its lawsuit against Ripple.

Despite this development, BTC traders still look apprehensive as their strategy suggests they are still bearish on the current price action. Bitcoin Traders Turn Bearish Following Price Recovery In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that Bitcoin traders have turned bearish despite the price recovery above $97,000. The crypto analyst mentioned that the percentage of traders on Binance betting BTC will rise has declined from 66.35% to 55.22% over the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Has Entered Another Bull Cycle, Puts Price Above $20 This development is significant as these Binance traders have a track record of being right most of the time. While most traders (55.22%) are still longing BTC, the decline in those betting on a rise suggests that there is the possibility that the recent price recovery is just a relief bounce and not a bullish reversal. The Bitcoin price has recovered above $97,000 after dropping to below $90,000 two days ago. This recent rally could pave the way for the flagship crypto to reclaim the psychological $100,000 price level. Crypto analyst Jelle is confident that this could happen soon, as he stated that a price breakout above $97,000 could lead to new highs for Bitcoin. However, there is still a lot of market uncertainty, which could explain why some of these Bitcoin traders are choosing not to bet on a further rally despite the recent price recovery. Recent macro data have suggested that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to implement as many quantitative easing (QE) policies as compared to last year. This is bearish for the Bitcoin price since investors could become more skeptical about investing in this risk asset. On the other hand, Donald Trump’s incoming administration provides some optimism for market participants since the US president-elect has promised to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which would lead to greater adoption of BTC. BTC’s Market Structure Has Changed Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade also provided a bullish outlook for the Bitcoin price. In an X post, he stated that Bitcoin has shifted the market structure from a downtrend to an uptrend. He explained that when BTC was in a downtrend with lower highs and lower lows, it created an equal high, signaling a “change of character.” Related Reading: Analyst Who Predicted Bitcoin Price Crash To $89,000 Reveals Where BTC Is Headed Next Now, Bitcoin has broken through the resistance to form a higher high. According to Trader Tardigrade, if BTC maintains a higher low at the support/ resistance flip level of $96,000, it could start the bull run again. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the flagship crypto could reclaim $100,000 and then rally to new highs. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $97,300, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

HBAR price analysis shows Hedera trapped between $0.25 and $0.33, hinging on Bitcoin’s next move to break free. Similarly, Bitget Token (BGB) struggles with selling pressure, falling 26% from its ATH of $8.49, and facing resistance at $6.29-$6.48. While both tokens show potential, the clear winner emerging is BlockDAG (BDAG). With its PoW-powered technology, $180.5 million raised in presale, and the game-changing LAUNCH300 campaign offering a 300% bonus, BDAG is attracting whales and positioning itself as the next big Layer-1 network. The project’s momentum, supported by an upcoming mainnet launch, sets it apart as the most promising option for investors seeking exponential gains. BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 – 300% Extra Coins Attracts Crypto Whales In the cryptoverse, institutional giants are on the lookout for smart money and they often gain the first mover advantage. Spotting the next big layer 1 is troublesome for average buyers, but what if there’s a way to follow where the smart money went and join them. BlockDAG (BDAG) is a PoW based crypto that raised over 180.5 million through presale. No other major presale has recorded such massive inflow of money in the last 5 years. So shouldn’t we listen? The layer 1 termed the successor of Kaspa (KAS) is doing everything Kaspa did but much better. Similar to what Elon Musk did with the space industry, they reinvented the wheel and they are bold about it with out-of-the-world marketing stunts in crypto history. Now the team has launched one of the biggest offers till date – the code LAUNCH300 offers buyers with 300% extra BDAG coins for a limited time. Within a few hours of the campaign launch, the project recorded massive selling pushing the coins sold to 18 billion. The momentum can partly be attributed to the upcoming mainnet launch where the coin price is planned to hit $0.05. With an altcoin season in the background, this could be the ultimate coin that could trigger massive gains in short time. HBAR Price Analysis: Will Hedera Break Free From Its $0.25-$0.33 Range? Hedera (HBAR) has been stuck in a tight consolidation range between $0.25 and $0.33 for over a month, frustrating traders eager for a breakout. HBAR price analysis suggests that its future trajectory depends heavily on Bitcoin’s performance, with a 0.65 correlation indicating that HBAR often mirrors Bitcoin’s movements. Currently trading at $0.27, HBAR faces a critical test. A dip below $0.25 could signal further bearish momentum, while flipping $0.33 into support could pave the way for a rally toward $0.39. Much of this depends on Bitcoin reclaiming $100,000 and sparking a broader market rally. For investors, HBAR’s potential upside in a bullish Bitcoin-led market makes it a worthwhile consideration. While short-term risks remain, a breakout could deliver significant gains, especially as Hedera continues to develop its ecosystem. HBAR price analysis highlights a promising opportunity for those willing to take calculated risks. Bitget Token (BGB) Struggles as Selling Pressure Mounts—What’s Next for the Price? Bitget Token (BGB) has faced significant selling pressure, dropping from its all-time high of $8.49 on Dec. 27, 2024, to $6.25 at press time—a 26% decline. This drop comes amid profit-taking and reduced buying momentum, with on-chain data showing a decrease in holding time for transacted coins. Lower holding times often indicate rising selling activity, which could extend BGB’s downward trend in the short term. Resistance between $6.29 and $6.48, highlighted by the In/Out of Money Around Price (IOMAP) metric, adds further challenges. Unless buying volume increases, Bitget Token (BGB) could face difficulty reclaiming the $7 level. Technically, BGB is trading within a descending triangle, a bearish pattern that suggests potential further declines to support levels at $5.04 or even $4.22. However, a shift in momentum could push the price toward $7.24 if buying pressure strengthens. Takeaway Among the three, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out as the most compelling opportunity. Hedera, as shown in HBAR price analysis, depends heavily on Bitcoin’s performance, leaving its trajectory uncertain. Similarly, Bitget Token (BGB) faces mounting resistance and bearish patterns, with recovery relying on a shift in buying pressure. In contrast, BDAG has already demonstrated unmatched success with $180.5 million raised, a loyal whale-backed community, and the innovative LAUNCH300 campaign. With its presale price of $0.0248 and a potential listing price of $0.05, BDAG combines high growth potential with tangible momentum.

The breach resulted in the theft of nearly 120,000 Bitcoins, valued at approximately $12 billion today. Of this, $9.3 billion worth, equivalent to 94,643 Bitcoin, has been recovered and approved for return to Bitfinex. Court Ruling: No Victims Identified in Bitfinex Hack The DOJ stated in the court filing that no identifiable victims exist in the Bitfinex hack due to the exchange’s repayment measures and loss generalization policies. GOV’S ABOUT TO HAND BACK BITFINEX BITCOIN TO REAL OWNERS So, the US government’s making crypto history by talking about returning those Bitfinex hack Bitcoins they seized back in 2016. That’s millions in BTC, getting handed back to the OGs. Sounds like a plot twist, right?… pic.twitter.com/hCOvtuXj5b — Mario Nawfal’s Roundtable (@RoundtableSpace) January 15, 2025 The filing read: “For the foregoing reasons, there is no ‘victim’ for the specific offenses of conviction in this proceeding.” The 2016 hack exploited a vulnerability in Bitfinex’s multi-signature wallet system, allowing hackers to steal vast amounts of cryptocurrency. According to the DOJ , the stolen Bitcoin was laundered using advanced methods, including crypto-mixing services. The hack led to the conviction of Ilya Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather “Razzlekhan” Morgan. Lichtenstein was sentenced to 60 months in prison for money laundering, while Morgan received an 18-month sentence for assisting in laundering the stolen funds. Their cooperation enabled the recovery of 80% of the stolen Bitcoin, marking one of the largest asset seizures in DOJ history. Despite her legal troubles, Morgan, a rapper and social media personality, recently released a music video titled “Razzlekhan vs. The United States,” dedicated to “misfits.” She is scheduled to report to prison this month. January 28 Deadline for Bitfinex Users to File Restitution Claim s Following the hack, Bitfinex implemented a repayment program to address customer losses. The exchange reduced user account balances by 36% and issued BFX tokens as compensation. These tokens were redeemable for cash or convertible into equity in Bitfinex’s parent company, Ifinex. The company also issued Recovery Right Tokens (RRT) to address potential future recoveries. Bitfinex stated that its repayment program fully compensated users, though some have argued that Bitcoin’s price increase since 2016 has left them undercompensated. While Bitfinex will receive 94,643 Bitcoin, valued at $9.3 billion, not all stolen funds could be recovered due to the complexity of laundering transactions. The plea agreements facilitated voluntary restitution to Bitfinex, focusing on assets linked to the hack. Separate forfeiture processes address other laundered funds not directly tied to the stolen Bitcoin. As part of the restitution process, affected users have until January 28, 2025, to file claims or objections to the terms. The DOJ has established a mechanism for individuals identifying themselves as affected parties to submit their claims.

The impersonators extorted $855,000 from the victim, who believed she was sending the funds to assist her lover, Brad Pitt. Perpetrators of romance scams have long preyed on lonely individuals seeking companionship with various deceptive tactics. Over the years, these methods have become fairly easy to spot and evade. However, recent developments in artificial intelligence have shifted the balance of power back to the fraudsters. Anne meets Brad Pitt Anne’s ordeal began in early 2023 when she was contacted by someone claiming to be the actor’s mother, Jane Etta Pitt. The person impersonating Brad Pitt’s mother then introduced her to another individual claiming to be Brad, who then expressed romantic interest in her. Over 18 months, the scammers strengthened the relationship using AI-generated photos and messages on several platforms, including WhatsApp and Instagram. The communications apparently helped convince Anne of their identity. After a while, the fake Brad Pitt started to ask Anne for money, claiming he needed it for cancer treatment. The scammers claimed that Pitt’s bank accounts were frozen due to his divorce proceedings with his ex-wife, Angelina Jolie. Anne, though doubtful at first, ended up transferring the large sum of money to an account in Turkey after receiving an email from the doctor who claimed to be treating Pitt. “I’m not used to social media, and I didn’t really understand what was happening to me,” Anne told TF1. Anne only realized she was the victim of a scam after seeing pictures of Pitt with his current partner, Inés de Ramon. Anne shared her story on the French television channel TF1 and rather than compassion or comfort, she was hit with a wave of mockery and trolling from the viewers of the show. The backlash got so bad that the broadcast had to be removed. Explanation about the removal of the Brad Pitt AI romance scam from social media. Source: @7a8 (X) TF1 presenter Harry Roselmack posted on his account that the broadcast would be withdrawn from the station’s platforms in order to protect the victim. AI has become a useful tool for cybercriminals This incident is just one of the many similar schemes gaining popularity in recent years. In 2024, reported scams involving Brad Pitt impersonators in Spain led to the arrest of five individuals after they conned the sum of $350,000 from two women. In 2022, romance scams ranked second among the most costly scams reported in Canada, resulting in losses of $59M from 1400 reported cases. Similarly, such scams accounted for over $652M in lost funds in the US in 2023. Romance scams aside, advancements in artificial intelligence have also made the job of identity thieves and online fraudsters easier, contributing to over $8.8M in losses in the US. Artificial intelligence gives cybercriminals easy access to sophisticated tools that amplify the effectiveness of their scams. Using AI tools available to the average, non-paying user, anyone can generate images and create deepfake videos to populate a fake profile on dating platforms or social media.

The Injective ecosystem is rolling out the governance proposal for INJ 3.0, setting the stage to elevate INJ as a standout deflationary asset. On another exciting front, Filecoin (FIL) rides a bullish wave, posting a 5% gain this week after a robust 19% increase, thanks to Bithumb’s new trading pair announcement and compelling on-chain metrics. Meanwhile, the trailblazing decentralized e-commerce platform, Web3Bay , is capturing attention with its presale, amassing over $700K from selling 200 million tokens. This surge confirms Web3Bay’s rapid ascent beyond just a decentralized marketplace. Injective Ecosystem: Latest INJ 3.0 Rollout The Injective ecosystem, vital to DeFi applications, has introduced the INJ 3.0 governance proposal, targeting to secure INJ’s position as a foremost deflationary asset in the cryptocurrency realm. This proposal is geared toward slashing the token supply with advanced burning techniques and strategic supply reduction, aligning perfectly with Injective’s vision for a sustainable ecosystem. Highlighted features include bolstered staking rewards and streamlined procedures to cut down the circulating supply. Set to launch in stages throughout the year, INJ 3.0 is poised to offer enduring benefits for traders, stakers, developers, and ecosystem partners, with anticipated substantial growth in 2025 driven by this forward-thinking approach to tokenomics. Filecoin (FIL) Price Eyes the $8.42 Mark Filecoin’s price trajectory remains bullish, climbing 5% this week to about $6.20 after a 19% upsurge last week triggered by Bithumb’s listing of a new trading pair, boosting FIL’s exposure in South Korea. The optimism is reinforced by strong on-chain metrics, with Open Interest swelling to $358.30 million and Total Value Locked hitting $93.12 million, signaling robust network activity. Technical forecasts predict potential advances for Filecoin’s price toward $8.42, propelled by a 35% surge to the Fibonacci retracement level, contingent on sustained momentum. Web3Bay’s Decentralized Marketplace: Explosive $700K Presale in Just Days! The e-commerce domain is undergoing a seismic shift, and Web3Bay is at the forefront of this revolution. As a decentralized marketplace fueled by blockchain, Web3Bay restores power to users, eliminating intermediaries, concealed fees, and data misuse—enabling secure, transparent, and effective transactions. Contrasting traditional e-commerce platforms that often involve hefty fees, privacy risks, and dependency on fallible centralized systems, Web3Bay eradicates these problems by enabling users to retain ownership of their data and assets. Thanks to its blockchain foundation, Web3Bay ensures lower costs, swifter transactions, and enhanced security. Yet, the catch is: accessing this exceptional platform requires Web3Bay’s native token, 3BAY. Possessing the 3BAY token is crucial for engaging with Web3Bay’s unique offerings. Without it, users would miss out on reduced transaction fees and the chance to shape the platform’s future through governance participation, all while enjoying rewards. Securing 3BAY tokens during its presale is not only astute due to the current affordable price but also a gateway to potentially huge returns, with the token price set to soar from just $0.0039675 to $0.1959—an astounding 4,839% ROI opportunity for early investors. As the presale has already gathered over $700,000, an increasing number of crypto enthusiasts are seizing this opportunity, driving demand and price upwards. Those interested should act quickly to participate in the presale, securing tokens at a lower price. Web3Bay crypto isn’t just another token—it’s the cornerstone of a platform poised to redefine online commerce. In Conclusion In essence, the Injective ecosystem, Filecoin’s bullish price trajectory, and Web3Bay’s pioneering decentralized marketplace are collectively spearheading a transformation in the crypto arena for 2025. Injective’s INJ 3.0 plan introduces a strategic deflationary model aimed at boosting long-term sustainability and growth. Filecoin remains a key market driver with its optimistic price forecasts supported by vigorous on-chain activity and strategic updates. Meanwhile, Web3Bay steals the limelight by reinventing e-commerce with its blockchain-integrated platform, offering unparalleled user control, transparency, and cost efficiency. Web3Bay’s booming presale and innovative approach to Web3 commerce firmly establish it as one of the leading web3 crypto coins in decentralized marketplaces and digital trade, making it an opportunity not to be missed.

The new ETF will invest in digital asset transformation businesses and products, giving investors access to the emerging digital economy. The Onchain Economy ETF, which will trade under the ticker NODE, plans to invest at least 80% of its net assets in companies and assets that support the digital asset economy. The fund was proposed on January 15 and will have two main investment streams: “Digital Transformation Companies” and “ Digital Asset Instruments”. Source:SEC The Digital Transformation Companies include companies involved in activities that are vital to the digital asset industry. Some are crypto exchanges, payment gateway service providers, mining companies, and those that provide software or infrastructure for digital asset functioning. The ETF’s investment strategy also includes exposure to companies involved in energy infrastructure, data centers, and other technologies supporting the digital asset market. While other digital asset funds will invest in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, the Onchain Economy ETF will not do so directly. Instead, it will gain exposure to digital assets through companies and instruments closely related to the sector. This approach is useful as the fund can focus on firms essential for the expansion of the digital currency industry but do not hold digital currencies. VanEck’s head of digital assets research, Matthew Sigel, said that more information about the ETF would be disclosed in the coming weeks. Increased interest in Crypto ETFs VanEck’s application is just one of many crypto-related ETFs that have been proposed to the SEC. Financial firms are looking up as they expect new regulations under the newly reelected administration. Bitwise Asset Management applied for its 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF in the last quarter of 2024. These major digital assets are listed in the index, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). Likewise, WisdomTree filed an application for an XRP-related ETF in December 2024, and Grayscale applied to transform its Solana Trust into an ETF. BlackRock is expected to roll out a Bitcoin ETF product for Canadian investors. The new iShares product will trade on CBOE Canada. Bitwise also proposed a Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF, which would track firms that hold Bitcoin in their treasuries. As reported by Cryptopolitan, in just one year, US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) broke all the rules, holding 1.13 million Bitcoins. Bitcoin ETFs alone have already grown larger than gold ETFs in terms of AUM. Gold ETFs, for instance, have only taken 20 years to get to $128 billion in AUM. Bitcoin ETFs got to $107 billion in one year only.

Coins like XRP and WIF serve as prime examples of these high-growth tokens, which transitioned from under a $1 value to remarkable expansion throughout 2024. With 2025 on the horizon and brimming with optimistic potential, we've pinpointed some leading crypto coins that could follow a similar growth trajectory in Q1. Among these tokens are Tron (TRX), Stellar (XLM), and Lunex Network (LNEX) . But what makes these coins stand out? Tron (TRX) Set to Build on Current Bullish Trends Tron has entered the new year riding a wave of positive momentum. To provide some context, Tron's price surged by over 22% in December, holding strong above the $0.25 threshold. According to CoinMarketCap , Tron saw a 136% increase in value throughout 2024, with 64% of that growth occurring in the fourth quarter. This bullish momentum has lifted Tron into the top 10 cryptocurrencies, boasting a market cap exceeding $21.8 billion. After reaching an all-time high of $0.4407 in early December, Andrew Griffiths, analyzing the Tron price chart on X, observed that Tron's price is trending within a descending channel on the one-hour timeframe. A rebound could lead to a positive shift, with Andrew's target around $0.26. Coincodex concurs, predicting that Tron's price will likely reach $0.26 in the near future. Stellar (XLM) May Be on the Verge of a Bullish Surge Recently, Stellar has experienced a correction phase, with its value dropping over 28% in the past month, as reported by market stats . This follows a period of over 500% growth from November to December, during which the token reached a yearly high of $0.56. Despite this downturn, Stellar has managed to hold support above $0.30. Crypto analyst JavonTM1 notes that Stellar is nearing a convergence point, likely sparking another bullish wave in the coming weeks. The growing DEX volume, averaging an 80% increase recently, may also steer the token towards a bullish trend. More than 20 vital market indicators are signaling buy, and the altcoin is trading above the 50-day and 200-day SMA . Although current sentiment remains neutral, the surge in market activity could drive the price to $0.63, a short-term target set by Coincodex experts. This positions Stellar as a key crypto to watch in Q1. Anticipated Launch of Lunex Network (LNEX) as Presale Momentum Builds The launch of Lunex Network (LNEX) is expected before Q1 ends, unveiling its full potential. The ongoing presale is a chance for investors to become early adopters. To date, over 2.4 billion LNEX tokens have been sold, raising more than $6M in cryptocurrency ICO funding. This figure is projected to surpass $10M by the presale's close. With its distinctive use case and growth potential, the Lunex Network project is anticipated to increase by 100x before launch. Priced at $0.0054, this is the ideal time for investors to acquire the token. Early investors have already realized over 350% ROI in just a few weeks. Similar to BNB, the Lunex Network token LNEX offers substantial utility in the DeFi exchange. Beyond serving as listing fees in the Lunex Network trading exchange, holders benefit from transaction fee discounts and a profit-sharing model rewarding active LNEX holders with additional tokens. Investors can also stake the token for as little as 30 days to earn significant APY returns. In essence, the Lunex project operates as a DeFi protocol enabling fast, secure, and non-custodial cross-chain asset transfers. The mobile exchange provides access to over 50k crypto pairs, paving the way for numerous trading opportunities that could enhance user profits. Overall, Lunex Network is a standout DeFi coin not to overlook in Q1. Which Crypto Project Should Capture Investors' Attention? Both Tron and Stellar present high-potential opportunities, especially given their recent value gains. Meanwhile, Lunex Network offers an attractive investment alternative, allowing investors to earn profits even during its presale. With pioneering features like a portfolio tracker and a merchant payment gateway, the trading exchange's adoption is set to rise, likely propelling the LNEX price above $1 sooner than expected.

Although the Stellar market sentiment is neutral, the booming market activity is likely to propel the price towards $0.63, which Coincodex experts forecasted for the short term. This makes it one of the top crypto coins to watch out for in Q1. The Launch of Lunex Network (LNEX) Draws Closer Amid Surging Presale Momentum Before the end of Q1, Lunex Network (LNEX) will be launched, and its true potential will be revealed. The ongoing presale offers investors an opportunity to be early adopters of the project.

Chainlink or Remittix,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/which-one-of-these-should-you-invest-for-500-gains-in-january-chainlink-or-remittix,"Investors are looking for their next opportunity as the start of 2025 is expected to be very promising for the crypto market. Chainlink (LINK) is among the best cryptos among the more spoken names. Even market analysts like Captain Faibik have made a bold price prediction. Meanwhile, an emerging token named Remittix (RTX) is also gaining mass appeal. Remittix will disrupt the cross-border payments market, which Mordor Intelligence predicts could be worth $295B by 2029. Many investors are gravitating towards this rising presale star, which has already rewarded early buyers with a 36% return. They believe it may have higher upside potential in 2025, with numbers like 500% being mentioned. Captain Faibik: The Price of Chainlink (LINK) Could Reach $200 Chainlink (LINK) is one of the top crypto coins, but it has recently seen some red price charts. According to CoinMarketCap , its value has fallen from around $30 to below $20 in the past 30 days. In other words, the Chainlink price fell over 30% in just a few short weeks. But the community is still excited about Chainlink (LINK), thanks to bullish statements by market analysts like Captain Faibik. In his recent X post , he said this altcoin will reach $200 in this bull run. The technical analysis supports this Chainlink price prediction. TradingView data shows this crypto coin is valued above its 100-day EMA ($18). Additionally, its momentum indicator of -3.369 is in the buy zone and suggests an uptrend potentially coming for the Chainlink coin. Remittix (RTX) Seen as a New Contender With Massive Upside Potential While Chainlink (LINK) is experiencing some volatility right now, Remittix (RTX) is creating a lot of positive buzz. This is because of its great performance in the crypto ICO event. Notably, Remittix has seen seven price increases and raised over $2.8M in just three weeks. Early investors in this project are already 36% richer, and more price spikes are coming. Hype for Remittix is growing fast as it could dominate the cross-border payments market. Unlike Stripe or Wise, Remittix will launch a crypto-to-fiat platform that lets users convert 40 cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies like YEN or EUR. Afterward, they can be sent to any global bank account at a flat fee with no hidden costs for FX or wires. Plus, the Remittix Pay API will allow businesses to accept crypto payments, benefiting all parties involved. Those interested now buy its native token, RTX, at a discount. To incentivize purchases, Remittix will give all RTX holders governance voting rights and staking rewards. Currently, one RTX costs just $0.0207, but the next block of tokens will cost $0.0217. With the recent CoinMarketCap listing of this altcoin, demand for RTX is bound to increase. This factor, plus a projected top-tier crypto exchange listing, could trigger a massive rally for RTX soon. Chainlink (LINK) vs. Remittix (RTX) – Which Crypto Coin Could Surge First? Chainlink (LINK) and Remittix (RTX) are the altcoins to watch this quarter, as they could both see big price gains. However, Remittix stands out as it will have a smaller market cap than LINK, which means it will need less money for its price to grow. Additionally, its groundbreaking technology could make it a fan-favorite for millions of individuals in unbanked regions. Therefore, its long-term growth potential could also be better. Because of all these factors, many investors are turning to RTX as the best cryptocurrency to buy now for potential 500% gains.

Chainlink or Remittix,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/which-investment-could-yield-500-returns-in-january-chainlink-or-remittix,"As 2025 approaches, the crypto market is expected to offer exciting opportunities for investors. Chainlink (LINK) is one of the standout cryptocurrencies that has garnered significant attention. Even prominent market analysts like Captain Faibik have ventured bold predictions for its price. On the other hand, a new player called Remittix (RTX) is rapidly gaining popularity. This token is set to revolutionize the cross-border payments sector, a market that Mordor Intelligence forecasts could reach $295B by 2029. Many investors are flocking to this promising presale star, which has already delivered a 36% return to early adopters. They speculate it might offer even greater potential gains in 2025, with figures like 500% being suggested. Captain Faibik: Predicts Chainlink's (LINK) Price May Hit $200 Chainlink (LINK) remains a leading cryptocurrency, despite experiencing a downturn in recent price trends. According to CoinMarketCap , its value has dropped from approximately $30 to under $20 in the last month. In summary, Chainlink's price has decreased by more than 30% in just a few weeks. Nonetheless, the Chainlink (LINK) community remains optimistic due to the bullish outlook from analysts like Captain Faibik. In a recent X post , he predicted that this altcoin could soar to $200 during the current bull market. Technical analysis backs this Chainlink price forecast. Data from TradingView reveals that this digital asset is trading above its 100-day EMA ($18). Also, its momentum indicator at -3.369 suggests it is in the buy zone, hinting at a potential upward trend for Chainlink. Remittix (RTX): A Rising Star With Tremendous Growth Potential While Chainlink (LINK) faces some turbulence, Remittix (RTX) is generating significant excitement. Its impressive performance during the crypto ICO event has attracted attention. Remarkably, Remittix has experienced seven price hikes and raised more than $2.8M within just three weeks. Early backers of this venture have already seen a 36% increase in value, with further price surges anticipated. The buzz around Remittix is rapidly intensifying as it aims to lead the cross-border payments industry. Unlike services like Stripe or Wise, Remittix is set to introduce a crypto-to-fiat platform that enables the conversion of 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies such as YEN or EUR. These can then be transferred to any international bank account with a flat fee, avoiding hidden FX or transfer charges. Additionally, the Remittix Pay API will allow businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments, benefiting all users. Potential investors can acquire its native token, RTX, at a discounted rate. Remittix encourages buying by offering RTX holders governance voting rights and staking rewards. Currently, RTX is priced at $0.0207, but the cost for the next batch of tokens will rise to $0.0217. With its recent listing on CoinMarketCap, the demand for RTX is expected to grow. This, combined with an anticipated listing on a major crypto exchange, could spark a significant rally for RTX soon. Chainlink (LINK) and Remittix (RTX): Which Crypto Might Surge First? Chainlink (LINK) and Remittix (RTX) are two altcoins to watch this quarter, both holding the potential for substantial price increases. However, Remittix stands out due to its smaller market cap compared to LINK, meaning it requires less capital to drive its price upward. Moreover, its innovative technology could make it particularly appealing to millions in underserved regions. Consequently, its prospects for long-term growth might be superior. Considering these aspects, numerous investors are viewing RTX as the top cryptocurrency to invest in now for potential 500% returns.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/only-five-whales-hold-565-trillion-shib-heres-the-significance/,"The distribution of Shiba Inu tokens has come under scrutiny as five whale addresses now collectively hold 57% of the total supply, amounting to 565 trillion SHIB. This significant concentration of assets within a small number of wallets raises questions about potential market volatility and the implications for token decentralization. Among these wallets, one address alone accounts for 41.7% of the entire SHIB supply, highlighting a clear disparity between high-activity and low-activity holders. Such centralization could amplify market risks, particularly in the event of abrupt movements by these large holders. As a result, tracking the activity of these wallets is crucial for anticipating short-term price fluctuations and understanding broader market trends. SHIB On-chain Data Highlights Key Trends Recent on-chain data further sheds light on current dynamics. Over the past week, outflows from large holders have decreased by 31%, signaling reduced selling pressure from whales. This decline may contribute to greater price stability in the short term. On the other hand, inflows into large wallets have risen by 53%, suggesting that prominent investors are accumulating the token at lower price levels. From a technical perspective, the token’s price is above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) support level at around $0.00002079. If the price continues to hold above this critical threshold, this move could signal a potential shift in market sentiment. However, caution is still advised, as sustained upward momentum would require SHIB to break above resistance levels near $0.00002250 and $0.00002325. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Strategic Investor Accumulation Offers Hope The recent accumulation trends hint at growing interest from strategic investors seeking to capitalize on lower prices. Resistance levels at $0.00002250 and $0.00002325 remain key hurdles for the bulls, and breaking above these thresholds would be necessary to shift market sentiment in a positive direction. The centralization of SHIB holdings in a few wallets poses unique challenges for market stability. Large-scale transactions by these whales have the potential to significantly impact prices, underscoring the importance of monitoring their activity. As the token navigates its current support levels, market participants should approach cautiously, considering the heightened risk of volatility stemming from the concentration of assets. The coming days will likely be vital for the asset’s price trajectory. A sustained defense of the $0.00002079 support level and continued accumulation by larger players could lay the groundwork for a price rebound. However, the reliance on a small number of investors leaves the market vulnerable to sudden shifts, emphasizing the need for vigilance among traders and stakeholders. By closely observing wallet activity and technical indicators, market participants can better prepare for the potential outcomes of this concentrated asset distribution.

Trump’s Crypto Law (TRUMPLAW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPLAW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Crypto Law can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Crypto Law could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Crypto Law launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Crypto Law on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Crypto Law by entering its contract address – 7mYansF38wyaSvnj7C1Gr536FdMbGA4ufqY7PwzC7CxM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPLAW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|REGULATION|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-16 00:38:14

This perspective aligns with technical analysis of its previous price actions, which suggest an imminent shift in market dynamics. While PEPE has captured attention for its inherent volatility, a new AI altcoin, PropiChain (PCHAIN) , is making waves by redefining the crypto space with its innovative approach to real estate investment. Projections indicate that a PEPE price surge could act as a catalyst, triggering an impressive 15,000x growth for PCHAIN. Whale Moves and Market Shifts: Can PEPE Price Rebound Amid Rising FUD? Last year, the PEPE price reached an all-time high of $0.000028 on December 9, 2024, boasting a market cap of $7.20 billion. Currently priced at $0.00001670, the PEPE price bearish trend persists as it struggles to hold critical support levels. Over the past three months, the network activity has plummeted by 95.52%, signaling declining investor confidence and rising FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). However, the story isn’t entirely bleak. Whales are stepping in as key players, offering a glimmer of hope for the PEPE price recovery. In the past 24 hours alone, two significant whale purchases have infused over $8.72 million into PEPE, reinforcing its potential for a reversal. While the token remains vulnerable to further dips, bullish divergence in RSI and whale support could drive a rebound. The PEPE price uncertain trajectory for investors starkly contrasts PropiChain (PCHAIN), an upcoming AI altcoin offering tangible utility and a promising 15,000x growth potential. PropiChain (PCHAIN) Revolutionalizes Real Estate Investing With its AI Altcoin In contrast to speculative memecoins like PEPE, PropiChain (PCHAIN) offers tangible utility by integrating blockchain technology with the real estate market. PropiChain tokenizes real estate assets, allowing investors to purchase fractional ownership through digital tokens. PropiChain’s key feature is that it enables the tokenization of real estate assets into NFTs, simplifying ownership and trading. These digital assets allow users to purchase fractional shares of high-value properties, democratizing access to an industry traditionally dominated by high-net-worth individuals. AI plays a pivotal role in PropiChain’s operations, offering predictive market analysis, real-time property valuations, and automated transaction execution. With its AI tools, PropiChain enables users to identify the best investment opportunities, automate complex processes, and optimize returns. For instance, the platform’s predictive analytics empower investors to anticipate market shifts, while smart contracts , audited by BlockAudit, provide smooth and tamper-proof transactions, from leasing agreements to monthly rental payments. PropiChain also uses the immersive potential of the metaverse. Through its “Propiverse,” users can virtually explore properties in 3D, providing an interactive and comprehensive understanding of assets without needing physical visits. Security is another cornerstone of PropiChain. Each transaction is recorded on the blockchain via its “Title Contract,” ensuring transparency and mitigating risks like fraud or mismanagement. By eliminating intermediaries such as brokers and reducing dependency on traditional systems, PropiChain significantly lowers transaction costs and accelerates processes. The Golden Opportunity of the PCHAIN AI Altcoin Presale PropiChain’s presale is attracting significant attention from crypto enthusiasts eager to capitalize on this groundbreaking project. Currently priced at just $0.011 per AI-powered altcoin, early investors seize a rare opportunity to secure their position before prices escalate. With the third stage of the presale set to raise the price to $0.023 and an anticipated final listing price of $0.032, participants in this initial phase could enjoy an impressive ROI of up to 800%. Projections for PCHAIN are nothing short of extraordinary, with some analysts forecasting returns as high as 15,000x. Savvy investors recognize this as a pivotal moment to enter what could become one of the most lucrative AI altcoin opportunities of 2025. Beyond its speculative potential, PCHAIN is a gateway to revolutionary real estate investments, enabling users to purchase property NFTs, access DeFi applications, and use cutting-edge AI analytics. Currently listed on CoinMarketCap , early adopters also stand to gain additional benefits, including frequent airdrops, staking rewards of up to 225%, and the ability to use PCHAIN as loan collateral, making this a multi-functional asset with long-term value. While bullish forecasts suggest a possible rebound in the PEPE price, analysts predict a significant ripple effect that could amplify PCHAIN’s trajectory, potentially driving its value by over 15,000x. For investors seeking high-growth opportunities, this presale offers an unparalleled entry point.

This article looks into four best performing cryptos, offering traders well-informed insights to tailor their investment strategies effectively. Web3Bay, Chainlink, Filecoin, and Stacks each bring unique benefits that could make them prime candidates for substantial portfolio impacts. 1. Web3Bay: Lead the E-Commerce Evolution with 6430% ROI! Leading the charge, Web3Bay revolutionizes online shopping by harnessing layer-1 blockchain technology to enhance transparency and efficiency. Its platform is fortified with smart contracts that manage transactions, governance, and staking—each audited rigorously to minimize security risks and protect user assets. Integration with major crypto wallets like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and WalletConnect allows seamless asset management and reward generation directly from the platform, coupled with decentralized storage to safeguard user data against single-point failures. Currently priced at a mere $0.$0.0039675 in its third presale stage, the 3BAY token has already accumulated over $700,000 in sales. With an anticipated launch price of $0.1959, early adopters could potentially realize a 6430% ROI, positioning Web3Bay as one of the best performing cryptos for 2025. 2. Chainlink: Facilitating Real-World Connectivity for Blockchain Applications Chainlink continues to bridge the gap between blockchain smart contracts and real-world data, serving critical sectors like finance and supply chain management. With the introduction of its staking mechanism in 2022, LINK holders now play a pivotal role in securing the network, with ongoing enhancements aimed to bolster these capabilities through 2025. Chainlink’s strategic collaborations, including partnerships with Google Cloud and SWIFT, underscore its vital role in the blockchain infrastructure landscape. The platform’s consistent expansion and reliability make it a top Web3 crypto pick, poised for continued growth. 3. Stacks: Expanding Bitcoin’s Capabilities Stacks enriches the Bitcoin ecosystem by integrating smart contracts and decentralized applications, enabling developers to innovate on Bitcoin’s secure network without altering its foundational attributes. Looking ahead to 2025, Stacks is focused on scaling its platform and enhancing developer engagement. Its unique position as a bridge between Bitcoin and advanced blockchain functionalities opens new avenues for development and growth within the Web3 space. 4. Filecoin: Setting New Standards in Data Storage Filecoin is at the forefront of decentralizing data storage, offering secure and cost-effective solutions that allow users to monetize unused storage space. As concerns over data privacy mount, Filecoin’s model is increasingly relevant, providing a decentralized alternative that integrates seamlessly with burgeoning Web3 projects. With its innovative approach and alignment with current trends, Filecoin is poised to be a central player in the decentralized infrastructure, making it a key investment target for forward-thinking crypto enthusiasts. Wrapping Up These four best performing cryptos are not just participating in the Web3 revolution—they are actively shaping its future. Chainlink’s role in seamlessly connecting blockchains with external data, Filecoin’s innovative approach to data storage, and Stacks’ expansion of Bitcoin’s functionality illustrate the dynamic evolution of the crypto landscape. Above all, Web3Bay exemplifies the potential of smart contracts and decentralized systems in transforming e-commerce, offering users unprecedented control and security. With a launch price that hints at significant returns, the 3BAY token is an enticing prospect for investors seeking both innovation and profitability in 2025.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 308,500 followers on the social media platform X that DeFi lending platform Aave ( AAVE ) is flashing multiple bullish signs on the eight-hour chart. “AAVE [is] one of my favorite looking alts here, clear ABC down on the eight-hour chart, clear five waves within the C wave AND a cracking eight-hour bullish divergence brewing. T1 (tier-one) setup in my opinion.” Source: Bluntz/X Bluntz follows the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to witness a five-wave surge after completing an ABC correction. Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that AAVE has completed the ABC retracement with a bullish divergence to support his stance on a potential reversal. A bullish divergence is typically viewed as a reversal signal as it indicates that an asset’s momentum is rising even though its price is dropping or trading sideways. Bluntz seems to predict that AAVE will soar as high as $460 for the next leg up, a potential upside of about 56%. Looking at AAVE/BTC, Bluntz says the pair is also flashing a similar setup, suggesting that the coin is gearing up to outperform Bitcoin. “AAVE/BTC also looks identical, with a nice high time frame eight-hour bullish divergence.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, AAVE/BTC is trading for 0.003034 BTC worth $294.71.

Investors are closely watching this level, as holding it as support could signify a strong foundation for ADA to challenge higher resistance zones. Cardano Finds Strength To Rise After a recent sharp drop, Cardano (ADA) is showing resilience, finding the strength to rise and eyeing a push above last year’s high of $1.32. This recovery has sparked optimism among analysts and investors, many of whom are calling for a significant rally. Cardano is increasingly viewed as a strong contender to become a market leader, driven by its robust development ecosystem and expanding use cases. Top analyst Ali Martinez has shared compelling data highlighting growing interest from smart money investors. Posting on X, Martinez revealed a chart showing that whales have accumulated 100 million ADA over the past 48 hours. This substantial purchase underscores confidence among large holders that current price levels present a valuable buying opportunity, setting the stage for further upward momentum. This surge in whale activity aligns with broader expectations for Cardano to capitalize on its technological advantages and potential as a leader in the blockchain space. The cryptocurrency’s ability to attract significant capital from institutional and high-net-worth investors reinforces its potential to outperform in the coming months.

Successfully breaking this level would likely trigger a substantial rally, potentially propelling ADA into a new bullish phase. The coming days will be pivotal in determining whether Cardano can sustain this momentum and fulfill its promise of becoming a market frontrunner. ADA Bulls Eye Key Levels Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $1 after briefly reaching $1.05 earlier in the session. The price is consolidating and seeking support at the psychologically significant $1 level. If this key support holds, the next target for ADA is $1.15, a resistance level that could open the doors to further gains. Market sentiment around ADA remains cautiously optimistic. As a result, holding the $1 mark would signal strong demand and set the stage for a potential surge as bullish momentum builds. A breakout above $1.15 could lead to an extended rally, potentially revisiting previous highs and entering a new bullish phase. However, losing the $1 support would suggest that demand is faltering. In this scenario, ADA could see a drop to its next major support level around $0.91, putting additional pressure on bulls to regain control.

Therefore, traders and investors are closely watching for signs of strength or weakness that could dictate the altcoin’s short-term trajectory. Whether Cardano can maintain its footing above $1 will determine whether the recent recovery evolves into a sustained rally or another period of consolidation.

Concurrently, Tron trends suggest an approaching downturn, highlighted by a 45% drop from its 2024 peak. Amid these fluctuations, BlockDAG (BDAG) is launching pivotal updates that are capturing widespread attention. Its presale has successfully amassed $180.5 million, as it prepares for imminent listings on ten secondary exchanges. Furthermore, BlockDAG’s advanced Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain and its dynamic “Affiliate Program” offering up to 10% USDT cashback are solidifying its reputation among the upcoming popular crypto coins for 2025. Sui Foundation Drives Growth in Its DeFi Ecosystem In an extraordinary fourth quarter of 2024, the Sui Foundation documented a surge in growth and strategic initiatives. Sui’s ecosystem saw its TVL reach a new high of $1.8 billion, with the total trading volume escalating to $44.3 billion—a notable 444.79% rise from the previous quarter. This growth of the Sui foundation has been propelled by the introduction of stablecoins and sophisticated protocols such as DeepBook and Suilend. Strategic partnerships, like those with SatLayer and Babylon Labs, which incorporated Bitcoin liquidity, have further broadened Sui’s ecosystem. These developments underscore the Sui Foundation’s crucial influence in crafting a resilient and expanding DeFi network. Tron Trends Point to Decline as TRX Plummets 45% Tron’s (TRX) trends are nearing a pivotal threshold as it faces a significant 45% decline from its peak in 2024. Despite surpassing Ethereum with a $2.19 billion blockchain revenue last year, TRX is struggling to uphold its growth momentum. Presently at a decisive point, Tron trends hint at a likely reevaluation of its long-term support level around $0.20. Bearish indicators from technical analysis tools like the RSI and MACD amplify the uncertainty, making Tron’s upcoming moves critical for its market standing. BlockDAG Readies for Major Exchange Listings BlockDAG is gearing up to transform its presence in the cryptocurrency market with upcoming listings on 10 tier-two and tier-three exchanges, enhancing its visibility and liquidity. This strategic expansion is intended to make BDAG a recognizable name among global crypto enthusiasts. The company is integrating its cutting-edge Proof-of-Work blockchain to build a scalable, decentralized financial system, with exchange listings already secured in preparation for its 2025 Mainnet launch. The addition of the BlockDAG Affiliate Program offers up to 10% USDT cashback for referrals and a steady 6% back on purchases, promoting community involvement and turning social networks into profitable platforms. The program resets rewards daily at 00:00 UTC, motivating users to maximize their earnings and boosting excitement within the BDAG community. BlockDAG’s market initiatives have led to a highly successful presale, with revenues exceeding $180.5 million and over 17.8 billion coins sold. With the price of BDAG at only $0.0248 in its latest batch and an impressive 2,380% ROI since its inception, buyers are eager to capitalize on these gains before further listings potentially elevate prices. Projections place BDAG’s value at $1 within the year, positioning it among the most sought-after crypto coins. Its community-driven Affiliate Program, combined with strategic exchange listings, underscores its commitment to sustained growth and broad accessibility, providing substantial returns and advantages for early adopters. Highlighting the Most Popular Crypto Coins The Sui Foundation’s significant DeFi achievements underscore its leadership in nurturing a robust ecosystem. Meanwhile, Tron’s (TRX) position as a top revenue generator, despite current market challenges, emphasizes the need for strategic market navigation. BlockDAG’s robust presale outcomes and its compelling Affiliate program, rewarding up to 10% USDT cashback, have established it as one of the popular crypto coins to watch in 2025. As it gears up for more exchange listings, the ongoing interest from traders and developers signifies a bright future for BlockDAG in the competitive cryptocurrency landscape.

This would position our state at the… pic.twitter.com/dRdCt86Otr — Charles Schwertner (@DrSchwertner) January 15, 2025 Texas is pushing to lead Bitcoin adoption Senator Charles Schwertner emphasizes that Texas should lead in adopting Bitcoin. This proposal could allow the state to collect taxes, fees, and donations in BTC. With President-elect Trump’s inauguration just a week away, Republican state leaders will relentlessly try to adopt BTC as a strategic reserve asset—at least at the state level, if not as a national reserve. Texas has the second-largest economy in the U.S. and the eighth-largest globally. It also has the highest concentration of Bitcoin miners in the country. The call for a national strategic Bitcoin reserve – one of President-elect Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly campaign promises – has grown stronger since the election. Bitcoin has risen by more than 45% as optimistic investors bet that establishing such a reserve will further boost its price. U.S. states and countries are actively exploring Bitcoin reserves as a market catalyst While there is some skepticism about whether the U.S. will establish a Bitcoin reserve or if it does, whether it will be the first, the mere prospect of it could act as a positive market catalyst in the new year. This could prompt other nations to create their own reserves, even if the U.S. does not follow through. Several states are eager to take the lead in this new area. Oklahoma Representative Cody Maynard introduced House Bill 1203, dubbed the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act. The bill proposes allocating some of the state’s pension funds and savings accounts to Bitcoin. At the end of last year, Pennsylvania lawmakers proposed that the state Treasury invest up to 10% of its assets in Bitcoin. Representative Mike Cabell emphasized that Pennsylvania could follow private asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity. On January 10, North Dakota and New Hampshire also introduced their own Bitcoin reserve bills. New Hampshire’s legislation uses broader terminology, like “ digital assets, ” which indicates a potential interest in cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin.

On Jan. 15, 2025, asset management company VanEck filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the “Onchain Economy” exchange-traded fund. Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of digital assets research, disclosed the filing in a now-deleted social media post, revealing the company’s ambitious plans to invest in the rapidly growing digital transformation sector. Deleted a post on an ETF filing. Details coming soon — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) January 15, 2025 The proposed ETF aims to allocate at least 80% of its assets to businesses and products within the digital asset ecosystem. These include software developers, mining firms, cryptocurrency exchanges, infrastructure providers, payment firms, and other crypto-focused companies collectively referred to as “Digital Transformation Companies.” VanEck outlined a strategic selection process for these investments, emphasizing fundamental research, market trends, valuation, and each company’s role in the broader digital asset ecosystem. While the fund will not directly hold cryptocurrencies, it plans to invest in digital asset products such as commodity futures contracts. VanEck’s application is part of a broader wave of activity in the ETF market, driven by speculation that the regulatory environment may become more favorable for cryptocurrencies under President Donald Trump’s administration. Bitwise Asset Management applied in November 2024 for its 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF, which tracks leading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and Solana ( SOL ).

The value of the recovered assets has appreciated by 16,618.31% to $11.97 billion from $72 million at the time of the hack. As crypto investors prepare for an eventful year under Trump’s incoming administration, the U.S. government has given a glimmer of hope to victims who lost their Bitcoin holdings in August 2016 from a hack on the Bitfinex crypto exchange. The U.S. government announced that the funds seized from the hack’s recovery operation should be reimbursed to victims through “in-kind” restitution. U.S. court rules that funds from Bitfinex hack must be returned to the exchange As expected *GOVT SAYS SEIZED BITCOIN FROM 2016 BITFINEX HACK SHOULD BE RETURNED IN-KIND Do they just ask Paolo for the addy? https://t.co/8iwx6J1XR6 pic.twitter.com/ndNd1UrdWG — db (@tier10k) January 15, 2025 According to an official document circulating online, a US court ordered that the US government should return the funds seized from the Bitfinex crypto hack back to the exchange. The court also ordered the U.S. government to notify all victims of the hack. The court also ruled that the government should post a link on the Department of Justice website directing potential victims to the case’s specific website where all vital information will be relayed. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia filed a legal motion in October last year where it identified the Bitfinex crypto exchange as the only entity eligible for restitution after the hack. The hack resulted in the loss of 120,000 Bitcoin worth $72 million at the time meaning that each Bitcoin was valued at around $600. The digital assets were recovered and have been in the custody of the government since then. A 2023 report from Chainalysis revealed that FBI, IRS Criminal Investigation, Homeland Security Investigations, and other government agencies initially recovered over 94,000 BTC. Further recovery efforts ran till June 2023 and brought the recovered assets to 108,068 Bitcoin. The recovered digital assets are worth $11.87 billion in today’s Bitcoin prices. This makes asset recovery rank among the top most valuable crypto recoveries in history. The victims literally made 16,618.31% if the government executed the reimbursement process. The U.S. government arrests charges and sentences Bitfinex hack perpetrators The U.S. government arrested and charged two individuals, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Rhiannon Morgan, on counts of money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to defraud the United States as part of the charges related to the 2016 Bitfinex attack. On November 14th, 2024, Ilya Lichtenstein was sentenced to five years in prison for participating in a money laundering conspiracy arising from the hack and theft of approximately 120,000 bitcoins from Bitfinex, a global cryptocurrency exchange. On the other hand, his accomplice and wife Morgan was sentenced to 18 months for helping her husband launder the stolen funds. U.S. Government linked address compromised for $20 million While in government custody, on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence showed something fishy happened. In October last year, about $20 million in digital assets that were believed to be the proceeds of the Bitfinex hack were moved from the government-controlled wallet in what appeared to be suspicious activity. The funds were moved into a relatively new wallet at the time that was five days old. From there, the wallet owners moved the stolen funds through various blockchain accounts in what seemed like an attempt to conceal the funds’ source. Some funds found their way into instant exchanges that derive their liquidity from Binance and are typically used for money laundering activities. The incident was not officially reported and the reason for the transactions remained unknown. The event occurred in 24 hours and the majority of the funds were returned to the government-controlled wallet. Theories suggest that the incident originated from compromised keys following the speed at which the recovery process was accomplished.

Social Media Is Now Bullish On Dogecoin, Solana, & Cardano In a new post on X, the analytics firm Santiment has discussed what sentiment the traders on social media currently hold toward the various top assets in the cryptocurrency sector. The metric of relevance here is the “Positive/Negative Sentiment,” which, as its name suggests, tells us about how the bullish and bearish sentiments related to a given asset compare on the major social media platforms. Related Reading: Massive Dogecoin Rally Incoming? Experts Point To Over 1,000% Upside This indicator works by putting the posts/comments/messages present on the platforms through a machine-learning model to separate between positive and negative ones. It then takes the ratio of these counts to calculate the net situation around the coin. When the Positive/Negative Sentiment has a value greater than zero, it means the bullish posts outweigh the negative ones. On the other hand, it being under the mark implies the investors as a whole share a negative sentiment. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the indicator for six top coins: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA): As displayed in the above graph, the Positive/Negative Sentiment has witnessed an increase for Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano recently, suggesting the sentiment around the assets has improved. Out of these, traders are the most positive toward SOL, with its bullish comments being around six times the bearish ones. The metric has a value of around 3 for ADA and 2 for DOGE. The improvement in sentiment for Dogecoin and others has come after a sector-wide rebound in prices. Interestingly, while the bullish wave has made investors more optimistic about these coins, it has failed to do so in the case of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, the top three cryptocurrencies by market cap. The indicator is sitting close to the neutral zero level for these assets, which implies there are about as many positive posts as negative ones. This fact, however, may not actually be bad for BTC and the crypto market. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Fun Will Begin When This Flip Happens Historically, digital assets have tended to show moves in a direction that’s opposite to the expectations of the majority. This means that an overly bullish crowd can lead to tops, while an extremely bearish one can result in bottoms. Thus, the hype around Dogecoin, Solana, and Cardano may act to the detriment of their prices, while Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP could have bullish room to run before they reach a top. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.352, up more than 2% over the past week.

While meme coins wobble under market pressures, 1FUEL is charging forward. Its presale has already raised $1.3 million, with early adopters seeing prices jump from $0.01 to $0.017 and there’s still a 20% bonus for those getting in now. If you’re hunting for the next big thing, 1FUEL’s mix of privacy, utility, and innovation might just be it. Read on to find out more! Pudgy Penguins and PENGU: Can this bird fly higher? PENGU, the cryptocurrency tied to the adorable yet wildly popular Pudgy Penguins NFTs, is back in focus. Its recent rally above $0.032 was no fluke, breaking out of a falling wedge pattern has put it in the bull’s crosshairs. Still, the numbers tell a complicated story. A $1.9 billion market cap and $328 million in daily trades showcase its market heft, yet the token is still 55% down from its ATH of $0.06845. That drop, combined with a 10% slide over the last two weeks, reveals the fragility of its recovery. Investors eyeing this project are asking a tough question—can PENGU truly rise, or are we looking at another false dawn? Is Dogwifhat losing its bark? Dogwifhat once led the pack in meme coin mania, roaring past expectations with social media hype and massive exchange listings. Today, though, WIF’s bark has quieted. Trading between $1.39 and $1.86 , WIF is testing a crucial support level. Falling 68% from its $4.83 ATH, it’s simply a shadow of its former self. The 40% drop over the past month is more than market turbulence. A strengthening US Dollar and tighter monetary policies have clipped WIF’s wings. While WIF’s $1.5 billion market cap and $240 million trading volume remain impressive, they mask the real story: volatility. WIF’s wild swings attract thrill-seekers but spook long-term backers. Analysts aren’t ready to write it off, though—if WIF stabilizes, it could stage a comeback. But for now, WIF’s path forward looks as unpredictable as its rise to fame once did. What’s making 1FUEL the best cryptocurrency to buy right now? At 1FUEL’s core is a revolutionary cryptocurrency wallet, designed not just for storage but as a gateway to secure, cross-chain transactions and unmatched privacy. It is built for the complexities of today’s multi-chain world. With cold storage, a built-in mixer, and intuitive design, it’s a leap forward. The dev team is laying the groundwork for P2P trading, creating a network effect where every new user enhances the ecosystem. And for those who crave passive income, staking rewards of up to 30% APR are on the table. With virtual debit cards also in the pipeline, 1FUEL’s promising to merge crypto with real-world spending in ways that feel natural. Presale stages 1 and 2 sold out at lightning speed, raising over $1.3 million. Prices have already climbed 70% to $0.017, and analysts predict this is just the beginning. Unlike PENGU and WIF, which hinge on trend cycles, 1FUEL is the best cryptocurrency to buy right now for its practical applications and room to grow. The bottom line Meme coins like PENGU and WIF may thrive on chaos, but 1FUEL is building a foundation for the long haul. Early backers are already seeing gains, and with a presale price of just $0.017 and a 20% bonus still on the table, the window for getting in early is closing fast. The market is already responding, but the best gains might still be ahead.

While these tokens have enjoyed viral success, emerging platforms like Lightchain AI are redefining what it means to build value in the crypto space. With a focus on utility and long-term growth, Lightchain AI’s momentum could spell trouble for speculative tokens reliant on social hype. Limitations of Dogecoin and Pepe Coin Dogecoin and Pepe Coin, both well-known joke coins, have clear limits. Dogecoin’s endless supply can cause inflation which may lessen value with time. Its dependence on social media and famous people ͏makes it weak to changing market feelings causing price ups and downs. Also, Dogecoin’s lack of growth with few changes brings worry about its ability to compete. Pepe Coin, though using funny internet images, has no real usefulness, working mostly as a gamble. This lack of true uses leads to big ups and downs and makes it easy to mess with in the market. The unknown group behind its making adds more worry about trust and responsibility. Both digital coins rely on group support and excitement, showing how they are risky to put money in for buyers. Lightchain AI Future of Blockchain Innovation Unlike Dogecoin and Pepe Coin, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a pioneer in blockchain technology, addressing real-world challenges with a forward-thinking approach. Currently in its Stage 12 presale, priced at $0.00525, and having raised over $10.4 million, Lightchain AI has already demonstrated its ability to attract investor confidence. Lightchain AI focuses on creating a scalable and efficient blockchain ecosystem designed to support diverse applications. Its emphasis on decentralization and energy efficiency ensures it can meet the growing demands of industries and developers without compromising sustainability. By targeting meaningful applications and solving critical challenges in the blockchain space, Lightchain AI is building an infrastructure for long-term success, making it a strong contender for future market leadership. What This Means for Meme Tokens The rise of projects like Lightchain AI highlights the market’s shift toward utility-driven platforms that deliver lasting value. While Dogecoin and Pepe Coin may continue to draw attention in the short term, their speculative nature makes them less competitive against innovative solutions with real-world applications. For investors, this signals the importance of diversifying portfolios to include projects like Lightchain AI , which offer both growth potential and practical utility. Plus, with the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the demand for efficient blockchain technology will only continue to grow. As a result, projects like Lightchain AI that prioritize scalability and sustainability are positioned to thrive in this evolving landscape.

Understanding these shifts is crucial for prospective buyers to determine the most promising crypto investments for the upcoming year. SUI’s market cap is rapidly approaching a significant milestone of $16 billion, propelled by recent strategic developments. Simultaneously, Chainlink has registered an impressive 18% increase, largely driven by significant whale purchases. However, BlockDAG (BDAG) is establishing itself with a standout feature of dual compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM), positioning it as a potential leader in the meme coin arena. The platform’s success is underscored by its robust presale performance, with substantial funds raised, indicating strong market confidence. SUI Market Cap: Close to a $16 Billion Achievement The SUI cryptocurrency is rapidly gaining momentum, with its market capitalization approaching a robust $16 billion, making it the 12th largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap. The price of SUI has recently surged to about $5.09, reflecting an 8% increase. This notable rise in value comes in the wake of the unlocking of 82 million SUI coins, which has significantly enhanced the trading volume. Additionally, the network’s open interest has witnessed a substantial 37% rise, climbing to $1.22 billion. This surge in market activity and investor interest underscores the growing confidence in SUI’s potential and its strengthening position in the cryptocurrency market. Chainlink Whales: Indicators of an 18% Increase Chainlink (LINK) has experienced an 18% surge, largely driven by significant purchases from Chainlink whales. These major investors have snapped up over 1.4 million LINK following a price dip to a support level around $19, suggesting a potential rally ahead. This uptick in whale activity underscores LINK’s resilience in a fluctuating market and indicates growing investor confidence. Additionally, a decrease in exchange outflows points to fewer holders selling their LINK, supporting a bullish forecast for Chainlink as it potentially tests higher resistance levels soon. BlockDAG’s Dual Compatibility: A Foundation for Meme Coins BlockDAG (BDAG) is emerging as a top destination for meme coin creation in 2025, swiftly establishing itself as a premier platform in this niche. Its standout feature is the exceptional compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM), which allows developers to utilize robust programming languages like Rust and C++. This dual compatibility not only simplifies the deployment of dApps and smart contracts but also opens doors to scalable, cross-platform applications. As meme coins continue to captivate the crypto community, BlockDAG is positioning itself at the forefront of this trend for 2025. The platform is also attracting significant attention from large buyers. During its 27th crypto presale, BlockDAG has already attracted over $180.5 million, with 17.8 billion coins snapped up by eager buyers. Thanks to its focus on low fees, quick transaction confirmations, and a developer-friendly ecosystem, BlockDAG is drawing both individual and institutional interest. The platform is buzzing with new token creations, games, and decentralized applications tailored for the meme coin market. Now is a pivotal time for traders. The ongoing Batch 27 presale presents a unique chance to get in on the action before prices take off. Currently priced at $0.0248, BlockDAG has delivered an impressive 2380% return since its first batch, positioning it as a must-buy for those looking to capitalize on early gains. With growing excitement within the community and continued assets from whales, the potential for significant returns is clearer than ever. Why BlockDAG is the Prime Crypto Pick for 2025 The evolution of the crypto market in 2025 features significant developments with SUI’s market cap growth and Chainlink’s whale-driven price increase. However, BlockDAG sets itself apart with its unique EVM and WASM compatibility, enhancing developer flexibility and scalability. This positions BlockDAG as a leading platform for meme coin creation, attracting significant stakes and offering promising returns. As such, BlockDAG is poised as the top cryptocurrency to jump in for both seasoned and new buyers in 2025.

Remember when Dogecoin first took off? It wasn’t just a joke; it turned into a legit investment vehicle! The wild ride of meme coins has captured the imagination of millions, from Gen Z to seasoned investors. But with so many options out there, it’s tough to know where to place your bets. If you missed the Pepe Coin wealth train, don’t worry— BTFD Coin is here, and it’s primed to shake things up in the meme coin arena. What makes BTFD Coin stand out in this crowded market? For starters, it’s not just another meme coin riding the coattails of internet humor. BTFD Coin is introducing features that elevate its status: a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , an enticing referral program, and eye-popping staking rewards with a 90% Annual Percentage Yield (APY). Seriously, who wouldn’t want to be part of a project that’s not only fun but also financially rewarding? As the presale heats up, analysts are buzzing about BTFD Coin’s potential to be one of the top new meme coins to invest in now. So, if you’re looking to dive into the crypto world, this could be your golden ticket. Let’s break down what makes BTFD Coin the talk of the town and how it compares to its predecessor, Pepe Coin. BTFD Coin: The Next Big Thing in Meme Coins Let’s kick things off with what BTFD Coin brings to the table. Currently, in its 13th presale stage, BTFD is priced at $0.000142, a jump from its initial presale price of just $0.000004. With over $5.2 million raised and over 64 billion $BTFD coins sold, the enthusiasm is palpable. But it’s not just about numbers; it’s about community and engagement. One of the standout features is the recently launched Play-to-Earn game , which went live on January 1, 2025. Imagine diving into a gaming experience where you can earn tokens while having a blast. It’s not just about holding coins anymore; it’s about actively participating in a fun ecosystem that rewards you for your time. This game isn’t just a gimmick; it’s a real way for users to earn and engage, making it one of the top new meme coins to invest in now. Then there’s the staking program, which kicked off on December 2, offering an astonishing 90% APY. That’s right—90%! This is a game-changer for anyone looking to grow their investment without lifting a finger. Just lock up your coins, sit back, and watch your wealth accumulate. And let’s not overlook the referral program, which incentivizes users to spread the word and earn even more. The more you share, the more you earn—it’s a win-win!

If you invest $10,000 now, you could see significant returns when the coin lists at $0.0006. That’s a potential profit of over $15,000! Who wouldn’t want to jump on that train? Pepe Coin: The Meme Coin Classic Now, let’s take a look at Pepe Coin, which has been a staple in the meme coin universe. Launched to capitalize on the beloved internet meme of the green frog, Pepe Coin quickly gained traction. It captured the hearts of many, much like Dogecoin did, and it became a darling of social media. Its rise was fueled by an enthusiastic community that rallied around the meme culture, but as we know, the crypto landscape is notoriously volatile. While Pepe Coin still has a loyal following, the question remains: has it peaked? Many investors are beginning to wonder if it can sustain its momentum in a market that’s constantly changing. Analysts have mixed feelings. Some believe Pepe Coin will continue to have a place in the meme coin arena, while others suggest that newer coins like BTFD are better bets for the future. Community engagement has been a strong point for Pepe Coin, driven by social media buzz and meme creation. However, as newer coins introduce innovative features, investors may find themselves looking for fresh opportunities. The initial excitement around Pepe Coin was undeniable, but will it be enough to keep investors interested? It’s a gamble, and one that’s led many to explore alternatives like BTFD Coin. In the end, while Pepe Coin has laid the groundwork for meme coins, it’s becoming increasingly clear that the market is shifting. Investors are hungry for new opportunities, and with BTFD Coin’s robust features and active community, it’s hard not to see why many are calling it one of the top new meme coins to invest in now. Conclusion: Seize the Opportunity with BTFD Coin In a world where meme coins continue to rise and fall, BTFD Coin is carving its niche as a compelling investment opportunity. With its innovative features, strong community support, and the buzz surrounding its presale, it’s quickly becoming one of the top new meme coins to invest in now. If you missed the Pepe Coin wealth train, don’t fret; BTFD Coin is ready to take you on a new ride. So, what are you waiting for? Dive into the BTFD Coin presale and make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity. Get involved, spread the word, and watch your investment grow.

The case, originally filed in December 2020, centers on whether Ripple’s sales of XRP to retail investors constitute unregistered securities transactions. US SEC Disagrees with Lower Court’s Ruling on Retail XRP Sales In its appeal brief filed on Wednesday evening, the US SEC stated that the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York made a mistake in the ruling issued in July 2023. The district court had held that Ripple’s programmatic sales of XRP to retail investors through cryptocurrency exchanges did not violate federal securities laws. The SEC claims that every XRP sale, no matter which particular seller has conducted the sale or how the sale was made, constitutes an “investment contract” in terms of the Howey Test. The agency argues that Ripple’s promotion activities gave a perception that investors, including retail buyers, were likely to make profit out of the XRP. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP @Ripple The @SECGov has filed its opening brief. https://t.co/v0YTjHGxzV — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) January 15, 2025 “The district court’s decision that retail buyers could not have reasonably expected gains from Ripple’s efforts because they purchased XRP anonymously through crypto platforms was in error,” the US SEC stated in its brief. It also noted that, representations made by Ripple for promotion of XRP were equally as much available to institutional and retail investors. Ripple Faces Allegations of Boosting XRP Demand In the SEC filing, the agency alleges that Ripple used the sales of XRP to inflate its demand and value in the market. The SEC alleged that Ripple published information regarding the token, on its website, social media, and in the media, with the aim of generating buy orders and, thus, profit expectations among investors. The agency claims that these actions made both institutional and retail investors treat XRP as a security that relies on Ripple’s growth. Further, the SEC also disputed the court’s ruling to exclude XRP received in non-cash transactions including in employee compensation and business incentives from securities laws. Nevertheless, Ripple continues to argue that XRP is a digital currency and not a security, and therefore, the sales of XRP cannot be considered as an investment contract under the law. Amid the ongoing case, defense attorney James K. Filan ealier noted that both Ripple and the SEC had submitted a stipulation regarding the ongoing cross-appeals process. According to Filan, both parties have agreed to file a deferred appendix 21 days after the appellee’s opening brief is served. Ripple CLO Dismisses SEC Arguments Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, called the SEC’s appeal “a rehash of already failed arguments.” In an X post, Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty suggested that the case would likely lose momentum under the next SEC administration as Chair Gary Gensler prepares to step down on January 20, 2025. Moreover, President Trump has nominated Paul Atkins, known for his crypto-friendly stance, to lead the agency. Ripple has argued throughout the case that XRP should not be classified as a security under U.S. law. The company points to the district court’s partial ruling, which stated that programmatic sales of XRP did not meet the Howey Test criteria. The legal battle began in 2020 when the SEC accused Ripple of raising $1.3 billion through unregistered XRP sales. In July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s direct sales to institutional investors violated securities laws but found that programmatic sales and distributions did not. Despite the ongoing Ripple case, XRP’s price has surged recently, reaching $3, for the first time since 2018 amid projections of a rally to $6. This price increase reflects optimism about potential regulatory changes under the incoming SEC leadership.

ETH is rising and facing hurdles near the $3,480 zone. Ethereum started a minor recovery wave above the $3,240 zone. The price is trading above $3,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a short-term contracting triangle with resistance at $3,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it clears the $3,480 resistance level. Ethereum Price Gains Over 5% Ethereum price started a recovery wave above the $3,150 level like Bitcoin . ETH was able to clear the $3,180 and $3,240 resistance levels to move into a short-term positive zone. Besides, there was a break above a short-term contracting triangle with resistance at $3,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair even surged above the $3,350 and $3,400 levels. Finally, it tested the $3,480 zone. A high was formed at $3,473 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,186 swing low to the $3,473 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,450 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,480 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,500. A clear move above the $3,500 resistance might send the price toward the $3,550 resistance. An upside break above the $3,550 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,650 resistance zone or even $3,720 in the near term. Downside Correction In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,480 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,350 level. The first major support sits near the $3,280 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,186 swing low to the $3,473 high. A clear move below the $3,280 support might push the price toward the $3,240 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,120 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,050. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

AVAX’s volume profile range (VPVR), for example, highlights a significant trading cluster between $40 and $42, a critical resistance area where considerable buy and sell orders have historically taken place. On the other hand, the Binance coin has highlighted a series of higher and lower highs. While this trend has found support at the $641 level, the bears have little firepower. Meanwhile, Lunex Network (LNEX) continues to witness massive growth as investors anticipate more rallies in the coming weeks. Designed to enable seamless buying, selling, and swapping of cryptocurrencies across blockchains, the LNEX token has been projected to outshine existing crypto giants in this bull cycle. Lunex Network (LNEX): Transforming Crypto Trading Lunex Network is a next-gen Web3 DeFi crypto exchange designed to enable seamless trading and swapping of cryptos across multiple blockchains at the lowest costs. Unlike conventional exchanges with rigorous KYC requirements, Lunex has eliminated these processes, including third-party DeFi wallet connectivity, like Meta Mask and Trust Wallet, minimizing data breaches and barriers to entry. As the first community-backed crypto exchange, Lunex enables businesses to accept crypto as a form of payment and convert it instantly to fiat through its B2B payment gateway API. This move has solved the inherent cross-border payment issues that most traders face. Its standout mobile exchange will enable users to spot trade over 50K crypto pairs across multiple blockchains. Moreover, traders can use Lunex’s portfolio tracker to track digital assets like bonds, stocks, and cryptos. The platform stands out for its simplicity as users will only have a unique DeFi crypto wallet that allows them to buy, sell, and cryptos all from one account. Like BNB, LNEX crypto holds massive potential. At the ongoing presale, the LNEX tokens are going for only $0.0056, with early investors already making 360% in profit. With close tor $6.4 million raised in crypto ICO funding, the LNEX price is expected to jump to $1 in 2025 Avalanche Oversold or More Room for Declines? Despite attempting a breakout in December, the AVAX token has struggled to peak above its significant barrier, reinforcing bearish sentiment. Avalanche VPVR has identified the $27 region as a potential support level. This area aligns with its previous accumulation area, indicating potential buying interest. If the AVAX token can breach this support level, the altcoin could see further declines towards the $25 range. Recent data have demonstrated a decline in Open Interest (OI), which aligns with AVAX’s inability to sustain bullish momentum above $55 in November. A declining OI typically highlights waning speculative interest as AVAX traders hold their positions amid uncertainty. This further reflects diminishing confidence in a short-term recovery. AVAX crypto must rally above the $40 and $42 resistance levels with a rising OI to shift this sentiment. Notably, AVAX’s relative Strength Index (RSI) has been hovering below the neutral zone at 50, reflecting the ongoing bearish momentum. This further aligns with the token’s lower highs and lower lows pattern. If the RSI continues to decline, it could enter an oversold condition, potentially attracting bargain hunters and driving a short-term recovery. Without a decisive jump above 45, bearish momentum would likely remain dominant. For AVAX bulls to take control of the market, RSI must surpass the 50 mark, highlighting a breakout above its $42 resistance level. BNB Price Analysis Amid the current market turbulence, BNB crypto has closed below its 50-day simple moving average at $691 on January 7, but the bears are struggling to sustain these lower levels. BNB bulls have been trying to push its value above the moving averages. If they become successful, the price of BNB could rally to challenge the overhead resistance at the $745 level. A breakout above this level could set the stage for a rally toward $794. Notably, the bears will try to defend the level with all their might. However, if the bulls prevail, the next target would be at the $935 level. On the flip side, if the price of BNB fails to close above the 20-day exponential moving average , it could signal that the bears have taken charge. This could drop BNB’s price toward its downside support level of $635. The recent downtrend can be attributed to broader market turbulence. Its open interest is increasing, suggesting investor confidence. Per CoinGlass data , derivative open interest for the BNB ecosystem has increased, demonstrating its potential to attract leveraged traders. The uptick comes as the BNB token recorded more price downturns in the past few days. Best Token To Buy: AVAX, BNB, and LNEX While AVAX and BNB bulls aim to reverse their current trajectory, Lunex Network could become a strong contender in the market. Based on its growth potential and innovative cross-chain capabilities, Lunex is emerging as the go-to platform for high returns and reliability in the DeFi market.

If Thielen’s crystal ball is correct, the digital asset might potentially experience significant price swings on January 29, 2025, once it breaks out of its so-called “symmetrical triangle” formation. Related Reading: Solana Tops The Charts As Artificial Intelligence Go-To Blockchain Platform —Research However, the path to this breakout is fraught with variables that could sway Bitcoin’s trajectory in any direction. Breaking Down The Technicals Bitcoin has been trading in a symmetrical triangular pattern for quite some time. These patterns typically signify consolidation, implying that the market is gearing up for a major move. Thielen sees this as a possibility for a breakout, which might push Bitcoin over its resistance levels. However, he adds that there is no assurance. The breakout may happen either way. Inflation And Fed Decisions Affect Bitcoin A breakout may not be fully based on technical analysis. Thielen notes that inflation data and Federal Reserve interest rate decisions will have a significant impact on Bitcoin’s future price behavior. If inflation remains high and the Fed continues to raise interest rates, the market’s risk appetite may decline, impeding Bitcoin’s growth. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, Bitcoin may skyrocket. Timeline For Breakout Thielen speculates that Bitcoin will break out on January 29, 2025. If this schedule is accurate, we could witness a huge movement in the market. However, time, like all predictions, is subject to uncertainty. Thielen, meanwhile, alluded to a bullish break and the ensuing Bitcoin surge. Growing anticipation of increased Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers served as the foundation for the market expert’s claim. The market may take longer to break through or face unexpected volatility, which alters the present trend. Investors should be cautious because the breakout could happen sooner or later than planned based on market conditions. The Uncertainty Factor While many analysts have a bright outlook, Thielen warns on prudence. Bitcoin’s price is famously volatile, with the possibility of huge volatility remaining. Investors should be aware that Bitcoin can encounter obstacles that restrict its breakout potential even with the positive technical patterns. Navigating this unpredictable terrain will depend much on risk management. Related Reading: Analyst Declares XRP A Bullish Favorite – Rally Imminent?

Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Saves California on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Saves California by entering its contract address – 2mtzeaYqDPLtCemX5jNPuuq8jw65cbgNUXuT3fBra2M2 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCALI.

In a brief submitted on Wednesday, the SEC disagreed with the earlier ruling by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District, which stated that certain XRP sales to retail investors did not violate securities laws. The appeal basically challenges the district court’s distinction between institutional and retail investors. The SEC said, “The district court reasoned that institutional investors reasonably expected profits from the efforts of others because Ripple represented that its efforts would increase the price of XRP.” #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP @Ripple The @SECGov has filed its opening brief. https://t.co/v0YTjHGxzV — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) January 15, 2025 Disagreement with Court’s Ruling The SEC argued that the district court’s distinction between the expectations of institutional and retail investors is inconsistent with the objective investor standard outlined in the Howey test. They also claimed it goes against a fundamental principle of federal securities laws, which asserts that less sophisticated investors are just as deserving of protection as more sophisticated investors. “But the district court erroneously found that retail investors did not have that same expectation because they purchased XRP through crypto asset trading platforms and thus did not know if the seller was Ripple, a Ripple affiliate, or someone else,” the agency added. The SEC wants to reverse the court’s ruling in favor of Ripple and argue that all XRP sales are unregistered securities. If they win, the case will go back to the district court. Possible Shift in Crypto Regulation Amid this legal chaos, rumors are circulating that the Trump administration’s SEC could revamp its stance on crypto regulation. Reports suggest a potential pause on enforcement actions, which could lead to quicker settlements and a shift away from “regulation by enforcement.” With the current sec chair Gary Gensler set to step down next week, the new administration is expected to bring more clarity and support for the crypto industry.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-16 03:34:31

Insights on FET Ecosystem & CoinRank Partnership,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-investors-snap-up-200m-web3bays-3bay-tokens-insights-on-fet-ecosystem-coinrank-partnership/,"In a significant development for the decentralized sector, the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance has enhanced the FET ecosystem by conducting its first token reduction, aiming to limit supply and raise value. Additionally, CoinRank has partnered with CyberCharge to improve Web3 interaction with smarter, advanced tools. On the other side, Web3Bay (3BAY) distinguishes itself with a decentralized e-commerce model. At the heart of its ecosystem, the 3BAY token offers unique benefits like price cuts and the right to make decisions. So far, Web3Bay has sold over 200 million 3BAY tokens, collecting over $700,000, confirming its crucial role in changing how we buy and sell digital assets. FET Ecosystem Announces Initial Token Reduction The newly formed Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, combining FET, OCEAN, and AGIX tokens, has declared its first major token reduction set for January 10, removing five million FET tokens from circulation. This strategy, intended to create scarcity, aims to possibly lift its long-term value. Although this move has not yet triggered a large market reaction, FET has seen a 14% price rise in the past week, showing some optimistic sentiment, despite being 57% below its highest price of $3.47. This upcoming token reduction could solidify the FET Ecosystem’s reputation, although recovering its peak value remains a challenge amid fluctuating market conditions in a quickly changing sector. CoinRank & CyberCharge Collaboration Enhances Web3 Interaction CoinRank, known for cryptocurrency analytics, has partnered with CyberCharge to improve user interaction with blockchain technology. This partnership introduces advanced tools to the table. By integrating CyberCharge’s cutting-edge solutions, CoinRank aims to facilitate smoother transactions, improve decentralized finance (DeFi) operations, and offer an easier interface for crypto portfolio management. With a focus on refining innovation, CoinRank and CyberCharge are setting the stage for a future where Web3 interaction is more seamless and secure. The success of these updates in simplifying crypto management will rely on the effective implementation and user adoption of these features. Web3Bay Raises $700K & Promises 6430% ROI Web3Bay (3BAY) is a decentralized e-commerce platform that seeks to revolutionize the way people buy and sell digital assets. The 3BAY token, central to its operations, facilitates seamless transactions on the platform. Additionally, the token provides utility, governance, and exclusive benefits to its holders. Users purchasing with the 3BAY token receive a 5% discount, promoting adoption and improving user experience. Governance features also enable token holders to actively participate in platform decisions, fostering a truly community-driven environment. The 3BAY token presale has already attracted substantial interest, with over 200 million tokens sold, raising a total of $700,000 so far. At the current presale stage 3 price of $0.0039675, the 3BAY token presents an attractive opportunity to shape and benefit from a blockchain-powered e-commerce platform that’s busy revolutionizing the online buying and selling of digital assets. With the growing demand, Web3Bay’s ongoing presale offers a distinct chance to acquire tokens early before presale batches sell out and prices significantly increase. Time is of the essence, and the chance to partake in Web3Bay’s transformative venture at this early stage should not be overlooked. Final Thoughts The FET ecosystem continues to grow with new initiatives like token reductions, potentially enhancing its long-term value. Simultaneously, CoinRank is facilitating easier Web3 interaction by teaming up with CyberCharge. However, the 3BAY token represents a distinct opportunity for those looking to buy and sell digital assets beyond the limits of traditional centralized platforms. As a pillar of the Web3Bay ecosystem, the 3BAY token offers a direct stake in the future of decentralized e-commerce . Focusing on user-oriented features such as discounts and community governance, the 3BAY token provides a strong appeal for those wanting to be part of the web3 revolution ahead of the global curve. Currently, in its third presale stage, buyers are quickly securing 3BAY tokens at the ongoing rate of $0.0039675 before anticipated demand hikes and price increases.

The SEC aims to classify all XRP sales as unregistered securities offerings. Reacting to the news, Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty took to X (formerly Twitter) and wrote, “As expected, the SEC’s appeal brief is a rehash of already failed arguments –and likely to be abandoned by the next administration. We’ll respond formally in due time. For now, know this: the SEC’s lawsuit is just noise. A new era of pro-innovation regulation is coming, and Ripple is thriving.” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also expressed disappointment and said, “One definition of insanity….Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Gensler’s SEC really took this to heart.” XRP Price Touches $3: Despite the legal chaos, Ripple’s XRP saw a 14% increase, reaching a yearly high above $3 on Wednesday morning, showing renewed investor interest. XRP, along with Dogecoin, is leading the gains in the cryptocurrency market, outperforming Bitcoin. Bitcoin has touched $100,000 once more and is currently trading just above that level.

XRP’s chart is looking strong, with analysts predicting possible future price gains. Some analysts believe XRP could reach $4 or even higher, thanks to a long period of accumulation.

This project plans to launch an autonomous agent to spot market trends before they take off. And with $1 million in presale funding raised in its first 24 hours alone, it’s clear that investor interest is exploding. MIND of Pepe Presale Takes Off with Huge First-Day Raise Crypto presales offer a unique opportunity: early access to tokens at the lowest possible price before they launch on exchanges. That’s the setup with MIND of Pepe. This AI-focused project is already getting attention, raising far more than the developers had expected in its first 24 hours of going live. MIND of Pepe’s rapid fundraising suggests retail investors are eager to get involved as early as possible. Currently, MIND tokens are available for $0.0031144 each, but this price will increase in just one day. That’s because the presale incorporates automatic price adjustments at each new stage. It means early investors get the lowest possible entry point. Joining the MIND token presale is simple. The developers accept various payment methods, including ETH, USDT, BNB, and credit cards. This ease of access, combined with Mind of Pepe’s innovative use case, has led to bullish social media discussions. The project’s Twitter page already has more than 2,600 followers. MIND of Pepe’s Telegram channel is also multiplying, with investors worldwide piling in to learn more about the development team’s plans. Behind the AI – How MIND of Pepe Spots Explosive Crypto Opportunities MIND of Pepe is like a digital crypto analyst, using advanced AI tech to sift through vast amounts of data – conversations, emerging trends, and market signals – across social media platforms like Twitter. Unlike simple trading bots that execute pre-programmed commands, this AI agent actively participates in the crypto community and develops its own insights. Here’s how it works: Imagine waking up to discover that MIND of Pepe has identified a promising new token overnight. It might have analyzed thousands of social media posts and blockchain interactions to find this token. MIND holders get exclusive access to insights like this through private community channels. These insights provide a clear advantage – especially for market newcomers. MIND of Pepe’s AI agent can even create and launch its own tokens, offering MIND holders first access. YouTuber Jacob Bury believes this feature could be revolutionary. He released a video discussing the MIND of Pepe project – and predicted it could offer a simple way to flip $1,000 into $10,000. Inside MIND of Pepe’s Tokenomics & High-Yield Staking App MIND of Pepe’s tokenomics structure showcases the development team’s ambition. A 25% share of the supply is allocated to the AI agent itself, ensuring it can expand its reach and influence over time. A further 30% is dedicated to ongoing development, showing the team’s commitment to staying ahead of the curve. MIND of Pepe’s team has also launched a staking platform while the presale is ongoing. This platform allows early investors to begin earning rewards immediately. Current yields are estimated at 1,750% per year – although that figure will decrease as more people stake. Although these huge yields are enticing, the real selling point for investors is how MIND of Pepe could permanently change the meme coin space. Most meme coins are all about hype and going viral. But MIND of Pepe takes a different approach, mixing that hype with genuine utility. It also taps into the AI crypto trend – which even big players like Franklin Templeton are bullish on . So, while it’s still in its early days, MIND of Pepe seems to have a bright future ahead.

However, Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty termed the case as noise and believes the case will be dismissed in the next administration. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed its opening brief to escalate its legal battle against blockchain-based digital payment network Ripple with only a few hours before the deadline elapsed. In October last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered that the U.S. SEC vs. Ripple and its executive brief be filed on or before January 15, 2025 failure to which the appeal would be dismissed. Court filings show the U.S. SEC is challenging Judge Analisa Torres’ July 13, 2023 ruling The court documents reveal that the regulator seeks to challenge part of the July 13, 2023 ruling by New York Judge Analisa Torres that categorized XRP tokens differently when dispensed to retail and institutional investors. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP @Ripple The @SECGov has filed its opening brief. https://t.co/v0YTjHGxzV — James K. Filan 🇺🇸🇮🇪 (@FilanLaw) January 15, 2025 The financial watchdog explained that Torres’ conclusion that profits can’t be expected unless investors knowingly buy from the issuer is against both applicable law and the “undisputed facts.” The SEC emphasized that the court’s ruling is against fundamental securities laws and builds an unsustainable contradiction between investor expectations. The SEC argues that the ruling contradicts the Howey Test which is used to establish whether an asset is a security or not. The document showed that the regulator continued to accuse Ripple, its co-founder Christian Larsen, and the company’s Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse of breaking the securities regulations when selling XRP tokens to retail and institutional investors. The commission also criticized the ruling for distinguishing institutional investors from retail ones, saying that Ripple’s extensive marketing aimed at boosting XRP’s price. Ripple’s executives respond to U.S. SEC’s last-minute filing Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty wrote on X that the last-minute move by the regulator was expected. The legal expert said the new court filing is a reconstitution of the initial arguments that failed in previous court proceedings. Alderoty termed the legal action by the financial watchdog as “noise” and expressed his beliefs that the new administration under President-elect Donald Trump will abandon the years-long case in due time. The legal expert also highlighted that a new era of regulations supporting the crypto industry is about to begin and Ripple will thrive. “As expected, the SEC’s appeal brief is a rehash of already failed arguments –and likely to be abandoned by the next administration. We’ll respond formally in due time. For now, know this: the SEC’s lawsuit is just noise.” – Stuart Alderoty Ripple’s Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse also commented on the SEC’s legal action, calling it insanity. He bashed the regulator for doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results. XRP soars despite the legal dispute The Ripple community has previously accused the U.S. SEC of trying to delay the conclusion of its legal battle with Ripple. Users claim that the regulator was intentionally filing at the last minute to frustrate the defendants and the entire crypto community. Despite the legal entanglement, investors are optimistic about the possible outlook of XRP and the general crypto market this year. XRP has emerged as the top-performing asset among the top ten largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. According to data from crypto data aggregator CoinMarketCap, XRP is up about 8% in the last 24 hours, fueling its seven-day gain to 28.77%. The digital asset retails at $3.02 with a market cap of 173.7 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $22.7 billion. The cryptocurrency now ranks third among the largest digital assets by market capitalization behind Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Bonk is one of the most successful crypto projects in 2024. The dog-themed Solana-based coin has become one of the most recognized meme coins, with its market capitalization reaching $2.4 billion in May. Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 93 trillion. It is important to note that 66 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem.

Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain triggered a huge surge in SOL’s price, attributed to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has many side projects that contribute to its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will reach $0.00025, which is approximately 7.9 times its current price, making it a good investment to consider. Why is Bonk down? Bonk lost a good portion of its value over the last 24 hours. In the last few hours, its value decreased by $0.000002847. Today’s decreasing pressure triggered a notable descent in the coin’s value. Will Bonk Recover? Bonk is currently trading within its established price range. A recent price decline tested the $0.00002618 support level, which proved strong. A successful defense of this support level is considered crucial for the current recovery. Will Bonk reach $0.000055? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.000035. However, just a few days ago, Bonk saw some price action above this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.000055 by the end of 2026. Will Bonk reach $0.000100? Bonk price prediction suggests that the coin can reach $0.000100 and surpass it by 2027. When Bonk reaches this price level, its market capitalization will increase 4.5-fold. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. According to The Cryptopolitan’s review of the cryptocurrency, it is expected that Bonk will reach a maximum value of $0.00025 by the end of 2031, which is quite a bit above its current price.

Bonk historic price sentiment Bonk price history In December 2022, Bonk was launched with a price of $0.0000001487 and made history by making a surge of more than 30% in SOL tokens. Bonk cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 100 by market cap, reaching $0.0000034 per coin on January 5, 2023, according to crypto market records. However, by March 2023, the price of the Bonk token had fallen from $0.0000004134, losing substantial value.

Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas made this prediction after Canary Capital filed an amended S-1 registration form in relation to its Litecoin ETF proposal. Amended Litecoin ETF S-1 Filing Suggests SEC Engagement Canary Capital had submitted the S-1 registration form for the Litecoin ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in October 2024. On Wednesday, the company filed an amended version of this form. According to the filing, U.S. Bancorp Fund Services would act as the administrator of the ETF, while Coinbase Custody Trust and BitGo would act as the custodians for the Litecoin of the fund. NEW: @CanaryFunds just filed an amended S-1 for their Litecoin ETF filing. No guarantees — but this might be indicative of SEC engagement on the filing. Still no 19b-4 filing yet though (A 19b-4 would actually start the potential approval/denial clock) h/t @isabelletanlee pic.twitter.com/wFtNOmbmYx — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 15, 2025 Some of the industry watchers including the Bloomberg analysts have suggested that that the modification of the filing could be an indication of SEC’s interest. Another Bloomberg ETF analyst, James Seyffart pointed out that the amendment could mean the SEC has offered comments on the application. However, there has been no 19b-4 filing made, which is a formal application for rule change that initiates the approval process. “We had heard chatter that the Litecoin S-1 had gotten comments back from [the] SEC,” said Balchunas in a post on X (formerly Twitter). He also said that this is in line with his earlier claim that Litecoin is ‘most likely’ to be the next cryptocurrency ETF in the United States. New SEC Leadership Adds Uncertainty The timing of the Litecoin ETF’s approval process could depend on upcoming changes in SEC leadership. Gary Gensler , the current SEC chair, is set to step down on Monday. Former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins, who has expressed support for the cryptocurrency sector in the past, has been nominated to lead the agency. However, the Senate has yet to confirm Atkins’ appointment, and the exact timeline remains uncertain. Balchunas emphasized that the leadership transition is a “huge variable” in the approval process for the Litecoin ETF. Growing Interest in Spot Crypto ETFs Created in 2011 as a more efficient version of Bitcoin, Litecoin is one of the oldest and most stable blockchains. Following the announcement, the price of Litecoin spiked by more than 18% to trade at $119.46 at the time of writing. Analysts believe that the current bullish rally may break through the $130 barrier, with the LTC price prediction standing at $170. In addition, open interest increased by 29.58% to $575.39 million within the last 24 hours while the trading volume jumped significantly by 277.25% to $1.65 billion. This excitement comes in the wake of the recent approval of U.S. spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in recent months. These products outperformed the market, which led to the growth of interest among issuers in the creation of ETFs for altcoins like Solana and XRP. A recent JPMorgan and Hashkey research note suggested that new Solana and XRP ETFs could pull in $13.6bn of new funds if they are approved within six to 12 months. The introduction of altcoin ETFs such as Litecoin may also contribute to increased institutional investments in the cryptocurrency space. Next Steps for Litecoin ETF Approval Even though the amended S-1 filing marks a progress, there is no certainty as to when the approval of the Litecoin ETF will be completed. The submission of a 19b-4 application would formally kick off the SEC’s decision process but Canary Capital has not given any indication of when this would happen. The original filing of Canary identified Litecoin as a blockchain that has had “100% uptime since its inception” noting its security and stability as strengths. Industry participants are now focused on the next steps, such as the SEC’s response and the possible 19b-4 filing, as the momentum for the approval of the Litecoin ETF picks up.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains a staple, but altcoins are showing unparalleled potential. From the dependable Ethereum (ETH) to the rising BigBossInu, these digital assets are ready to deliver game-changing returns.

The rally is fueled by Meta’s launch of Polygon-powered NFTs on Instagram, which has increased investor interest, along with bullish chart patterns suggesting a potential long-term uptrend. Bitcoin (BTC) : Bitcoin has been leading the current market rally, pushing many altcoins, including MATIC, higher. The excitement around the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has also contributed to Bitcoin’s momentum, and analysts expect this could continue driving gains across the crypto market in the short term​. Polkadot (DOT) : DOT’s price is nearing the breakout level of $6.90, a crucial resistance point. If bulls manage to push the price higher, it could trigger a move to $10.

Aptos (APT) : APT has shown gains recently, riding the momentum of the broader market rally led by Bitcoin.

Anderson said that the decision comes after the firm has completed its “pipeline of ideas,” and there are no personal or health-related reasons behind the closure. “The intensity and focus has come at the cost of missing a lot of the rest of the world and the people I care about. I now view Hindenburg as a chapter in my life, not a central thing that defines me,’ the founder said. Hindenburg gained widespread attention for its reports on companies like the Adani Group, Nikola and Carvana, sparking major controversies, especially in India. The firm’s research accused Adani of corporate malpractice, leading to major financial losses and political turmoil. The firm was known for publishing research that was sold to hedge funds and investors while simultaneously releasing the findings to the public, benefiting from market shorts. On January 15, Anderson said, “The plan has been to wind up after we finished the pipeline of ideas we were working on. And as of the last Ponzi cases we just completed and are sharing with regulators, that day is today.” A Personal Note From Our Founder https://t.co/OOMtimC0gV — Hindenburg Research (@HindenburgRes) January 15, 2025 The firm’s closure comes amidst heightened regulatory scrutiny, particularly from the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, and India’s SEBI. Hindenburg faced allegations of violating regulations by using offshore instruments to short Indian markets, with SEBI issuing a show-cause notice to the firm. The Adani case remains unresolved, and Adani Enterprises, saw a strong increase in its share price at the start of today’s trading. The shares opened at Rs 2,500, up from the previous day’s Rs 2,388.15. Other companies in the Adani Group, such as Adani Power, also experienced major gains. It remains to be seen what actions will follow, particularly with the change in leadership in the U.S. “There are others on our team who are now free agents — so feel free to reach out to me if you have a need for anyone who is brilliant, focused, and easy to work with, as they all are,” he added.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-16 04:47:32
39037562,https://timestabloid.com/?p=54688,1737002990,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top Exchange Predicts SHIB to Hit $1,https://timestabloid.com/top-exchange-predicts-shib-to-hit-1/,"Leading cryptocurrency exchange CoinW recently generated widespread discussion by projecting that Shiba Inu could surge by over 4,584,900% to reach the elusive $1 mark. The ambitious prediction was shared via a poll conducted on X, sparking renewed interest in the token’s potential value. Comparative Market Predictions In the poll, CoinW invited users to speculate on which milestone might be achieved first: Shiba Inu climbing to $1, Ethereum reaching $10,000, BNB hitting $1,000, or Dogecoin touching $1. Other featured cryptocurrencies included Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), XRP, and Avalanche (AVAX). The asset’s potential growth to $1 emerged as the most extreme prediction due to the significant increase needed to reach the target. For context, the token is currently valued at $0.00002181. Achieving $1 would require the token to increase by over 4.58 million percent, effectively removing all decimal places from its current price. At this rate, a $100 investment in SHIB could theoretically yield over $4.2 million. Contextualizing the Prediction CoinW further fueled the debate by asking whether such a milestone for the asset could happen before Bitcoin reaches $100,000 or Ethereum crosses $10,000. Bitcoin currently trades at $99,000, requiring only a 6% rise. Ethereum requires a 206% increase from its current value of approximately $3,270 to hit its target. While predictions of massive gains are not unprecedented for Shiba inu, the feasibility of achieving a $1 valuation is widely questioned. For the token to hit this price point, its market capitalization would need to exceed $589 trillion—an astronomical figure far beyond the size of the global economy. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Historic Price Performance and Future Possibilities Despite skepticism, the asset has already demonstrated extraordinary growth in the past. From its all-time low to its peak, the token saw an astonishing increase of over 150,000,000%. Early investors witnessed staggering gains, including one case where an $8,000 investment grew into more than $5.7 billion. However, replicating such a meteoric rise in today’s market environment appears unlikely. Industry experts and platforms like Telegaon predict that while the token could eventually reach $1, achieving this target may take several decades. According to Telegaon, sustained growth and widespread adoption over time could make the price point feasible by 2050. CoinW’s bold prediction has reignited discussions about Shiba Inu’s long-term potential and the broader possibilities within the cryptocurrency market. Although the odds remain low, the community continues to rally around the project. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Trump’s Crypto Law (TRUMPLAW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPLAW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Crypto Law can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Crypto Law could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Crypto Law launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Crypto Law on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Crypto Law by entering its contract address – 7mYansF38wyaSvnj7C1Gr536FdMbGA4ufqY7PwzC7CxM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPLAW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|REGULATION|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-16 04:55:00

Key Insights Into The Latest Recovery,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-bitcoin-upward-cycle-back-key-insights-into-the-latest-recovery/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has rebounded to trade above $99,000 following its significant dip earlier this week. While the latest US Consumer Price Index (CPI) news appears to have contributed to this quick recovery, it has also drawn attention from analysts, who are closely monitoring key metrics to understand the market’s next move. A CryptoQuant contributor known as Crypto Dan recently provided insights into Bitcoin’s current market behavior. Highlighting the Short-Term Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), Dan observed that the metric has shown a recurring pattern during correction phases. This pattern, he noted, typically dampens market optimism before a subsequent rebound. Despite the recent correction, signs point to the potential resumption of an upward cycle in the near future. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharp Rebound Above $95K: Stop Hunting or Trend Reversal? Short-Term SOPR Analysis And What It Currently Suggests For BTC The SOPR metric measures the profitability of spent outputs relative to their realized value, providing insights into market participants’ behavior during price corrections. According to Crypto Dan, during corrections, the SOPR oscillates between red and green zones. The red zone signals increased profit-taking, often driven by whale activity, which can extend correction periods. Conversely, the green zone indicates reduced selling pressure, setting the stage for potential rebounds. Dan reveals that the SOPR currently shows a smaller volume of profit-taking compared to previous correction periods, such as the seven-month correction earlier in the year. This trend suggests that the recent correction, which has lasted over a month, may be shorter in duration. Dan speculates that Bitcoin could resume its upward trend within the first quarter of 2025. However, he cautioned that short-term volatility remains a risk, with the possibility of further sharp drops before a sustained reversal. The analyst wrote: However, in the short term, there may still be one or two sharp drops that push SOPR below the yellow dotted line, potentially crushing market participants’ hope for a rally before the market reverses upward. As such, aggressive short-term trades should be approached with caution. Bitcoin Market Performance And Outlook Meanwhile, Bitcoin appears to now be making its way back above the $100,000 mark as the asset currently trades at a price of $99,494, at the time of writing marking a 2.7% increase in the past day. This increase in Bitcoin’s price aside from being attributed to the underlying positive metrics on the BTC network can also be linked to the latest update on the US CPI. According to the latest reports, the US CPI rose by 0.4% in December—this news has resulted in the US Dollar seeing a notable plunge while other financial assets saw the opposite trend recording an uptick.

SOL was able to climb above the $180 and $185 resistance levels. The bulls pushed it above the $188 resistance and then $200. A high was formed at $206 and the price is now consolidating gains near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $186 swing high to the $206 low. Solana is now trading above $195 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $196 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $205 level. The next major resistance is near the $212 level. The main resistance could be $220. A successful close above the $220 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $232. Any more gains might send the price toward the $245 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $205 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $196 zone and the trend line. The first major support is near the $190 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $186 swing high to the $206 low. A break below the $190 level might send the price toward the $185 zone. If there is a close below the $185 support, the price could decline toward the $172 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $196 and $190.

Recently, Fox Journalist Eleanor Terrett revealed that Solana ETFs faced a rejection, but Litecoin’s chances are soaring. It might just be the first altcoin to get approval in 2025! Solana ETFs Face Setback According to Fox’s Eleanor Terrett, Solana ETFs had been getting attention from the SEC staff, but they faced a setback when their 19b4s were rejected. This happened a few weeks ago when Gary Gensler was still heading the SEC. Solana ETFs were also getting engagement from staff but the 19b4s were then rejected. Granted, that was a few weeks ago with the @SECGov still under @GaryGensler who’s out in 3 business days.

It will be a waiting game to see how the new leadership handles the approval process for these highly anticipated assets. Litecoin Poised for ETF Approval First! Meanwhile, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas shared that the SEC had given comments back on the Litecoin S-1 filing. However, this is a greater sign of Litecoin’s approval sooner. Although, Balchunas previously predicted that Litecoin might be the next coin to get an ETF approval, and now it seems that prediction is becoming more likely. However, the start of the new SEC chair’s term is still a big factor that could influence the final decision. Balchunas statement comes after Canary Capital filed an updated S-1 form on Wednesday, marking the initial step in registering its Litecoin ETF with the SEC. What’s Next for XRP and Solana? As for XRP and Solana, both have faced delays, but there’s hope for their ETFs. The shift in leadership at the SEC might lead to a fresh perspective on these applications. If these ETFs are approved, it could bring more institutional interest and boost the overall cryptocurrency market. The next few weeks will be crucial in determining the future of Solana, Litecoin, and XRP ETFs.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|LTC|REGULATION|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-16 05:14:01

Severino, a Chartered Market Technician and seasoned trader with over 15 years of experience, highlighted the potential for the asset to surge to $13.4 if a developing bull flag pattern materializes on the daily chart. XRP Bull Flag Formation Observed Severino’s observations stem from recent price movements of the token. The digital asset valued at $0.4956 on November 4, surged dramatically to reach a seven-year high of $2.9 by December 3, marking a 485% increase within a month. This sharp upward movement formed the flagpole portion of the suspected bull flag pattern. Following this surge, XRP faced a pullback from the $2.9 peak and consolidated within the $2 range. Severino interprets this consolidation phase as potentially forming the bull flag portion of the pattern, signaling that the asset may be building momentum for another upward breakout. However, he acknowledged the possibility that this pattern might instead represent a descending channel rather than a bullish structure. If this is a valid bull flag in XRP, the target is $13 This is significantly beyond my top targets, but not impossible pic.twitter.com/bacmrcNyOD — Tony ""The Bull"" Severino, CMT (@tonythebullBTC) January 1, 2025 XRP Potential Price Surge to $13.4 Bull flag formations are typically characterized by an initial price surge followed by a consolidation period, eventually leading to a continuation of the upward trend. If this pattern holds for the token, the price could experience a breakout matching the length of the previous rally. Given the 485% increase in November and December, a similar rise from current levels would push XRP to approximately $13.4, according to Severino’s projections. While he admitted that this price target surpasses even his most optimistic expectations, Severino emphasized that such outcomes, although ambitious, are not entirely unrealistic. If the token reaches this value, its market capitalization will exceed $769 billion, surpassing Ethereum’s current valuation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additional Bullish Indicators for XRP In addition to the potential bull flag pattern, other technical indicators support Severino’s positive outlook. Notably, XRP’s quarterly Relative Strength Index (RSI) has climbed above 70. The last occurrence of this indicator level was in January 2018, coinciding with the token’s previous all-time high of $3.31. Furthermore, XRP recently closed a yearly candle above the $2 mark for the first time in its history and surpassed $3 for the first time since 2018, reinforcing its current bullish momentum. The asset is currently trading at $3.07, maintaining its position as a market leader while Bitcoin remains under $100,000. Although Severino’s predictions point to significant potential gains for XRP , market dynamics remain unpredictable. The realization of such price targets would depend on sustained demand, market sentiment, and broader industry trends. Nonetheless, the possibility of a continued rally keeps the token firmly in the spotlight as traders closely monitor price developments and chart patterns.

From Oklahoma's proposed legislation to incorporate Bitcoin into state pension funds to forecasts of the cryptocurrency reaching up to $250,000 by 2025, the narrative around Bitcoin is increasingly centered on its utility as a hedge against inflation and its appeal to institutional and governmental entities. Oklahoma Introduces Bill to Establish Bitcoin as Strategic Reserve Asset On Jan. 15, 2025, a new bill aiming to establish Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset was introduced to the Oklahoma House of Representatives. Spearheaded by state Representative Cody Maynard, House Bill 1203—known as the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act—seeks to position Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation by allowing state pension funds and savings accounts to allocate a portion of their assets to the leading cryptocurrency. The proposed legislation is part of a growing trend of US states exploring the potential of Bitcoin as a safeguard against economic uncertainties. Representative Maynard, championing the bill, articulated the rationale behind this move, stating, “Bitcoin represents freedom from bureaucrats printing away our purchasing power. As a decentralized form of money, Bitcoin cannot be manipulated or created by government entities. It is the ultimate store of value for those who believe in financial freedom and sound money principles.” If passed, Oklahoma would join the ranks of a handful of US states advancing similar legislation, demonstrating Bitcoin’s emergence as a mainstream financial instrument. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act in Oklahoma is not an isolated initiative. A growing number of states, including Pennsylvania, Texas, North Dakota, and New Hampshire, have introduced bills aimed at incorporating Bitcoin into their financial strategies. Pennsylvania: In November 2024, lawmakers proposed allowing the state Treasury to allocate up to 10% of its assets to Bitcoin. State Representative Mike Cabell emphasized Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation and a tool to mitigate macroeconomic risks. Cabell likened the approach to strategies employed by asset management giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, who have adopted Bitcoin as part of their diversified portfolios. Texas: The Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, introduced by lawmaker Giovanni Capriglione in December 2024, proposed a five-year minimum holding period for Bitcoin as a reserve asset. North Dakota: On Jan. 10, 2025, North Dakota introduced its own Bitcoin reserve bill, backed by a bipartisan coalition of 11 co-sponsors, according to Dennis Porter, co-founder and CEO of the Bitcoin advocacy group Satoshi Action Fund. New Hampshire: On the same day, New Hampshire unveiled a broader initiative that extends beyond Bitcoin, categorizing investments under the umbrella term “digital assets.” This broader scope hints at potential diversification into other cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based technologies. The introduction of Bitcoin reserve bills aligns with increasing concerns over inflation and economic instability. As fiat currencies lose value due to inflationary pressures, Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins makes it an attractive alternative for safeguarding purchasing power. State legislators advocating for Bitcoin adoption argue that its decentralized nature and finite supply provide a level of security and autonomy unavailable in traditional fiat systems. By allocating a portion of state reserves to Bitcoin, governments can potentially reduce exposure to inflationary risks while fostering innovation in the blockchain sector. The growing interest in Bitcoin among US states mirrors its rising institutional adoption globally. As governments and private entities alike explore Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value, the cryptocurrency continues to solidify its role as an essential component of diversified financial strategies. However, the move is not without its critics. Opponents of Bitcoin reserve bills cite concerns over its volatility and lack of regulatory clarity. Despite these challenges, the momentum behind Bitcoin adoption suggests that states like Oklahoma are willing to embrace its potential benefits while navigating its risks. What’s Next for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act? As House Bill 1203 advances through the legislative process, it remains to be seen how other states and policymakers will respond. If Oklahoma successfully establishes Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, it could set a precedent for other states and even federal institutions to follow suit. The ongoing wave of Bitcoin -related legislation is a pivotal moment in the evolution of financial systems. Whether as a hedge against inflation, a tool for diversification, or a statement of financial independence, Bitcoin is increasingly becoming a cornerstone of modern financial strategies. Bitcoin Set to Surge: Analysts Predict Prices Up to $250,000 by 2025 as Half a Trillion Dollars Flow In Bitcoin (BTC) could skyrocket to unprecedented highs of $250,000 in 2025, according to new projections from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant. In its latest weekly report released on Jan. 14, the firm highlighted favorable economic conditions, regulatory clarity, and increased institutional adoption as key drivers for the potential influx of $520 billion in new capital to the cryptocurrency. CryptoQuant’s research suggests Bitcoin is poised to see significant price growth in 2025, with a base case target of $145,000 and a potential high of $249,000. The report attributes this bullish outlook to a confluence of factors, including the anticipated impact of a new US presidential administration and an increasingly crypto-friendly regulatory environment. ”About $520 billion of fresh capital could flow into Bitcoin in 2025,” CryptoQuant researchers calculated. ”In the context of favorable regulatory, monetary, and cyclical conditions, it’s reasonable to expect capital to continue flowing into Bitcoin.” The report further notes that the expansion in Bitcoin’s realized capitalization—defined as the total value of Bitcoin supply based on the price at which each unit last moved on-chain—has a magnified effect on its market value and price. Historical patterns show that substantial capital inflows into Bitcoin lead to exponential price growth. Accompanying CryptoQuant’s findings is an analysis of Bitcoin’s realized market cap since 2015. The data reveals that during previous bull cycles, realized capitalization growth correlated with dramatic price increases. If similar conditions prevail, the anticipated $520 billion in capital inflows could propel Bitcoin to new all-time highs, with analysts envisioning a price range of $145,000 to $249,000 by 2025. ”The expansion in the total capital invested in Bitcoin (realized capitalization) has a more-than-proportional effect on Bitcoin’s market value and price,” the report states. CryptoQuant’s forecast is one of several optimistic predictions for Bitcoin’s future. Samson Mow, CEO of Bitcoin adoption firm JAN3, has been vocal about his belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Last year, Mow outlined the possibility of Bitcoin reaching $1 million per coin, driven by what he described as ”omega candles”—daily price increases of $100,000 or more. “You’ll start to go up by $10,000 a day or drop by $10,000 a day. And this is the God candle. After that, we’ll start to see Omega candles, which are $100,000 increments daily,” Mow said. While such a dramatic rise may seem implausible to some, Mow continues to champion the $1 million price target, sharing his predictions on social media. Despite recent price fluctuations, Bitcoin analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Bitcoin experienced two-month lows earlier this week, prompting speculation about the impact of broader macroeconomic factors. Filbfilb, co-founder of trading suite DecenTrader, compared Bitcoin’s current market position to a ”beach ball under water,” suggesting that pressure from legacy markets is temporarily suppressing its growth potential. “Standard stuff... my feeling is that BTC is currently a bit of a beach ball under water with the legacy markets sitting on it for now,” Filbfilb told subscribers of his Telegram channel. Meanwhile, Rekt Capital, a popular crypto trader and analyst, highlighted Bitcoin’s resilience, describing its ability to rebound quickly after market dips. “On daily timeframes, BTC/USD is going from threatening a downside deviation to strongly rebounding and developing a new Higher Low,” Rekt Capital noted. “Lots can change within 24 hours for Bitcoin.” Political and Regulatory Tailwinds for Bitcoin The upcoming inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 20 has added a layer of intrigue to Bitcoin’s near-term outlook. Rumors of potential pro-crypto policies and first-day announcements are fueling speculation about the trajectory of the next crypto bull market. If favorable conditions materialize, Bitcoin could see accelerated adoption among institutions and retail investors alike. CryptoQuant’s $250,000 projection for Bitcoin signals growing confidence in its role as a store of value and hedge against macroeconomic risks. With $520 billion in fresh capital potentially entering the market, Bitcoin stands to benefit from increased regulatory clarity, mainstream adoption, and economic uncertainty driving demand for alternative assets. While short-term volatility remains a concern, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains overwhelmingly bullish. As analysts and industry leaders continue to tout unprecedented price targets, 2025 could mark a watershed moment for the world’s leading cryptocurrency.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-16 05:30:00

On Wednesday, net inflows into BTC ETF skyrocketed to $755 million with Fidelity’s FBTC leading the charge with $463 million in inflows. The BTC price also surged past the $100K level following a strong run-up in the S&P 500. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Resume Again After four consecutive trading sessions of outflows, the spot Bitcoin ETF witnessed strong inflows on Wednesday led by Fidelity. These Bitcoin investment products scooped more than 7,548 Bitcoins from the market against the daily BTC production of 450 BTC. Source: HODL15Capital As shown above, Fidelity’s FBTC saw inflows totaling to $463 million, leading the pack, while Ark Invest’s ARKB came second clocking $138 million of inflows. Although BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw only $31 million in inflows, it clocked a massive $2.35 billion in trading volumes. On the other hand, Fidelity’s FBTC clocked $284 million in trading volumes. Asset managers are working to expand its Bitcoin offerings to other global markets as well. Earlier this week, BlackRock launched a Bitcoin ETF variant on CBOE Canada. Apart from the US, the demand for Bitcoin ETFs continues to remain strong. Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise Invest stated that they have continued to receive inquiries from other nation-states as well. He said: “We just provided some information for a nation state asking about Bitcoin ETFs. Considering moving some exposure from foreign currency govt bonds into BTC. Bitcoin is entering a new chapter”. Core CPI Drop Fuels Market Optimism The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for December rose by 2.9%, aligning with market expectations. Meanwhile, Core CPI inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, dropped to 3.2%, slightly below the anticipated 3.3%. This was enough to send global equities and crypto market soaring high on Wednesday. The S&P 500 closed with a gain of more than 100 points in yesterday’s trading session, fueled by an unexpected drop in core CPI inflation. The index added an impressive $900 billion in market capitalization during the trading session. Will Bitcoin Price Sustain Above $100K to Hit New ATH? On-chain data shows that the current BTC rally is backed by strong fundamentals. According to blockchain analytics firm Santiment, the accumulation of wallets holding more than 10 BTC has resumed once again after stagnating during the second half of December and early January. Source: Santiment Similarly, the number of non-empty wallets has been declining over the past six weeks, as many small retail traders are cashing out profits and attempting to time the market peak. The data supports further rise in BTC in thew coming days. Along with strong inflows into Bitcoin ETF, the BTC price also swiftly moved above $100K before retracing back under that crucial support. As of press time, the Bitcoin price is trading 2.34% up at $99,597 with daily trading volumes up by 5.38% to $58 billion. As per the Coinglass data , the 24-hour liquidations have shot to more than $83 million of which $58 million is in short liquidations.

Bitcoin (BTC) may lead the pack, but altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and the emerging BigBossInu are proving to be game-changers. Investors are expecting remarkable returns from these top crypto picks. BigBossInu Presale Takes Off: A Game-Changing Opportunity BigBossInu is rapidly climbing the ranks in the crypto market, with its hot presale igniting demand from investors.

Arbitrum (ARB): There were no significant recent updates specifically on Arbitrum from this round of browsing, but generally, ARB has been gaining traction in the Layer-2 scaling space with increasing adoption Tron (TRX): Tron has turned deflationary over the past year, surpassing Ethereum in token burns, which has contributed to positive price movement.

One Of These Is Predicted To Make Early Investors A 25x By The End Of July",https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-amp-or-remittix-one-of-these-is-predicted-to-make-early/,"January started on a bullish note, but the tune quickly changed as a barrage of sell-offs plunged the market into a mini-bear season. Bitcoin (BTC) and Amp (AMP) have both breached through critical support levels and are currently treading water, with their price structures breaking down as the correction deepened. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a safe haven, prompting investors to rotate funds into the viral presale of its native $RTX token. Let’s explore what this newcomer brings to the table and why analysts are tipping it as the next 25x gem. Remittix Is Revolutionizing A $150 Trillion Market Cross-border payments were valued at $150 trillion in 2017 and are expected to reach $250 trillion by 2027. As the world embraces cryptocurrencies, the demand for unifying crypto-to-fiat solutions is growing exponentially. Remittix (RTX) exists at the meeting point between DeFi and traditional payment frameworks, offering seamless transfers across 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies. Through Remittix, users will be able to perform quick and inexpensive crypto payments and have the funds immediately converted into fiat and then deposited into a recipient’s bank account anywhere in the world. Businesses can easily integrate crypto through the Remittix Pay API. This is an application designed exclusively for the needs of companies, allowing them to manage payroll with cryptocurrencies and expand their payment options. Experts are already praising this initiative, as it gives businesses the tools they need to stay ahead of the curve and retain a competitive edge in an increasingly crypto-focused world. At the center of the Remittix ecosystem is the $RTX token, which plays a crucial role in key features such as staking and governance. Users can stake their $RTX and reap recurring rewards for up to 8% APY, while those who want a premium experience can join Remittix’s VIP Program. This is a membership program that consists of three levels, with Tier-3 investors earning up to 18% APY and enjoying special privileges, such as enhanced governance rights, and a dedicated account manager. Bitcoin Finds New Support, MicroStrategy Steps In Bitcoin starts off the week in the red as it recorded a 3.5% intraday decline and is currently selling for $91,838. Bitcoin’s cumulative monthly losses now amount to 9% after it failed to sustain the $100k level. This resulted in BTC entering a descending channel, and dragging the entire market into a steep downtrend. However, as the saying goes, “In a bull run, dips are for buying” and Michael Saylor and company have wasted no time buying the blood. Just a few hours ago, he announced that MicroStrategy acquired 2,530 Bitcoin, valued at around $243 million. This timely intervention reignited optimism within the Bitcoin community, as Bitcoin had reached its lowest price since November. Amp Slips 10%, The Bottom Seems To Be In Amp (AMP) formed a local top at $0.011 in early December. However, after a harsh rejection, its price spiraled, resulting in a significant 38% monthly decline. At the time of writing, Amp sells for $0.006 following a 10% intraday decrease. Meanwhile, 24-hour volume shows a 26% increase, with over $23 million worth of AMP traded across exchanges. Amp is also a project that focuses on digital payments, but it proposes an interesting twist. Amp acts as a digital collateral token designed to enhance the security and speed of transactions. It works by providing collateral to guarantee the successful completion of transactions, locking up a small amount of value until the transfer is confirmed. Once the transaction is finalized, the collateral is released, ensuring seamless and secure transfers across different platforms. This framework has already piqued the interest of investors, however, with its broader approach and integration of both crypto and fiat, Remittix presents a more versatile and convenient solution. Join The Remittix Presale Hundreds of investors are rushing to secure their $RTX allocation and over $3 million has been raised in record time. The $RTX presale is now live and tokens are on sale for just $0.207. However, this discount window will close very soon, as experts anticipate an 800% surge by the end of the presale phase. Once listings on major exchanges are finalized and $RTX hits the markets, early adopters could be in for a 25x moonshot. The best time to get involved? Now!

The brief was shared with the XRP community on X by James K. Filan, a well-respected attorney in the crypto space, and it has garnered significant attention. Jeremy Hogan, another prominent attorney and XRP supporter, provided an insightful analysis of the filing. According to Hogan, the appeal focuses solely on the district court’s decision that XRP sales to retail investors did not constitute securities transactions. Hogan also stated that the SEC did not argue about harm to investors , noting that proving investors were harmed will be difficult now that XRP has surpassed $3. This SEC brief was hard to work thru because, IMO, the case won't be ruled on. But I've come this far so, dangit, here we go! My thoughts on the initial Ripple v. SEC appeal brief… We aren't holding back tonight. https://t.co/l8Tcqdfuxc pic.twitter.com/bIWnJC1y3N — Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) January 16, 2025 The SEC’s Opening Brief According to Hogan, the SEC’s primary argument is that it does not need to prove that XRP purchasers were aware of Ripple’s statements about efforts to increase XRP’s value. Instead, the SEC relies on precedent to argue that it is sufficient to show the existence of such promotional statements. Hogan criticized this approach, stating, “The problem the SEC has is that, from my reading of the first two cases, they say no such thing.” He also noted that distinguishing between the concepts of “reliance” and “knowledge” is pivotal, with the trial court emphasizing the latter in its ruling. The SEC’s reliance on prior cases, particularly Aqua-Sonic, appears tenuous. Hogan observed that the SEC had to combine sentences from multiple sections of the Aqua-Sonic decision to construct its argument. He also expects Ripple to counter this by highlighting key differences between both cases, such as the lack of evidence that XRP retail investors were aware of Ripple’s promises. Another significant point of contention is the SEC’s failure to challenge the substantial evidence submitted by attorney John Deaton on behalf of XRP holders. Deaton had gathered thousands of affidavits from XRP investors refuting claims of reliance on Ripple’s statements. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Hogan expressed surprise that the SEC did not attempt to counter this evidence during the initial proceedings, noting that this oversight could prove detrimental to its appeal. Implications of the SEC’s Appeal Hogan highlighted the broader impact of the SEC’s appeal, noting that if the appellate court upholds the district court’s decision , the SEC could face a new precedent requiring proof of investor awareness of promotional statements. This could complicate enforcement, leading to longer, more expensive litigation. Ripple might also revive its argument that investment contracts require contractual obligations, further weakening the SEC’s position. Hogan concluded by questioning the SEC’s rationale for pursuing the appeal, highlighting the risks of adverse legal precedents. Ripple, meanwhile, could use the appeal to strengthen its position and challenge the SEC’s approach. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to Bloomberg Analyst Eric Balchunas, Canary Capital recently received feedback from the US regulator on its S-1 form-filling, which bodes well for a Litecoin ETF approval.

On Wednesday, the firm submitted an amended S-1 filing to the commission, effecting the proposed amendments made by the regulator. ETF analyst James Seyffart believes the amended S-1 filing signals the SEC’s engagement with the filing. However, he claimed that a 19b-4 filing would be the ideal hint that the regulator will approve the LTC ETF. Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, expects the Litecoin ETF to be the next SEC’s approved fund. He said: “We had heard chatter that the Litecoin S-1 had gotten comments back from the SEC. This looks to confirm that, which bodes well for our prediction that Litecoin is most likely to be the next coin approved.” – Eric Balchunas However, Balchunas claimed that the expected entry of a new SEC chair remains a “huge variable.” Donald Trump has nominated crypto-friendly former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins to lead the agency.

Canary Capital had also filed for a Solana ETF in October In October, Canary Capital also filed for approval of its Solana ETF . According to its Solana ETF filing, the trust emphasized that it aimed to provide exposure to the price of Solana.

Meanwhile, Burwick Law is preparing legal action against Solana-based launchpad Pump.fun for enabling scams and harmful activities on the platform, which led to serious financial losses for investors. Meanwhile, BitMEX and its parent company HDR Global Trading were fined $100 million for Bank Secrecy Act violations, bringing an end to years of legal battles with US authorities. Tether and Swan Bitcoin Clash Tether, the issuer of the popular USDT stablecoin, filed a lawsuit against Swan Bitcoin, and accused the Bitcoin financial services company of breaches in their agreements. In a joint statement with 2040 Energy, Tether confirmed the legal action, and stated that Swan’s reckless actions violated their contractual obligations. This case was filed in the High Court of England and Wales, and is the latest escalation in the legal battle between the two firms. The dispute started from a partnership that was established in 2022, where Tether and Swan co-founded 2040 Energy, a Bitcoin mining venture. Tether provided funding while Swan managed operations. However, Swan alleged that former employees of its mining division stole proprietary information , including software code and business strategies, to establish a rival company, Proton Management. According to Swan, these employees executed a deliberate scheme, which is called ”rain and hellfire,” and is aimed at undermining its role in the venture. Some of the key figures in this alleged plan included Michael Holmes, Swan’s former head of business development, and Raphael Zagury, its ex-chief investment officer and mining head, who now serves as Proton’s CEO. Swan claimed that Proton used its trade secrets to become a direct competitor, severely damaging Swan’s market position. The firm also accused Proton of convincing Tether to sever ties with Swan and support Proton in the mining venture. By August of 2024, Swan CEO Cory Klippsten was removed as CEO of 2040 Energy, and Proton officially assumed control of the mining operations. Swan also alleged that Tether facilitated the ”hostile takeover” of its mining business, but Tether denies this claim. Adding to Swan’s legal troubles, the company sued its own law firm, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, in November of 2024 for malpractice. Swan alleged that the firm abandoned its case against Proton after taking on Tether as a client. As a result, the law firm violated ethics rules prohibiting such conflicts of interest. Swan CEO Cory Klippsten described this move as a betrayal that caused serious harm to Swan’s business. Burwick Law Targets Pump.fun Over Investor Losses Burwick Law, a US-based crypto law firm, also recently announced its intention to pursue legal action on behalf of investors who suffered losses due to the meme coin launchpad Pump.fun. In a post on X from Jan. 15, the firm stated that it spent months working with people who lost large amounts of money to meme coins, rug pulls, and unfulfilled promises that were facilitated through platforms like Pump.fun. The firm described the situation as emblematic of exploitation in the crypto ecosystem, and blamed anonymous creators and other corrupt entities for taking advantage of everyday people. According to Burwick , Pump.fun generated hundreds of millions of dollars in fees while allowing harmful and antisocial behaviors, including displays of illicit drug use, racism, and violent acts, to occur on its platform. Pump.fun is a Solana-based meme coin launchpad that allows users to create and launch their own meme coins without needing technical expertise. It attracted millions of users, but still faced criticism for its alleged role in scams and unethical activities. In fact, data from Dune analyst Adam Tehc reveals that only 0.4% of the 14 million crypto wallets interacting with Pump.fun actually achieved profits of more than $10,000. Pump.fun previously allowed live streaming for token promotion but suspended the feature after it was misused for dangerous stunts. The platform also faced regulatory scrutiny after the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority banned access to Pump.fun in December to try and mitigate crypto-related scams. The law firm called for affected investors to join its investigation, and suggested that the potential class-action group could be in the millions. In addition to its fight against Pump.fun, Burwick Law is pursuing separate legal actions involving other crypto-related projects. These include cases against Moonbirds and Proof Collective NFTs, as well as the Full Send Metacard NFTs promoted by the Nelk Boys, which the firm alleges misled investors with unrealistic promises of benefits. Judge Fines BitMEX $100M Over BSA Violations A federal judge sentenced HDR Global Trading Limited, the parent company of crypto exchange BitMEX, to two years of unsupervised probation and a $100 million fine. The ruling was delivered on Jan. 15 in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York by Judge John Koeltl, approximately six months after BitMEX pleaded guilty to violating the US Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) by failing to implement an adequate Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program. The charges stemmed from BitMEX’s alleged lack of compliance with BSA requirements, as the platform allowed users to sign up with only an email address. This allowed people to bypass proper Know Your Customer standards. The US government claimed that BitMEX gained $155 million unlawfully from US sources between 2015 and 2020 and asked for a $417 million fine. However, the court dismissed all open counts against the firm as part of the sentencing and imposed a much smaller financial penalty. BitMEX statement to its users BitMEX called the charges “old news” in a statement to its users , and shared that it is very disappointed at the additional fine, even though it is far less than what the Department of Justice initially sought over the years. The firm and its executives previously settled separate regulatory cases, including a $100 million consent payment to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in 2021. BitMEX co-founders Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, Samuel Reed, and employee Gregory Dwyer already faced sentencing in 2022, and received probation for their roles in violating the BSA. In addition, Hayes, Delo, and Reed were ordered to pay $30 million in penalties as part of a civil settlement with the CFTC. The recent judgment appears to bring an end to the lengthy criminal and civil cases against BitMEX and its executives, which have lasted almost four years. Arthur Hayes stepped down as CEO in 2020 and surrendered to US authorities in 2021 after allegations related to the BSA violations.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-16 05:56:20

This team up will bring web3 services to over 450 million Jio users. What exactly is cooking between Reliance Jio and Polygon, let’s try to uncover. What This Means for Jio (and You) So, why does this matter? Jio Platforms, the company behind India’s biggest telecom network, has over 450 million users. That’s huge. By working with Polygon, they’re planning to make apps and services more advanced using blockchain tech. Kiran Thomas, CEO of Jio Platforms, said this is part of their push for “digital excellence.” But don’t let the fancy phrase throw you off—it’s basically about making things better and smarter. Sandeep Nailwal, Polygon’s co-founder, called it a big step for Web3 adoption in India. Source : X.com What kind of changes are we talking about? Well, details are still hush-hush, but Aishwary Gupta from Polygon hinted at some cool blockchain-based apps in the works. They might include NFT-based platforms, better payment systems, or even new ways to create online communities. This partnership will help both Reliance Jio and Polygon in getting more exposure to users and technology. Why Web3 Is a Big Deal Web3 has become a huge deal in the past few years. This is not something fancy but just a newer version of the internet. Why is it getting so famous? Because now you can own your online identity and everything you do on the internet. Think of it as a space where you have more control over your data, and everything is more secure. Blockchain is at the heart of it, powering everything from cryptocurrencies to NFT marketplaces. In India, Web3 is more than just a tech trend. It could fill gaps in the financial system, help small businesses, and even make e-commerce more fun with digital vouchers. Polygon is already leading this charge, working with big brands like Flipkart to bring Web3 to the mainstream. What’s Next This partnership between Reliance Jio and Polygon could change how millions of Indians use the internet. With Jio’s reach and Polygon’s expertise, Web3 might soon be something everyone can use, not just tech geeks. It’s still early, but the possibilities are endless.

Hunter Horsley’s tweet suggests a nation might adopt Bitcoin ETFs for reserves. On Jan. 16, Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, revealed on Twitter that at least one national government has begun investigating the possibility of investing in Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded funds. We just provided some information for a nation state asking about Bitcoin ETFs. Considering moving some exposure from foreign currency govt bonds into BTC. Bitcoin is entering a new chapter — — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) January 15, 2025 According to Horsley, the unnamed nation is considering shifting a portion of its foreign exchange reserves—traditionally held in foreign government bonds—into BTC. Typically, countries hold reserves in stable assets such as U.S. Treasuries, euros, or other highly liquid foreign bonds. Shifting even a fraction of those reserves into Bitcoin would mark a stark departure from traditional reserve management. Although not specifically related to ETFs, El Salvador’s move to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021 was a landmark moment for sovereign-level crypto adoption. The latest development echoes the recent comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell , who described BTC more as a competitor to gold than a currency, highlighting the growing recognition of BTC as a viable asset class.

According to the latest data from Coinglass as of Jan. 16, the total assets under management for Bitcoin ETFs have reached nearly $113.45 billion, reflecting a steady inflow of investors. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) leads the market with an AUM of $53.46 billion, followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), each managing over $20 billion. The rising interest in BTC ETFs also aligns with legislative efforts at the state level to integrate BTC into everyday financial systems. In Oklahoma , State Senator Dusty Deevers recently introduced the “Bitcoin Freedom Act” (SB325), which would allow employees to receive salaries in BTC and enable businesses to accept BTC payments. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market has seen major growth ahead of Donald Trump’s Jan. 20, inauguration. Since Trump’s re-election, BTC’s price has climbed from $69,000 to over $100,000, buoyed by optimism surrounding his pro-business policies and the possibility of regulatory easing under his administration.

The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF saw record inflows and rapid asset accumulation in its inaugural year, driven largely by direct retail investor interest. The ETF also benefited from Bitcoin’s historic rally above $100,000 late last year, although enthusiasm may wane in the early months of 2025. Mitchnick acknowledged the recent outflows from ETFs but praised the product’s broader success. “We’re focused on being a valuable resource and educational partner for our clients,” he says, adding that adoption in the institutional and wealth advisory segments is an untapped opportunity. Related News: US Consumers Sue the Most Talked About Cryptocurrency Platform of Recent Days for Losing Money While individual investors were the primary driver of IBIT’s early success, the firm is now turning its attention to attracting institutional clients and wealth advisors, Mitchnick said. These segments face greater hurdles due to rigorous research and approval processes, but represent significant growth opportunities, he said. “We are still in the early days of adoption in the asset advisory and institutional segments,” Mitchnick explained. “There is great momentum among firms working to accelerate approvals that will allow advisors to incorporate Bitcoin into their client portfolios.” Mitchnick also highlighted the surge in institutional interest last quarter, as well as progress in wealth advisory channels, which he sees as a larger, longer-term opportunity. “Both segments are very important, but asset advisory may hold the most promise due to the increasing momentum in approvals,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

The cryptocurrency's price has surged 50% to seven-year highs above $3 this month, extending the past quarter's 240% rally, according to data source CoinDesk . Prices have gained 30% in the past seven days alone, lifting the market capitalization to $176.75 billion, the third-highest ahead of stablecoin tether. XRP is witnessing the fastest observed rally since the altcoin boom of January 2018, according to a popular market analysis tool called the relative strength index (RSI). The measure oscillates between 0 and 100, measuring the speed and change of price movement over specific periods, typically 14 days or 12 months. XRP's 14-month RSI has risen to 92, the highest level since October 2017, indicating that the momentum observed over the past 12 months is the strongest over seven years. Rookie traders would quickly point out that RSI readings above 70 indicate overbought conditions and potential for a bull breather or correction. However, that's not necessarily the case, as RSI merely measures the speed of price changes over a specific period. Indicators can continue to flash the so-called overbought reading longer than bears can stay solvent. As the law of motion states: an object in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by an outside force. ""Crypto continues its recovery from Monday’s drop, with BTC pushing towards the $100k mark. The broader market is rebounding, with altcoins like XRP and XLM standing out. XRP has reclaimed the 3rd spot among cryptocurrencies and surpassed BlackRock’s market cap,"" Diego Cardenas, OTC trader at digital asset platform Abra, said in a note to CoinDesk. ""This surge is driven by a growing number of partnerships, the launch of Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD, and speculation about a potential spot XRP ETF,"" Cardenas added. Currently, XRP-specific factors combined with broader crypto market dynamics support the ongoing bullish momentum. Take trading volumes for example. The spot market tally has tripled to over $23 billion in the past 24 hours, validating the price surge. Meanwhile, volumes in derivatives have more than doubled to $34 billion, according to data source Coingecko and Coinglass . XRP's perpetual futures open interest has surged to a record high of 2.34 billion XRP, with funding rates representing the cost of holding leveraged bets hovering around 13%. That's well below the overheated 100% in early December, which signaled excess bullish leverage. In other words, the XRP market is much healthier and supports continued price gains. Meanwhile, crypto market leader bitcoin has risen past $100,000, cheering the slowdown in the U.S. core inflation.

Second, this analysis is better assisted by the MACD line crossing above the signal line. Aggregated open interest for $AIXBT showcases a strong upward trend, indicating growing trader participation and confidence in the market rally.
