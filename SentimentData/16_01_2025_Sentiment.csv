Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Saves California on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Saves California by entering its contract address – 2mtzeaYqDPLtCemX5jNPuuq8jw65cbgNUXuT3fBra2M2 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCALI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-15 23:11:00

Similarly, Chainlink(LINK) has endured a tragic month, as its value spirals downwards. Many long-time holders of these assets are now considering alternatives, and Remittix (RTX) has become a popular choice. This modern PayFi protocol brings solutions to the longstanding problems in the cross-border payments sector, and is gearing up to carve out a large piece of this market. So are Pepe (PEPE) and Chainlink (LINK) likely to see a price resurgence in 2025, and why are so many investors shifting funds to Remittix (RTX)? Solana Price Drops 19% In 30 Days Solana (SOL) has spiralled, losing more than 19% of its value in the last month alone, and having posted a similar loss in the last week. Industry commentators are torn over whether the most recent Solana price drop has been due to whale sell offs or a general downturn in the crypto market. Technological analysis shows that Solana (SOL) has dropped below key support levels, such as the $196 200-day Exponential Moving Average, representing a bearish trend. Perhaps more worryingly, Solana's Total Value Locked (TVL) has also fallen more than 7% in a day, indicating less trust in its ecosystem. Solana (SOL) still has a $86.74 billion market cap and remains an influential player in the crypto space, though its price trajectory is looking weak going into 2025. Chainlink Finds Itself On Thin Ice Chainlink ambled through 2022 and 2023 at snail pace before a major rally in November 2024, raising questions about whether Chainlink (LINK) could make a meaningful comeback. Despite recent losses, it still holds standing as one of more modern decentralized oracle networks, facilitating secure communication between smart contracts and real worlddata. Chainlink (LINK) too has had a poor start to 2025. Over the last 30 days, Chainlink lost 37.47% of its value and is also down 21.9% in the last week, now sitting at $18.97, down a staggering 64% from its ATH in 2021. Technically, Chainlink is trading in a descending wedge pattern, which is usually a bullish reversal indicator. The key resistance level to watch is $23.92, as a breakout above this could push Chainlink towards $30. Remittix Carves Out Its Place in Cross-Border Payment Space Remittix (RTX) has entered the PayFi space with a powerful offering as it sets out to address longstanding inefficiencies in the cross-border payments space. This is a $190 trillion industry in which Remittix (RTX) is considered a game changer due to its practical, real-life utility. Remittix lets users change over 40 cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies and transfer money directly to bank accounts worldwide, solving some of the biggest problems in global finance.

With support for over 30 fiat currencies and 50 cryptocurrency pairs, Remittix is ideal for freelancers, e-commerce platforms, and international service providers. Remittix Nears $2.8 Million Raised In Presale Proactive adopters of Remittix can seize up tokens at an alluring price of $0.0207 in the current phase of the presale , which has already attracted over $2.8 million in investment. Due to the project’s practical utility within a high value sector, analysts have anticipated an 800% increase by the presale’s end, followed by a potential 5,000% rally post-launch, positioning RTX as one of the most anticipated tokens in the market.

Similarly, Chainlink (LINK) has faced a challenging month, with its value on a downward trend. Long-standing investors in these cryptocurrencies are exploring other options, and Remittix (RTX) has emerged as a favored alternative. This innovative PayFi protocol aims to tackle the persistent issues in cross-border payments and is poised to seize a significant share of this market. So, will Pepe (PEPE) and Chainlink (LINK) see a price revival in 2025, and what drives so many investors to shift their focus to Remittix (RTX)? Solana Sees a 19% Decline Over a Month Solana (SOL) has taken a hit, shedding more than 19% of its value in just the past month and showing similar losses over the past week. Experts are divided on whether this recent drop in Solana's price is due to significant sell-offs by major investors or a general decline in the crypto market. Technical analysis reveals that Solana (SOL) has fallen below crucial support levels, such as the $196 200-day Exponential Moving Average, indicating a bearish trend. Adding to the concern, Solana's Total Value Locked (TVL) has also decreased by more than 7% in a single day, suggesting diminishing confidence in its ecosystem. Despite these setbacks, Solana (SOL) maintains an $86.74 billion market cap and remains a key player in the crypto space, although its price outlook appears weak as 2025 approaches. Chainlink Faces Uncertainty After trudging through 2022 and 2023 at a slow pace, Chainlink experienced a significant rally in November 2024, sparking discussions about whether Chainlink (LINK) could stage a meaningful recovery. Despite recent setbacks, it remains a leading decentralized oracle network, enabling secure interactions between smart contracts and real-world data. Chainlink (LINK) has also started 2025 on a poor note. Over the past 30 days, Chainlink has lost 37.47% of its value and is down 21.9% in the last week, now priced at $18.97, which is a significant 64% drop from its all-time high in 2021. From a technical perspective, Chainlink is trading within a descending wedge pattern, typically viewed as a bullish reversal signal. The critical resistance level to monitor is $23.92, as breaking through this point could propel Chainlink towards $30. Remittix Establishes Its Role in the Cross-Border Payment Industry Remittix (RTX) has entered the PayFi sector with a strong proposition, aiming to resolve long-standing inefficiencies in cross-border payments.

Remittix has drawn the interest of investors looking for high-growth prospects with its ground-breaking PayFitechnology, which is intended to transform international payments. Here's a deeper look at the progress with Tron growth, ADA price volatility, and PayFi innovation. Cardano Faces Market Volatility, but Investors Remain Optimistic A notable price correction just occurred for Cardano (ADA), which fell 10% on Monday and closed at $0.91. After a period of strong performance during which the asset posted a 17.8% gain last week, there was a drop. The fall was largely caused by macroeconomic concerns, such as inflation concerns brought on by better-than-expected U.S. job data. Despite the ADA price drop, Cardano remains a significant player in the cryptocurrency industry with $1.16 billion in open interest, suggesting investor optimism. Future developments, including the incoming U.S. administration's proposed crypto tax reforms, are stoking expectations for a possible recovery. According to analysts, Cardano ADA price may soon rise toward $0.99 if it sustains support at $0.90. Cardano's capacity to withstand market swings is demonstrated by its resilience, which also emphasizes the need for diversity. Many ADA holders are looking for new options like Remittixto enhance their portfolios as they navigate this turbulent time. Tron Growth Inspires Confidence Among Investors Tron (TRX) has demonstrated remarkable performance in the cryptocurrency space, with a 95% price gain in the last 12 months and an incredible 115.73% revenue growth in 2024. According to projections, Tron TRX may hit $0.50 by 2025 as a result of ongoing network expansion and uptake. Tron is a strong rival, even outperforming Ethereum and Solana in terms of profitability, with its emphasis on quick transactions and decentralized software. And so far, Tron growth has been impressive. Nonetheless, Tron investors are alert to the market's natural volatility and are searching for new ventures with substantial upside potential. Presenting Remittix, a revolutionary payment network that combines the ease of fiat money with the speed of cryptocurrency. With its innovative features and early-stage presale, Remittix offers a compelling opportunity for Tron investors to diversify and potentially maximize returns.

Cardano's Market Challenges and Investor Optimism Cardano (ADA) recently faced a significant price drop, falling 10% on Monday to close at $0.91.

Future developments, such as the upcoming U.S. administration's proposed crypto tax reforms, are fuelling hopes for a potential rebound.

Tron's Growth Fuels Investor Assurance In the crypto realm, Tron (TRX) has shown impressive performance, with its price surging 95% over the past year and an astounding 115.73% revenue increase in 2024. Projections suggest that Tron's TRX could reach $0.50 by 2025, driven by ongoing network growth and adoption.

As reported by Ali Martinez, an on-chain analyst, the number of transactions on the network has risen to above $1 million in the last few days. Source: X According to Martinez, within one day, Santiment registered 341 transactions of more than $1 million. These high volume value transfers are believed to be made by XRP whales, individuals or entities with large number of XRP holdings. Their entry demonstrates a pick up in market participation and confidence. XRP price new high XRP has also shown significant growth as it hit $3, the first time since its previous high of $3.84 in January 2018. At the time of writing, the token is trading at $2.94. XRP went up by 14.45% in the last 24 hours. Peter Brandt, a veteran trader, recently pointed out that the half-mast flag seen on the weekly chart of XRP should be completed within the next six weeks. A half-mast flag is a neutral pattern that has the potential to go either up or down. The consolidation phase usually indicates the probability of the continuation of the trend. Source: X According to Brandt, if the pattern completes bullishly, XRP’s market capitalization might attain $500 billion, a 262% increase and a potential price of $6.40. But Brandt pointed out that the pattern needs to “rock and roll soon,” otherwise it can switch to something else. This broader bullish trend has also been seen in the meme coins on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as well. Among the most popular tokens, ARMY, LIHUA, and DROP have increased the value significantly. ARMY rose by 26.52% to close at $0.1792, while LIHUA rose by 24.89% to $0.051588. At the time of reporting, DROP was also 26.10% up and was trading at $16.66. Most of these tokens are currently being traded on the Bitrue exchange. In the last week alone, DROP has surged by a massive 95.41%. Factors driving XRP’s recent surge The price surge is happening against the backdrop of increasing rumors of the possible approval of an XRP-based ETF. Also, the anticipation for new developments by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its lawsuit against Ripple.

Despite this development, BTC traders still look apprehensive as their strategy suggests they are still bearish on the current price action. Bitcoin Traders Turn Bearish Following Price Recovery In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that Bitcoin traders have turned bearish despite the price recovery above $97,000. The crypto analyst mentioned that the percentage of traders on Binance betting BTC will rise has declined from 66.35% to 55.22% over the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Has Entered Another Bull Cycle, Puts Price Above $20 This development is significant as these Binance traders have a track record of being right most of the time. While most traders (55.22%) are still longing BTC, the decline in those betting on a rise suggests that there is the possibility that the recent price recovery is just a relief bounce and not a bullish reversal. The Bitcoin price has recovered above $97,000 after dropping to below $90,000 two days ago. This recent rally could pave the way for the flagship crypto to reclaim the psychological $100,000 price level. Crypto analyst Jelle is confident that this could happen soon, as he stated that a price breakout above $97,000 could lead to new highs for Bitcoin. However, there is still a lot of market uncertainty, which could explain why some of these Bitcoin traders are choosing not to bet on a further rally despite the recent price recovery. Recent macro data have suggested that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to implement as many quantitative easing (QE) policies as compared to last year. This is bearish for the Bitcoin price since investors could become more skeptical about investing in this risk asset. On the other hand, Donald Trump’s incoming administration provides some optimism for market participants since the US president-elect has promised to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which would lead to greater adoption of BTC. BTC’s Market Structure Has Changed Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade also provided a bullish outlook for the Bitcoin price. In an X post, he stated that Bitcoin has shifted the market structure from a downtrend to an uptrend. He explained that when BTC was in a downtrend with lower highs and lower lows, it created an equal high, signaling a “change of character.” Related Reading: Analyst Who Predicted Bitcoin Price Crash To $89,000 Reveals Where BTC Is Headed Next Now, Bitcoin has broken through the resistance to form a higher high. According to Trader Tardigrade, if BTC maintains a higher low at the support/ resistance flip level of $96,000, it could start the bull run again. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the flagship crypto could reclaim $100,000 and then rally to new highs. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $97,300, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

HBAR price analysis shows Hedera trapped between $0.25 and $0.33, hinging on Bitcoin’s next move to break free. Similarly, Bitget Token (BGB) struggles with selling pressure, falling 26% from its ATH of $8.49, and facing resistance at $6.29-$6.48. While both tokens show potential, the clear winner emerging is BlockDAG (BDAG). With its PoW-powered technology, $180.5 million raised in presale, and the game-changing LAUNCH300 campaign offering a 300% bonus, BDAG is attracting whales and positioning itself as the next big Layer-1 network. The project’s momentum, supported by an upcoming mainnet launch, sets it apart as the most promising option for investors seeking exponential gains. BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 – 300% Extra Coins Attracts Crypto Whales In the cryptoverse, institutional giants are on the lookout for smart money and they often gain the first mover advantage. Spotting the next big layer 1 is troublesome for average buyers, but what if there’s a way to follow where the smart money went and join them. BlockDAG (BDAG) is a PoW based crypto that raised over 180.5 million through presale. No other major presale has recorded such massive inflow of money in the last 5 years. So shouldn’t we listen? The layer 1 termed the successor of Kaspa (KAS) is doing everything Kaspa did but much better. Similar to what Elon Musk did with the space industry, they reinvented the wheel and they are bold about it with out-of-the-world marketing stunts in crypto history. Now the team has launched one of the biggest offers till date – the code LAUNCH300 offers buyers with 300% extra BDAG coins for a limited time. Within a few hours of the campaign launch, the project recorded massive selling pushing the coins sold to 18 billion. The momentum can partly be attributed to the upcoming mainnet launch where the coin price is planned to hit $0.05. With an altcoin season in the background, this could be the ultimate coin that could trigger massive gains in short time. HBAR Price Analysis: Will Hedera Break Free From Its $0.25-$0.33 Range? Hedera (HBAR) has been stuck in a tight consolidation range between $0.25 and $0.33 for over a month, frustrating traders eager for a breakout. HBAR price analysis suggests that its future trajectory depends heavily on Bitcoin’s performance, with a 0.65 correlation indicating that HBAR often mirrors Bitcoin’s movements. Currently trading at $0.27, HBAR faces a critical test. A dip below $0.25 could signal further bearish momentum, while flipping $0.33 into support could pave the way for a rally toward $0.39. Much of this depends on Bitcoin reclaiming $100,000 and sparking a broader market rally. For investors, HBAR’s potential upside in a bullish Bitcoin-led market makes it a worthwhile consideration. While short-term risks remain, a breakout could deliver significant gains, especially as Hedera continues to develop its ecosystem. HBAR price analysis highlights a promising opportunity for those willing to take calculated risks. Bitget Token (BGB) Struggles as Selling Pressure Mounts—What’s Next for the Price? Bitget Token (BGB) has faced significant selling pressure, dropping from its all-time high of $8.49 on Dec. 27, 2024, to $6.25 at press time—a 26% decline. This drop comes amid profit-taking and reduced buying momentum, with on-chain data showing a decrease in holding time for transacted coins. Lower holding times often indicate rising selling activity, which could extend BGB’s downward trend in the short term. Resistance between $6.29 and $6.48, highlighted by the In/Out of Money Around Price (IOMAP) metric, adds further challenges. Unless buying volume increases, Bitget Token (BGB) could face difficulty reclaiming the $7 level. Technically, BGB is trading within a descending triangle, a bearish pattern that suggests potential further declines to support levels at $5.04 or even $4.22. However, a shift in momentum could push the price toward $7.24 if buying pressure strengthens. Takeaway Among the three, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out as the most compelling opportunity. Hedera, as shown in HBAR price analysis, depends heavily on Bitcoin’s performance, leaving its trajectory uncertain. Similarly, Bitget Token (BGB) faces mounting resistance and bearish patterns, with recovery relying on a shift in buying pressure. In contrast, BDAG has already demonstrated unmatched success with $180.5 million raised, a loyal whale-backed community, and the innovative LAUNCH300 campaign. With its presale price of $0.0248 and a potential listing price of $0.05, BDAG combines high growth potential with tangible momentum.

The breach resulted in the theft of nearly 120,000 Bitcoins, valued at approximately $12 billion today. Of this, $9.3 billion worth, equivalent to 94,643 Bitcoin, has been recovered and approved for return to Bitfinex. Court Ruling: No Victims Identified in Bitfinex Hack The DOJ stated in the court filing that no identifiable victims exist in the Bitfinex hack due to the exchange’s repayment measures and loss generalization policies. GOV’S ABOUT TO HAND BACK BITFINEX BITCOIN TO REAL OWNERS So, the US government’s making crypto history by talking about returning those Bitfinex hack Bitcoins they seized back in 2016. That’s millions in BTC, getting handed back to the OGs. Sounds like a plot twist, right?… pic.twitter.com/hCOvtuXj5b — Mario Nawfal’s Roundtable (@RoundtableSpace) January 15, 2025 The filing read: “For the foregoing reasons, there is no ‘victim’ for the specific offenses of conviction in this proceeding.” The 2016 hack exploited a vulnerability in Bitfinex’s multi-signature wallet system, allowing hackers to steal vast amounts of cryptocurrency. According to the DOJ , the stolen Bitcoin was laundered using advanced methods, including crypto-mixing services. The hack led to the conviction of Ilya Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather “Razzlekhan” Morgan. Lichtenstein was sentenced to 60 months in prison for money laundering, while Morgan received an 18-month sentence for assisting in laundering the stolen funds. Their cooperation enabled the recovery of 80% of the stolen Bitcoin, marking one of the largest asset seizures in DOJ history. Despite her legal troubles, Morgan, a rapper and social media personality, recently released a music video titled “Razzlekhan vs. The United States,” dedicated to “misfits.” She is scheduled to report to prison this month. January 28 Deadline for Bitfinex Users to File Restitution Claim s Following the hack, Bitfinex implemented a repayment program to address customer losses. The exchange reduced user account balances by 36% and issued BFX tokens as compensation. These tokens were redeemable for cash or convertible into equity in Bitfinex’s parent company, Ifinex. The company also issued Recovery Right Tokens (RRT) to address potential future recoveries. Bitfinex stated that its repayment program fully compensated users, though some have argued that Bitcoin’s price increase since 2016 has left them undercompensated. While Bitfinex will receive 94,643 Bitcoin, valued at $9.3 billion, not all stolen funds could be recovered due to the complexity of laundering transactions. The plea agreements facilitated voluntary restitution to Bitfinex, focusing on assets linked to the hack. Separate forfeiture processes address other laundered funds not directly tied to the stolen Bitcoin. As part of the restitution process, affected users have until January 28, 2025, to file claims or objections to the terms. The DOJ has established a mechanism for individuals identifying themselves as affected parties to submit their claims.

The impersonators extorted $855,000 from the victim, who believed she was sending the funds to assist her lover, Brad Pitt. Perpetrators of romance scams have long preyed on lonely individuals seeking companionship with various deceptive tactics. Over the years, these methods have become fairly easy to spot and evade. However, recent developments in artificial intelligence have shifted the balance of power back to the fraudsters. Anne meets Brad Pitt Anne’s ordeal began in early 2023 when she was contacted by someone claiming to be the actor’s mother, Jane Etta Pitt. The person impersonating Brad Pitt’s mother then introduced her to another individual claiming to be Brad, who then expressed romantic interest in her. Over 18 months, the scammers strengthened the relationship using AI-generated photos and messages on several platforms, including WhatsApp and Instagram. The communications apparently helped convince Anne of their identity. After a while, the fake Brad Pitt started to ask Anne for money, claiming he needed it for cancer treatment. The scammers claimed that Pitt’s bank accounts were frozen due to his divorce proceedings with his ex-wife, Angelina Jolie. Anne, though doubtful at first, ended up transferring the large sum of money to an account in Turkey after receiving an email from the doctor who claimed to be treating Pitt. “I’m not used to social media, and I didn’t really understand what was happening to me,” Anne told TF1. Anne only realized she was the victim of a scam after seeing pictures of Pitt with his current partner, Inés de Ramon. Anne shared her story on the French television channel TF1 and rather than compassion or comfort, she was hit with a wave of mockery and trolling from the viewers of the show. The backlash got so bad that the broadcast had to be removed. Explanation about the removal of the Brad Pitt AI romance scam from social media. Source: @7a8 (X) TF1 presenter Harry Roselmack posted on his account that the broadcast would be withdrawn from the station’s platforms in order to protect the victim. AI has become a useful tool for cybercriminals This incident is just one of the many similar schemes gaining popularity in recent years. In 2024, reported scams involving Brad Pitt impersonators in Spain led to the arrest of five individuals after they conned the sum of $350,000 from two women. In 2022, romance scams ranked second among the most costly scams reported in Canada, resulting in losses of $59M from 1400 reported cases. Similarly, such scams accounted for over $652M in lost funds in the US in 2023. Romance scams aside, advancements in artificial intelligence have also made the job of identity thieves and online fraudsters easier, contributing to over $8.8M in losses in the US. Artificial intelligence gives cybercriminals easy access to sophisticated tools that amplify the effectiveness of their scams. Using AI tools available to the average, non-paying user, anyone can generate images and create deepfake videos to populate a fake profile on dating platforms or social media.

The Injective ecosystem is rolling out the governance proposal for INJ 3.0, setting the stage to elevate INJ as a standout deflationary asset. On another exciting front, Filecoin (FIL) rides a bullish wave, posting a 5% gain this week after a robust 19% increase, thanks to Bithumb’s new trading pair announcement and compelling on-chain metrics. Meanwhile, the trailblazing decentralized e-commerce platform, Web3Bay , is capturing attention with its presale, amassing over $700K from selling 200 million tokens. This surge confirms Web3Bay’s rapid ascent beyond just a decentralized marketplace. Injective Ecosystem: Latest INJ 3.0 Rollout The Injective ecosystem, vital to DeFi applications, has introduced the INJ 3.0 governance proposal, targeting to secure INJ’s position as a foremost deflationary asset in the cryptocurrency realm. This proposal is geared toward slashing the token supply with advanced burning techniques and strategic supply reduction, aligning perfectly with Injective’s vision for a sustainable ecosystem. Highlighted features include bolstered staking rewards and streamlined procedures to cut down the circulating supply. Set to launch in stages throughout the year, INJ 3.0 is poised to offer enduring benefits for traders, stakers, developers, and ecosystem partners, with anticipated substantial growth in 2025 driven by this forward-thinking approach to tokenomics. Filecoin (FIL) Price Eyes the $8.42 Mark Filecoin’s price trajectory remains bullish, climbing 5% this week to about $6.20 after a 19% upsurge last week triggered by Bithumb’s listing of a new trading pair, boosting FIL’s exposure in South Korea. The optimism is reinforced by strong on-chain metrics, with Open Interest swelling to $358.30 million and Total Value Locked hitting $93.12 million, signaling robust network activity. Technical forecasts predict potential advances for Filecoin’s price toward $8.42, propelled by a 35% surge to the Fibonacci retracement level, contingent on sustained momentum. Web3Bay’s Decentralized Marketplace: Explosive $700K Presale in Just Days! The e-commerce domain is undergoing a seismic shift, and Web3Bay is at the forefront of this revolution. As a decentralized marketplace fueled by blockchain, Web3Bay restores power to users, eliminating intermediaries, concealed fees, and data misuse—enabling secure, transparent, and effective transactions. Contrasting traditional e-commerce platforms that often involve hefty fees, privacy risks, and dependency on fallible centralized systems, Web3Bay eradicates these problems by enabling users to retain ownership of their data and assets. Thanks to its blockchain foundation, Web3Bay ensures lower costs, swifter transactions, and enhanced security. Yet, the catch is: accessing this exceptional platform requires Web3Bay’s native token, 3BAY. Possessing the 3BAY token is crucial for engaging with Web3Bay’s unique offerings. Without it, users would miss out on reduced transaction fees and the chance to shape the platform’s future through governance participation, all while enjoying rewards. Securing 3BAY tokens during its presale is not only astute due to the current affordable price but also a gateway to potentially huge returns, with the token price set to soar from just $0.0039675 to $0.1959—an astounding 4,839% ROI opportunity for early investors. As the presale has already gathered over $700,000, an increasing number of crypto enthusiasts are seizing this opportunity, driving demand and price upwards. Those interested should act quickly to participate in the presale, securing tokens at a lower price. Web3Bay crypto isn’t just another token—it’s the cornerstone of a platform poised to redefine online commerce. In Conclusion In essence, the Injective ecosystem, Filecoin’s bullish price trajectory, and Web3Bay’s pioneering decentralized marketplace are collectively spearheading a transformation in the crypto arena for 2025. Injective’s INJ 3.0 plan introduces a strategic deflationary model aimed at boosting long-term sustainability and growth. Filecoin remains a key market driver with its optimistic price forecasts supported by vigorous on-chain activity and strategic updates. Meanwhile, Web3Bay steals the limelight by reinventing e-commerce with its blockchain-integrated platform, offering unparalleled user control, transparency, and cost efficiency. Web3Bay’s booming presale and innovative approach to Web3 commerce firmly establish it as one of the leading web3 crypto coins in decentralized marketplaces and digital trade, making it an opportunity not to be missed.

The new ETF will invest in digital asset transformation businesses and products, giving investors access to the emerging digital economy. The Onchain Economy ETF, which will trade under the ticker NODE, plans to invest at least 80% of its net assets in companies and assets that support the digital asset economy. The fund was proposed on January 15 and will have two main investment streams: “Digital Transformation Companies” and “ Digital Asset Instruments”. Source:SEC The Digital Transformation Companies include companies involved in activities that are vital to the digital asset industry. Some are crypto exchanges, payment gateway service providers, mining companies, and those that provide software or infrastructure for digital asset functioning. The ETF’s investment strategy also includes exposure to companies involved in energy infrastructure, data centers, and other technologies supporting the digital asset market. While other digital asset funds will invest in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, the Onchain Economy ETF will not do so directly. Instead, it will gain exposure to digital assets through companies and instruments closely related to the sector. This approach is useful as the fund can focus on firms essential for the expansion of the digital currency industry but do not hold digital currencies. VanEck’s head of digital assets research, Matthew Sigel, said that more information about the ETF would be disclosed in the coming weeks. Increased interest in Crypto ETFs VanEck’s application is just one of many crypto-related ETFs that have been proposed to the SEC. Financial firms are looking up as they expect new regulations under the newly reelected administration. Bitwise Asset Management applied for its 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF in the last quarter of 2024. These major digital assets are listed in the index, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). Likewise, WisdomTree filed an application for an XRP-related ETF in December 2024, and Grayscale applied to transform its Solana Trust into an ETF. BlackRock is expected to roll out a Bitcoin ETF product for Canadian investors. The new iShares product will trade on CBOE Canada. Bitwise also proposed a Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF, which would track firms that hold Bitcoin in their treasuries. As reported by Cryptopolitan, in just one year, US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) broke all the rules, holding 1.13 million Bitcoins. Bitcoin ETFs alone have already grown larger than gold ETFs in terms of AUM. Gold ETFs, for instance, have only taken 20 years to get to $128 billion in AUM. Bitcoin ETFs got to $107 billion in one year only.

Coins like XRP and WIF serve as prime examples of these high-growth tokens, which transitioned from under a $1 value to remarkable expansion throughout 2024. With 2025 on the horizon and brimming with optimistic potential, we've pinpointed some leading crypto coins that could follow a similar growth trajectory in Q1. Among these tokens are Tron (TRX), Stellar (XLM), and Lunex Network (LNEX) . But what makes these coins stand out? Tron (TRX) Set to Build on Current Bullish Trends Tron has entered the new year riding a wave of positive momentum. To provide some context, Tron's price surged by over 22% in December, holding strong above the $0.25 threshold. According to CoinMarketCap , Tron saw a 136% increase in value throughout 2024, with 64% of that growth occurring in the fourth quarter. This bullish momentum has lifted Tron into the top 10 cryptocurrencies, boasting a market cap exceeding $21.8 billion. After reaching an all-time high of $0.4407 in early December, Andrew Griffiths, analyzing the Tron price chart on X, observed that Tron's price is trending within a descending channel on the one-hour timeframe. A rebound could lead to a positive shift, with Andrew's target around $0.26. Coincodex concurs, predicting that Tron's price will likely reach $0.26 in the near future. Stellar (XLM) May Be on the Verge of a Bullish Surge Recently, Stellar has experienced a correction phase, with its value dropping over 28% in the past month, as reported by market stats . This follows a period of over 500% growth from November to December, during which the token reached a yearly high of $0.56. Despite this downturn, Stellar has managed to hold support above $0.30. Crypto analyst JavonTM1 notes that Stellar is nearing a convergence point, likely sparking another bullish wave in the coming weeks. The growing DEX volume, averaging an 80% increase recently, may also steer the token towards a bullish trend. More than 20 vital market indicators are signaling buy, and the altcoin is trading above the 50-day and 200-day SMA . Although current sentiment remains neutral, the surge in market activity could drive the price to $0.63, a short-term target set by Coincodex experts. This positions Stellar as a key crypto to watch in Q1. Anticipated Launch of Lunex Network (LNEX) as Presale Momentum Builds The launch of Lunex Network (LNEX) is expected before Q1 ends, unveiling its full potential. The ongoing presale is a chance for investors to become early adopters. To date, over 2.4 billion LNEX tokens have been sold, raising more than $6M in cryptocurrency ICO funding. This figure is projected to surpass $10M by the presale's close. With its distinctive use case and growth potential, the Lunex Network project is anticipated to increase by 100x before launch. Priced at $0.0054, this is the ideal time for investors to acquire the token. Early investors have already realized over 350% ROI in just a few weeks. Similar to BNB, the Lunex Network token LNEX offers substantial utility in the DeFi exchange. Beyond serving as listing fees in the Lunex Network trading exchange, holders benefit from transaction fee discounts and a profit-sharing model rewarding active LNEX holders with additional tokens. Investors can also stake the token for as little as 30 days to earn significant APY returns. In essence, the Lunex project operates as a DeFi protocol enabling fast, secure, and non-custodial cross-chain asset transfers. The mobile exchange provides access to over 50k crypto pairs, paving the way for numerous trading opportunities that could enhance user profits. Overall, Lunex Network is a standout DeFi coin not to overlook in Q1. Which Crypto Project Should Capture Investors' Attention? Both Tron and Stellar present high-potential opportunities, especially given their recent value gains. Meanwhile, Lunex Network offers an attractive investment alternative, allowing investors to earn profits even during its presale. With pioneering features like a portfolio tracker and a merchant payment gateway, the trading exchange's adoption is set to rise, likely propelling the LNEX price above $1 sooner than expected.

Although the Stellar market sentiment is neutral, the booming market activity is likely to propel the price towards $0.63, which Coincodex experts forecasted for the short term. This makes it one of the top crypto coins to watch out for in Q1. The Launch of Lunex Network (LNEX) Draws Closer Amid Surging Presale Momentum Before the end of Q1, Lunex Network (LNEX) will be launched, and its true potential will be revealed. The ongoing presale offers investors an opportunity to be early adopters of the project.

Chainlink or Remittix,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/which-one-of-these-should-you-invest-for-500-gains-in-january-chainlink-or-remittix,"Investors are looking for their next opportunity as the start of 2025 is expected to be very promising for the crypto market. Chainlink (LINK) is among the best cryptos among the more spoken names. Even market analysts like Captain Faibik have made a bold price prediction. Meanwhile, an emerging token named Remittix (RTX) is also gaining mass appeal. Remittix will disrupt the cross-border payments market, which Mordor Intelligence predicts could be worth $295B by 2029. Many investors are gravitating towards this rising presale star, which has already rewarded early buyers with a 36% return. They believe it may have higher upside potential in 2025, with numbers like 500% being mentioned. Captain Faibik: The Price of Chainlink (LINK) Could Reach $200 Chainlink (LINK) is one of the top crypto coins, but it has recently seen some red price charts. According to CoinMarketCap , its value has fallen from around $30 to below $20 in the past 30 days. In other words, the Chainlink price fell over 30% in just a few short weeks. But the community is still excited about Chainlink (LINK), thanks to bullish statements by market analysts like Captain Faibik. In his recent X post , he said this altcoin will reach $200 in this bull run. The technical analysis supports this Chainlink price prediction. TradingView data shows this crypto coin is valued above its 100-day EMA ($18). Additionally, its momentum indicator of -3.369 is in the buy zone and suggests an uptrend potentially coming for the Chainlink coin. Remittix (RTX) Seen as a New Contender With Massive Upside Potential While Chainlink (LINK) is experiencing some volatility right now, Remittix (RTX) is creating a lot of positive buzz. This is because of its great performance in the crypto ICO event. Notably, Remittix has seen seven price increases and raised over $2.8M in just three weeks. Early investors in this project are already 36% richer, and more price spikes are coming. Hype for Remittix is growing fast as it could dominate the cross-border payments market. Unlike Stripe or Wise, Remittix will launch a crypto-to-fiat platform that lets users convert 40 cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies like YEN or EUR. Afterward, they can be sent to any global bank account at a flat fee with no hidden costs for FX or wires. Plus, the Remittix Pay API will allow businesses to accept crypto payments, benefiting all parties involved. Those interested now buy its native token, RTX, at a discount. To incentivize purchases, Remittix will give all RTX holders governance voting rights and staking rewards. Currently, one RTX costs just $0.0207, but the next block of tokens will cost $0.0217. With the recent CoinMarketCap listing of this altcoin, demand for RTX is bound to increase. This factor, plus a projected top-tier crypto exchange listing, could trigger a massive rally for RTX soon. Chainlink (LINK) vs. Remittix (RTX) – Which Crypto Coin Could Surge First? Chainlink (LINK) and Remittix (RTX) are the altcoins to watch this quarter, as they could both see big price gains. However, Remittix stands out as it will have a smaller market cap than LINK, which means it will need less money for its price to grow. Additionally, its groundbreaking technology could make it a fan-favorite for millions of individuals in unbanked regions. Therefore, its long-term growth potential could also be better. Because of all these factors, many investors are turning to RTX as the best cryptocurrency to buy now for potential 500% gains.

Chainlink or Remittix,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/which-investment-could-yield-500-returns-in-january-chainlink-or-remittix,"As 2025 approaches, the crypto market is expected to offer exciting opportunities for investors. Chainlink (LINK) is one of the standout cryptocurrencies that has garnered significant attention. Even prominent market analysts like Captain Faibik have ventured bold predictions for its price. On the other hand, a new player called Remittix (RTX) is rapidly gaining popularity. This token is set to revolutionize the cross-border payments sector, a market that Mordor Intelligence forecasts could reach $295B by 2029. Many investors are flocking to this promising presale star, which has already delivered a 36% return to early adopters. They speculate it might offer even greater potential gains in 2025, with figures like 500% being suggested. Captain Faibik: Predicts Chainlink's (LINK) Price May Hit $200 Chainlink (LINK) remains a leading cryptocurrency, despite experiencing a downturn in recent price trends. According to CoinMarketCap , its value has dropped from approximately $30 to under $20 in the last month. In summary, Chainlink's price has decreased by more than 30% in just a few weeks. Nonetheless, the Chainlink (LINK) community remains optimistic due to the bullish outlook from analysts like Captain Faibik. In a recent X post , he predicted that this altcoin could soar to $200 during the current bull market. Technical analysis backs this Chainlink price forecast. Data from TradingView reveals that this digital asset is trading above its 100-day EMA ($18). Also, its momentum indicator at -3.369 suggests it is in the buy zone, hinting at a potential upward trend for Chainlink. Remittix (RTX): A Rising Star With Tremendous Growth Potential While Chainlink (LINK) faces some turbulence, Remittix (RTX) is generating significant excitement. Its impressive performance during the crypto ICO event has attracted attention. Remarkably, Remittix has experienced seven price hikes and raised more than $2.8M within just three weeks. Early backers of this venture have already seen a 36% increase in value, with further price surges anticipated. The buzz around Remittix is rapidly intensifying as it aims to lead the cross-border payments industry. Unlike services like Stripe or Wise, Remittix is set to introduce a crypto-to-fiat platform that enables the conversion of 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies such as YEN or EUR. These can then be transferred to any international bank account with a flat fee, avoiding hidden FX or transfer charges. Additionally, the Remittix Pay API will allow businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments, benefiting all users. Potential investors can acquire its native token, RTX, at a discounted rate. Remittix encourages buying by offering RTX holders governance voting rights and staking rewards. Currently, RTX is priced at $0.0207, but the cost for the next batch of tokens will rise to $0.0217. With its recent listing on CoinMarketCap, the demand for RTX is expected to grow. This, combined with an anticipated listing on a major crypto exchange, could spark a significant rally for RTX soon. Chainlink (LINK) and Remittix (RTX): Which Crypto Might Surge First? Chainlink (LINK) and Remittix (RTX) are two altcoins to watch this quarter, both holding the potential for substantial price increases. However, Remittix stands out due to its smaller market cap compared to LINK, meaning it requires less capital to drive its price upward. Moreover, its innovative technology could make it particularly appealing to millions in underserved regions. Consequently, its prospects for long-term growth might be superior. Considering these aspects, numerous investors are viewing RTX as the top cryptocurrency to invest in now for potential 500% returns.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/only-five-whales-hold-565-trillion-shib-heres-the-significance/,"The distribution of Shiba Inu tokens has come under scrutiny as five whale addresses now collectively hold 57% of the total supply, amounting to 565 trillion SHIB. This significant concentration of assets within a small number of wallets raises questions about potential market volatility and the implications for token decentralization. Among these wallets, one address alone accounts for 41.7% of the entire SHIB supply, highlighting a clear disparity between high-activity and low-activity holders. Such centralization could amplify market risks, particularly in the event of abrupt movements by these large holders. As a result, tracking the activity of these wallets is crucial for anticipating short-term price fluctuations and understanding broader market trends. SHIB On-chain Data Highlights Key Trends Recent on-chain data further sheds light on current dynamics. Over the past week, outflows from large holders have decreased by 31%, signaling reduced selling pressure from whales. This decline may contribute to greater price stability in the short term. On the other hand, inflows into large wallets have risen by 53%, suggesting that prominent investors are accumulating the token at lower price levels. From a technical perspective, the token’s price is above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) support level at around $0.00002079. If the price continues to hold above this critical threshold, this move could signal a potential shift in market sentiment. However, caution is still advised, as sustained upward momentum would require SHIB to break above resistance levels near $0.00002250 and $0.00002325. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Strategic Investor Accumulation Offers Hope The recent accumulation trends hint at growing interest from strategic investors seeking to capitalize on lower prices. Resistance levels at $0.00002250 and $0.00002325 remain key hurdles for the bulls, and breaking above these thresholds would be necessary to shift market sentiment in a positive direction. The centralization of SHIB holdings in a few wallets poses unique challenges for market stability. Large-scale transactions by these whales have the potential to significantly impact prices, underscoring the importance of monitoring their activity. As the token navigates its current support levels, market participants should approach cautiously, considering the heightened risk of volatility stemming from the concentration of assets. The coming days will likely be vital for the asset’s price trajectory. A sustained defense of the $0.00002079 support level and continued accumulation by larger players could lay the groundwork for a price rebound. However, the reliance on a small number of investors leaves the market vulnerable to sudden shifts, emphasizing the need for vigilance among traders and stakeholders. By closely observing wallet activity and technical indicators, market participants can better prepare for the potential outcomes of this concentrated asset distribution.

Trump’s Crypto Law (TRUMPLAW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPLAW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Crypto Law can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Crypto Law could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Crypto Law launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Crypto Law on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Crypto Law by entering its contract address – 7mYansF38wyaSvnj7C1Gr536FdMbGA4ufqY7PwzC7CxM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPLAW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|REGULATION|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-16 00:38:14

This perspective aligns with technical analysis of its previous price actions, which suggest an imminent shift in market dynamics. While PEPE has captured attention for its inherent volatility, a new AI altcoin, PropiChain (PCHAIN) , is making waves by redefining the crypto space with its innovative approach to real estate investment. Projections indicate that a PEPE price surge could act as a catalyst, triggering an impressive 15,000x growth for PCHAIN. Whale Moves and Market Shifts: Can PEPE Price Rebound Amid Rising FUD? Last year, the PEPE price reached an all-time high of $0.000028 on December 9, 2024, boasting a market cap of $7.20 billion. Currently priced at $0.00001670, the PEPE price bearish trend persists as it struggles to hold critical support levels. Over the past three months, the network activity has plummeted by 95.52%, signaling declining investor confidence and rising FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). However, the story isn’t entirely bleak. Whales are stepping in as key players, offering a glimmer of hope for the PEPE price recovery. In the past 24 hours alone, two significant whale purchases have infused over $8.72 million into PEPE, reinforcing its potential for a reversal. While the token remains vulnerable to further dips, bullish divergence in RSI and whale support could drive a rebound. The PEPE price uncertain trajectory for investors starkly contrasts PropiChain (PCHAIN), an upcoming AI altcoin offering tangible utility and a promising 15,000x growth potential. PropiChain (PCHAIN) Revolutionalizes Real Estate Investing With its AI Altcoin In contrast to speculative memecoins like PEPE, PropiChain (PCHAIN) offers tangible utility by integrating blockchain technology with the real estate market. PropiChain tokenizes real estate assets, allowing investors to purchase fractional ownership through digital tokens. PropiChain’s key feature is that it enables the tokenization of real estate assets into NFTs, simplifying ownership and trading. These digital assets allow users to purchase fractional shares of high-value properties, democratizing access to an industry traditionally dominated by high-net-worth individuals. AI plays a pivotal role in PropiChain’s operations, offering predictive market analysis, real-time property valuations, and automated transaction execution. With its AI tools, PropiChain enables users to identify the best investment opportunities, automate complex processes, and optimize returns. For instance, the platform’s predictive analytics empower investors to anticipate market shifts, while smart contracts , audited by BlockAudit, provide smooth and tamper-proof transactions, from leasing agreements to monthly rental payments. PropiChain also uses the immersive potential of the metaverse. Through its “Propiverse,” users can virtually explore properties in 3D, providing an interactive and comprehensive understanding of assets without needing physical visits. Security is another cornerstone of PropiChain. Each transaction is recorded on the blockchain via its “Title Contract,” ensuring transparency and mitigating risks like fraud or mismanagement. By eliminating intermediaries such as brokers and reducing dependency on traditional systems, PropiChain significantly lowers transaction costs and accelerates processes. The Golden Opportunity of the PCHAIN AI Altcoin Presale PropiChain’s presale is attracting significant attention from crypto enthusiasts eager to capitalize on this groundbreaking project. Currently priced at just $0.011 per AI-powered altcoin, early investors seize a rare opportunity to secure their position before prices escalate. With the third stage of the presale set to raise the price to $0.023 and an anticipated final listing price of $0.032, participants in this initial phase could enjoy an impressive ROI of up to 800%. Projections for PCHAIN are nothing short of extraordinary, with some analysts forecasting returns as high as 15,000x. Savvy investors recognize this as a pivotal moment to enter what could become one of the most lucrative AI altcoin opportunities of 2025. Beyond its speculative potential, PCHAIN is a gateway to revolutionary real estate investments, enabling users to purchase property NFTs, access DeFi applications, and use cutting-edge AI analytics. Currently listed on CoinMarketCap , early adopters also stand to gain additional benefits, including frequent airdrops, staking rewards of up to 225%, and the ability to use PCHAIN as loan collateral, making this a multi-functional asset with long-term value. While bullish forecasts suggest a possible rebound in the PEPE price, analysts predict a significant ripple effect that could amplify PCHAIN’s trajectory, potentially driving its value by over 15,000x. For investors seeking high-growth opportunities, this presale offers an unparalleled entry point.

This article looks into four best performing cryptos, offering traders well-informed insights to tailor their investment strategies effectively. Web3Bay, Chainlink, Filecoin, and Stacks each bring unique benefits that could make them prime candidates for substantial portfolio impacts. 1. Web3Bay: Lead the E-Commerce Evolution with 6430% ROI! Leading the charge, Web3Bay revolutionizes online shopping by harnessing layer-1 blockchain technology to enhance transparency and efficiency. Its platform is fortified with smart contracts that manage transactions, governance, and staking—each audited rigorously to minimize security risks and protect user assets. Integration with major crypto wallets like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and WalletConnect allows seamless asset management and reward generation directly from the platform, coupled with decentralized storage to safeguard user data against single-point failures. Currently priced at a mere $0.$0.0039675 in its third presale stage, the 3BAY token has already accumulated over $700,000 in sales. With an anticipated launch price of $0.1959, early adopters could potentially realize a 6430% ROI, positioning Web3Bay as one of the best performing cryptos for 2025. 2. Chainlink: Facilitating Real-World Connectivity for Blockchain Applications Chainlink continues to bridge the gap between blockchain smart contracts and real-world data, serving critical sectors like finance and supply chain management. With the introduction of its staking mechanism in 2022, LINK holders now play a pivotal role in securing the network, with ongoing enhancements aimed to bolster these capabilities through 2025. Chainlink’s strategic collaborations, including partnerships with Google Cloud and SWIFT, underscore its vital role in the blockchain infrastructure landscape. The platform’s consistent expansion and reliability make it a top Web3 crypto pick, poised for continued growth. 3. Stacks: Expanding Bitcoin’s Capabilities Stacks enriches the Bitcoin ecosystem by integrating smart contracts and decentralized applications, enabling developers to innovate on Bitcoin’s secure network without altering its foundational attributes. Looking ahead to 2025, Stacks is focused on scaling its platform and enhancing developer engagement. Its unique position as a bridge between Bitcoin and advanced blockchain functionalities opens new avenues for development and growth within the Web3 space. 4. Filecoin: Setting New Standards in Data Storage Filecoin is at the forefront of decentralizing data storage, offering secure and cost-effective solutions that allow users to monetize unused storage space. As concerns over data privacy mount, Filecoin’s model is increasingly relevant, providing a decentralized alternative that integrates seamlessly with burgeoning Web3 projects. With its innovative approach and alignment with current trends, Filecoin is poised to be a central player in the decentralized infrastructure, making it a key investment target for forward-thinking crypto enthusiasts. Wrapping Up These four best performing cryptos are not just participating in the Web3 revolution—they are actively shaping its future. Chainlink’s role in seamlessly connecting blockchains with external data, Filecoin’s innovative approach to data storage, and Stacks’ expansion of Bitcoin’s functionality illustrate the dynamic evolution of the crypto landscape. Above all, Web3Bay exemplifies the potential of smart contracts and decentralized systems in transforming e-commerce, offering users unprecedented control and security. With a launch price that hints at significant returns, the 3BAY token is an enticing prospect for investors seeking both innovation and profitability in 2025.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 308,500 followers on the social media platform X that DeFi lending platform Aave ( AAVE ) is flashing multiple bullish signs on the eight-hour chart. “AAVE [is] one of my favorite looking alts here, clear ABC down on the eight-hour chart, clear five waves within the C wave AND a cracking eight-hour bullish divergence brewing. T1 (tier-one) setup in my opinion.” Source: Bluntz/X Bluntz follows the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to witness a five-wave surge after completing an ABC correction. Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that AAVE has completed the ABC retracement with a bullish divergence to support his stance on a potential reversal. A bullish divergence is typically viewed as a reversal signal as it indicates that an asset’s momentum is rising even though its price is dropping or trading sideways. Bluntz seems to predict that AAVE will soar as high as $460 for the next leg up, a potential upside of about 56%. Looking at AAVE/BTC, Bluntz says the pair is also flashing a similar setup, suggesting that the coin is gearing up to outperform Bitcoin. “AAVE/BTC also looks identical, with a nice high time frame eight-hour bullish divergence.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, AAVE/BTC is trading for 0.003034 BTC worth $294.71.

Investors are closely watching this level, as holding it as support could signify a strong foundation for ADA to challenge higher resistance zones. Cardano Finds Strength To Rise After a recent sharp drop, Cardano (ADA) is showing resilience, finding the strength to rise and eyeing a push above last year’s high of $1.32. This recovery has sparked optimism among analysts and investors, many of whom are calling for a significant rally. Cardano is increasingly viewed as a strong contender to become a market leader, driven by its robust development ecosystem and expanding use cases. Top analyst Ali Martinez has shared compelling data highlighting growing interest from smart money investors. Posting on X, Martinez revealed a chart showing that whales have accumulated 100 million ADA over the past 48 hours. This substantial purchase underscores confidence among large holders that current price levels present a valuable buying opportunity, setting the stage for further upward momentum. This surge in whale activity aligns with broader expectations for Cardano to capitalize on its technological advantages and potential as a leader in the blockchain space. The cryptocurrency’s ability to attract significant capital from institutional and high-net-worth investors reinforces its potential to outperform in the coming months.

Successfully breaking this level would likely trigger a substantial rally, potentially propelling ADA into a new bullish phase. The coming days will be pivotal in determining whether Cardano can sustain this momentum and fulfill its promise of becoming a market frontrunner. ADA Bulls Eye Key Levels Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $1 after briefly reaching $1.05 earlier in the session. The price is consolidating and seeking support at the psychologically significant $1 level. If this key support holds, the next target for ADA is $1.15, a resistance level that could open the doors to further gains. Market sentiment around ADA remains cautiously optimistic. As a result, holding the $1 mark would signal strong demand and set the stage for a potential surge as bullish momentum builds. A breakout above $1.15 could lead to an extended rally, potentially revisiting previous highs and entering a new bullish phase. However, losing the $1 support would suggest that demand is faltering. In this scenario, ADA could see a drop to its next major support level around $0.91, putting additional pressure on bulls to regain control.

Therefore, traders and investors are closely watching for signs of strength or weakness that could dictate the altcoin’s short-term trajectory. Whether Cardano can maintain its footing above $1 will determine whether the recent recovery evolves into a sustained rally or another period of consolidation.

Concurrently, Tron trends suggest an approaching downturn, highlighted by a 45% drop from its 2024 peak. Amid these fluctuations, BlockDAG (BDAG) is launching pivotal updates that are capturing widespread attention. Its presale has successfully amassed $180.5 million, as it prepares for imminent listings on ten secondary exchanges. Furthermore, BlockDAG’s advanced Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain and its dynamic “Affiliate Program” offering up to 10% USDT cashback are solidifying its reputation among the upcoming popular crypto coins for 2025. Sui Foundation Drives Growth in Its DeFi Ecosystem In an extraordinary fourth quarter of 2024, the Sui Foundation documented a surge in growth and strategic initiatives. Sui’s ecosystem saw its TVL reach a new high of $1.8 billion, with the total trading volume escalating to $44.3 billion—a notable 444.79% rise from the previous quarter. This growth of the Sui foundation has been propelled by the introduction of stablecoins and sophisticated protocols such as DeepBook and Suilend. Strategic partnerships, like those with SatLayer and Babylon Labs, which incorporated Bitcoin liquidity, have further broadened Sui’s ecosystem. These developments underscore the Sui Foundation’s crucial influence in crafting a resilient and expanding DeFi network. Tron Trends Point to Decline as TRX Plummets 45% Tron’s (TRX) trends are nearing a pivotal threshold as it faces a significant 45% decline from its peak in 2024. Despite surpassing Ethereum with a $2.19 billion blockchain revenue last year, TRX is struggling to uphold its growth momentum. Presently at a decisive point, Tron trends hint at a likely reevaluation of its long-term support level around $0.20. Bearish indicators from technical analysis tools like the RSI and MACD amplify the uncertainty, making Tron’s upcoming moves critical for its market standing. BlockDAG Readies for Major Exchange Listings BlockDAG is gearing up to transform its presence in the cryptocurrency market with upcoming listings on 10 tier-two and tier-three exchanges, enhancing its visibility and liquidity. This strategic expansion is intended to make BDAG a recognizable name among global crypto enthusiasts. The company is integrating its cutting-edge Proof-of-Work blockchain to build a scalable, decentralized financial system, with exchange listings already secured in preparation for its 2025 Mainnet launch. The addition of the BlockDAG Affiliate Program offers up to 10% USDT cashback for referrals and a steady 6% back on purchases, promoting community involvement and turning social networks into profitable platforms. The program resets rewards daily at 00:00 UTC, motivating users to maximize their earnings and boosting excitement within the BDAG community. BlockDAG’s market initiatives have led to a highly successful presale, with revenues exceeding $180.5 million and over 17.8 billion coins sold. With the price of BDAG at only $0.0248 in its latest batch and an impressive 2,380% ROI since its inception, buyers are eager to capitalize on these gains before further listings potentially elevate prices. Projections place BDAG’s value at $1 within the year, positioning it among the most sought-after crypto coins. Its community-driven Affiliate Program, combined with strategic exchange listings, underscores its commitment to sustained growth and broad accessibility, providing substantial returns and advantages for early adopters. Highlighting the Most Popular Crypto Coins The Sui Foundation’s significant DeFi achievements underscore its leadership in nurturing a robust ecosystem. Meanwhile, Tron’s (TRX) position as a top revenue generator, despite current market challenges, emphasizes the need for strategic market navigation. BlockDAG’s robust presale outcomes and its compelling Affiliate program, rewarding up to 10% USDT cashback, have established it as one of the popular crypto coins to watch in 2025. As it gears up for more exchange listings, the ongoing interest from traders and developers signifies a bright future for BlockDAG in the competitive cryptocurrency landscape.

This would position our state at the… pic.twitter.com/dRdCt86Otr — Charles Schwertner (@DrSchwertner) January 15, 2025 Texas is pushing to lead Bitcoin adoption Senator Charles Schwertner emphasizes that Texas should lead in adopting Bitcoin. This proposal could allow the state to collect taxes, fees, and donations in BTC. With President-elect Trump’s inauguration just a week away, Republican state leaders will relentlessly try to adopt BTC as a strategic reserve asset—at least at the state level, if not as a national reserve. Texas has the second-largest economy in the U.S. and the eighth-largest globally. It also has the highest concentration of Bitcoin miners in the country. The call for a national strategic Bitcoin reserve – one of President-elect Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly campaign promises – has grown stronger since the election. Bitcoin has risen by more than 45% as optimistic investors bet that establishing such a reserve will further boost its price. U.S. states and countries are actively exploring Bitcoin reserves as a market catalyst While there is some skepticism about whether the U.S. will establish a Bitcoin reserve or if it does, whether it will be the first, the mere prospect of it could act as a positive market catalyst in the new year. This could prompt other nations to create their own reserves, even if the U.S. does not follow through. Several states are eager to take the lead in this new area. Oklahoma Representative Cody Maynard introduced House Bill 1203, dubbed the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act. The bill proposes allocating some of the state’s pension funds and savings accounts to Bitcoin. At the end of last year, Pennsylvania lawmakers proposed that the state Treasury invest up to 10% of its assets in Bitcoin. Representative Mike Cabell emphasized that Pennsylvania could follow private asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity. On January 10, North Dakota and New Hampshire also introduced their own Bitcoin reserve bills. New Hampshire’s legislation uses broader terminology, like “ digital assets, ” which indicates a potential interest in cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin.

On Jan. 15, 2025, asset management company VanEck filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the “Onchain Economy” exchange-traded fund. Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of digital assets research, disclosed the filing in a now-deleted social media post, revealing the company’s ambitious plans to invest in the rapidly growing digital transformation sector. Deleted a post on an ETF filing. Details coming soon — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) January 15, 2025 The proposed ETF aims to allocate at least 80% of its assets to businesses and products within the digital asset ecosystem. These include software developers, mining firms, cryptocurrency exchanges, infrastructure providers, payment firms, and other crypto-focused companies collectively referred to as “Digital Transformation Companies.” VanEck outlined a strategic selection process for these investments, emphasizing fundamental research, market trends, valuation, and each company’s role in the broader digital asset ecosystem. While the fund will not directly hold cryptocurrencies, it plans to invest in digital asset products such as commodity futures contracts. VanEck’s application is part of a broader wave of activity in the ETF market, driven by speculation that the regulatory environment may become more favorable for cryptocurrencies under President Donald Trump’s administration. Bitwise Asset Management applied in November 2024 for its 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF, which tracks leading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and Solana ( SOL ).

The value of the recovered assets has appreciated by 16,618.31% to $11.97 billion from $72 million at the time of the hack. As crypto investors prepare for an eventful year under Trump’s incoming administration, the U.S. government has given a glimmer of hope to victims who lost their Bitcoin holdings in August 2016 from a hack on the Bitfinex crypto exchange. The U.S. government announced that the funds seized from the hack’s recovery operation should be reimbursed to victims through “in-kind” restitution. U.S. court rules that funds from Bitfinex hack must be returned to the exchange As expected *GOVT SAYS SEIZED BITCOIN FROM 2016 BITFINEX HACK SHOULD BE RETURNED IN-KIND Do they just ask Paolo for the addy? https://t.co/8iwx6J1XR6 pic.twitter.com/ndNd1UrdWG — db (@tier10k) January 15, 2025 According to an official document circulating online, a US court ordered that the US government should return the funds seized from the Bitfinex crypto hack back to the exchange. The court also ordered the U.S. government to notify all victims of the hack. The court also ruled that the government should post a link on the Department of Justice website directing potential victims to the case’s specific website where all vital information will be relayed. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia filed a legal motion in October last year where it identified the Bitfinex crypto exchange as the only entity eligible for restitution after the hack. The hack resulted in the loss of 120,000 Bitcoin worth $72 million at the time meaning that each Bitcoin was valued at around $600. The digital assets were recovered and have been in the custody of the government since then. A 2023 report from Chainalysis revealed that FBI, IRS Criminal Investigation, Homeland Security Investigations, and other government agencies initially recovered over 94,000 BTC. Further recovery efforts ran till June 2023 and brought the recovered assets to 108,068 Bitcoin. The recovered digital assets are worth $11.87 billion in today’s Bitcoin prices. This makes asset recovery rank among the top most valuable crypto recoveries in history. The victims literally made 16,618.31% if the government executed the reimbursement process. The U.S. government arrests charges and sentences Bitfinex hack perpetrators The U.S. government arrested and charged two individuals, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Rhiannon Morgan, on counts of money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to defraud the United States as part of the charges related to the 2016 Bitfinex attack. On November 14th, 2024, Ilya Lichtenstein was sentenced to five years in prison for participating in a money laundering conspiracy arising from the hack and theft of approximately 120,000 bitcoins from Bitfinex, a global cryptocurrency exchange. On the other hand, his accomplice and wife Morgan was sentenced to 18 months for helping her husband launder the stolen funds. U.S. Government linked address compromised for $20 million While in government custody, on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence showed something fishy happened. In October last year, about $20 million in digital assets that were believed to be the proceeds of the Bitfinex hack were moved from the government-controlled wallet in what appeared to be suspicious activity. The funds were moved into a relatively new wallet at the time that was five days old. From there, the wallet owners moved the stolen funds through various blockchain accounts in what seemed like an attempt to conceal the funds’ source. Some funds found their way into instant exchanges that derive their liquidity from Binance and are typically used for money laundering activities. The incident was not officially reported and the reason for the transactions remained unknown. The event occurred in 24 hours and the majority of the funds were returned to the government-controlled wallet. Theories suggest that the incident originated from compromised keys following the speed at which the recovery process was accomplished.

Social Media Is Now Bullish On Dogecoin, Solana, & Cardano In a new post on X, the analytics firm Santiment has discussed what sentiment the traders on social media currently hold toward the various top assets in the cryptocurrency sector. The metric of relevance here is the “Positive/Negative Sentiment,” which, as its name suggests, tells us about how the bullish and bearish sentiments related to a given asset compare on the major social media platforms. Related Reading: Massive Dogecoin Rally Incoming? Experts Point To Over 1,000% Upside This indicator works by putting the posts/comments/messages present on the platforms through a machine-learning model to separate between positive and negative ones. It then takes the ratio of these counts to calculate the net situation around the coin. When the Positive/Negative Sentiment has a value greater than zero, it means the bullish posts outweigh the negative ones. On the other hand, it being under the mark implies the investors as a whole share a negative sentiment. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the indicator for six top coins: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA): As displayed in the above graph, the Positive/Negative Sentiment has witnessed an increase for Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano recently, suggesting the sentiment around the assets has improved. Out of these, traders are the most positive toward SOL, with its bullish comments being around six times the bearish ones. The metric has a value of around 3 for ADA and 2 for DOGE. The improvement in sentiment for Dogecoin and others has come after a sector-wide rebound in prices. Interestingly, while the bullish wave has made investors more optimistic about these coins, it has failed to do so in the case of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, the top three cryptocurrencies by market cap. The indicator is sitting close to the neutral zero level for these assets, which implies there are about as many positive posts as negative ones. This fact, however, may not actually be bad for BTC and the crypto market. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Fun Will Begin When This Flip Happens Historically, digital assets have tended to show moves in a direction that’s opposite to the expectations of the majority. This means that an overly bullish crowd can lead to tops, while an extremely bearish one can result in bottoms. Thus, the hype around Dogecoin, Solana, and Cardano may act to the detriment of their prices, while Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP could have bullish room to run before they reach a top. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.352, up more than 2% over the past week.

While meme coins wobble under market pressures, 1FUEL is charging forward. Its presale has already raised $1.3 million, with early adopters seeing prices jump from $0.01 to $0.017 and there’s still a 20% bonus for those getting in now. If you’re hunting for the next big thing, 1FUEL’s mix of privacy, utility, and innovation might just be it. Read on to find out more! Pudgy Penguins and PENGU: Can this bird fly higher? PENGU, the cryptocurrency tied to the adorable yet wildly popular Pudgy Penguins NFTs, is back in focus. Its recent rally above $0.032 was no fluke, breaking out of a falling wedge pattern has put it in the bull’s crosshairs. Still, the numbers tell a complicated story. A $1.9 billion market cap and $328 million in daily trades showcase its market heft, yet the token is still 55% down from its ATH of $0.06845. That drop, combined with a 10% slide over the last two weeks, reveals the fragility of its recovery. Investors eyeing this project are asking a tough question—can PENGU truly rise, or are we looking at another false dawn? Is Dogwifhat losing its bark? Dogwifhat once led the pack in meme coin mania, roaring past expectations with social media hype and massive exchange listings. Today, though, WIF’s bark has quieted. Trading between $1.39 and $1.86 , WIF is testing a crucial support level. Falling 68% from its $4.83 ATH, it’s simply a shadow of its former self. The 40% drop over the past month is more than market turbulence. A strengthening US Dollar and tighter monetary policies have clipped WIF’s wings. While WIF’s $1.5 billion market cap and $240 million trading volume remain impressive, they mask the real story: volatility. WIF’s wild swings attract thrill-seekers but spook long-term backers. Analysts aren’t ready to write it off, though—if WIF stabilizes, it could stage a comeback. But for now, WIF’s path forward looks as unpredictable as its rise to fame once did. What’s making 1FUEL the best cryptocurrency to buy right now? At 1FUEL’s core is a revolutionary cryptocurrency wallet, designed not just for storage but as a gateway to secure, cross-chain transactions and unmatched privacy. It is built for the complexities of today’s multi-chain world. With cold storage, a built-in mixer, and intuitive design, it’s a leap forward. The dev team is laying the groundwork for P2P trading, creating a network effect where every new user enhances the ecosystem. And for those who crave passive income, staking rewards of up to 30% APR are on the table. With virtual debit cards also in the pipeline, 1FUEL’s promising to merge crypto with real-world spending in ways that feel natural. Presale stages 1 and 2 sold out at lightning speed, raising over $1.3 million. Prices have already climbed 70% to $0.017, and analysts predict this is just the beginning. Unlike PENGU and WIF, which hinge on trend cycles, 1FUEL is the best cryptocurrency to buy right now for its practical applications and room to grow. The bottom line Meme coins like PENGU and WIF may thrive on chaos, but 1FUEL is building a foundation for the long haul. Early backers are already seeing gains, and with a presale price of just $0.017 and a 20% bonus still on the table, the window for getting in early is closing fast. The market is already responding, but the best gains might still be ahead.

While these tokens have enjoyed viral success, emerging platforms like Lightchain AI are redefining what it means to build value in the crypto space. With a focus on utility and long-term growth, Lightchain AI’s momentum could spell trouble for speculative tokens reliant on social hype. Limitations of Dogecoin and Pepe Coin Dogecoin and Pepe Coin, both well-known joke coins, have clear limits. Dogecoin’s endless supply can cause inflation which may lessen value with time. Its dependence on social media and famous people ͏makes it weak to changing market feelings causing price ups and downs. Also, Dogecoin’s lack of growth with few changes brings worry about its ability to compete. Pepe Coin, though using funny internet images, has no real usefulness, working mostly as a gamble. This lack of true uses leads to big ups and downs and makes it easy to mess with in the market. The unknown group behind its making adds more worry about trust and responsibility. Both digital coins rely on group support and excitement, showing how they are risky to put money in for buyers. Lightchain AI Future of Blockchain Innovation Unlike Dogecoin and Pepe Coin, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a pioneer in blockchain technology, addressing real-world challenges with a forward-thinking approach. Currently in its Stage 12 presale, priced at $0.00525, and having raised over $10.4 million, Lightchain AI has already demonstrated its ability to attract investor confidence. Lightchain AI focuses on creating a scalable and efficient blockchain ecosystem designed to support diverse applications. Its emphasis on decentralization and energy efficiency ensures it can meet the growing demands of industries and developers without compromising sustainability. By targeting meaningful applications and solving critical challenges in the blockchain space, Lightchain AI is building an infrastructure for long-term success, making it a strong contender for future market leadership. What This Means for Meme Tokens The rise of projects like Lightchain AI highlights the market’s shift toward utility-driven platforms that deliver lasting value. While Dogecoin and Pepe Coin may continue to draw attention in the short term, their speculative nature makes them less competitive against innovative solutions with real-world applications. For investors, this signals the importance of diversifying portfolios to include projects like Lightchain AI , which offer both growth potential and practical utility. Plus, with the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the demand for efficient blockchain technology will only continue to grow. As a result, projects like Lightchain AI that prioritize scalability and sustainability are positioned to thrive in this evolving landscape.

Understanding these shifts is crucial for prospective buyers to determine the most promising crypto investments for the upcoming year. SUI’s market cap is rapidly approaching a significant milestone of $16 billion, propelled by recent strategic developments. Simultaneously, Chainlink has registered an impressive 18% increase, largely driven by significant whale purchases. However, BlockDAG (BDAG) is establishing itself with a standout feature of dual compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM), positioning it as a potential leader in the meme coin arena. The platform’s success is underscored by its robust presale performance, with substantial funds raised, indicating strong market confidence. SUI Market Cap: Close to a $16 Billion Achievement The SUI cryptocurrency is rapidly gaining momentum, with its market capitalization approaching a robust $16 billion, making it the 12th largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap. The price of SUI has recently surged to about $5.09, reflecting an 8% increase. This notable rise in value comes in the wake of the unlocking of 82 million SUI coins, which has significantly enhanced the trading volume. Additionally, the network’s open interest has witnessed a substantial 37% rise, climbing to $1.22 billion. This surge in market activity and investor interest underscores the growing confidence in SUI’s potential and its strengthening position in the cryptocurrency market. Chainlink Whales: Indicators of an 18% Increase Chainlink (LINK) has experienced an 18% surge, largely driven by significant purchases from Chainlink whales. These major investors have snapped up over 1.4 million LINK following a price dip to a support level around $19, suggesting a potential rally ahead. This uptick in whale activity underscores LINK’s resilience in a fluctuating market and indicates growing investor confidence. Additionally, a decrease in exchange outflows points to fewer holders selling their LINK, supporting a bullish forecast for Chainlink as it potentially tests higher resistance levels soon. BlockDAG’s Dual Compatibility: A Foundation for Meme Coins BlockDAG (BDAG) is emerging as a top destination for meme coin creation in 2025, swiftly establishing itself as a premier platform in this niche. Its standout feature is the exceptional compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM), which allows developers to utilize robust programming languages like Rust and C++. This dual compatibility not only simplifies the deployment of dApps and smart contracts but also opens doors to scalable, cross-platform applications. As meme coins continue to captivate the crypto community, BlockDAG is positioning itself at the forefront of this trend for 2025. The platform is also attracting significant attention from large buyers. During its 27th crypto presale, BlockDAG has already attracted over $180.5 million, with 17.8 billion coins snapped up by eager buyers. Thanks to its focus on low fees, quick transaction confirmations, and a developer-friendly ecosystem, BlockDAG is drawing both individual and institutional interest. The platform is buzzing with new token creations, games, and decentralized applications tailored for the meme coin market. Now is a pivotal time for traders. The ongoing Batch 27 presale presents a unique chance to get in on the action before prices take off. Currently priced at $0.0248, BlockDAG has delivered an impressive 2380% return since its first batch, positioning it as a must-buy for those looking to capitalize on early gains. With growing excitement within the community and continued assets from whales, the potential for significant returns is clearer than ever. Why BlockDAG is the Prime Crypto Pick for 2025 The evolution of the crypto market in 2025 features significant developments with SUI’s market cap growth and Chainlink’s whale-driven price increase. However, BlockDAG sets itself apart with its unique EVM and WASM compatibility, enhancing developer flexibility and scalability. This positions BlockDAG as a leading platform for meme coin creation, attracting significant stakes and offering promising returns. As such, BlockDAG is poised as the top cryptocurrency to jump in for both seasoned and new buyers in 2025.

Remember when Dogecoin first took off? It wasn’t just a joke; it turned into a legit investment vehicle! The wild ride of meme coins has captured the imagination of millions, from Gen Z to seasoned investors. But with so many options out there, it’s tough to know where to place your bets. If you missed the Pepe Coin wealth train, don’t worry— BTFD Coin is here, and it’s primed to shake things up in the meme coin arena. What makes BTFD Coin stand out in this crowded market? For starters, it’s not just another meme coin riding the coattails of internet humor. BTFD Coin is introducing features that elevate its status: a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , an enticing referral program, and eye-popping staking rewards with a 90% Annual Percentage Yield (APY). Seriously, who wouldn’t want to be part of a project that’s not only fun but also financially rewarding? As the presale heats up, analysts are buzzing about BTFD Coin’s potential to be one of the top new meme coins to invest in now. So, if you’re looking to dive into the crypto world, this could be your golden ticket. Let’s break down what makes BTFD Coin the talk of the town and how it compares to its predecessor, Pepe Coin. BTFD Coin: The Next Big Thing in Meme Coins Let’s kick things off with what BTFD Coin brings to the table. Currently, in its 13th presale stage, BTFD is priced at $0.000142, a jump from its initial presale price of just $0.000004. With over $5.2 million raised and over 64 billion $BTFD coins sold, the enthusiasm is palpable. But it’s not just about numbers; it’s about community and engagement. One of the standout features is the recently launched Play-to-Earn game , which went live on January 1, 2025. Imagine diving into a gaming experience where you can earn tokens while having a blast. It’s not just about holding coins anymore; it’s about actively participating in a fun ecosystem that rewards you for your time. This game isn’t just a gimmick; it’s a real way for users to earn and engage, making it one of the top new meme coins to invest in now. Then there’s the staking program, which kicked off on December 2, offering an astonishing 90% APY. That’s right—90%! This is a game-changer for anyone looking to grow their investment without lifting a finger. Just lock up your coins, sit back, and watch your wealth accumulate. And let’s not overlook the referral program, which incentivizes users to spread the word and earn even more. The more you share, the more you earn—it’s a win-win!

If you invest $10,000 now, you could see significant returns when the coin lists at $0.0006. That’s a potential profit of over $15,000! Who wouldn’t want to jump on that train? Pepe Coin: The Meme Coin Classic Now, let’s take a look at Pepe Coin, which has been a staple in the meme coin universe. Launched to capitalize on the beloved internet meme of the green frog, Pepe Coin quickly gained traction. It captured the hearts of many, much like Dogecoin did, and it became a darling of social media. Its rise was fueled by an enthusiastic community that rallied around the meme culture, but as we know, the crypto landscape is notoriously volatile. While Pepe Coin still has a loyal following, the question remains: has it peaked? Many investors are beginning to wonder if it can sustain its momentum in a market that’s constantly changing. Analysts have mixed feelings. Some believe Pepe Coin will continue to have a place in the meme coin arena, while others suggest that newer coins like BTFD are better bets for the future. Community engagement has been a strong point for Pepe Coin, driven by social media buzz and meme creation. However, as newer coins introduce innovative features, investors may find themselves looking for fresh opportunities. The initial excitement around Pepe Coin was undeniable, but will it be enough to keep investors interested? It’s a gamble, and one that’s led many to explore alternatives like BTFD Coin. In the end, while Pepe Coin has laid the groundwork for meme coins, it’s becoming increasingly clear that the market is shifting. Investors are hungry for new opportunities, and with BTFD Coin’s robust features and active community, it’s hard not to see why many are calling it one of the top new meme coins to invest in now. Conclusion: Seize the Opportunity with BTFD Coin In a world where meme coins continue to rise and fall, BTFD Coin is carving its niche as a compelling investment opportunity. With its innovative features, strong community support, and the buzz surrounding its presale, it’s quickly becoming one of the top new meme coins to invest in now. If you missed the Pepe Coin wealth train, don’t fret; BTFD Coin is ready to take you on a new ride. So, what are you waiting for? Dive into the BTFD Coin presale and make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity. Get involved, spread the word, and watch your investment grow.

The case, originally filed in December 2020, centers on whether Ripple’s sales of XRP to retail investors constitute unregistered securities transactions. US SEC Disagrees with Lower Court’s Ruling on Retail XRP Sales In its appeal brief filed on Wednesday evening, the US SEC stated that the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York made a mistake in the ruling issued in July 2023. The district court had held that Ripple’s programmatic sales of XRP to retail investors through cryptocurrency exchanges did not violate federal securities laws. The SEC claims that every XRP sale, no matter which particular seller has conducted the sale or how the sale was made, constitutes an “investment contract” in terms of the Howey Test. The agency argues that Ripple’s promotion activities gave a perception that investors, including retail buyers, were likely to make profit out of the XRP. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP @Ripple The @SECGov has filed its opening brief. https://t.co/v0YTjHGxzV — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) January 15, 2025 “The district court’s decision that retail buyers could not have reasonably expected gains from Ripple’s efforts because they purchased XRP anonymously through crypto platforms was in error,” the US SEC stated in its brief. It also noted that, representations made by Ripple for promotion of XRP were equally as much available to institutional and retail investors. Ripple Faces Allegations of Boosting XRP Demand In the SEC filing, the agency alleges that Ripple used the sales of XRP to inflate its demand and value in the market. The SEC alleged that Ripple published information regarding the token, on its website, social media, and in the media, with the aim of generating buy orders and, thus, profit expectations among investors. The agency claims that these actions made both institutional and retail investors treat XRP as a security that relies on Ripple’s growth. Further, the SEC also disputed the court’s ruling to exclude XRP received in non-cash transactions including in employee compensation and business incentives from securities laws. Nevertheless, Ripple continues to argue that XRP is a digital currency and not a security, and therefore, the sales of XRP cannot be considered as an investment contract under the law. Amid the ongoing case, defense attorney James K. Filan ealier noted that both Ripple and the SEC had submitted a stipulation regarding the ongoing cross-appeals process. According to Filan, both parties have agreed to file a deferred appendix 21 days after the appellee’s opening brief is served. Ripple CLO Dismisses SEC Arguments Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, called the SEC’s appeal “a rehash of already failed arguments.” In an X post, Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty suggested that the case would likely lose momentum under the next SEC administration as Chair Gary Gensler prepares to step down on January 20, 2025. Moreover, President Trump has nominated Paul Atkins, known for his crypto-friendly stance, to lead the agency. Ripple has argued throughout the case that XRP should not be classified as a security under U.S. law. The company points to the district court’s partial ruling, which stated that programmatic sales of XRP did not meet the Howey Test criteria. The legal battle began in 2020 when the SEC accused Ripple of raising $1.3 billion through unregistered XRP sales. In July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s direct sales to institutional investors violated securities laws but found that programmatic sales and distributions did not. Despite the ongoing Ripple case, XRP’s price has surged recently, reaching $3, for the first time since 2018 amid projections of a rally to $6. This price increase reflects optimism about potential regulatory changes under the incoming SEC leadership.

ETH is rising and facing hurdles near the $3,480 zone. Ethereum started a minor recovery wave above the $3,240 zone. The price is trading above $3,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a short-term contracting triangle with resistance at $3,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it clears the $3,480 resistance level. Ethereum Price Gains Over 5% Ethereum price started a recovery wave above the $3,150 level like Bitcoin . ETH was able to clear the $3,180 and $3,240 resistance levels to move into a short-term positive zone. Besides, there was a break above a short-term contracting triangle with resistance at $3,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair even surged above the $3,350 and $3,400 levels. Finally, it tested the $3,480 zone. A high was formed at $3,473 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,186 swing low to the $3,473 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,450 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,480 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,500. A clear move above the $3,500 resistance might send the price toward the $3,550 resistance. An upside break above the $3,550 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,650 resistance zone or even $3,720 in the near term. Downside Correction In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,480 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,350 level. The first major support sits near the $3,280 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,186 swing low to the $3,473 high. A clear move below the $3,280 support might push the price toward the $3,240 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,120 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,050. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

AVAX’s volume profile range (VPVR), for example, highlights a significant trading cluster between $40 and $42, a critical resistance area where considerable buy and sell orders have historically taken place. On the other hand, the Binance coin has highlighted a series of higher and lower highs. While this trend has found support at the $641 level, the bears have little firepower. Meanwhile, Lunex Network (LNEX) continues to witness massive growth as investors anticipate more rallies in the coming weeks. Designed to enable seamless buying, selling, and swapping of cryptocurrencies across blockchains, the LNEX token has been projected to outshine existing crypto giants in this bull cycle. Lunex Network (LNEX): Transforming Crypto Trading Lunex Network is a next-gen Web3 DeFi crypto exchange designed to enable seamless trading and swapping of cryptos across multiple blockchains at the lowest costs. Unlike conventional exchanges with rigorous KYC requirements, Lunex has eliminated these processes, including third-party DeFi wallet connectivity, like Meta Mask and Trust Wallet, minimizing data breaches and barriers to entry. As the first community-backed crypto exchange, Lunex enables businesses to accept crypto as a form of payment and convert it instantly to fiat through its B2B payment gateway API. This move has solved the inherent cross-border payment issues that most traders face. Its standout mobile exchange will enable users to spot trade over 50K crypto pairs across multiple blockchains. Moreover, traders can use Lunex’s portfolio tracker to track digital assets like bonds, stocks, and cryptos. The platform stands out for its simplicity as users will only have a unique DeFi crypto wallet that allows them to buy, sell, and cryptos all from one account. Like BNB, LNEX crypto holds massive potential. At the ongoing presale, the LNEX tokens are going for only $0.0056, with early investors already making 360% in profit. With close tor $6.4 million raised in crypto ICO funding, the LNEX price is expected to jump to $1 in 2025 Avalanche Oversold or More Room for Declines? Despite attempting a breakout in December, the AVAX token has struggled to peak above its significant barrier, reinforcing bearish sentiment. Avalanche VPVR has identified the $27 region as a potential support level. This area aligns with its previous accumulation area, indicating potential buying interest. If the AVAX token can breach this support level, the altcoin could see further declines towards the $25 range. Recent data have demonstrated a decline in Open Interest (OI), which aligns with AVAX’s inability to sustain bullish momentum above $55 in November. A declining OI typically highlights waning speculative interest as AVAX traders hold their positions amid uncertainty. This further reflects diminishing confidence in a short-term recovery. AVAX crypto must rally above the $40 and $42 resistance levels with a rising OI to shift this sentiment. Notably, AVAX’s relative Strength Index (RSI) has been hovering below the neutral zone at 50, reflecting the ongoing bearish momentum. This further aligns with the token’s lower highs and lower lows pattern. If the RSI continues to decline, it could enter an oversold condition, potentially attracting bargain hunters and driving a short-term recovery. Without a decisive jump above 45, bearish momentum would likely remain dominant. For AVAX bulls to take control of the market, RSI must surpass the 50 mark, highlighting a breakout above its $42 resistance level. BNB Price Analysis Amid the current market turbulence, BNB crypto has closed below its 50-day simple moving average at $691 on January 7, but the bears are struggling to sustain these lower levels. BNB bulls have been trying to push its value above the moving averages. If they become successful, the price of BNB could rally to challenge the overhead resistance at the $745 level. A breakout above this level could set the stage for a rally toward $794. Notably, the bears will try to defend the level with all their might. However, if the bulls prevail, the next target would be at the $935 level. On the flip side, if the price of BNB fails to close above the 20-day exponential moving average , it could signal that the bears have taken charge. This could drop BNB’s price toward its downside support level of $635. The recent downtrend can be attributed to broader market turbulence. Its open interest is increasing, suggesting investor confidence. Per CoinGlass data , derivative open interest for the BNB ecosystem has increased, demonstrating its potential to attract leveraged traders. The uptick comes as the BNB token recorded more price downturns in the past few days. Best Token To Buy: AVAX, BNB, and LNEX While AVAX and BNB bulls aim to reverse their current trajectory, Lunex Network could become a strong contender in the market. Based on its growth potential and innovative cross-chain capabilities, Lunex is emerging as the go-to platform for high returns and reliability in the DeFi market.

If Thielen’s crystal ball is correct, the digital asset might potentially experience significant price swings on January 29, 2025, once it breaks out of its so-called “symmetrical triangle” formation. Related Reading: Solana Tops The Charts As Artificial Intelligence Go-To Blockchain Platform —Research However, the path to this breakout is fraught with variables that could sway Bitcoin’s trajectory in any direction. Breaking Down The Technicals Bitcoin has been trading in a symmetrical triangular pattern for quite some time. These patterns typically signify consolidation, implying that the market is gearing up for a major move. Thielen sees this as a possibility for a breakout, which might push Bitcoin over its resistance levels. However, he adds that there is no assurance. The breakout may happen either way. Inflation And Fed Decisions Affect Bitcoin A breakout may not be fully based on technical analysis. Thielen notes that inflation data and Federal Reserve interest rate decisions will have a significant impact on Bitcoin’s future price behavior. If inflation remains high and the Fed continues to raise interest rates, the market’s risk appetite may decline, impeding Bitcoin’s growth. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, Bitcoin may skyrocket. Timeline For Breakout Thielen speculates that Bitcoin will break out on January 29, 2025. If this schedule is accurate, we could witness a huge movement in the market. However, time, like all predictions, is subject to uncertainty. Thielen, meanwhile, alluded to a bullish break and the ensuing Bitcoin surge. Growing anticipation of increased Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers served as the foundation for the market expert’s claim. The market may take longer to break through or face unexpected volatility, which alters the present trend. Investors should be cautious because the breakout could happen sooner or later than planned based on market conditions. The Uncertainty Factor While many analysts have a bright outlook, Thielen warns on prudence. Bitcoin’s price is famously volatile, with the possibility of huge volatility remaining. Investors should be aware that Bitcoin can encounter obstacles that restrict its breakout potential even with the positive technical patterns. Navigating this unpredictable terrain will depend much on risk management. Related Reading: Analyst Declares XRP A Bullish Favorite – Rally Imminent?

Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Saves California on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Saves California by entering its contract address – 2mtzeaYqDPLtCemX5jNPuuq8jw65cbgNUXuT3fBra2M2 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCALI.

In a brief submitted on Wednesday, the SEC disagreed with the earlier ruling by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District, which stated that certain XRP sales to retail investors did not violate securities laws. The appeal basically challenges the district court’s distinction between institutional and retail investors. The SEC said, “The district court reasoned that institutional investors reasonably expected profits from the efforts of others because Ripple represented that its efforts would increase the price of XRP.” #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP @Ripple The @SECGov has filed its opening brief. https://t.co/v0YTjHGxzV — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) January 15, 2025 Disagreement with Court’s Ruling The SEC argued that the district court’s distinction between the expectations of institutional and retail investors is inconsistent with the objective investor standard outlined in the Howey test. They also claimed it goes against a fundamental principle of federal securities laws, which asserts that less sophisticated investors are just as deserving of protection as more sophisticated investors. “But the district court erroneously found that retail investors did not have that same expectation because they purchased XRP through crypto asset trading platforms and thus did not know if the seller was Ripple, a Ripple affiliate, or someone else,” the agency added. The SEC wants to reverse the court’s ruling in favor of Ripple and argue that all XRP sales are unregistered securities. If they win, the case will go back to the district court. Possible Shift in Crypto Regulation Amid this legal chaos, rumors are circulating that the Trump administration’s SEC could revamp its stance on crypto regulation. Reports suggest a potential pause on enforcement actions, which could lead to quicker settlements and a shift away from “regulation by enforcement.” With the current sec chair Gary Gensler set to step down next week, the new administration is expected to bring more clarity and support for the crypto industry.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-16 03:34:31

Insights on FET Ecosystem & CoinRank Partnership,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-investors-snap-up-200m-web3bays-3bay-tokens-insights-on-fet-ecosystem-coinrank-partnership/,"In a significant development for the decentralized sector, the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance has enhanced the FET ecosystem by conducting its first token reduction, aiming to limit supply and raise value. Additionally, CoinRank has partnered with CyberCharge to improve Web3 interaction with smarter, advanced tools. On the other side, Web3Bay (3BAY) distinguishes itself with a decentralized e-commerce model. At the heart of its ecosystem, the 3BAY token offers unique benefits like price cuts and the right to make decisions. So far, Web3Bay has sold over 200 million 3BAY tokens, collecting over $700,000, confirming its crucial role in changing how we buy and sell digital assets. FET Ecosystem Announces Initial Token Reduction The newly formed Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, combining FET, OCEAN, and AGIX tokens, has declared its first major token reduction set for January 10, removing five million FET tokens from circulation. This strategy, intended to create scarcity, aims to possibly lift its long-term value. Although this move has not yet triggered a large market reaction, FET has seen a 14% price rise in the past week, showing some optimistic sentiment, despite being 57% below its highest price of $3.47. This upcoming token reduction could solidify the FET Ecosystem’s reputation, although recovering its peak value remains a challenge amid fluctuating market conditions in a quickly changing sector. CoinRank & CyberCharge Collaboration Enhances Web3 Interaction CoinRank, known for cryptocurrency analytics, has partnered with CyberCharge to improve user interaction with blockchain technology. This partnership introduces advanced tools to the table. By integrating CyberCharge’s cutting-edge solutions, CoinRank aims to facilitate smoother transactions, improve decentralized finance (DeFi) operations, and offer an easier interface for crypto portfolio management. With a focus on refining innovation, CoinRank and CyberCharge are setting the stage for a future where Web3 interaction is more seamless and secure. The success of these updates in simplifying crypto management will rely on the effective implementation and user adoption of these features. Web3Bay Raises $700K & Promises 6430% ROI Web3Bay (3BAY) is a decentralized e-commerce platform that seeks to revolutionize the way people buy and sell digital assets. The 3BAY token, central to its operations, facilitates seamless transactions on the platform. Additionally, the token provides utility, governance, and exclusive benefits to its holders. Users purchasing with the 3BAY token receive a 5% discount, promoting adoption and improving user experience. Governance features also enable token holders to actively participate in platform decisions, fostering a truly community-driven environment. The 3BAY token presale has already attracted substantial interest, with over 200 million tokens sold, raising a total of $700,000 so far. At the current presale stage 3 price of $0.0039675, the 3BAY token presents an attractive opportunity to shape and benefit from a blockchain-powered e-commerce platform that’s busy revolutionizing the online buying and selling of digital assets. With the growing demand, Web3Bay’s ongoing presale offers a distinct chance to acquire tokens early before presale batches sell out and prices significantly increase. Time is of the essence, and the chance to partake in Web3Bay’s transformative venture at this early stage should not be overlooked. Final Thoughts The FET ecosystem continues to grow with new initiatives like token reductions, potentially enhancing its long-term value. Simultaneously, CoinRank is facilitating easier Web3 interaction by teaming up with CyberCharge. However, the 3BAY token represents a distinct opportunity for those looking to buy and sell digital assets beyond the limits of traditional centralized platforms. As a pillar of the Web3Bay ecosystem, the 3BAY token offers a direct stake in the future of decentralized e-commerce . Focusing on user-oriented features such as discounts and community governance, the 3BAY token provides a strong appeal for those wanting to be part of the web3 revolution ahead of the global curve. Currently, in its third presale stage, buyers are quickly securing 3BAY tokens at the ongoing rate of $0.0039675 before anticipated demand hikes and price increases.

The SEC aims to classify all XRP sales as unregistered securities offerings. Reacting to the news, Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty took to X (formerly Twitter) and wrote, “As expected, the SEC’s appeal brief is a rehash of already failed arguments –and likely to be abandoned by the next administration. We’ll respond formally in due time. For now, know this: the SEC’s lawsuit is just noise. A new era of pro-innovation regulation is coming, and Ripple is thriving.” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also expressed disappointment and said, “One definition of insanity….Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Gensler’s SEC really took this to heart.” XRP Price Touches $3: Despite the legal chaos, Ripple’s XRP saw a 14% increase, reaching a yearly high above $3 on Wednesday morning, showing renewed investor interest. XRP, along with Dogecoin, is leading the gains in the cryptocurrency market, outperforming Bitcoin. Bitcoin has touched $100,000 once more and is currently trading just above that level.

XRP’s chart is looking strong, with analysts predicting possible future price gains. Some analysts believe XRP could reach $4 or even higher, thanks to a long period of accumulation.

This project plans to launch an autonomous agent to spot market trends before they take off. And with $1 million in presale funding raised in its first 24 hours alone, it’s clear that investor interest is exploding. MIND of Pepe Presale Takes Off with Huge First-Day Raise Crypto presales offer a unique opportunity: early access to tokens at the lowest possible price before they launch on exchanges. That’s the setup with MIND of Pepe. This AI-focused project is already getting attention, raising far more than the developers had expected in its first 24 hours of going live. MIND of Pepe’s rapid fundraising suggests retail investors are eager to get involved as early as possible. Currently, MIND tokens are available for $0.0031144 each, but this price will increase in just one day. That’s because the presale incorporates automatic price adjustments at each new stage. It means early investors get the lowest possible entry point. Joining the MIND token presale is simple. The developers accept various payment methods, including ETH, USDT, BNB, and credit cards. This ease of access, combined with Mind of Pepe’s innovative use case, has led to bullish social media discussions. The project’s Twitter page already has more than 2,600 followers. MIND of Pepe’s Telegram channel is also multiplying, with investors worldwide piling in to learn more about the development team’s plans. Behind the AI – How MIND of Pepe Spots Explosive Crypto Opportunities MIND of Pepe is like a digital crypto analyst, using advanced AI tech to sift through vast amounts of data – conversations, emerging trends, and market signals – across social media platforms like Twitter. Unlike simple trading bots that execute pre-programmed commands, this AI agent actively participates in the crypto community and develops its own insights. Here’s how it works: Imagine waking up to discover that MIND of Pepe has identified a promising new token overnight. It might have analyzed thousands of social media posts and blockchain interactions to find this token. MIND holders get exclusive access to insights like this through private community channels. These insights provide a clear advantage – especially for market newcomers. MIND of Pepe’s AI agent can even create and launch its own tokens, offering MIND holders first access. YouTuber Jacob Bury believes this feature could be revolutionary. He released a video discussing the MIND of Pepe project – and predicted it could offer a simple way to flip $1,000 into $10,000. Inside MIND of Pepe’s Tokenomics & High-Yield Staking App MIND of Pepe’s tokenomics structure showcases the development team’s ambition. A 25% share of the supply is allocated to the AI agent itself, ensuring it can expand its reach and influence over time. A further 30% is dedicated to ongoing development, showing the team’s commitment to staying ahead of the curve. MIND of Pepe’s team has also launched a staking platform while the presale is ongoing. This platform allows early investors to begin earning rewards immediately. Current yields are estimated at 1,750% per year – although that figure will decrease as more people stake. Although these huge yields are enticing, the real selling point for investors is how MIND of Pepe could permanently change the meme coin space. Most meme coins are all about hype and going viral. But MIND of Pepe takes a different approach, mixing that hype with genuine utility. It also taps into the AI crypto trend – which even big players like Franklin Templeton are bullish on . So, while it’s still in its early days, MIND of Pepe seems to have a bright future ahead.

However, Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty termed the case as noise and believes the case will be dismissed in the next administration. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed its opening brief to escalate its legal battle against blockchain-based digital payment network Ripple with only a few hours before the deadline elapsed. In October last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered that the U.S. SEC vs. Ripple and its executive brief be filed on or before January 15, 2025 failure to which the appeal would be dismissed. Court filings show the U.S. SEC is challenging Judge Analisa Torres’ July 13, 2023 ruling The court documents reveal that the regulator seeks to challenge part of the July 13, 2023 ruling by New York Judge Analisa Torres that categorized XRP tokens differently when dispensed to retail and institutional investors. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP @Ripple The @SECGov has filed its opening brief. https://t.co/v0YTjHGxzV — James K. Filan 🇺🇸🇮🇪 (@FilanLaw) January 15, 2025 The financial watchdog explained that Torres’ conclusion that profits can’t be expected unless investors knowingly buy from the issuer is against both applicable law and the “undisputed facts.” The SEC emphasized that the court’s ruling is against fundamental securities laws and builds an unsustainable contradiction between investor expectations. The SEC argues that the ruling contradicts the Howey Test which is used to establish whether an asset is a security or not. The document showed that the regulator continued to accuse Ripple, its co-founder Christian Larsen, and the company’s Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse of breaking the securities regulations when selling XRP tokens to retail and institutional investors. The commission also criticized the ruling for distinguishing institutional investors from retail ones, saying that Ripple’s extensive marketing aimed at boosting XRP’s price. Ripple’s executives respond to U.S. SEC’s last-minute filing Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty wrote on X that the last-minute move by the regulator was expected. The legal expert said the new court filing is a reconstitution of the initial arguments that failed in previous court proceedings. Alderoty termed the legal action by the financial watchdog as “noise” and expressed his beliefs that the new administration under President-elect Donald Trump will abandon the years-long case in due time. The legal expert also highlighted that a new era of regulations supporting the crypto industry is about to begin and Ripple will thrive. “As expected, the SEC’s appeal brief is a rehash of already failed arguments –and likely to be abandoned by the next administration. We’ll respond formally in due time. For now, know this: the SEC’s lawsuit is just noise.” – Stuart Alderoty Ripple’s Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse also commented on the SEC’s legal action, calling it insanity. He bashed the regulator for doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results. XRP soars despite the legal dispute The Ripple community has previously accused the U.S. SEC of trying to delay the conclusion of its legal battle with Ripple. Users claim that the regulator was intentionally filing at the last minute to frustrate the defendants and the entire crypto community. Despite the legal entanglement, investors are optimistic about the possible outlook of XRP and the general crypto market this year. XRP has emerged as the top-performing asset among the top ten largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. According to data from crypto data aggregator CoinMarketCap, XRP is up about 8% in the last 24 hours, fueling its seven-day gain to 28.77%. The digital asset retails at $3.02 with a market cap of 173.7 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $22.7 billion. The cryptocurrency now ranks third among the largest digital assets by market capitalization behind Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Bonk is one of the most successful crypto projects in 2024. The dog-themed Solana-based coin has become one of the most recognized meme coins, with its market capitalization reaching $2.4 billion in May. Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 93 trillion. It is important to note that 66 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem.

Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain triggered a huge surge in SOL’s price, attributed to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has many side projects that contribute to its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will reach $0.00025, which is approximately 7.9 times its current price, making it a good investment to consider. Why is Bonk down? Bonk lost a good portion of its value over the last 24 hours. In the last few hours, its value decreased by $0.000002847. Today’s decreasing pressure triggered a notable descent in the coin’s value. Will Bonk Recover? Bonk is currently trading within its established price range. A recent price decline tested the $0.00002618 support level, which proved strong. A successful defense of this support level is considered crucial for the current recovery. Will Bonk reach $0.000055? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.000035. However, just a few days ago, Bonk saw some price action above this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.000055 by the end of 2026. Will Bonk reach $0.000100? Bonk price prediction suggests that the coin can reach $0.000100 and surpass it by 2027. When Bonk reaches this price level, its market capitalization will increase 4.5-fold. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. According to The Cryptopolitan’s review of the cryptocurrency, it is expected that Bonk will reach a maximum value of $0.00025 by the end of 2031, which is quite a bit above its current price.

Bonk historic price sentiment Bonk price history In December 2022, Bonk was launched with a price of $0.0000001487 and made history by making a surge of more than 30% in SOL tokens. Bonk cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 100 by market cap, reaching $0.0000034 per coin on January 5, 2023, according to crypto market records. However, by March 2023, the price of the Bonk token had fallen from $0.0000004134, losing substantial value.

Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas made this prediction after Canary Capital filed an amended S-1 registration form in relation to its Litecoin ETF proposal. Amended Litecoin ETF S-1 Filing Suggests SEC Engagement Canary Capital had submitted the S-1 registration form for the Litecoin ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in October 2024. On Wednesday, the company filed an amended version of this form. According to the filing, U.S. Bancorp Fund Services would act as the administrator of the ETF, while Coinbase Custody Trust and BitGo would act as the custodians for the Litecoin of the fund. NEW: @CanaryFunds just filed an amended S-1 for their Litecoin ETF filing. No guarantees — but this might be indicative of SEC engagement on the filing. Still no 19b-4 filing yet though (A 19b-4 would actually start the potential approval/denial clock) h/t @isabelletanlee pic.twitter.com/wFtNOmbmYx — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 15, 2025 Some of the industry watchers including the Bloomberg analysts have suggested that that the modification of the filing could be an indication of SEC’s interest. Another Bloomberg ETF analyst, James Seyffart pointed out that the amendment could mean the SEC has offered comments on the application. However, there has been no 19b-4 filing made, which is a formal application for rule change that initiates the approval process. “We had heard chatter that the Litecoin S-1 had gotten comments back from [the] SEC,” said Balchunas in a post on X (formerly Twitter). He also said that this is in line with his earlier claim that Litecoin is ‘most likely’ to be the next cryptocurrency ETF in the United States. New SEC Leadership Adds Uncertainty The timing of the Litecoin ETF’s approval process could depend on upcoming changes in SEC leadership. Gary Gensler , the current SEC chair, is set to step down on Monday. Former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins, who has expressed support for the cryptocurrency sector in the past, has been nominated to lead the agency. However, the Senate has yet to confirm Atkins’ appointment, and the exact timeline remains uncertain. Balchunas emphasized that the leadership transition is a “huge variable” in the approval process for the Litecoin ETF. Growing Interest in Spot Crypto ETFs Created in 2011 as a more efficient version of Bitcoin, Litecoin is one of the oldest and most stable blockchains. Following the announcement, the price of Litecoin spiked by more than 18% to trade at $119.46 at the time of writing. Analysts believe that the current bullish rally may break through the $130 barrier, with the LTC price prediction standing at $170. In addition, open interest increased by 29.58% to $575.39 million within the last 24 hours while the trading volume jumped significantly by 277.25% to $1.65 billion. This excitement comes in the wake of the recent approval of U.S. spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in recent months. These products outperformed the market, which led to the growth of interest among issuers in the creation of ETFs for altcoins like Solana and XRP. A recent JPMorgan and Hashkey research note suggested that new Solana and XRP ETFs could pull in $13.6bn of new funds if they are approved within six to 12 months. The introduction of altcoin ETFs such as Litecoin may also contribute to increased institutional investments in the cryptocurrency space. Next Steps for Litecoin ETF Approval Even though the amended S-1 filing marks a progress, there is no certainty as to when the approval of the Litecoin ETF will be completed. The submission of a 19b-4 application would formally kick off the SEC’s decision process but Canary Capital has not given any indication of when this would happen. The original filing of Canary identified Litecoin as a blockchain that has had “100% uptime since its inception” noting its security and stability as strengths. Industry participants are now focused on the next steps, such as the SEC’s response and the possible 19b-4 filing, as the momentum for the approval of the Litecoin ETF picks up.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains a staple, but altcoins are showing unparalleled potential. From the dependable Ethereum (ETH) to the rising BigBossInu, these digital assets are ready to deliver game-changing returns.

The rally is fueled by Meta’s launch of Polygon-powered NFTs on Instagram, which has increased investor interest, along with bullish chart patterns suggesting a potential long-term uptrend. Bitcoin (BTC) : Bitcoin has been leading the current market rally, pushing many altcoins, including MATIC, higher. The excitement around the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has also contributed to Bitcoin’s momentum, and analysts expect this could continue driving gains across the crypto market in the short term​. Polkadot (DOT) : DOT’s price is nearing the breakout level of $6.90, a crucial resistance point. If bulls manage to push the price higher, it could trigger a move to $10.

Aptos (APT) : APT has shown gains recently, riding the momentum of the broader market rally led by Bitcoin.

Anderson said that the decision comes after the firm has completed its “pipeline of ideas,” and there are no personal or health-related reasons behind the closure. “The intensity and focus has come at the cost of missing a lot of the rest of the world and the people I care about. I now view Hindenburg as a chapter in my life, not a central thing that defines me,’ the founder said. Hindenburg gained widespread attention for its reports on companies like the Adani Group, Nikola and Carvana, sparking major controversies, especially in India. The firm’s research accused Adani of corporate malpractice, leading to major financial losses and political turmoil. The firm was known for publishing research that was sold to hedge funds and investors while simultaneously releasing the findings to the public, benefiting from market shorts. On January 15, Anderson said, “The plan has been to wind up after we finished the pipeline of ideas we were working on. And as of the last Ponzi cases we just completed and are sharing with regulators, that day is today.” A Personal Note From Our Founder https://t.co/OOMtimC0gV — Hindenburg Research (@HindenburgRes) January 15, 2025 The firm’s closure comes amidst heightened regulatory scrutiny, particularly from the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, and India’s SEBI. Hindenburg faced allegations of violating regulations by using offshore instruments to short Indian markets, with SEBI issuing a show-cause notice to the firm. The Adani case remains unresolved, and Adani Enterprises, saw a strong increase in its share price at the start of today’s trading. The shares opened at Rs 2,500, up from the previous day’s Rs 2,388.15. Other companies in the Adani Group, such as Adani Power, also experienced major gains. It remains to be seen what actions will follow, particularly with the change in leadership in the U.S. “There are others on our team who are now free agents — so feel free to reach out to me if you have a need for anyone who is brilliant, focused, and easy to work with, as they all are,” he added.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-16 04:47:32
39037562,https://timestabloid.com/?p=54688,1737002990,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top Exchange Predicts SHIB to Hit $1,https://timestabloid.com/top-exchange-predicts-shib-to-hit-1/,"Leading cryptocurrency exchange CoinW recently generated widespread discussion by projecting that Shiba Inu could surge by over 4,584,900% to reach the elusive $1 mark. The ambitious prediction was shared via a poll conducted on X, sparking renewed interest in the token’s potential value. Comparative Market Predictions In the poll, CoinW invited users to speculate on which milestone might be achieved first: Shiba Inu climbing to $1, Ethereum reaching $10,000, BNB hitting $1,000, or Dogecoin touching $1. Other featured cryptocurrencies included Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), XRP, and Avalanche (AVAX). The asset’s potential growth to $1 emerged as the most extreme prediction due to the significant increase needed to reach the target. For context, the token is currently valued at $0.00002181. Achieving $1 would require the token to increase by over 4.58 million percent, effectively removing all decimal places from its current price. At this rate, a $100 investment in SHIB could theoretically yield over $4.2 million. Contextualizing the Prediction CoinW further fueled the debate by asking whether such a milestone for the asset could happen before Bitcoin reaches $100,000 or Ethereum crosses $10,000. Bitcoin currently trades at $99,000, requiring only a 6% rise. Ethereum requires a 206% increase from its current value of approximately $3,270 to hit its target. While predictions of massive gains are not unprecedented for Shiba inu, the feasibility of achieving a $1 valuation is widely questioned. For the token to hit this price point, its market capitalization would need to exceed $589 trillion—an astronomical figure far beyond the size of the global economy. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Historic Price Performance and Future Possibilities Despite skepticism, the asset has already demonstrated extraordinary growth in the past. From its all-time low to its peak, the token saw an astonishing increase of over 150,000,000%. Early investors witnessed staggering gains, including one case where an $8,000 investment grew into more than $5.7 billion. However, replicating such a meteoric rise in today’s market environment appears unlikely. Industry experts and platforms like Telegaon predict that while the token could eventually reach $1, achieving this target may take several decades. According to Telegaon, sustained growth and widespread adoption over time could make the price point feasible by 2050. CoinW’s bold prediction has reignited discussions about Shiba Inu’s long-term potential and the broader possibilities within the cryptocurrency market. Although the odds remain low, the community continues to rally around the project. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Trump’s Crypto Law (TRUMPLAW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPLAW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Crypto Law can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Crypto Law could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Crypto Law launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Crypto Law on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Crypto Law by entering its contract address – 7mYansF38wyaSvnj7C1Gr536FdMbGA4ufqY7PwzC7CxM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPLAW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|REGULATION|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-16 04:55:00

Key Insights Into The Latest Recovery,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-bitcoin-upward-cycle-back-key-insights-into-the-latest-recovery/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has rebounded to trade above $99,000 following its significant dip earlier this week. While the latest US Consumer Price Index (CPI) news appears to have contributed to this quick recovery, it has also drawn attention from analysts, who are closely monitoring key metrics to understand the market’s next move. A CryptoQuant contributor known as Crypto Dan recently provided insights into Bitcoin’s current market behavior. Highlighting the Short-Term Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), Dan observed that the metric has shown a recurring pattern during correction phases. This pattern, he noted, typically dampens market optimism before a subsequent rebound. Despite the recent correction, signs point to the potential resumption of an upward cycle in the near future. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharp Rebound Above $95K: Stop Hunting or Trend Reversal? Short-Term SOPR Analysis And What It Currently Suggests For BTC The SOPR metric measures the profitability of spent outputs relative to their realized value, providing insights into market participants’ behavior during price corrections. According to Crypto Dan, during corrections, the SOPR oscillates between red and green zones. The red zone signals increased profit-taking, often driven by whale activity, which can extend correction periods. Conversely, the green zone indicates reduced selling pressure, setting the stage for potential rebounds. Dan reveals that the SOPR currently shows a smaller volume of profit-taking compared to previous correction periods, such as the seven-month correction earlier in the year. This trend suggests that the recent correction, which has lasted over a month, may be shorter in duration. Dan speculates that Bitcoin could resume its upward trend within the first quarter of 2025. However, he cautioned that short-term volatility remains a risk, with the possibility of further sharp drops before a sustained reversal. The analyst wrote: However, in the short term, there may still be one or two sharp drops that push SOPR below the yellow dotted line, potentially crushing market participants’ hope for a rally before the market reverses upward. As such, aggressive short-term trades should be approached with caution. Bitcoin Market Performance And Outlook Meanwhile, Bitcoin appears to now be making its way back above the $100,000 mark as the asset currently trades at a price of $99,494, at the time of writing marking a 2.7% increase in the past day. This increase in Bitcoin’s price aside from being attributed to the underlying positive metrics on the BTC network can also be linked to the latest update on the US CPI. According to the latest reports, the US CPI rose by 0.4% in December—this news has resulted in the US Dollar seeing a notable plunge while other financial assets saw the opposite trend recording an uptick.

SOL was able to climb above the $180 and $185 resistance levels. The bulls pushed it above the $188 resistance and then $200. A high was formed at $206 and the price is now consolidating gains near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $186 swing high to the $206 low. Solana is now trading above $195 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $196 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $205 level. The next major resistance is near the $212 level. The main resistance could be $220. A successful close above the $220 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $232. Any more gains might send the price toward the $245 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $205 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $196 zone and the trend line. The first major support is near the $190 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $186 swing high to the $206 low. A break below the $190 level might send the price toward the $185 zone. If there is a close below the $185 support, the price could decline toward the $172 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level.

Recently, Fox Journalist Eleanor Terrett revealed that Solana ETFs faced a rejection, but Litecoin’s chances are soaring. It might just be the first altcoin to get approval in 2025! Solana ETFs Face Setback According to Fox’s Eleanor Terrett, Solana ETFs had been getting attention from the SEC staff, but they faced a setback when their 19b4s were rejected. This happened a few weeks ago when Gary Gensler was still heading the SEC. Solana ETFs were also getting engagement from staff but the 19b4s were then rejected. Granted, that was a few weeks ago with the @SECGov still under @GaryGensler who’s out in 3 business days.

It will be a waiting game to see how the new leadership handles the approval process for these highly anticipated assets. Litecoin Poised for ETF Approval First! Meanwhile, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas shared that the SEC had given comments back on the Litecoin S-1 filing. However, this is a greater sign of Litecoin’s approval sooner. Although, Balchunas previously predicted that Litecoin might be the next coin to get an ETF approval, and now it seems that prediction is becoming more likely. However, the start of the new SEC chair’s term is still a big factor that could influence the final decision. Balchunas statement comes after Canary Capital filed an updated S-1 form on Wednesday, marking the initial step in registering its Litecoin ETF with the SEC. What’s Next for XRP and Solana? As for XRP and Solana, both have faced delays, but there’s hope for their ETFs. The shift in leadership at the SEC might lead to a fresh perspective on these applications. If these ETFs are approved, it could bring more institutional interest and boost the overall cryptocurrency market.

Severino, a Chartered Market Technician and seasoned trader with over 15 years of experience, highlighted the potential for the asset to surge to $13.4 if a developing bull flag pattern materializes on the daily chart. XRP Bull Flag Formation Observed Severino’s observations stem from recent price movements of the token. The digital asset valued at $0.4956 on November 4, surged dramatically to reach a seven-year high of $2.9 by December 3, marking a 485% increase within a month. This sharp upward movement formed the flagpole portion of the suspected bull flag pattern. Following this surge, XRP faced a pullback from the $2.9 peak and consolidated within the $2 range. Severino interprets this consolidation phase as potentially forming the bull flag portion of the pattern, signaling that the asset may be building momentum for another upward breakout. However, he acknowledged the possibility that this pattern might instead represent a descending channel rather than a bullish structure. If this is a valid bull flag in XRP, the target is $13 This is significantly beyond my top targets, but not impossible pic.twitter.com/bacmrcNyOD — Tony ""The Bull"" Severino, CMT (@tonythebullBTC) January 1, 2025 XRP Potential Price Surge to $13.4 Bull flag formations are typically characterized by an initial price surge followed by a consolidation period, eventually leading to a continuation of the upward trend. If this pattern holds for the token, the price could experience a breakout matching the length of the previous rally. Given the 485% increase in November and December, a similar rise from current levels would push XRP to approximately $13.4, according to Severino’s projections. While he admitted that this price target surpasses even his most optimistic expectations, Severino emphasized that such outcomes, although ambitious, are not entirely unrealistic. If the token reaches this value, its market capitalization will exceed $769 billion, surpassing Ethereum’s current valuation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additional Bullish Indicators for XRP In addition to the potential bull flag pattern, other technical indicators support Severino’s positive outlook. Notably, XRP’s quarterly Relative Strength Index (RSI) has climbed above 70. The last occurrence of this indicator level was in January 2018, coinciding with the token’s previous all-time high of $3.31. Furthermore, XRP recently closed a yearly candle above the $2 mark for the first time in its history and surpassed $3 for the first time since 2018, reinforcing its current bullish momentum. The asset is currently trading at $3.07, maintaining its position as a market leader while Bitcoin remains under $100,000. Although Severino’s predictions point to significant potential gains for XRP , market dynamics remain unpredictable. The realization of such price targets would depend on sustained demand, market sentiment, and broader industry trends. Nonetheless, the possibility of a continued rally keeps the token firmly in the spotlight as traders closely monitor price developments and chart patterns.

From Oklahoma's proposed legislation to incorporate Bitcoin into state pension funds to forecasts of the cryptocurrency reaching up to $250,000 by 2025, the narrative around Bitcoin is increasingly centered on its utility as a hedge against inflation and its appeal to institutional and governmental entities. Oklahoma Introduces Bill to Establish Bitcoin as Strategic Reserve Asset On Jan. 15, 2025, a new bill aiming to establish Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset was introduced to the Oklahoma House of Representatives. Spearheaded by state Representative Cody Maynard, House Bill 1203—known as the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act—seeks to position Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation by allowing state pension funds and savings accounts to allocate a portion of their assets to the leading cryptocurrency. The proposed legislation is part of a growing trend of US states exploring the potential of Bitcoin as a safeguard against economic uncertainties. Representative Maynard, championing the bill, articulated the rationale behind this move, stating, “Bitcoin represents freedom from bureaucrats printing away our purchasing power. As a decentralized form of money, Bitcoin cannot be manipulated or created by government entities. It is the ultimate store of value for those who believe in financial freedom and sound money principles.” If passed, Oklahoma would join the ranks of a handful of US states advancing similar legislation, demonstrating Bitcoin’s emergence as a mainstream financial instrument. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act in Oklahoma is not an isolated initiative. A growing number of states, including Pennsylvania, Texas, North Dakota, and New Hampshire, have introduced bills aimed at incorporating Bitcoin into their financial strategies. Pennsylvania: In November 2024, lawmakers proposed allowing the state Treasury to allocate up to 10% of its assets to Bitcoin. State Representative Mike Cabell emphasized Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation and a tool to mitigate macroeconomic risks. Cabell likened the approach to strategies employed by asset management giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, who have adopted Bitcoin as part of their diversified portfolios. Texas: The Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, introduced by lawmaker Giovanni Capriglione in December 2024, proposed a five-year minimum holding period for Bitcoin as a reserve asset. North Dakota: On Jan. 10, 2025, North Dakota introduced its own Bitcoin reserve bill, backed by a bipartisan coalition of 11 co-sponsors, according to Dennis Porter, co-founder and CEO of the Bitcoin advocacy group Satoshi Action Fund. New Hampshire: On the same day, New Hampshire unveiled a broader initiative that extends beyond Bitcoin, categorizing investments under the umbrella term “digital assets.” This broader scope hints at potential diversification into other cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based technologies. The introduction of Bitcoin reserve bills aligns with increasing concerns over inflation and economic instability. As fiat currencies lose value due to inflationary pressures, Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins makes it an attractive alternative for safeguarding purchasing power. State legislators advocating for Bitcoin adoption argue that its decentralized nature and finite supply provide a level of security and autonomy unavailable in traditional fiat systems. By allocating a portion of state reserves to Bitcoin, governments can potentially reduce exposure to inflationary risks while fostering innovation in the blockchain sector. The growing interest in Bitcoin among US states mirrors its rising institutional adoption globally. As governments and private entities alike explore Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value, the cryptocurrency continues to solidify its role as an essential component of diversified financial strategies. However, the move is not without its critics. Opponents of Bitcoin reserve bills cite concerns over its volatility and lack of regulatory clarity. Despite these challenges, the momentum behind Bitcoin adoption suggests that states like Oklahoma are willing to embrace its potential benefits while navigating its risks. What’s Next for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act? As House Bill 1203 advances through the legislative process, it remains to be seen how other states and policymakers will respond. If Oklahoma successfully establishes Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, it could set a precedent for other states and even federal institutions to follow suit. The ongoing wave of Bitcoin -related legislation is a pivotal moment in the evolution of financial systems. Whether as a hedge against inflation, a tool for diversification, or a statement of financial independence, Bitcoin is increasingly becoming a cornerstone of modern financial strategies. Bitcoin Set to Surge: Analysts Predict Prices Up to $250,000 by 2025 as Half a Trillion Dollars Flow In Bitcoin (BTC) could skyrocket to unprecedented highs of $250,000 in 2025, according to new projections from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant. In its latest weekly report released on Jan. 14, the firm highlighted favorable economic conditions, regulatory clarity, and increased institutional adoption as key drivers for the potential influx of $520 billion in new capital to the cryptocurrency. CryptoQuant’s research suggests Bitcoin is poised to see significant price growth in 2025, with a base case target of $145,000 and a potential high of $249,000. The report attributes this bullish outlook to a confluence of factors, including the anticipated impact of a new US presidential administration and an increasingly crypto-friendly regulatory environment. ”About $520 billion of fresh capital could flow into Bitcoin in 2025,” CryptoQuant researchers calculated. ”In the context of favorable regulatory, monetary, and cyclical conditions, it’s reasonable to expect capital to continue flowing into Bitcoin.” The report further notes that the expansion in Bitcoin’s realized capitalization—defined as the total value of Bitcoin supply based on the price at which each unit last moved on-chain—has a magnified effect on its market value and price. Historical patterns show that substantial capital inflows into Bitcoin lead to exponential price growth. Accompanying CryptoQuant’s findings is an analysis of Bitcoin’s realized market cap since 2015. The data reveals that during previous bull cycles, realized capitalization growth correlated with dramatic price increases. If similar conditions prevail, the anticipated $520 billion in capital inflows could propel Bitcoin to new all-time highs, with analysts envisioning a price range of $145,000 to $249,000 by 2025. ”The expansion in the total capital invested in Bitcoin (realized capitalization) has a more-than-proportional effect on Bitcoin’s market value and price,” the report states. CryptoQuant’s forecast is one of several optimistic predictions for Bitcoin’s future. Samson Mow, CEO of Bitcoin adoption firm JAN3, has been vocal about his belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Last year, Mow outlined the possibility of Bitcoin reaching $1 million per coin, driven by what he described as ”omega candles”—daily price increases of $100,000 or more. “You’ll start to go up by $10,000 a day or drop by $10,000 a day. And this is the God candle. After that, we’ll start to see Omega candles, which are $100,000 increments daily,” Mow said. While such a dramatic rise may seem implausible to some, Mow continues to champion the $1 million price target, sharing his predictions on social media. Despite recent price fluctuations, Bitcoin analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Bitcoin experienced two-month lows earlier this week, prompting speculation about the impact of broader macroeconomic factors. Filbfilb, co-founder of trading suite DecenTrader, compared Bitcoin’s current market position to a ”beach ball under water,” suggesting that pressure from legacy markets is temporarily suppressing its growth potential. “Standard stuff... my feeling is that BTC is currently a bit of a beach ball under water with the legacy markets sitting on it for now,” Filbfilb told subscribers of his Telegram channel. Meanwhile, Rekt Capital, a popular crypto trader and analyst, highlighted Bitcoin’s resilience, describing its ability to rebound quickly after market dips. “On daily timeframes, BTC/USD is going from threatening a downside deviation to strongly rebounding and developing a new Higher Low,” Rekt Capital noted. “Lots can change within 24 hours for Bitcoin.” Political and Regulatory Tailwinds for Bitcoin The upcoming inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 20 has added a layer of intrigue to Bitcoin’s near-term outlook. Rumors of potential pro-crypto policies and first-day announcements are fueling speculation about the trajectory of the next crypto bull market. If favorable conditions materialize, Bitcoin could see accelerated adoption among institutions and retail investors alike. CryptoQuant’s $250,000 projection for Bitcoin signals growing confidence in its role as a store of value and hedge against macroeconomic risks. With $520 billion in fresh capital potentially entering the market, Bitcoin stands to benefit from increased regulatory clarity, mainstream adoption, and economic uncertainty driving demand for alternative assets. While short-term volatility remains a concern, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains overwhelmingly bullish. As analysts and industry leaders continue to tout unprecedented price targets, 2025 could mark a watershed moment for the world’s leading cryptocurrency.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-16 05:30:00

On Wednesday, net inflows into BTC ETF skyrocketed to $755 million with Fidelity’s FBTC leading the charge with $463 million in inflows. The BTC price also surged past the $100K level following a strong run-up in the S&P 500. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Resume Again After four consecutive trading sessions of outflows, the spot Bitcoin ETF witnessed strong inflows on Wednesday led by Fidelity. These Bitcoin investment products scooped more than 7,548 Bitcoins from the market against the daily BTC production of 450 BTC. Source: HODL15Capital As shown above, Fidelity’s FBTC saw inflows totaling to $463 million, leading the pack, while Ark Invest’s ARKB came second clocking $138 million of inflows. Although BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw only $31 million in inflows, it clocked a massive $2.35 billion in trading volumes. On the other hand, Fidelity’s FBTC clocked $284 million in trading volumes. Asset managers are working to expand its Bitcoin offerings to other global markets as well. Earlier this week, BlackRock launched a Bitcoin ETF variant on CBOE Canada. Apart from the US, the demand for Bitcoin ETFs continues to remain strong. Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise Invest stated that they have continued to receive inquiries from other nation-states as well. He said: “We just provided some information for a nation state asking about Bitcoin ETFs. Considering moving some exposure from foreign currency govt bonds into BTC. Bitcoin is entering a new chapter”. Core CPI Drop Fuels Market Optimism The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for December rose by 2.9%, aligning with market expectations. Meanwhile, Core CPI inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, dropped to 3.2%, slightly below the anticipated 3.3%. This was enough to send global equities and crypto market soaring high on Wednesday. The S&P 500 closed with a gain of more than 100 points in yesterday’s trading session, fueled by an unexpected drop in core CPI inflation. The index added an impressive $900 billion in market capitalization during the trading session. Will Bitcoin Price Sustain Above $100K to Hit New ATH? On-chain data shows that the current BTC rally is backed by strong fundamentals. According to blockchain analytics firm Santiment, the accumulation of wallets holding more than 10 BTC has resumed once again after stagnating during the second half of December and early January. Source: Santiment Similarly, the number of non-empty wallets has been declining over the past six weeks, as many small retail traders are cashing out profits and attempting to time the market peak. The data supports further rise in BTC in thew coming days. Along with strong inflows into Bitcoin ETF, the BTC price also swiftly moved above $100K before retracing back under that crucial support. As of press time, the Bitcoin price is trading 2.34% up at $99,597 with daily trading volumes up by 5.38% to $58 billion. As per the Coinglass data , the 24-hour liquidations have shot to more than $83 million of which $58 million is in short liquidations.

One Of These Is Predicted To Make Early Investors A 25x By The End Of July",https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-amp-or-remittix-one-of-these-is-predicted-to-make-early/,"January started on a bullish note, but the tune quickly changed as a barrage of sell-offs plunged the market into a mini-bear season. Bitcoin (BTC) and Amp (AMP) have both breached through critical support levels and are currently treading water, with their price structures breaking down as the correction deepened. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a safe haven, prompting investors to rotate funds into the viral presale of its native $RTX token. Let’s explore what this newcomer brings to the table and why analysts are tipping it as the next 25x gem. Remittix Is Revolutionizing A $150 Trillion Market Cross-border payments were valued at $150 trillion in 2017 and are expected to reach $250 trillion by 2027.

This is an application designed exclusively for the needs of companies, allowing them to manage payroll with cryptocurrencies and expand their payment options. Experts are already praising this initiative, as it gives businesses the tools they need to stay ahead of the curve and retain a competitive edge in an increasingly crypto-focused world. At the center of the Remittix ecosystem is the $RTX token, which plays a crucial role in key features such as staking and governance. Users can stake their $RTX and reap recurring rewards for up to 8% APY, while those who want a premium experience can join Remittix’s VIP Program. This is a membership program that consists of three levels, with Tier-3 investors earning up to 18% APY and enjoying special privileges, such as enhanced governance rights, and a dedicated account manager. Bitcoin Finds New Support, MicroStrategy Steps In Bitcoin starts off the week in the red as it recorded a 3.5% intraday decline and is currently selling for $91,838. Bitcoin’s cumulative monthly losses now amount to 9% after it failed to sustain the $100k level. This resulted in BTC entering a descending channel, and dragging the entire market into a steep downtrend. However, as the saying goes, “In a bull run, dips are for buying” and Michael Saylor and company have wasted no time buying the blood. Just a few hours ago, he announced that MicroStrategy acquired 2,530 Bitcoin, valued at around $243 million. This timely intervention reignited optimism within the Bitcoin community, as Bitcoin had reached its lowest price since November. Amp Slips 10%, The Bottom Seems To Be In Amp (AMP) formed a local top at $0.011 in early December. However, after a harsh rejection, its price spiraled, resulting in a significant 38% monthly decline. At the time of writing, Amp sells for $0.006 following a 10% intraday decrease. Meanwhile, 24-hour volume shows a 26% increase, with over $23 million worth of AMP traded across exchanges. Amp is also a project that focuses on digital payments, but it proposes an interesting twist. Amp acts as a digital collateral token designed to enhance the security and speed of transactions. It works by providing collateral to guarantee the successful completion of transactions, locking up a small amount of value until the transfer is confirmed. Once the transaction is finalized, the collateral is released, ensuring seamless and secure transfers across different platforms. This framework has already piqued the interest of investors, however, with its broader approach and integration of both crypto and fiat, Remittix presents a more versatile and convenient solution. Join The Remittix Presale Hundreds of investors are rushing to secure their $RTX allocation and over $3 million has been raised in record time. The $RTX presale is now live and tokens are on sale for just $0.207. However, this discount window will close very soon, as experts anticipate an 800% surge by the end of the presale phase. Once listings on major exchanges are finalized and $RTX hits the markets, early adopters could be in for a 25x moonshot. The best time to get involved? Now!

The brief was shared with the XRP community on X by James K. Filan, a well-respected attorney in the crypto space, and it has garnered significant attention. Jeremy Hogan, another prominent attorney and XRP supporter, provided an insightful analysis of the filing. According to Hogan, the appeal focuses solely on the district court’s decision that XRP sales to retail investors did not constitute securities transactions. Hogan also stated that the SEC did not argue about harm to investors , noting that proving investors were harmed will be difficult now that XRP has surpassed $3. This SEC brief was hard to work thru because, IMO, the case won't be ruled on. But I've come this far so, dangit, here we go! My thoughts on the initial Ripple v. SEC appeal brief… We aren't holding back tonight. https://t.co/l8Tcqdfuxc pic.twitter.com/bIWnJC1y3N — Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) January 16, 2025 The SEC’s Opening Brief According to Hogan, the SEC’s primary argument is that it does not need to prove that XRP purchasers were aware of Ripple’s statements about efforts to increase XRP’s value. Instead, the SEC relies on precedent to argue that it is sufficient to show the existence of such promotional statements. Hogan criticized this approach, stating, “The problem the SEC has is that, from my reading of the first two cases, they say no such thing.” He also noted that distinguishing between the concepts of “reliance” and “knowledge” is pivotal, with the trial court emphasizing the latter in its ruling. The SEC’s reliance on prior cases, particularly Aqua-Sonic, appears tenuous. Hogan observed that the SEC had to combine sentences from multiple sections of the Aqua-Sonic decision to construct its argument. He also expects Ripple to counter this by highlighting key differences between both cases, such as the lack of evidence that XRP retail investors were aware of Ripple’s promises. Another significant point of contention is the SEC’s failure to challenge the substantial evidence submitted by attorney John Deaton on behalf of XRP holders. Deaton had gathered thousands of affidavits from XRP investors refuting claims of reliance on Ripple’s statements. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Hogan expressed surprise that the SEC did not attempt to counter this evidence during the initial proceedings, noting that this oversight could prove detrimental to its appeal. Implications of the SEC’s Appeal Hogan highlighted the broader impact of the SEC’s appeal, noting that if the appellate court upholds the district court’s decision , the SEC could face a new precedent requiring proof of investor awareness of promotional statements. This could complicate enforcement, leading to longer, more expensive litigation. Ripple might also revive its argument that investment contracts require contractual obligations, further weakening the SEC’s position. Hogan concluded by questioning the SEC’s rationale for pursuing the appeal, highlighting the risks of adverse legal precedents. Ripple, meanwhile, could use the appeal to strengthen its position and challenge the SEC’s approach. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

On Wednesday, the firm submitted an amended S-1 filing to the commission, effecting the proposed amendments made by the regulator. ETF analyst James Seyffart believes the amended S-1 filing signals the SEC’s engagement with the filing. However, he claimed that a 19b-4 filing would be the ideal hint that the regulator will approve the LTC ETF. Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, expects the Litecoin ETF to be the next SEC’s approved fund. He said: “We had heard chatter that the Litecoin S-1 had gotten comments back from the SEC.

Canary Capital had also filed for a Solana ETF in October In October, Canary Capital also filed for approval of its Solana ETF . According to its Solana ETF filing, the trust emphasized that it aimed to provide exposure to the price of Solana.

Meanwhile, Burwick Law is preparing legal action against Solana-based launchpad Pump.fun for enabling scams and harmful activities on the platform, which led to serious financial losses for investors. Meanwhile, BitMEX and its parent company HDR Global Trading were fined $100 million for Bank Secrecy Act violations, bringing an end to years of legal battles with US authorities. Tether and Swan Bitcoin Clash Tether, the issuer of the popular USDT stablecoin, filed a lawsuit against Swan Bitcoin, and accused the Bitcoin financial services company of breaches in their agreements. In a joint statement with 2040 Energy, Tether confirmed the legal action, and stated that Swan’s reckless actions violated their contractual obligations. This case was filed in the High Court of England and Wales, and is the latest escalation in the legal battle between the two firms. The dispute started from a partnership that was established in 2022, where Tether and Swan co-founded 2040 Energy, a Bitcoin mining venture. Tether provided funding while Swan managed operations. However, Swan alleged that former employees of its mining division stole proprietary information , including software code and business strategies, to establish a rival company, Proton Management. According to Swan, these employees executed a deliberate scheme, which is called ”rain and hellfire,” and is aimed at undermining its role in the venture. Some of the key figures in this alleged plan included Michael Holmes, Swan’s former head of business development, and Raphael Zagury, its ex-chief investment officer and mining head, who now serves as Proton’s CEO. Swan claimed that Proton used its trade secrets to become a direct competitor, severely damaging Swan’s market position. The firm also accused Proton of convincing Tether to sever ties with Swan and support Proton in the mining venture. By August of 2024, Swan CEO Cory Klippsten was removed as CEO of 2040 Energy, and Proton officially assumed control of the mining operations. Swan also alleged that Tether facilitated the ”hostile takeover” of its mining business, but Tether denies this claim. Adding to Swan’s legal troubles, the company sued its own law firm, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, in November of 2024 for malpractice. Swan alleged that the firm abandoned its case against Proton after taking on Tether as a client. As a result, the law firm violated ethics rules prohibiting such conflicts of interest. Swan CEO Cory Klippsten described this move as a betrayal that caused serious harm to Swan’s business. Burwick Law Targets Pump.fun Over Investor Losses Burwick Law, a US-based crypto law firm, also recently announced its intention to pursue legal action on behalf of investors who suffered losses due to the meme coin launchpad Pump.fun. In a post on X from Jan. 15, the firm stated that it spent months working with people who lost large amounts of money to meme coins, rug pulls, and unfulfilled promises that were facilitated through platforms like Pump.fun. The firm described the situation as emblematic of exploitation in the crypto ecosystem, and blamed anonymous creators and other corrupt entities for taking advantage of everyday people. According to Burwick , Pump.fun generated hundreds of millions of dollars in fees while allowing harmful and antisocial behaviors, including displays of illicit drug use, racism, and violent acts, to occur on its platform. Pump.fun is a Solana-based meme coin launchpad that allows users to create and launch their own meme coins without needing technical expertise. It attracted millions of users, but still faced criticism for its alleged role in scams and unethical activities. In fact, data from Dune analyst Adam Tehc reveals that only 0.4% of the 14 million crypto wallets interacting with Pump.fun actually achieved profits of more than $10,000. Pump.fun previously allowed live streaming for token promotion but suspended the feature after it was misused for dangerous stunts. The platform also faced regulatory scrutiny after the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority banned access to Pump.fun in December to try and mitigate crypto-related scams. The law firm called for affected investors to join its investigation, and suggested that the potential class-action group could be in the millions. In addition to its fight against Pump.fun, Burwick Law is pursuing separate legal actions involving other crypto-related projects. These include cases against Moonbirds and Proof Collective NFTs, as well as the Full Send Metacard NFTs promoted by the Nelk Boys, which the firm alleges misled investors with unrealistic promises of benefits. Judge Fines BitMEX $100M Over BSA Violations A federal judge sentenced HDR Global Trading Limited, the parent company of crypto exchange BitMEX, to two years of unsupervised probation and a $100 million fine. The ruling was delivered on Jan. 15 in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York by Judge John Koeltl, approximately six months after BitMEX pleaded guilty to violating the US Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) by failing to implement an adequate Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program. The charges stemmed from BitMEX’s alleged lack of compliance with BSA requirements, as the platform allowed users to sign up with only an email address. This allowed people to bypass proper Know Your Customer standards. The US government claimed that BitMEX gained $155 million unlawfully from US sources between 2015 and 2020 and asked for a $417 million fine. However, the court dismissed all open counts against the firm as part of the sentencing and imposed a much smaller financial penalty. BitMEX statement to its users BitMEX called the charges “old news” in a statement to its users , and shared that it is very disappointed at the additional fine, even though it is far less than what the Department of Justice initially sought over the years. The firm and its executives previously settled separate regulatory cases, including a $100 million consent payment to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in 2021. BitMEX co-founders Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, Samuel Reed, and employee Gregory Dwyer already faced sentencing in 2022, and received probation for their roles in violating the BSA. In addition, Hayes, Delo, and Reed were ordered to pay $30 million in penalties as part of a civil settlement with the CFTC. The recent judgment appears to bring an end to the lengthy criminal and civil cases against BitMEX and its executives, which have lasted almost four years.

This team up will bring web3 services to over 450 million Jio users. What exactly is cooking between Reliance Jio and Polygon, let’s try to uncover. What This Means for Jio (and You) So, why does this matter? Jio Platforms, the company behind India’s biggest telecom network, has over 450 million users. That’s huge. By working with Polygon, they’re planning to make apps and services more advanced using blockchain tech. Kiran Thomas, CEO of Jio Platforms, said this is part of their push for “digital excellence.” But don’t let the fancy phrase throw you off—it’s basically about making things better and smarter. Sandeep Nailwal, Polygon’s co-founder, called it a big step for Web3 adoption in India. Source : X.com What kind of changes are we talking about? Well, details are still hush-hush, but Aishwary Gupta from Polygon hinted at some cool blockchain-based apps in the works. They might include NFT-based platforms, better payment systems, or even new ways to create online communities. This partnership will help both Reliance Jio and Polygon in getting more exposure to users and technology. Why Web3 Is a Big Deal Web3 has become a huge deal in the past few years. This is not something fancy but just a newer version of the internet. Why is it getting so famous? Because now you can own your online identity and everything you do on the internet. Think of it as a space where you have more control over your data, and everything is more secure. Blockchain is at the heart of it, powering everything from cryptocurrencies to NFT marketplaces. In India, Web3 is more than just a tech trend. It could fill gaps in the financial system, help small businesses, and even make e-commerce more fun with digital vouchers. Polygon is already leading this charge, working with big brands like Flipkart to bring Web3 to the mainstream. What’s Next This partnership between Reliance Jio and Polygon could change how millions of Indians use the internet. With Jio’s reach and Polygon’s expertise, Web3 might soon be something everyone can use, not just tech geeks. It’s still early, but the possibilities are endless. One thing is clear: the internet in India is about to get a serious upgrade.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MATIC|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-16 05:59:05

Hunter Horsley’s tweet suggests a nation might adopt Bitcoin ETFs for reserves. On Jan. 16, Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, revealed on Twitter that at least one national government has begun investigating the possibility of investing in Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded funds. We just provided some information for a nation state asking about Bitcoin ETFs. Considering moving some exposure from foreign currency govt bonds into BTC. Bitcoin is entering a new chapter — — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) January 15, 2025 According to Horsley, the unnamed nation is considering shifting a portion of its foreign exchange reserves—traditionally held in foreign government bonds—into BTC. Typically, countries hold reserves in stable assets such as U.S. Treasuries, euros, or other highly liquid foreign bonds. Shifting even a fraction of those reserves into Bitcoin would mark a stark departure from traditional reserve management. Although not specifically related to ETFs, El Salvador’s move to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021 was a landmark moment for sovereign-level crypto adoption. The latest development echoes the recent comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell , who described BTC more as a competitor to gold than a currency, highlighting the growing recognition of BTC as a viable asset class.

According to the latest data from Coinglass as of Jan. 16, the total assets under management for Bitcoin ETFs have reached nearly $113.45 billion, reflecting a steady inflow of investors. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) leads the market with an AUM of $53.46 billion, followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), each managing over $20 billion. The rising interest in BTC ETFs also aligns with legislative efforts at the state level to integrate BTC into everyday financial systems. In Oklahoma , State Senator Dusty Deevers recently introduced the “Bitcoin Freedom Act” (SB325), which would allow employees to receive salaries in BTC and enable businesses to accept BTC payments. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market has seen major growth ahead of Donald Trump’s Jan. 20, inauguration. Since Trump’s re-election, BTC’s price has climbed from $69,000 to over $100,000, buoyed by optimism surrounding his pro-business policies and the possibility of regulatory easing under his administration.

The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF saw record inflows and rapid asset accumulation in its inaugural year, driven largely by direct retail investor interest. The ETF also benefited from Bitcoin’s historic rally above $100,000 late last year, although enthusiasm may wane in the early months of 2025. Mitchnick acknowledged the recent outflows from ETFs but praised the product’s broader success. “We’re focused on being a valuable resource and educational partner for our clients,” he says, adding that adoption in the institutional and wealth advisory segments is an untapped opportunity. Related News: US Consumers Sue the Most Talked About Cryptocurrency Platform of Recent Days for Losing Money While individual investors were the primary driver of IBIT’s early success, the firm is now turning its attention to attracting institutional clients and wealth advisors, Mitchnick said. These segments face greater hurdles due to rigorous research and approval processes, but represent significant growth opportunities, he said. “We are still in the early days of adoption in the asset advisory and institutional segments,” Mitchnick explained. “There is great momentum among firms working to accelerate approvals that will allow advisors to incorporate Bitcoin into their client portfolios.” Mitchnick also highlighted the surge in institutional interest last quarter, as well as progress in wealth advisory channels, which he sees as a larger, longer-term opportunity. “Both segments are very important, but asset advisory may hold the most promise due to the increasing momentum in approvals,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

The cryptocurrency's price has surged 50% to seven-year highs above $3 this month, extending the past quarter's 240% rally, according to data source CoinDesk . Prices have gained 30% in the past seven days alone, lifting the market capitalization to $176.75 billion, the third-highest ahead of stablecoin tether. XRP is witnessing the fastest observed rally since the altcoin boom of January 2018, according to a popular market analysis tool called the relative strength index (RSI). The measure oscillates between 0 and 100, measuring the speed and change of price movement over specific periods, typically 14 days or 12 months. XRP's 14-month RSI has risen to 92, the highest level since October 2017, indicating that the momentum observed over the past 12 months is the strongest over seven years. Rookie traders would quickly point out that RSI readings above 70 indicate overbought conditions and potential for a bull breather or correction. However, that's not necessarily the case, as RSI merely measures the speed of price changes over a specific period. Indicators can continue to flash the so-called overbought reading longer than bears can stay solvent. As the law of motion states: an object in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by an outside force. ""Crypto continues its recovery from Monday’s drop, with BTC pushing towards the $100k mark. The broader market is rebounding, with altcoins like XRP and XLM standing out. XRP has reclaimed the 3rd spot among cryptocurrencies and surpassed BlackRock’s market cap,"" Diego Cardenas, OTC trader at digital asset platform Abra, said in a note to CoinDesk. ""This surge is driven by a growing number of partnerships, the launch of Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD, and speculation about a potential spot XRP ETF,"" Cardenas added. Currently, XRP-specific factors combined with broader crypto market dynamics support the ongoing bullish momentum. Take trading volumes for example. The spot market tally has tripled to over $23 billion in the past 24 hours, validating the price surge. Meanwhile, volumes in derivatives have more than doubled to $34 billion, according to data source Coingecko and Coinglass . XRP's perpetual futures open interest has surged to a record high of 2.34 billion XRP, with funding rates representing the cost of holding leveraged bets hovering around 13%. That's well below the overheated 100% in early December, which signaled excess bullish leverage. In other words, the XRP market is much healthier and supports continued price gains. Meanwhile, crypto market leader bitcoin has risen past $100,000, cheering the slowdown in the U.S. core inflation.

At the same time, analysts have turned highly bullish, with predictions of up to $10 per token during the ongoing cycle. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView Recall that the asset’s price stood at a mere $2.1 at the start of the year two weeks ago. Since then, it has been on a spectacular run that even the Monday crash couldn’t contain. The past few days alone have been nothing short of astonishing for the third-largest cryptocurrency, as it went from $2.3 on Monday to $3.2 earlier this morning. This represented a nearly 40% surge in about 72 hours and put its price at a seven-year peak. Despite retracing to under $3.1 now, XRP is still 9% up on the day and more than 30% higher than this time last week. This impressive rally came after the US CPI data was announced yesterday, which pushed many crypto assets north. However, XRP’s case is particularly impressive. It all started last week after reports that XRP whales had spent more than $2 billion to accumulate approximately a billion tokens within the span of just 48 hours. The positive developments have only intensified since then, including growing usage of the XRP network for massive transactions. Even the SEC’s late appeal in the legal case between the agency and Ripple couldn’t shake XRP’s gains. At the same time, popular analyst Ali Martinez outlined a massive price target for the asset of up to $10. After outlining the aforementioned whale accumulation, he added that the token has broken out of a bull pennant, which typically indicates the continuation of a substantial rally to the upside. He concluded that if the buying pressure continues in such a manner, it could send XRP’s price higher by more than 3x. $XRP is going to $10! pic.twitter.com/EAIhqpj4V4 — Ali (@ali_charts) January 15, 2025 The post Ripple (XRP) Surges to $3.2 With $10 Price Target in Sight This Cycle appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-01-16 06:49:51

According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $755.01 million in net inflows on Wednesday, breaking a four-day outflow streak during which over $1.2 billion exited the funds. Interestingly, the majority of the inflows on the day came from Fidelity’s FBTC, which attracted $463.08 million — its highest net positive flow since March 7 of last year, when it recorded an inflow of $473.4 million. ARK and 21Shares’ ARKB followed with an inflow of $138.81 million a huge jump from the modest inflow of $2.89 million recorded the previous day.

Among the notable altcoins to consider buying, Rexas Finance (RXS), Dogecoin (DOGE), Chainlink (LINK), and Sui (SUI) emerge as solid candidates for transforming a small $600 investment into $12,000. Here is why. 4 Altcoins to Consider Buying to Transform $600 into $12,000 in 2025 Transforming an investment of as low as $600 to $12,000 could be achievable, when considering altcoins to buy including Rexas Finance Dogecoin, Chain Link and Sui stand out as altcoins to buy. 1. Dogecoin (DOGE): Altcoin to Buy with High ROI Potential Dogecoin’s enduring popularity and strong community backing make it a favorite for high returns in 2025. Priced at $0.3769, DOGE recently gained 18% in one day, showcasing its bullish momentum. It has maintained its position as one of the most popular meme coins to buy , ranking as the 7th largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $55.52 billion, and, according to CoinMarketcap . Market Trends : Breaching the $0.35-$0.30 range, DOGE is now trading above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). Price Targets : Analysts including @JohncyCrypto anticipate a rise to $0.48, with the potential for further gains to $0.65 and beyond. Dogecoin has formed a bullish pennant pattern on the daily chart. Why Invest: Dogecoin’s loyal community and consistent market presence make it a gateway for transforming small investments into substantial profits. Source @JohncyCrypto (X.com) 2. Rexas Finance (RXS): Transforming Asset Investment on Blockchain Rexas Finance (RXS) has a big impact on real-world asset tokenization making it one of the most promising altcoins of 2025. RXS works at the forefront of blockchain innovation allowing smooth and clear investment in assets like real estate, art, and commodities. Presale success: RXS tokens cost $0.175 each, and the project has raised over $36 million, with 93.76% of tokens sold.

Over the past few years, we’ve witnessed meme coins like Floki Inu (FLOKI) and Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE) rocket in value after being listed on major exchanges like Binance, making early investors very happy. In fact, these coins have transformed the financial landscape for many, turning casual investors into crypto legends. Now, there’s a new name on the horizon that has been making waves— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . Word on the street is that BTFD Coin is gearing up for a potential Binance listing. So, should you jump in early and capitalize on this buzzworthy meme coin? Let’s dive into the best new meme coins to invest in this week, featuring BTFD Coin, Floki Inu, and Baby Doge Coin. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The New Meme Coin on the Block BTFD Coin (BTFD) is quickly becoming one of the best new meme coins to invest in this week. It’s no surprise that rumors are swirling about the potential Binance listing for BTFD, especially considering its impressive presale performance . Within just the first month of its presale launch, BTFD Coin raised over $2 million, signaling strong demand for this meme coin. BTFD has a unique focus on combining meme culture with real utility. The coin’s presale success, combined with its potential for explosive ROI, is only the beginning. BTFD offers staking rewards, Play2Earn (P2E) gaming, and a highly engaged community that calls itself the “Bulls Squad.” This focus on community-driven engagement has helped BTFD rise above its competitors. Presale performance has been nothing short of spectacular, with BTFD raising over $5.2 million so far. The coin is currently in Stage 13 of its presale, with a price of $0.000142 per coin. But here’s the kicker—when the presale ends, BTFD will be listed at $0.0006. This represents a 4000% ROI potential, which is massive for early investors. Analysts are already predicting that BTFD could se e significant price movements once it hits major exchanges. If BTFD gets listed on Binance, there’s a real chance of seeing explosive gains. Floki Inu (FLOKI): A Community-Driven Force Floki Inu (FLOKI) has captured the imagination of meme coin enthusiasts ever since it was launched. Named after Elon Musk’s dog, Floki has gained a passionate community of supporters who believe it can make a real impact in the crypto market. Why did FLOKI get listed on Binance? It’s simple: community strength, solid tokenomics, and continuous innovation. FLOKI isn’t just a meme coin—it’s a whole ecosystem, combining decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and even its own metaverse project. This diverse offering has helped FLOKI differentiate itself from the competition and prove that meme coins can be more than just jokes. Floki’s journey to Binance was no accident. The coin has captured the imagination of investors due to its strong social media presence, continued partnerships, and active engagement with its community. By focusing on real-world utility, such as its Floki University and NFT marketplace, FLOKI established itself as more than a meme—it’s now a platform that investors trust. Plus, FLOKI’s aggressive marketing strategy, including partnerships with influencers and campaigns like “Floki Everywhere,” certainly didn’t hurt its visibility. The coin’s rise has inspired many to wonder if it’s the future of meme coins, especially as its price soared post-Binance listing. But here’s the thing: FLOKI isn’t the only meme coin that’s causing a stir. Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE) is right behind, gaining traction and attracting attention. Let’s take a look at what makes Baby Doge Coin tick and why it’s also one of the best new meme coins to invest in this week. Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE): The Memetic King of Crypto If you’ve been anywhere near crypto Twitter, you’ve likely seen Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE) being mentioned in the same breath as major players like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. But why did Baby Doge Coin manage to secure a listing on Binance? The secret sauce lies in its hyperactive community, its tokenomics, and the love it has received from the meme-loving crowd. Baby Doge Coin capitalized on the meme coin craze with a simple yet effective marketing strategy. The coin became a fan favorite by creating its own charitable foundation and developing partnerships with organizations that benefit from the token’s success. Baby Doge’s high transaction volume, aggressive marketing campaigns, and celebrity endorsements boosted its legitimacy, earning it a spot on Binance’s listing. Since then, it’s gone from strength to strength, with its vibrant online community constantly pumping new energy into the project. Baby Doge is also a high-yield meme coin, offering rewards for holding tokens. Its deflationary tokenomics mean that tokens are burned with each transaction, which could drive scarcity and increase the value over time. Additionally, Baby Doge’s staking options and continuous roadmap updates have kept the community excited, ensuring that its popularity won’t fade anytime soon. Now, let’s talk about the rising star in the meme coin world—BTFD Coin. Here’s why BTFD is making waves and why you should keep your eye on it this week. Hurry Up Before the Next Big Meme Coin Hits the Market Here’s the deal: If you’re looking to invest in one of the best new meme coins to invest in this week, BTFD Coin is your chance to get in early.

Let’s break down an investment scenar io: If you put in $35,000 at the current presale price of $0.000142 per BTFD Coin, you’d get around 246 million coins. When BTFD hits the listing price of $0.0006, your investment could skyrocket to $147,600. That’s a massive potential return, all for acting now. This is not just a “get-rich-quick” scheme—it’s an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of the next big thing in meme coins.

On Thursday, Morgan rebuked the regulatory body’s claims in the opening brief, calling out on its lack of understanding of how the crypto market works. This saga, amid XRP price hitting $3, has gained significant traction across the crypto market globally. Pro-Ripple Lawyer Slams SEC As It Files New Opening Brief In XRP Lawsuit The U.S. SEC filed opening brief in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, sparking market discussions globally. The opening brief alleges that Ripple breached securities laws through its XRP sales, as also seen under the ‘Howey Test.’ Notably, “the American blockchain company’s actions and representations to investors (about increasing the value of their native coin) created a common expectation of profits,” the opening brief added. In an X post on January 16, attorney Bill Morgan criticized most of the claims made in this opening brief, stating, “This is absolute garbage and shows an appalling lack of knowledge by the SEC of how crypto markets work and price rises.” Morgan primarily points towards the market’s movement as a whole, saying rising tides and prices occur at a much broader level and not due to the promotions of an issuer.” All boats rise when the market rises and this usually conforms to Bitcoin rises,” he added. New Opening Brief Follows Stipulation Filing In XRP Lawsuit Meanwhile, it’s noteworthy that the opening brief follows both parties’ mutual decision to file a stipulation in the ongoing XRP lawsuit. CoinGape reported yesterday that the U.S. regulator and company agreed on a timeline to file a deferred appendix regarding cross-appeals in the Ripple vs. SEC case . Simultaneously, massive whale movements amid these legal maneuvers have also sparked noteworthy market intrigue. CoinGape revealed that XRP whales moved roughly 130M tokens amid recent legal developments, adding to speculations. XRP Price Gains Unprecedentedly Moreover, the American blockchain company’s native coin price has gained to unprecedented levels amid a broader crypto market recovery despite the increase in U.S. CPI inflation data . As a result, the abovementioned chronicle has further echoed a market frenzy. At press time, XRP price witnessed an 8% uptick in value and is currently trading at $3.07. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $2.72 and $3.18, respectively. The rising movement amid broader legal developments has sparked quite the investor enthusiasm. Moreover, despite legal uncertainty clouding the coin’s future run, market sentiments remain bullish concerning long-term prospects. CoinGape Media spotlighted that Ripple’s coin is among the leading cryptos that showcase the potential for long-term gains. Additionally, with the rising odds of an XRP ETF, per JP Morgan analysts, traders and investors continue to eye the crypto asset optimistically. In conclusion, the crypto has emerged as the talk of the digital assets sector, riding the back of legal developments and phenomenal price gains.

Much like the explosive growth these sectors experienced in 2021, the increasing integration of blockchain technology with gaming is expected to drive significant interest, perhaps rivalling the sheer lucrative hype-potential of meme coins as the bull run progresses. Rollblock has emerged as a trailblazer in the iGaming sector, offering a cutting-edge play-to-earn platform that merges traditional and blockchain-based gaming into one seamless experience. Appealing to investors and gamers in equal stead, here’s why Rollblock could become the next 100x iGaming opportunity during its tentative presale phase. Extensive Gaming Options Set Rollblock Apart In A Saturated Industry Rollblock’s success can partially be attributed to its diverse and expansive gaming catalog, designed to appeal to a broad user base irrespective of gaming experience. The platform features over 7,000 games, ranging from classic favorites like poker and blackjack to exclusive blockchain-exclusive titles that can’t be found elsewhere. Partnering with top gaming providers, Rollblock continues to expand its offerings with plans to add over 100 new games in 2025. This relentless innovation positions the platform to become the most comprehensive gaming destination in the budding blockchain iGaming sector. Adding to its already-immense appeal on the surface, Rollblock recently added sports betting services into its ambit. This strategic expansion aligns with the platform’s mission to become the ultimate one-stop GameFi and betting hub, enabling Rollblock’s user base various ways to have fun and make a profit. Innovative Revenue Sharing And Tokenomics Make Rollblock A Standout Investment Rollblock’s groundbreaking revenue-sharing model is a major draw for investors. The platform allocates 30% of its profits to buy back RBLK tokens, with half permanently burned to reduce supply and the other half distributed as staking rewards. This deflationary mechanism increases token scarcity and incentivizes long-term holding, stabilizing the ecosystem and fostering sustainable growth for the RBLK token in a volatile marketplace. As a play-to-earn platform, Rollblock also rewards active engagement, encouraging users to participate in games regularly. This ingenious approach has helped build a strong and loyal community while reducing price volatility, with Rollblock’s user base now totalling 30,000+ members in counting. Audits And State-Of-The-Art Encryption Set Rollblock Apart In The $465 Billion iGaming Market Rollblock sets the standard for security in the iGaming space, utilizing advanced AI-powered systems to ensure the safety of all transactions and bets alongside state-of-the-art encryption. This robust security infrastructure guarantees protection over potential hacks or breaches that are unfortunately all too common with alternative iGaming and GambleFi providers. In addition to Rollblock’s steadfast dedication to protecting user funds and data, Rollblock is licensed by Gaming Anjouan and has undergone rigorous audits conducted by renowned security firms such as SolidProof. This ensures that the Rollblock platform is free from vulnerabilities and fully compliant with industry standards, validating the integrity of Rollblock’s smart contracts and preventing the chance for erroneous insider sell-offs that haunt other presale prospects. Why Rollblock Offers One Of The Best Opportunities For 100x Returns In Q2-Q4 The GameFi sector is poised for a significant resurgence in 2025. If this sector repeats even a modicum of what it achieved in 2021, gaming cryptocurrencies could amass anywhere from 25-1000x gains later this year, though the window to accumulate is shortening daily. Currently priced at just $0.045 during its ninth presale stage, RBLK tokens offer an incredible opportunity for early investors to secure potential 50-100x returns in a tantalizing iGaming gem.

The daily trading volume has also skyrocketed by a massive 301% to $1.68 billion suggesting strong bullish momentum moving ahead. This comes amid strong LTC whale accumulation along with the growing optimism for Litecoin ETF approval. What’s Behind the Litecoin Price Rally? After forming a strong base at $100, the Litecoin price has gained 18% in the last 24 hours supported by a strong boost in the daily trading volumes. As per the Coinglass data , the LTC open interest has shot up by 30% to $582 million while the 24-hour liquidations have surged to $1.60 million with $1.28 million in short liquidations. As per blockchain analytics firm Santiment, the Litecoin price surge comes due to increased activity from large investors, specifically whales and sharks holding at least 10,000 LTC. These entities have collectively accumulated 250,000 LTC since January 9, signaling strong institutional and large-scale investor interest. Source: Santiment This pattern mirrors similar activity observed in early December. Thus, this reinforces the notion that big players are showing much interest in LTC with the expectations of further price gains. LTC Rally to $200 And Beyond Very Soon? As LTC has bounced back from the support of $100 with strong trading volumes, analysts are bullish regarding its next leg of the rally to $200 and beyond. Popular crypto analyst Solberg Invest stated that LTC has completed a “retest” phase following its breakout from a long-term downward trendline. This development, combined with the appearance of a triple-bottom pattern on the chart, signals that Litecoin may be set for a significant upward move, potentially gaining $200 in value. Source: Solberg Invest XBT Liquidators has highlighted a bullish setup in Litecoin’s chart that has largely gone unnoticed. The analysis points to the role of Gann angles, which, once broken, can act as strong support or resistance levels. With Litecoin price holding above the Gann angle without retracing, the analysts suggest this is a highly bullish signal. They predict that a move to $250 in the next upward leg is a “no-brainer. On the other, other market analysts have shared an LTC price prediction of $500 by mid-2025. No one talking about this $LTC chart. Remember, gann angles, once broken, can act like support/resistance. Since LTC price didn’t dump back below the gann angle, this is very bullish. $250 on the next leg up is a no-brainer. pic.twitter.com/OzMAYKNily — XBT Liquidators (@Cryptard3000) January 15, 2025 Optimism Around Litecoin ETF Grows On Wednesday, Canary Capital submitted the S-1 application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot Litecoin ETF. Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, has hinted at progress in Litecoin ETF approval . Balchunas noted that reports suggest the Litecoin S-1 filing has received comments from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), signaling a step forward. “This development supports our prediction that Litecoin is the most likely candidate for the next ETF approval,” Balchunas stated. As of press time, the LTC price is trading 17.31% up at $119.31.

This impressive performance stands in stark contrast to the broader cryptocurrency market, where major players like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have struggled to maintain upward momentum. Analyst Highlights ‘Massive Bullish Breakout’ For The XRP Price Analysts are now predicting that the XRP price and its upward trajectory may continue, driven by strong buying pressure and positive market sentiment seen during the past month. Notably, market expert and technical analyst Ali Martinez recently identified in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter) what he describes as a “massive bullish breakout” for the XRP price. Related Reading: BREAKING: BitMEX Fined $100 Million For US Money-Laundering Violations According to Martinez’s analysis, on-chain data indicates a significant accumulation of XRP coins, with over 1.10 billion tokens purchased in the past week alone.This aggressive buying activity has created a sense of momentum, further supported by technical indicators. Martinez further highlights that the XRP price has broken out of a bull pennant formation—a classic bullish pattern that suggests further price increases could be on the horizon. The analyst posits that if the current buying trend persists, the XRP price could potentially reach new all-time highs of $10, significantly exceeding its current record of $3.40 reached in 2018. However, not all indicators are pointing toward unmitigated success. Martinez also highlighted that the TD Sequential indicator, a popular tool among traders, has flashed a sell signal on the 4-hour chart for the XRP price, suggesting that a price correction in the short-term could be imminent. The Crucial Hurdle For XRP’s Continued Bullish Momentum Adding to the optimism for XRP holders, another analyst known as Dom has drawn comparisons between the current price action and that of the XRP price in 2017. Dom’s analysis shows a striking fractal pattern, where XRP spent 25 days in a consolidation phase before experiencing a significant rally. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Gearing Up To Fly After Lows, Here’s The Target Currently, XRP has been consolidating for about 30 days, leading Dom to predict a similar bullish breakout could follow, potentially leading to new all-time highs. As of the latest trading, XRP has retraced slightly to around $2.93, attempting to establish this level as support for future gains. However, the $3 mark remains a formidable resistance level, representing a barrier that has not been surpassed in over seven years. Overcoming this threshold will be critical for XRP to maintain its bullish momentum and for traders to gain confidence in the altcoin’s long-term trajectory.

The breakout of the “flag and pole” pattern further fuels the bullish outlook, indicating that the price could continue its upward trajectory. XRP Price Hits $3, Fueled by “Bull Flag” Pattern, Eyes $10, $15, and $20 The chart highlights a strong upward trend for XRP, featuring a classic “bull flag” pattern, a common indicator of a continuation in price movement. This outlook is shared by the crypto market due to Bitcoin’s recent rally . After breaking out of the consolidation phase, XRP has identified $5 as the first psychological target. The next key milestone is $10, which aligns with the projected move based on the flagpole’s measurement. With sustained bullish momentum and growing investor confidence, XRP price could climb to $15. Ultimately, the psychological level of $20 stands as a major target, representing a significant gain from its current price.

This month alone, its price skyrocketed by 50%, smashing through a seven-year high above $3. If that isn’t impressive enough, the cryptocurrency has surged 240% over the past quarter. It’s now the third-largest crypto, outranking Tether with a staggering $176.75 billion market cap. What’s driving this explosive growth, and could this momentum last? The Fastest Rally Since 2018 XRP’s current surge isn’t just significant—it’s historic. This is the fastest price rally since January 2018, a time many crypto enthusiasts remember as the golden age of altcoins. One technical indicator, the 14-month Relative Strength Index (RSI), has reached a striking 84.80. That’s the highest since December 2017, when it reached 94.57. Source : Tradingview Now, here’s an interesting thing. Usually, an RSI over 70 signals that an asset might be “overbought.” But in strong bull markets like this one, these readings don’t always mean a correction is near. In fact, they can stick around while prices keep climbing. Market Trends and XRP’s Rising Popularity Trading activity has gone through the roof. Spot trading volumes have surged by 84.72% to $22.85 billion in just 24 hours. Derivatives trading isn’t lagging behind either, with volumes more than doubling to $34 billion. Perpetual futures open interest? A record-breaking 2.34 billion XRP. Healthy funding rates, currently sitting at 13%, hint at sustained market enthusiasm without the risk of overheating. Source : Coinglass But it’s not just the numbers driving XRP’s rally. Ripple’s new stablecoin, RLUSD, and growing speculation about a potential spot XRP ETF are adding fuel to the fire. Partnerships supporting XRP adoption are also creating a buzz. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s rise past $100,000, helped by optimism over slowing U.S. inflation , is boosting the overall crypto market. Ripple effects (pun intended) are benefiting other altcoins like XRP and XLM. What to Expect Next XRP’s rise looks more than just a hype in the market. Its reclaimed third spot in the crypto rankings, surpassing even BlackRock in market cap, points to a shift in market sentiment. Add to that strong funding rates and strategic developments, and XRP might just have more room to grow. As XRP continues its winning streak, all eyes are on whether this momentum can sustain or if we’re in for a reality check.

Speculation also grows around Trump-linked crypto moves, adding intrigue to Solana’s upward trajectory amidst market-wide optimism. Solana (SOL) Price Gains as Trump Turns Away From ETH – Time to Buy? Recent blockchain data reveals that World Liberty Financial, linked to Trump, has executed substantial BTC to ETH trades.

Such strategic moves from high-profile entities suggest renewed confidence in Ethereum’s long-term prospects, sparking conversations about its broader market impact. This activity could also influence other altcoins like Solana price, which remains a top choice for scalability and innovation. With Ethereum drawing institutional attention, Solana might benefit from the market’s growing appetite for alternatives. Investors are now eyeing SOL as it holds steady amid fluctuating market conditions. Source: X SOL Price Eyes $220 as TD Sequential Flashes Buy Signal Solana price has displayed a bullish signal on the daily chart, according to the TD Sequential indicator. This technical indicator suggests the possibility of a rebound that could propel Solana toward the $220 mark. The TD Sequential is a popular tool used by traders to identify potential price reversals in the market. On the Solana chart, the indicator highlighted a buy signal, aligning with market sentiment for a recovery. Currently, Solana price is trading near critical support levels, which might provide the foundation for an upward trajectory. If the rebound materializes, the top altcoin price is expected to test resistance zones and aim for the $220 target. This projection aligns with key Fibonacci retracement levels, adding to the optimism surrounding Solana’s performance. Source: Tweet SOL Price Analysis Solana demonstrates resilience after a sharp 22% drop in early Jan, retaining its top blockchain position. Notably, Solana surpassed Ethereum in decentralized exchange (DEX) trade volume, solidifying its dominance. Reports suggest a Solana ETF could further boost the platform’s growth trajectory. At the time of writing, the SOL price is $202.76, with a 10% daily increase. The cryptocurrency has seen a steady climb within an ascending channel on the 24-hour chart. Buyers are pushing the asset closer to a key resistance level at $210. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 66, signaling a bullish sentiment while approaching the overbought zone. If the Solana price prediction manages to break above $210, the next target would likely be the $220 resistance zone. Conversely, a decline below $200 might push the price back to the critical support at $190. Key levels to watch include support zones at $200 and $190, along with resistance levels at $210 and $220.

He added that the politically driven lawsuit was just noise and merely a rehash of already failed arguments. The Ripple CLO said a new era of pro-innovation regulation was coming, and Ripple was thriving. He congratulated attorney Paul Grewal and Coinbase for their win against the U.S. SEC on January 3rd, stating that Gensler’s anti-crypto crusade would end on January 20th. U.S. attorney Hogan said the U.S. SEC was only appealing the ruling that what the XRP sold to retail investors on exchanges were not sales of securities, not that the investors were harmed. He added that he was a little shocked that the U.S. SEC had failed to get any reasonable evidence into the record that actual XRP retail buyers knew about Ripple and its ‘promises’ to them. James Filan, defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor, said the parties had filed a stipulation stating they would file a deferred appendix for the cross-appeals 21 days after the appellee’s brief was served. Attorney says the U.S. SEC’s opening brief is ‘lacklustre’ at best 2. I honestly found the brief lackluster – almost as though the drafter knew he was wasting his time. For example, almost half the brief was spent just reiterating what the trial court ruled. That part of the brief was almost as long as the trial court ruling itself! It's kind… — Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) January 16, 2025 Hogan asserted that the U.S. SEC’s brief was hard to work through because it lacked conviction, almost as though the drafter knew they were wasting time. Almost half the initial Ripple v. SEC appeal brief – nearly as long as the trial court ruling itself – was spent reiterating what the trial court ruled. Hogan said it was kind of like trying to talk a girl into going out with you and spending half the time telling her back the reasons she said ‘no’ previously. At heart, what the U.S. SEC wanted the appellate court to say was that it did not have to prove that XRP buyers were aware of Ripple’s statements that it would work to increase XRP’s price, said the attorney. According to Hogan, the U.S. SEC relied primarily on three cases for that proposition. He, however, claimed the problem with the U.S. SEC – from his reading of the first two cases – was that they said no such thing. Hogan added that not needing to show ‘reliance’, which the U.S. SEC argued, was completely different from not needing to even show knowledge – which the trial court ruled was missing in the Ripple case. “Expect Ripple to destroy this in its reply, if we get there.” – Jeremy Hogan Hogan believes the U.S. SEC’s best bet is to ‘Frankenstein’ together a case that helped them. He, however, pointed out that reading the case revealed that the investors knew exactly who the seller was and what the promises were. Expect Ripple to distinguish this case to shreds as well, said Hogan. Trump’s incoming administration increases hope for Ripple’s win Alderoty was certain that Gensler’s war on crypto at the U.S. SEC would end on January 20th, immediately after Trump’s inauguration. He pointed out that Ripple was confident in its position on the appeal, and it looked forward to working with the new U.S. SEC leadership to resolve most of its pending complaints. According to Alderoty, a federal appeals court had laid bare what the industry had repeated for years: Gensler’s selective enforcement of securities laws was a (not so) hidden attempt to ban the crypto industry. The Ripple CLO urged the incoming government to cleanse the agency of lingering stains, saying that there was much more to do to repair the damage. Alderoty said Ripple planned to expose the U.S. SEC’s lawless tactics. A court disclosed that the U.S. SEC was adopting its litigation positions to further its desired goals, not out of faithful allegiance to the law. Alderoty said the question was not whether the U.S. SEC under Gensler, it was. Vivek Ramaswamy claimed the worst part about the U.S. SEC was that it regularly lost cases in federal court because they ‘contorted’ their rules in illegal and unconstitutional ways.

Despite broader market pullbacks, XRP demonstrated a 10% rally last weekend, only to face a modest retracement. As the market recovered, the asset has led the pack, showing a notable 16.82% gain in the past week. Understanding the XRP Megaphone Pattern This analysis focuses on a broadening price pattern known as the “megaphone pattern,” formed on XRP’s 1-month chart. This pattern is characterized by higher highs and higher lows, indicating that bulls are in control, despite the increased volatility. According to EGRAG , the megaphone structure has a 70% win ratio and can be more reliable on longer timeframes. The pattern was first identified by EGRAG in March 2023 when the token was priced at $0.3895. At that time, the analyst noted that the megaphone pattern had formed, representing potential future price increases. The structure’s distinctive feature is its three major bottoming phases and three major price upswings. #XRP – Megaphone Pattern (UPDATE): Recall: Who remembers the Megaphone Pattern from March 2023? If it doesn’t ring a bell, here’s a recap from our post on March 9, 2023: https://t.co/1f3zkgpPGP Price Target: I’m reluctant to mention the top price target of the MEGAPHONE… https://t.co/pAlQu06cvh pic.twitter.com/YTQJyCTHwO — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) January 13, 2025 XRP Historical Price Movements and Current Rebound EGRAG highlights the asset’s past price movements to understand the significance of the megaphone pattern. The first bottoming phase occurred in September 2014, when the token reached a floor price of $0.00058. After this low, the cryptocurrency rebounded, reaching a peak of $0.0306 by December 2014. A subsequent correction led to a second bottom of $0.003 in January 2017, followed by another price rally, with XRP reaching an all-time high of $3.5 in January 2018. This represented the second major upswing. Afterward, the token underwent a significant pullback, lasting for seven years. This correction ended in July 2024 when the price bottomed at $0.3899. With the current rebound, the analyst believes the digital asset is now experiencing the third upswing, which could push the cryptocurrency toward higher price levels. Price Targets and Market Expectations EGRAG’s latest analysis outlines three key price targets for XRP as it moves through this third upswing. Based on Fibonacci retracement levels, the first target is $8.15, corresponding to the Fib. 1.272 mark. If the token surpasses this level, the next target would be $13.3, which aligns with Fibonacci’s 1.414 level. According to EGRAG , the final target is $27.05, corresponding to Fibonacci 1.618, representing a nearly 10-fold increase from its current price of $2.54. EGRAG also notes that for the token to confirm the validity of this megaphone pattern, traders should monitor both price action and volume indicators. An increase in trading volume and consistently trading above key breakout points confirm that the pattern is unfolding as expected. Although EGRAG previously suggested more ambitious targets in earlier analyses, he has opted not to set overly optimistic price projections this time. He emphasized that while the potential for significant price movement exists, especially given the recent rebound, he aims to avoid misleading new traders by overestimating potential gains. In conclusion, while the megaphone pattern on XRP’s chart suggests the possibility of significant price increases, traders should carefully monitor the asset’s price movements and volume to confirm the trend. If the pattern holds, the token could be set for a major rally toward the $27 mark. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Saves California on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Saves California by entering its contract address – 2mtzeaYqDPLtCemX5jNPuuq8jw65cbgNUXuT3fBra2M2 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCALI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-16 07:50:00

This has triggered a massive $755.1 million in Bitcoin ETF inflows, with Fidelity’s FBTC leading at $463 million. Bitcoin ETF Recorded an Inflow Of $750 Million According Farside report Bitcoin ETF recorded a net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs soared to $755 million, as institutional investors eagerly seized the opportunity to purchase Bitcoin at a dip. This surge in ETF investments marks a sharp reversal after four consecutive trading sessions of outflows. Over 7,500 Bitcoins were scooped up from the market by these investment products, outpacing the daily Bitcoin production of only 450 BTC. Leading this inflow charge was Fidelity FBTC with an impressive $463.1 million in inflows, but Ark Invest’s ARKB also saw notable inflows of $138.8 million.

What Fueling This Surge? The surge in Bitcoin ETF inflows can be traced back to the recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. For December, the CPI rose by 0.4% , bringing the annual inflation rate to 3.2% after a 0.3% increase in November. This higher inflation reading sparked speculation about future interest rate cuts, with the CME FedWatch tool suggesting a 30% chance of a rate cut during the Federal Reserve’s meeting in March. Along with this, the S&P 500 experienced a jump of over 100 points, adding $900 billion in market value.

This legislation comes amid growing tensions about national security and the environmental impact of crypto mining, fueling arguments about how to balance technological innovation with public safety and community well-being. Reasons behind the SB 60 Bill The bill is inspired by recent events in Cabot, Arkansas, where Florida-based real estate investment firm Interstate Holdings began building a cryptocurrency mining plant near the Little Rock Air Force Base. The crypto mining plant is located less than five miles from the airbase, which has concerned local leaders and citizens. National security is a major concern, as Senator Hill asked: “Why did they pick this facility that’s less than five miles away from our air base?” Hill added, “This is a national security concern”. Cabot Mayor Ken Kincade added to the argument by mentioning the negative impact of noise pollution and environmental degradation caused by cryptocurrency mining operations. “These centres cause loud noise disturbances and pollution that negatively affect our people, pets, wild animals, nature, and overall well-being”. The law proposes an exemption for existing cryptocurrency mining operations that were fully constructed and operational before Dec. 31, 2024. This ensures that existing firms are not forced to close their operations by regulations. The rise of crypto mining regulation in the US Arkansas is hardly the only state fighting the repercussions of crypto mining. The Biden administration previously prohibited a Chinese-linked cryptocurrency mining company from utilizing territory near the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Similarly, banking Senator Elizabeth Warren has expressed concerns about foreign-owned crypto mining operations, describing them as a threat to national security. “They’re loud, they’re hot, and they suck up a ton of electricity, which can crash the power grid,” Warren said in July of 2024. Not everyone supports the bill. Dustin Curtis, Vice President of Interstate Holdings, has attacked the proposed legislation, claiming it unfairly targets cryptocurrency mining businesses. According to the local news outlet Arkansas Money and Politics: “This bill would make Arkansas the only state in America with anything like this. No one from the governor’s or attorney general’s office asked for this.” Curtis further defended the company’s operations, claiming that the facility conforms with all state and federal noise, environmental impact, and security standards. He says the Cabot site has lower noise levels than the surrounding state highway.

The XRP price rose by 50% in January, reaching a seven-year high above $3. With this rise, XRP continued its 240% rise in the last quarter of 2024, moving into third place, surpassing stablecoin giant Tether. While it was stated that the XRP rise was due to whale accumulation and the expectation for an increasing XRP ETF, another reason for the rise was the ATH in XRP's futures open interest. Analysts said that the XRP price has made its fastest rise in recent years, amid record activity in XRP-related derivatives. At this point, XRP perpetual futures open interest reached an all-time high of 2.34 billion XRP. This is well below the overheated 100% in early December, which signaled excessive bull leverage, analysts said, making the XRP market much healthier and supportive of continued price gains. Diego Cardenas, an OTC trader at digital asset platform Abra, said that XRP-specific factors, combined with broader crypto market dynamics, are supporting the ongoing bullish momentum. “Cryptocurrencies continue to recover from Monday’s decline, with Bitcoin breaking past the $100,000 level. The broader market is also recovering, with altcoins like XRP and XLM leading the way. XRP reclaims 3rd place among cryptocurrencies and surpasses BlackRock's market cap. “This increase is being driven by a growing number of partnerships, the launch of Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD, and speculation about a potential spot XRP ETF.” XRP continues to trade at $3.11, up 8.5% in the last 24 hours. *This is not investment advice.

The secure crypto wallet 1FUEL is being tipped as the best cryptocurrency to buy now after winning over analysts and traders alike with its unique take on cross-chain crypto transactions, advanced privacy features and military-grade cold storage. Read on to find out why this game changing new entrant is expected to deliver early returns above 500% to investors switching from Avalanche and Binance Coin. There’s More Than A Bear Pattern Pulling Investor Attention From Avalanche to 1FUEL The bears have recently taken control of Avalanche, with price losses erasing almost all of the progress made over the last few weeks. Avalanche is currently trading at $36.28, which represents a loss of 29.34% in the last month. This level is just a hair’s breadth from Avalanche’s critical resistance level of $35 . If that price is breached, analysts believe AVAX could drop as low as $27 . Another downside for Avalanche is that there are signs investor interest is waning with a drop in Open Interest and reduced market participation. With its technically-advanced proposition and completely groundbreaking one-click, cross-chain crypto transactions, 1FUEL is a dynamic and innovative Avalanche alternative. Binance Coin Investors Are Also Looking To 1FUEL As Price Pressure Continues Any period of price pressure makes a compelling argument for considering portfolio diversification and that could be exactly what’s happening right now for Binance Coin investors. So far this week, Binance Coin has fallen below moving average lines, and a low of around $660 could be upcoming if the backwards slide continues. A good way to describe Binance Coin’s most recent price action would be ‘changeable’. Its price trajectory continues to move from one range to the other, with a sharp drop on Monday followed by a climb to recovery. Binance Coin could be feeling the fall out from expectations that the Federal Reserve will pause its program of rate cuts, a suggestion which has also caused Bitcoin a few headaches. For Binance Coin investors, now is an optimal moment to consider an entirely different value proposition. The secure crypto wallet 1FUEL is attracting both Binance Coin and Avalanche whales by virtue of its technical credentials, privacy features and its exponential potential. Thanks to a pioneering approach to cross-chain transactions, 1FUEL has higher levels of utility and accessibility than its rivals and an unlimited scope to transform digital asset management at every level. 1FUEL’s advanced technology handles the complexities of cross-chain transactions on behalf of its users, empowering everyone, regardless of crypto expertise, to chain across blockchains. This unlocks DeFi access to millions of users currently locked out from the industry entirely, meaning 1FUEL’s potential is limitless. Join The Presale The 1FUEL presale is happening now. Don’t miss your chance to be in line for early returns which are expected to exceed 500%, projected 100x returns on public launch and up to 30% APR staking rewards.

In a new analysis , the chief investment officer of the crypto asset management firm Bitwise predicts that hundreds of companies will add BTC to their corporate treasuries in the next 12–18 months, which he thinks will cause the Bitcoin market to surge. Hougan notes the trend is already a lot bigger than MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of BTC. “MicroStrategy gets all the press, but it’s hardly alone. Today, 70 publicly traded companies own Bitcoin on their balance sheets, and many private companies do as well (including Bitwise, by the way). The public-company list includes well-known crypto companies like Coinbase and Marathon Digital, as well as non-crypto companies like Block, Tesla, Semlar Scientific, and Mercado Libre. Together, these companies—excluding MicroStrategy—own 141,302 BTC. Private companies aren’t required to report their holdings, but the ones who have done so voluntarily (SpaceX, Block.one, etc.) own at least another 368,043 BTC, according to BitcoinTreasuries.com . That’s significant. It means that, even today, MicroStrategy is less than 50% of the corporate BTC market. I suspect it’ll be a small fraction of it eventually.” The Bitwise CIO argues that the reputational risk of buying Bitcoin is diminishing, especially with the incoming Trump Administration’s embrace of crypto. Hougan also notes that a change in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) surrounding Bitcoin will impact the number of companies that choose to invest in the top crypto asset. “Starting in December, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) — which governs how publicly traded companies report financials—implemented a new rule called ASU 2023-08 that changes how bitcoin is accounted for in GAAP reporting. Prior to the start of this year, bitcoin was treated under GAAP as an “intangible asset” subject to “impairment testing.” That meant companies that bought Bitcoin had to mark its value on their books upon purchase and then write down the value if the price fell. But if the price rose, they were not allowed to mark the value back up. I know that sounds crazy, but it’s true. Under ASU 2023-08, however, that changes. Now, if Bitcoin’s price goes up, companies can mark the value to market and book a profit.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Since the start of 2025, the Bitcoin market has seen a growth of 6.65%. With a growth of 2.9%, in the last 24 hours, the market has outperformed the overall crypto sector. What are the prime factors that have supported the market to achieve this growth? Let’s discuss the factors deeply. Ready? Bitcoin’s $100K Rebound Sparks Hope It was on December 5, 2024, that the BTC market achieved the milestone of $100K. On December 17, the market reached an all-time-high of $108,369.05 . On the last day of 2024, the market was at $93,552.66 – nearly 13.67% below the ATH. In the first six days of 2025, the market witnessed a sharp growth of 9.30%, pushing the price once again above the $100K range. However, between January 7 and 9, the market experienced a correction of 9.4%. Even though the market has not yet completely recovered from the correction, between January 14 and 15, it recorded an impressive growth of 6.30%. It was that sharp upward momentum which helped the market to rebound to the $100K level. Right now, the BTC price stands at $99,784.47. Key Factors Influencing the Market Trump’s Inauguration and SEC Policies Donald Trump, who promised to bring policies to support the growth of the crypto sector, will take oath as the president of the United States of America on January 20, 2025. Crypto enthusiasts strongly believe that he will introduce several regulatory changes to create a conducive environment for the futuristic industry. US Federal Reserve’s Stance In December, the US core inflation rate dropped from 3.3% to 3.2%. During the previous FOMC meeting , the authority expressed a hawkish stance on the matter of interest rates. The data is expected to encourage the US Fed to rethink its stance on interest rates. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market is Up Today?

BTC On-Chain Metrics Reflects Positive Trends Reports say that the Bitcoin market has witnessed a sharp rise in the number of wallets holding 10+ BTC. What this indicates is strong confidence among BTC whales. Reports add that the market has also experienced a fall in the number of small wallets. However, experts say that shrinking aligns with historical patterns of market rallies. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s rise above $100K marks a promising start to January, with macro events and on-chain signals aligning positively. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin again attempted to rise above the crucial resistance at $100K but failed to sustain. Meanwhile, the bulls prevented excessive price drain as the markets flipped the prevailing bearish price action. The main reason for the growing certainty over the markets is the rising XRP price , as it remained passive for quite a long time. Now that the levels have marked a 7-year high, the probability of a new ATH above $4 seems inevitable. Recent reports suggest that the ongoing Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit is approaching its destiny. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer believes the ongoing lawsuit will be scrapped soon after Trump assumes his office as the new President of the U.S. This has made the market participants optimistic about the token and the rising search volume for XRP surpassing Bitcoin substantiates the claim. With the rise in the search volume, there is also an increase in trading activity. Active address count, which displays the traffic over the platform, has rebounded from the interim lows, suggesting a massive increase in trading activity. It indicates a steep rise in the number of addresses contacting the platform to perform a trade, regardless of whether it is a buy, sell, or swap trade. The active address count has been surging since the November 2024 breakout but has been consistently rising since the start of the month. The addresses have surged from the range of around 63K to levels above 97K in the past couple of days. While the trading activity is on the run, there has been a constant drop in the new traders as the active supply maintains a steep descending trend. This suggests the whales have been actively trading on the platform and as a result, their wallet count has been increasing dramatically. The address count with more than 1 million XRP tokens has surged from levels around 2200 to as high as 2600, hinting towards a massive whale accumulation. With this, the XRP price has secured levels not seen since January 2018. Now that the XRP price has broken the upper resistance of a bearish pattern, a continued ascending trend could be imminent. This suggests XRP could be a sleeping giant, as the price now appears to be primed to mark a new ATH in a short while from now.",Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-16 08:13:05

While VeChain and Hedera are battling bearish forces, Remittix recently reached a new ATH (all time high), rewarding early backers with gains reaching 30% . The continued interest in the Remittix presale and its potential 800% surge make $RTX a must-buy this January. Remittix (RTX): Transforming Global Payments with the Power of PayFi The $190 trillion global remittance business is facing long-standing challenges. Expensive fees, avoidable delays, and limited flexibility make cross-border payments tough for people and companies. Standard systems fail to close the gap between digital currencies and fiat, rendering users disappointed and underserved. To address these problems, Remittix (RTX) launched its PayFi protocol , which links conventional banking with decentralized finance. This protocol lets users send and receive over 50 crypto pairs and immediately convert them to thirty-plus fiat currencies. By integrating local banking networks, Remittix ensures smooth global transfers without the hidden fees or lengthy processing times typical of traditional systems. One of the biggest barriers in the payment industry is transparency, especially with exchange rates and hidden charges. Remittix eliminates these concerns with its flat-fee structure, guaranteeing users get exactly what they send. Unlike competitors like Stripe, Wise, or Coinbase, Remittix uniquely enables crypto-to-fiat transfers directly to bank accounts, providing unmatched convenience. The benefits are transformative for businesses. With the Remittix Pay API, companies can accept cryptocurrency payments and settle them in fiat, offering flexibility in managing funds. Businesses can also create merchant accounts, giving them full control over cash-outs and enabling conversions between multiple currencies. Security remains a cornerstone of the platform. Transactions on Remittix are immutable and tamper-proof, reducing chargebacks and fraud. Certifications from BlockSAFU and SolidProof further enhance trust, while locked liquidity pools ensure price stability for RTX tokens. Currently priced below at $0.0207, RTX tokens offer immense potential, with projections suggesting they could reach $1 by year-end. Remittix is not just solving payment problems; it’s paving the way for a more efficient and inclusive global economy. VeChain’s Path to Recovery: Potential Gains Amid Market Challenges VeChain (VET) is currently trading at $0.04513, marking a small 0.5% gain in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, the cryptocurrency has bounced back from a 18% fall, slipping from $0.05 to its current value. However, daily trading activity has surged, with $86.5 million worth of VET exchanged in just one day which is an impressive 56% increase. Looking ahead, VeChain’s partnerships with Walmart and BMW are paving the way for growth in 2025. The anticipated “VeChain Renaissance” upgrade is also expected to drive adoption and innovation within the ecosystem. Analysts predict the possibility of VET reaching $0.1, comparing the current cycle to a previous phase where the coin surged 6,538%, gaining $0.19888 in value. With rising collaborations and upgrades, VeChain could be positioned for significant gains in the near future. Hedera’s Vision For 2025: Innovations and Strategic Growth Hedera (HBAR) is trading around $0.30, reflecting a 5% increase in the last 24 hours. Despite the fluctuations, the Hedera network is gearing up for a transformative year ahead. One key highlight is the upcoming launch of “UP,” a Layer-2 blockchain by Karate Combat, set to debut in early 2025. UP aims to revolutionize sports and esports through Web3 integration. Under the guidance of CEO Charles Atkins, Hedera is merging AI and DeFi to advance its blockchain capabilities, tackling challenges like compliance and trust. A noteworthy collaboration with Nvidia and Intel on a Verifiable Compute framework is also in progress.

The company explains that Aurora Cloud Console is a no-code platform that enables everyone to spin up and launch their very own EVM-friendly blockchain at zero cost and with minimal effort or expertise. It’s aimed at memecoins and dApps that would rather enjoy the benefits of having their very own network, as opposed to deploying on the super-congested Ethereum chain or another blockchain. One of the major benefits of having your own chain, of course, is that you don’t have to share it with anyone else. That means you’ll benefit from blazing-fast transactions as there are no other tokens and services you’ll need to compete with. The Aurora blockchains are built on solid infrastructure provided by NEAR Protocol , and inherit that network’s solid security and scalability, ensuring they can meet the needs of even the most popular projects. Aurora Labs explains that its goal with the new console is to make launching a fully-customizable blockchain as simple as the process of building an online store on a platform such as Shopify. In other words, even the biggest moron should be able to get one up and running. When creating a blockchain on the Aurora Cloud Console, what you’re actually getting is an Aurora Virtual Chain, which is somewhat similar to having your very own “Layer-2 network” such as Polygon or Arbitrum. So instead of deploying your dApp on memecoin on Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche etc., you can spin up its very own infrastructure, while maintaining full compatibility with chains like Ethereum and NEAR to tap into their liquidity and ecosystems. Alex Shevchenko, the CEO of Aurora Labs, said the launch of the Aurora Cloud Console makes blockchain creation “completely accessible” to anyone who has a reason to do so. He’s pitching it as a “gateway to Web3”. “In just days, you can have a fully customizable chain powered by NEAR’s robust network,” he promised. “We’ve removed the complexity, so builders can focus on creating great products while tapping into a thriving ecosystem of liquidity, tools, and users.” The Aurora Cloud Console provides dozens of features that combine to remove all of the headaches that would arise from the nightmarish task of trying to create your own blockchain. For one thing it’s entirely free to use, and there’s a guided onboarding process that walks new users through each step, showing them how to set different parameters like permissions, the base token for the network, the gas fees, any integrations required and anything else that matters. You won’t need to type a single line of code. It also provides tools for blockchain creators to monitor transactions on their new networks in real-time, as well as the ability to keep track of things as they go about deploying their blockchain. One of the most notable crypto projects to create its very own network using Aurora’s tools is the TURBO memecoin . An early access user, it announced the official launch of its TurboChain platform last month, complete with its own decentralized swap service TurboSwap . Aurora Labs stressed that Aurora Cloud Console is the “cornerstone” of its mission to make Web3 and blockchain technology accessible to everyone through plug-and-play solutions. With its official launch, crypto projects of all sizes now have a simple and reliable way to create their own network, tailored for the needs of their products.

According to the company, the Aurora Cloud Console is a no-code platform that allows anyone to create and launch their own EVM-compatible blockchain without spending a dime or needing much technical knowledge. This service is particularly appealing to memecoins and dApps, providing them their own network instead of relying on the heavily trafficked Ethereum chain or other blockchains. One key advantage of having your own blockchain is exclusivity—transactions can occur rapidly because there are no other tokens or services to contend with. Aurora's blockchains are built on the robust infrastructure of the NEAR Protocol , inheriting its strong security and scalability to support even the busiest projects. Aurora Labs aims to make the process of launching a fully customizable blockchain as straightforward as creating an online store on platforms like Shopify.

When you establish a blockchain with the Aurora Cloud Console, you're essentially getting an Aurora Virtual Chain, akin to having your own ""Layer-2 network"" similar to Polygon or Arbitrum.

Alex Shevchenko, CEO of Aurora Labs, stated that the introduction of the Aurora Cloud Console makes blockchain creation ""completely accessible"" for anyone with a purpose to do so. He describes it as a ""gateway to Web3."" ""In just a few days, you can have a fully customizable chain powered by NEAR’s reliable network,"" he assured.

Here are five cryptos to keep on your radar: Doge Uprising , XRP, Cardano, Hedera, and Near Protocol. These projects are affordable yet pack massive potential. Doge Uprising: The Meme Coin with a Mission Doge Uprising, a newcomer to the crypto space, is shaking things up. Unlike traditional meme coins, it integrates staking rewards, NFT gaming, and a narrative-driven ecosystem inspired by a dystopian 2045 storyline. The Doge Uprising presale offers early investors access to tokens at the lowest prices, giving them a head start.

Beyond its presale, Doge Uprising’s roadmap is packed with features like the introduction of Doge Mecha NFTs, which are ultra-rare and hold both collectible and functional value in the project’s ecosystem. Additionally, the rebellion-themed gaming aspects create an interactive layer that could attract a global audience, further boosting the token’s demand. XRP: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments Ripple’s XRP has long been a contender in the crypto market. It specializes in fast, low-cost international transactions. With partnerships in banking and a focus on transforming the financial industry, XRP remains a strong bet for 2025. As regulatory clarity improves, XRP’s adoption rate could skyrocket, pushing its value beyond expectations. Moreover, XRP’s focus on interoperability with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) positions it as a critical player in the future of digital finance. This unique use case gives XRP an edge, even among well-established competitors. Cardano: Sustainability and Scalability Cardano stands out for its commitment to sustainability and a peer-reviewed approach to development. At under $5, it offers a robust blockchain ecosystem with applications spanning DeFi, NFTs, and more. Cardano’s focus on scalability makes it an excellent long-term investment, especially as the market matures. Cardano’s unique Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism makes it environmentally friendly, which resonates with eco-conscious investors. Additionally, its partnerships with educational and agricultural projects worldwide highlight its real-world utility. Hedera: Enterprise-Grade Blockchain Hedera Hashgraph is a unique blockchain platform designed for enterprise applications. It’s fast, secure, and energy-efficient, with real-world applications in supply chain management, advertising, and healthcare. Hedera’s native token, HBAR, is priced attractively for investors looking for an enterprise-grade solution with significant growth potential. Hedera’s governance model, which includes big names like Google and IBM, further enhances its credibility and positions it as a leading enterprise solution in the blockchain space. Near Protocol: The Developer’s Choice Near Protocol simplifies blockchain development with its user-friendly platform. Its focus on scalability and ease of use makes it a favorite among developers. Near’s emphasis on practical applications, such as gaming and decentralized finance, ensures its relevance in a rapidly evolving market. Priced under $5, it offers enormous upside. Near Protocol also stands out with its Nightshade technology, which boosts scalability by breaking blockchain data into smaller chunks called shards. This innovative approach enables Near to handle a higher transaction volume efficiently. Why Invest in These Cryptos? Investing in affordable cryptocurrencies with real-world utility is a smart strategy for maximizing gains. These projects combine innovation, strong communities, and practical applications, making them ideal picks for investors aiming for substantial returns. While the market is volatile, a well-researched portfolio featuring these five coins could pave the way for significant success in 2025.

The new offer applies to both hot and cold wallet storage without extra costs, the bank revealed in a press release shared with crypto.news. The bank also announced plans to add EURC, Circle ‘s euro-backed stablecoin, to the program soon. Clients holding USDC will receive quarterly rewards directly from the bank, the press release reads.

He suggested that regulatory clarity could pave the way for the U.S. to introduce bank-issued stablecoins by year-end. Still, the Dragonfly Capital managing partner anticipates no major disruptions for established issuers like Tether, which he believes will retain their dominance “especially with [Howard] Lutnick as Secretary of Commerce.” Read more: Circle partners with Bison Digital Assets for MiCA-compliant stablecoins",News|Banking|Circle|Stablecoin|USDC,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|SPONSORED|TRADING|USDC,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-16 09:25:17

Canary Capital had filed the S-1 registration form for the Litecoin ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in October 2024. However, Canary Capital has now filed a corrected S-1 form for the Litecoin ETF. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart said this is likely an indication that the company is in dialogue with the SEC. Seyffart noted that while a formal 19b-4 filing has not yet been made to start the approval timeline, a 19b-4 filing would be a real signal for possible approval. Apart from Seffart, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas also made an assessment of the Litecoin ETF. Stating that the latest development increases optimism for Litecoin's potential ETF approval, Eric Balchunas claimed that the Litecoin ETF could be the next cryptocurrency ETF to be approved in the US. “We had heard rumors that the Litecoin S-1 had received feedback from the SEC. This bodes well for our prediction that Litecoin has the highest probability of being the next cryptocurrency to be approved.” Finally, Balchunas said there remains a “big variable” for ETFs, which the analyst noted is the appointment of a new SEC chairman after Gary Gensler leaves next Monday. “As one of the longest-running blockchains with 100% uptime since inception, Litecoin has a proven track record of security and reliability with significant enterprise-level use cases,” Canary Capital said when it filed for the Litecoin ETF. Apart from Litecoin, Canary Capital has also applied for ETFs for XRP, Solana (SOL), and Hedera (HBAR). Related News: Second Application for XRP in the US!

The price of bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, has risen 11% from Monday's lows under $90,000. It has jumped nearly 3% in the past 24 hours, topping $100,000 at one point, CoinDesk data show. The move into the six figures that spurred risk-taking in the broader market followed a softer-than-expected core CPI report, which alleviated hawkish Fed fears that had driven prices lower. Instead, markets are focusing on Trump's swearing-in and a potential pro-crypto announcement on the first day of the office. ""The removal of inflation fears clears the way for bitcoin to break through the strong $100,000 resistance level before Trump’s inauguration,"" said Matt Mena, a crypto research strategist at 21Shares, in an email. ""Such a milestone would not only be psychologically significant but also technical, setting up bitcoin to surpass its $108,000 all-time high and establish new record levels as market optimism builds."" 21Shares is one of the world’s largest crypto-native issuers of exchange-traded products (ETPs). ""Trump’s well-documented support for pro-growth policies and his track record of favoring asset price appreciation further reinforces the bullish outlook for bitcoin and risk assets more broadly,"" Mena wrote. The bullish forecast is consistent with a rally in traditional assets, especially the Nasdaq 100, which surged over 2% Wednesday. BTC has recently strengthened its positive correlation with the tech-heavy index to a two-year high. Meanwhile, the rally in the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, has stalled, offering a lifeline to risk assets, and the S&P 500 has neared the key level of 6,000. According to Mena, a break above 6,000 ""could set the stage for the next leg of the global asset bull market."" Once a skeptic of digital assets, Trump courted the crypto community in months leading up to the November election, pledging to create a national strategic bitcoin stockpile. His victory helped propel BTC to over $108,000 from $70,000 to over $108,000. ""If Trump indicates on day one that he will be creating the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, even if he doesn’t sign it on day one, expect price discovery to be asymmetric,"" said Nathan Cox, the chief investment officer at Two Prime, in an email. ""Once through the previous highs of $108,000, there is no limit to how fast it could expand given the unparalleled demand a bitcoin reserve strategy could have globally."" Two Prime is an SEC-regulated registered investment adviser specializing in digital asset derivatives. Volatility likely Paul Howard, a senior director at crypto market-making firm Wincent, said expected announcements related to regulating the digital assets industry, banking rules and creation of the strategic bitcoin reserve are not fully priced in yet. ""We are positioned for a volatile week ahead with the change of administration in the U.S. expect to see some +/-10% moves across the majors such as BTC, SOL, ETH, and XRP. Pricing will reflect outcomes of announcements by the incoming President, so opportunities, likely not everything, are baked into the current price,"" Howard said.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Donald Trump,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-16 09:27:57

According to the regulator, District Court Judge Analisa Torres was “factually and legally” wrong when she concluded that offers and sales of XRP to the public via crypto trading platforms and the company’s offers of the token as employee compensation and in business deals did not constitute investment contracts. Details of the Appeal In the brief filed late on January 15, the SEC requested the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to overturn Judge Torres’ decision and order a summary judgment in its favor regarding Ripple’s offers and sales of XRP to retail investors and for those instances it was exchanged for non-cash considerations. This long-running case goes back to 2020 when the regulator sued Ripple, claiming the crypto company had raised at least $1.3 billion from the sale of XRP, which it deemed an unregistered security. Three years later, Judge Torres ruled on the matter, concluding that while institutional sales of the token violated U.S. securities laws, programmatic ones did not due to their blind-bid nature. While the financial watchdog filed an appeal against the verdict in October last year, this latest move marks a more formal step in the process. The agency is outlining its reasoning for challenging the decision made by the district court. Once again, it bolstered its argument using the Howey Test, claiming that XRP buyers would have expected to profit from Ripple’s promotion of the token, making it an investment contract. The SEC also argued that the anticipation of profit from the efforts of others is not determined by the identity of the person or entity offering an investment but by what they say and do. For that reason, those buying XRP from exchanges still expected to gain, contrary to Judge Torres’ determination. Ripple Executives React Shortly after the filing, Ripple’s chief attorney, Stuart Alderoty, took to social media to lambast the SEC’s move, calling it “a rehash of already failed arguments.” The lawyer also noted that Ripple will make a formal response of its own in due time. However, he expressed optimism that the incoming Trump administration will likely abandon the litigation. “For now, know this: the SEC’s lawsuit is just noise. A new era of pro-innovation regulation is coming, and Ripple is thriving,” he remarked. On his part, CEO Brad Garlinghouse described the filing as “insanity.” He called out the agency for doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting different results. The executive also accused Chair Gary Gensler, who is set to step down in a few days, for taking the matter personally.

Pump.fun, according to Burwick, allegedly frames “exit liquidity” as a game—making light of the very real financial losses inflicted on late entrants. Pump.fun is a decentralized platform on the Solana ( SOL ) blockchain that simplifies the process of creating and trading meme coins, aiming to make participation in the crypto market accessible to non-technical users. Burwick didn’t hold back in taking shots at the platform, saying they were the antithesis of blockchain innovation. He says platforms like Pump.fun don’t embody the fundamental principles of transparency, fairness, and empowerment that crypto was originally built on. Burwick reiterated that meme coins aren’t innovative in and of themselves but prey on addiction and youth. His comments come as Burwick Law picks up the gauntlet in a legal case involving Pump.fun, demanding accountability in company conduct within the crypto ecosystem.

As of Jan. 15, the platform’s total revenue surpassed $422 million, with nearly $25 million generated in the last seven days alone, according to Dune Analytics. Burwick Law contends that the meme coin launchpad offers little actual support for its users and instead facilitates rug pulls, where developers walk away with investor funds after raising capital. “As the system grows, early adopters cash out by dumping their holdings on later participants, effectively stealing from them,” Burwick remarked. In November 2024, the platform suffered major backlash due to its live streaming feature. A user threatened to harm himself to promote their meme coin during a live broadcast, causing panic in the entire crypto community. While Pump.fun did acknowledge the damage done and changed its moderation policies, there were no talks about losses that investors suffered. According to an analysis by Pump.fun wallet examiner Adam Tehc, only 0.4% of the 14 million wallets interacting with Pump.fun reported profits exceeding $10,000—highlighting the extent to which most users have suffered losses. Max Burwick is not the only one who has a strong stance against the platform.

TD Sequential May Suggest So",https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-bitcoin-short-lived-td-sequential-suggest-so/,"An analyst has revealed how XRP and Bitcoin are among the cryptocurrencies seeing a sell signal on the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential after the market recovery. XRP & Bitcoin Among Coins Seeing TD Sequential Sell Signal In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about the TD Sequential pattern that four top assets in the sector have formed recently. The “TD Sequential” refers to an indicator from technical analysis (TA) that’s used for locating probable points of reversal in any asset’s price. The indicator involves two phases: the setup and countdown. During the first of these, candles of the same color in the cryptocurrency’s chart are counted up to nine. These candles don’t have to be one after the other. Related Reading: Social Media Turns Bullish On Dogecoin, Solana As Market Rebounds Once the candles are in, the coin may be considered to have arrived at a spot of reversal. Naturally, this would suggest a shift to a downtrend if green candles completed the setup and that to the upside in case of red ones. As soon as the setup is done, the second phase, the countdown, begins. There isn’t anything different about how the countdown works, except for the fact that here thirteen candles are counted, not nine. This phase’s finish, too, can be assumed to coincide with a likely turnaround in the asset. Four cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), and Solana (SOL) have completed a TD Sequential phase of the former type on their 4-hour prices recently. Here are the charts shared by the analyst that shows the trend leading up to this signal: As is visible in the above graphs, all of these assets have just finished a TD Sequential setup with nine green candles. These candles have corresponded to the recovery that the coins have enjoyed during the last couple of days. Considering what such a TD Sequential setup implies, though, this uptrend may not be here to stay for the cryptocurrency market. So far, XRP, Bitcoin, and the others have continued to rise despite this signal, but it remains to be seen how long the trend would last. In some other news, whale activity on the XRP network has witnessed an increase recently, as Martinez has pointed out in another X post. The chart shows the data for the “Whale Transaction Count” metric from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment. This indicator keeps track of the total amount of transfers taking place on the XRP network that are carrying a value of more than $1 million. The metric has seen a jump during the last couple of days and has hit a value of 341. This implies the whales are making a high number of moves on the blockchain right now. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $2.95, up more than 15% over the last 24 hours.

Despite bullish momentum, the RSI crossing above 70 signals a potential correction. Analysts predict XRP could reach $4-$10, with the Ripple-SEC lawsuit and upcoming SEC leadership change being critical factors for future price movements. The Bearish Factor Ripple’s XRP has been crypto’s rockstar lately, with its price reaching multi-year peaks. Several hours ago, the valuation skyrocketed to $3.20, representing the highest level observed since the beginning of 2018. In the following hours, XRP lost some steam and is currently trading at around $3.05 (per CoinGecko’s data). XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite the bullish landscape and the overall expectations of a further pump, one indicator suggests an incoming correction. This is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures the speed and change of price movements. It varies from 0 to 100, helping traders identify potential price reversals. Readings above 70 typically signal that the asset is overbought and could be due for a pullback. On the contrary, anything below 30 might be considered a buying opportunity. The RSI has been hovering above 40 since the beginning of the week but most recently crossed the bearish zone of 70. XRP Price Predictions As mentioned above, multiple analysts expect XRP’s value to keep climbing after exceeding the $3 level. The popular X user CRYPTOWZRD believes the asset could hit $4 in the short term, while Ali Martinez was even more optimistic, setting a target of $10. One major factor that could affect XRP’s future price fluctuations is the development of the lawsuit between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The agency recently filed its first opening brief as part of its appeal against a court ruling concerning the XRP sold to retail investors on exchanges years ago. It also insisted (once again) that Ripple’s native token should be classified as a security. The SEC has been quite hostile toward the company (and many other crypto businesses) over the past few years. However, the upcoming shift in its leadership may end that approach. The current Chairman, Gary Gensler (considered a huge enemy of the digital asset industry), will resign on January 20 and be succeeded by the pro-crypto Paul Atkins. The XRP Army expects the new leader to push the case against Ripple to a favorable resolution soon. However, considering the complexity of the entire legal process, they should have somewhat realistic hopes.

Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? The TIA price has faced resistance around $5, resulting in minor selling pressure. However, buyers are strongly defending further decline. Will TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers’ interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. Recent news/opinions on TIA Celestia has unveiled Shwap, a Data Availability (DA) upgrade that enhances its DA network. The upgrade introduces a new storage system and messaging protocol, boosting data retrieval efficiency and reducing storage demands. Celestia price prediction January 2025 Celestia’s price triggered intense bullish pressure following Bitcoin’s surge toward the $100K mark. As a result, we expect the TIA price to record a minimum of $4 and a maximum of $7, with an average of $5.5. Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction January 2025 $4 $5.5 $7 Celestia price prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn’t felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward. This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $17.84, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.

In response, Hoskinson, who once had disagreements with the XRP community , tweeted, “Peter’s coming around to XRP Nation.” Peter's coming around to XRP Nation https://t.co/9A6zFYNFEq — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) January 12, 2025 Peter Brandt’s Message to the XRP Community Peter Brandt, known for his extensive experience in commodities trading, addressed the XRP community in a recent social media post , reflecting on his past criticisms of XRP and its supporters. Brandt acknowledged taking “some hard shots” at XRP and its community over the years. Brandt conceded that some of the backlash he received from the XRP community was warranted, while other responses were “outright uncivil” or even “funny and creative.” He elaborated on the reasoning behind his critiques, emphasizing that they stemmed from his perspective as a professional trader focused on preserving capital. Criticism Rooted in Trading Philosophy In his post, Brandt explained his long-standing reservations about XRP’s performance relative to Bitcoin, which he called the “store of wealth” standard. He highlighted XRP’s history of steep declines, noting repeated losses of 80%, 90%, and even 97% in value against Bitcoin. From Brandt’s perspective, holding onto a speculative asset that consistently underperforms compared to a more stable option, such as Bitcoin, is irrational. He described this approach as “the definition of insanity,” particularly when investors continue to hold the asset despite repeated poor performance, expecting a different outcome. Focus on the Community’s Attitude Brandt clarified that his criticisms were not aimed at XRP supporters as individuals but rather at their attitude during significant losses. He specifically called out what he described as a “dogmatic, obnoxious, often unintelligible defense” of XRP during its downturns. While Brandt acknowledged that his critiques might have appeared harsh, he reiterated that his focus was on what he saw as the imprudent financial behavior of defending substantial losses, rather than the community’s broader commitment to improving their financial circumstances.

He emphasized that he would never criticize their achievements, only how they defended losses in the past. In his words, “I would never disparage your success, only your attitude of defending 90% declines against an asset with more stability.” He also declared that this would be his final public commentary on XRP. Hoskinson’s Response Highlights a Shift Charles Hoskinson’s lighthearted response to Brandt’s post suggests that he views the trader’s remarks as a potential shift between XRP supporters and their critics. Although Hoskinson has had disagreements with the XRP community, he shared new perspectives last year on potential opportunities for collaboration between the Cardano and XRP ecosystems. This interaction between prominent figures in the crypto industry underscores the ongoing discussions around XRP, its performance, and the passionate community that supports it.

However, his latest forecast for the cryptocurrency is slightly more conservative than earlier predictions for 2025. Kiyosaki’s $250,000 Target As Bitcoin surged past the $100,500 milestone, Kiyosaki took to social media to express his optimism . “Bitcoin over $100,000,” he tweeted, followed by a new projection that the leading cryptocurrency would hit $250,000 this year. Furthermore, he confirmed that he continues buying more Bitcoin, signaling unwavering confidence in its potential. This prediction has garnered support from several commentators who believe Bitcoin’s price could skyrocket if the incoming U.S. administration follows through on its campaign promise to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Some experts have speculated that such a move could propel Bitcoin’s value beyond $350,000. In late 2024, Kiyosaki admired MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy, spearheaded by Michael Saylor. He echoed Saylor’s long-term view that Bitcoin could reach $12 million per coin over the next decade as it increasingly replaces gold in investment portfolios. A Change in Kiyosaki’s Bitcoin Strategy Interestingly, Kiyosaki’s current approach contrasts with his earlier stance. Just a few months ago, he stated that he would cease purchasing Bitcoin once its price surpassed $100,000, emphasizing the importance of avoiding greed. Yet, following Bitcoin’s recent rally, he has continued accumulating, demonstrating his enduring faith in its value as a long-term asset. In December 2024, Kiyosaki made several predictions about Bitcoin’s trajectory. While one estimate suggested the cryptocurrency could reach $175,000 in 2025, another more optimistic forecast pegged it at $350,000 by year-end. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Kiyosaki Criticizes BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Strategy Kiyosaki has also been vocal in his criticism of BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Following significant outflows from BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF in December 2024, Kiyosaki accused the firm of deliberately suppressing Bitcoin’s price to enable large investors, or “whales,” to accumulate more. Known for his passion for alternative investments, Kiyosaki has consistently championed Bitcoin, gold, and silver as safe-haven assets. His commitment to these assets reflects his belief in their ability to preserve wealth in an unpredictable financial landscape. Looking Ahead As Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory, Robert Kiyosaki’s revised prediction highlights his unwavering confidence in Bitcoin’s potential. With market dynamics shifting and institutional interest growing, Bitcoin’s journey toward Kiyosaki’s $250,000 target will be a focal point for investors and enthusiasts alike.

MARA’s unique approach includes issuing convertible bonds to raise capital for BTC accumulation, aiming to increase BTC yield and shareholder value. Despite its higher debt and risk profile, MARA’s compressed mNAV and operational similarities to MSTR suggest significant upside potential in a Bitcoin bull market. Market is undervaluing or heavily discounting MARA's mining operations. Simple comparison with RIOT demonstrates this. MARA Holdings ( MARA ) is positioning itself as a unique Bitcoin (BTC-USD) focused company, reminiscent of MicroStrategy (MSTR). While MSTR remains the world’s premier Bitcoin treasury company holding 450,000 BTC, MARA brings additional innovations to the table and boasts the second-largest Bitcoin treasury among publicly traded companies at 44,893 BTC. With the MARA share price at pretty low levels—especially compared to MSTR’s valuation and that of other pure-play Bitcoin miners—MARA could offer a “revenge trade” opportunity for investors who feel they missed out on MSTR’s historic rally. I believe MARA is trading in deep value territory at under $18 per share. MARA’s Parallels to MSTR I’ve written about how MSTR is like Bitcoin’s only investment bank . The company issues various kinds of securities (predominantly convertible bonds, but recently also entering preferred stock) to raise capital and funnel that capital into BTC. This structure redistributes BTC’s volatility and returns across different investor classes, effectively letting MSTR package BTC exposure as a variety of financial products. MARA appears to be following a similar model on a smaller scale. By issuing convertible bonds at low or zero interest rates, MARA raises capital efficiently and uses the proceeds to accumulate BTC. Convertible bond offerings benefit from the company’s relatively high implied volatility, making them attractive for those who wish to hedge or speculate via options. Once that debt is converted into shares—typically after the stock price surpasses the conversion price—MARA is left holding more BTC per assumed diluted share than before. This is called “BTC Yield,” a term pioneered by MSTR. Both MSTR and MARA demonstrate a willingness to accept dilution if it translates BTC Yield (i.e. is accretive to shareholders). MSTR’s massive gains over 2024 highlight how powerful this dynamic can be, and MARA appears poised to replicate it—seeing that it is the second-largest BTC treasury and the largest BTC miner. Importantly, MARA’s share price has not enjoyed the same parabolic move that characterized MSTR’s run, suggesting there may be considerable upside if this current Bitcoin bull market accelerates. Why MARA Could Be the Next MSTR “Revenge Trade” I strongly believe that investors who feel like they missed the boat on MSTR might bet on MARA as a bit of a “revenge trade.” MARA has not seen meaningful appreciation. Yet, it resembles MSTR in many extremely important and glaring ways. With 44,893 BTC, MARA’s BTC treasury is far larger than other companies. Only MSTR holds more. The third-place treasury, [[RIOT]], is at 17,722 BTC—much lower than MARA’s total. This wide gap suggests MARA is the logical runner-up if investors want another “pure-play” bet on Bitcoin treasury companies. But there's more to this because MARA offers a few things that MSTR does not. First, MARA is actually the largest Bitcoin miner by hashrate. MARA generates a large portion of revenue in BTC, part of which can be added to BTC Yield. Second, MARA has also been lending out its BTC. It lent 7377 BTC in 2024 . MSTR has neither of these. In short, MARA’s fundamentals and operational decisions strongly parallel MSTR’s playbook. It’s BTC treasury size makes it the clear #2— effectively the next in line for a Bitcoin treasury company pure play bet. And because MARA’s stock has yet to enjoy the sort of growth MSTR saw, it presents a potential opportunity for those who believe that the next MSTR might still have room to grow. I think MARA’s “mini-MSTR” status could help it attract a wave of new investors seeking such exposure. When we look at the numbers of mNAV (multiple of market cap to BTC NAV), we see that MARA has by far the lowest mNAV of all the top Bitcoin treasury companies with US tickers. MARA currently trades at 1.349X the value of its BTC. MSTR trades at 1.926X its BTC. Bitcoin Treasuries ( bitcointreasuries.net ) MARA also owns the world's largest publicly traded mining operation, and it also has products like 2PIC, which I have covered in my previous MARA articles . An adjustment to the same mNAV as some of the other miners (like HUT) would mean a 67% gain from current levels, at least. [[CLSK]]’s mNAV is over twice as high as MARA’s. Even adjusting to the mNAV of MSTR would mean a 40% gain from current levels. At the same time, MARA’s risk profile is higher. It has more debt compared to its equity value. Here is the debt as of their 10-Q from November . There are 2 series of notes. Convertibles (MARA) Then in November, they completed a $1 billion convertible bonds offering . And in December, they completed a $850 million convertible bonds offering . You can see the full lineup of all four notes here in the 19 December 2024 8-K . This table outlines the shares that the notes are convertible too, which is needed for the BTC Yield calculation. Convertibles (MARA) Altogether, MARA has about $2.48 billion of debt. Their market cap is under $6 billion, so they are levered about 2.4X. In contrast, MSTR’s BTC value (which is half of MSTR’s market cap) is about 5X more than MSTR’s outstanding debt (which is also all convertible bonds). So MARA is definitely in a much riskier position. This could justify a lower mNAV. But the main point is that all of these things have made MARA look a lot like a mini MSTR, which has not yet taken off. The compressed mNAV and the fact that it is the largest miner with the largest BTC holdings adds to this view. Also, it isn't wrong to say that because MARA is more leveraged, it should outperform in a true bull market rally of BTC due to a higher equity beta. That said, the price action of the stock and the leverage in the capital structure don't always translate to one another. But in this case, I think the odds are good since the asset being leveraged has a 24/7 market price and is 74% of the market cap. Risks MARA, like MSTR, is highly sensitive to Bitcoin’s price volatility. If BTC endures a prolonged downturn, the burden of repaying debt could force the company to sell its BTC or other assets or dilute. By contrast, a surging BTC price could magnify the company’s upside, particularly if it continues adding to its treasury. Because MARA is so highly leveraged, I think it is possible that it would outperform MSTR in a BTC rally, although this dynamic is quickly changing as MSTR is expected to unload much of the fixed income portion of their 21-21 plan in Q1. MARA has, in my view, another big risk in executing on multiple initiatives at once— large-scale mining across a few continents, 2PIC, Slipstream, Anduro, mining Kaspa, lending BTC, MARAFW, and selling heat from mining. Having all these ventures evidently has not made the market enthusiastic, or you’d expect the BTC treasury to not occupy 74% of the market value. Here’s a good example. The market currently values RIOT’s mining operations as more valuable than MARA’s. RIOT’s market cap minus its BTC NAV is $2.48 billion. MARA’s market cap minus its BTC NAV is $1.52 billion. This is shocking when you see that RIOT has 31.5 EH/s as of December 2024, but MARA has 53.2 EH/s as of December 2024. In other words, RIOT’s 40% smaller mining operation is worth 60% more, according to the market. Based on these numbers, long MARA, short RIOT could be a great pair trade. We must also remember that RIOT doesn't have the auxiliary things that MARA has like 2PIC and BTC lending. But another interpretation is that MARA’s mining operation—and adjacent ventures—appear to be undervalued or even penalized by the market, treating them more like liabilities than assets. I believe MARA should consider divesting parts of its mining operation—reducing expansion CAPEX and redirecting resources to cutting deals to divest machines and sites to other miners like CLSK and RIOT. MARA should take the proceeds from divestitures and purchase BTC, doubling down on becoming a mini MSTR. For now, I don't believe it is possible to conclusively know why the market is assigning such a valuation to MARA. The risk is that this harsh assessment could continue, and the stock can continue lagging BTC and other mining peers. Conclusion MARA mirrors MicroStrategy’s core model—leveraging convertible debt to accumulate BTC—yet reaches beyond that playbook by adding a list of other capabilities. It seems that the market is assigning higher risk to these capabilities, but they can also open the door for larger rewards. With a more moderate valuation and the 2nd largest BTC treasury among publicly traded firms, MARA may be a compelling option for investors seeking “the next MSTR”. This is why I recently opened a small position in OTM MARA calls, expiring in 2027. I think the stock is currently in deep value territory and a revision in sentiment can send it much, much higher.",BTC-USD|CLSK|MSTR|RIOT|MARA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-16 09:40:31

Especially as the president-elect seems dead set on fixing his friendship with Russia’s president Vlad Putin. Now Biden has rolled out a massive package targeting over 250 entities, aiming squarely at Russia’s already battered economy, its military-industrial backbone, and a sneaky sanctions evasion network involving China. The Treasury calls it “fresh restrictions.” Sanctions experts call it “Trump-proof.” Either way, it’s a parting gift from Biden designed to make reversing these penalties a bureaucratic nightmare for Trump—or anyone else, for that matter. The sanctions hit nearly 100 Russian entities that were already under previous restrictions. The Treasury says this new layer is about tightening the noose, creating risks for anyone bold—or foolish—enough to do business with these sanctioned players. Russian energy companies, financial institutions, and a few Chinese actors facilitating illegal payment channels are the primary targets. And for those wondering, yes, Congress now has to get involved before any of this can be undone. The Democrats are turning out to be some really bitter losers. Energy, banks, and the shadow network Russian banks, already paralyzed by sanctions, have just had the screws tightened even more. The Treasury’s list includes financial institutions deeply embedded in Moscow’s economy, making their operations even riskier for anyone still willing to work with them. Companies in Russia’s energy sector, a key part of its GDP, also got hit again, increasing their headaches in navigating international markets. China didn’t escape this crackdown. The U.S. focused on a cross-border payment scheme between Russian and Chinese actors that facilitated transactions for restricted goods. Regional clearinghouses in both countries were involved, making this a transnational headache. Several Russian banks played a starring role in the scheme, which the Treasury claims enabled trade in sensitive items. Then there’s Keremet Bank, based in Kyrgyzstan, a relatively small player accused of helping Russian officials dodge sanctions. The U.S. labeled it as a facilitator of illicit financial activity tied to a Russian-designated bank. The message? Even minor players won’t be overlooked in this sanctions regime. The Biden administration also turned its gaze to Ukraine, slapping sanctions on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Captured by Russian forces in 2022, it remains Europe’s largest nuclear facility. While the sanctions won’t disrupt the plant’s operations, they serve as a clear warning about Moscow’s occupation and control. Russian officials, unsurprisingly, shrugged off the move, claiming it wouldn’t affect the plant. Oil markets and Russia’s struggling economy The International Energy Agency (IEA) chimed in, saying the sanctions could eventually disrupt Russian oil supply chains, although the global market might not feel the pinch immediately. Russia’s oil exports, which prop up its economy, have already taken a hit since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and these new restrictions could tighten the screws further. Global benchmark Brent crude prices have responded. On Monday, oil was trading at $81 a barrel, up 8% since the start of 2025. The IEA, however, remains cautious, revising earlier predictions of catastrophic declines in Russian supply. In 2022, they estimated a loss of 3 million barrels per day, but reality fell short. This time, they’re playing it safe, waiting to see how Russia adapts. Meanwhile, Moscow’s economy is taking blow after blow. Inflation in Russia officially hit 9.5% in 2024, but many citizens claim the real figure feels closer to 20%. Prices for basic goods have skyrocketed. Food, in particular, has seen prices jump as much as 90%, leaving ordinary Russians scrambling to make ends meet. It’s not just inflation. The government is pouring money into military spending, leaving civilian sectors in the dust. Nearly 40% of Russia’s 2025 budget—an eye-watering 41.47 trillion rubles—is going straight to defense. At the same time, Moscow faces a $142 billion funding gap for its war efforts. How do they plan to cover it? Borrowing and, most likely, printing money, which could make the inflation problem even worse. Russia’s economy is on the brink Russia’s economy, already limping, is now on even shakier ground. Inflation hit 9.5% in 2024, with unofficial estimates pushing that number closer to 20%. Every day, Russians are feeling the squeeze. Grocery bills have ballooned, with some food prices skyrocketing by as much as 90%. Public frustration is boiling over as wages remain stagnant while costs spiral out of control. Meanwhile, the Kremlin is throwing money into its war machine. Military spending is set to account for 40% of the 2025 federal budget, which totals a record 41.47 trillion rubles—roughly $400 billion. That’s leaving little for civilians. Social programs are underfunded, and public sector wages can’t keep up with inflation. The Russian government also faces a staggering $142 billion funding gap for its Ukraine war effort this year. Analysts say Moscow will likely resort to borrowing or printing more money, which could trigger another wave of inflation. This vicious cycle is hitting businesses hard. High interest rates, now sitting at 21%, are forcing many companies into bankruptcy.

This surge seems to be driven by heavy whale accumulation and growing excitement about the potential approval of Litecoin ETF. Litecoin Price Surges Amid Optimism Over ETF Approval Hopes As per James Seyffart tweet on X, @CanaryFunds has just filed an amended S-1 for their Litecoin ETF, which could signal some engagement with the SEC on the filing. While there are no guarantees yet, this move suggests progress in the approval process. However, it’s important to note that the 19b-4 filing, which is crucial for final approval, has not been submitted yet. This development adds to growing anticipation around the potential approval of a Litecoin ETF. Canary Litecoin ETF Accordign to Santiment , Litecoin has decoupled from other altcoins, soring by 16.1% in market cap within the last 11 hours. Similar to the trend seen in early December, the main factor behind this surge appears to be whales and sharks holding 10K+ LTC. Since January 9th, they have accumulated 250K coins, fuelign the price increase. Santiment According to Javon Marks on X, Litecoin (LTC) is showing signs of significant strength and could be gearing up for a strong rally, with the first target near $354.36. This move could signal a potential upside of over 207%, and might just be the beginning. Litecoin Weekly Chart What Next For LTC? On the daily chart, After forming a low of $50 near august 2024, Litecoin price started its upward journey and 5th Dec it made a high of $147 and the price retracted almost 40% from high to $90 and form double bottom. After taking support near 0.382 Fibonacci level, LTC is hovering near the neckline of double bottom pattern as well as near 0.786 Fibonacci level. If the upside trend continues and breaches these levels, then the next target might be the $150 psychological barrier. LTC/USDT Daily Chart However, Litecoin is expected to keep rising as bulls eye the next major resistance at $150, driven by hopes of an ETF approval and whale buying activity. This target is roughly 27% higher than the current price. If the price falls below the crucial support level at $100, the bullish outlook will be invalidated.

Instead of slumping once again as it did at the start of the business week, BTC’s price headed north and tapped a weekly high before it was stopped. Briefly Exceeding $100K The aforementioned start of the current business week was violent for the primary cryptocurrency as it plummeted from $96,000 to under $90,000 in hours. In fact, its bottom came at $89,250 (on Bitstamp), which became its lowest price position since November. As the community started to question the bull run’s validity, BTC bounced off and soared to $97,000 by Tuesday. It calmed there for a bit in anticipation of the Wednesday announcement for the CPI numbers, but it shot up once they came out. Within mere minutes, the asset went from under $97,000 to $98,500 and kept climbing to just shy of $101,000. After charting this weekly high, though, it started to lose some momentum and now sits about two grand lower. Its market capitalization has climbed to $1.960 trillion on CG, but its dominance over the alts has taken a hit and is down to 54.3%. BTCUSD.

The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF is outdated and underperforming due to its reliance on futures contracts. New Bitcoin ETFs launched in 2024 offer superior returns and lower expenses, making them preferable for buy-and-hold investors. The launch of IBIT options in November 2024 removes BITO's last unique attraction, leading to a ""sell"" rating for BITO. Bitcoin is consolidating the post-election rally. This is a necessary step in building the next phase of the rally - without a rest, markets get too stretched and vulnerable to large drops. The good news is that the positive drivers that drove the 2024 gains are still present, and there is scope for further gains and good news in 2025 as Donald Trump assembles his crypto-friendly administration. There are various ways to gain exposure to bitcoin. Some are better than others, but there is one fund that sticks out for all the wrong reasons. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) is an outdated and underperforming way to gain bitcoin exposure. This article explains why it has outlived its usefulness. Why BITO? Once upon a time, the only way to own bitcoin was to buy it directly on a crypto exchange. This was a risky business as wallets were often hacked and exchanges went bankrupt. The high-profile collapse of FTX in 2022 was a particularly painful episode for all concerned. Bitcoin futures were introduced by CBOE and CME in December 2017. The launch of the CME contract just happened to be on the day of the top before an -85% decline. Futures made it possible to short Bitcoin for the first time. Even though futures made it easier to trade bitcoin, derivatives contracts are largely an arena of institutional investors, and retail traders with a standard brokerage account were still excluded. BITO changed that in 2021. As the fund page states : First U.S. bitcoin-linked ETF. Familiarity, liquidity and transparency of an ETF. Available through a brokerage account-no need for a cryptocurrency exchange account or wallet. The attraction was clear, and with no alternatives (apart from the OTC-traded Grayscale Trust) until early 2024, the downsides associated with the fund's structure and methodology could be overlooked. The Downsides Due to regulatory limitations which were only overcome in 2024, BITO could not hold bitcoin directly. It therefore bought futures contracts, but this introduced a variety of problems. As the fund page states: There is no guarantee the fund will closely track bitcoin returns. Or to put it another way, BITO is almost certain to underperform Bitcoin. Data by YCharts There are several reasons for this. BITO buys front-month futures contracts and continually rolls them to the next month. As the fact sheet highlights , this can have a negative impact. This ETF is actively managed. The costs associated with rolling (buying and selling) futures and the impact of margin requirements, collateral requirements and other limits may have a negative impact on performance and prevent the Fund from achieving its objective. 2. To make matters worse, bitcoin is almost always in contango. This is more pronounced with further-out contracts, but even rolling to the next month can be detrimental. As the prospectus explains: In order to maintain its exposure to bitcoin futures contracts, the Fund must sell its futures contracts as they near expiration and replace them with new futures contracts with a later expiration date. This is often referred to as ""rolling"" a futures contract. Futures contracts with a longer term to expiration may be priced higher than futures contracts with a shorter term to expiration, a relationship called ""contango."" When rolling futures contracts that are in contango, the Fund will sell the expiring contract at a relatively lower price and buy a longer-dated contract at a relatively higher price. BITO also enters swap agreements. As the prospectus explains, this may be due to liquidity constraints. After all, maintaining a plus $2B position in futures may be challenging. In certain circumstances, for example, if the Fund is unable to obtain the desired exposure to bitcoin futures contracts, the Fund may enter into swap agreements that provide exposure to bitcoin or bitcoin futures. Here's how the holdings look - ProShares The short-term US Treasury Bills are a cash-substitute and serve as collateral on the futures and swap positions. The Bills yield the going rate, currently around 4.5%, which is useful, but only serves to narrow the underperformance. 3. The fund is actively managed, and the expense ratio is high at 0.95%. Other Bitcoin ETFs such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF have expense ratios as low as 0.12%. 4. BITO's ""distributions"" are seen as an attraction by some investors. Certainly, the current 61.7% yield is impressive, but it is simply a distribution of income to lower taxes for the fund. As ProShares explains: All 1940 Act registered mutual funds and ETFs are required to distribute nearly all of their taxable income by the end of each calendar year to avoid excise taxes. This effectively shifts the tax burden onto BITO holders: ""Generally, the Fund's dividend distributions will be taxed as ordinary dividends, not qualified dividend income. "" The distributions are monthly due to the contract rolls and are then adjusted towards the end of the year. All the profits are distributed, and when there is no profit, like in 2022 and some months in 2023, there is no distribution. Seeking Alpha This is a different methodology to the popular income-based ETFs launched in recent years. For example, the Simplify Bitcoin Strategy PLUS Income ETF ( MAXI ) provides exposure to bitcoin while simultaneously generating income by selling short-dated put and/or call spreads. Don't mix BITO's strategy with this option overlay strategy; it has no positive effect. The Alternatives The Bitcoin ETFs launched in early 2024 are far superior products to BITO, especially if your tactic is to buy and hold. Their popularity has led to a decline in BITO's AUM. Data by YCharts The total return in the new ETFs is considerably higher and the expense ratios considerably lower as the funds don't have to get involved with futures contracts and swaps. Seeking Alpha As they buy considerable amounts of bitcoin and keep it in custody, there is a risk of hacking, but these funds have gone to great lengths to secure their holdings. Nothing is 100%, but I have no concerns. The Option Angle The volatility of bitcoin means options are attractive and suitable for various strategies. Perhaps one of the last advantages for BITO was that it was the only fund with options available. However, that has recently changed. IBIT options started trading in November and their launch caused a lot of excitement with $1.9B in volume on their first day. Saxo enthused: The debut of options trading on Bitcoin ETFs, starting with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), isn't just another headline for crypto enthusiasts-it's a game-changer for investors everywhere. IBIT options already have open interest of around $11 billion, or 2.3m contracts. Meanwhile, the open interest of BITO options has fallen slightly to 1.1m contracts and is below the 52-week average of 1.2m. This may be the start of a switch to IBIT options and the final nail in the coffin for BITO. Conclusions BITO had an important role to play as the first bitcoin ETF. To take this position, it had to employ a complex strategy trading futures contracts, which negatively affected its total return and introduced other problems. It made sense when there was no alternative, but the introduction of new ETFs in 2024 provided much better options for buy-and-hold investors. The last attraction for BITO was that it was the only ETF to have options available. That changed in November with the launch of IBIT options, and BITO has no longer any unique attraction. I may be bullish on bitcoin, but I rate BITO a ""sell.""

SEC Uses Its Last Trump Card for XRP!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/new-development-in-ripple-sec-case-sec-uses-its-last-trump-card-for-xrp/,"There has been a new development in the Ripple-SEC case, with the SEC filing an appeal against the district court’s decision regarding Ripple’s XRP sales. The SEC argued that all transactions involving XRP purchased by retail investors through cryptocurrency platforms were securities under the Howey Test. On this point, the SEC argued that the district court's decision was erroneous, disagreeing with its previous decision that XRP sales to retail investors under the Howey test did not violate securities laws, and appealed to the court of appeals to overturn that decision. The SEC also accused Ripple of increasing demand for and the price of XRP through public statements. The SEC argued that Ripple’s promotional activities created the perception that investors, including retail buyers, were likely to profit from XRP. The SEC also stated that the first instance court made the wrong decision regarding retail XRP sales and included the following statements in its petition: “The court ruled that sales to institutional investors were securities, but erroneously determined that sales to retail investors were not securities. Because retail investors purchased XRP through crypto asset trading platforms, they had no idea whether the seller was Ripple, a Ripple affiliate, or someone else.” Ripple chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty called the SEC's lawsuit “just noise” and said, “As expected, the SEC's objection reiterates arguments that have already failed and will likely be rejected by the next administration. We will respond formally in due time.” What Happened? In 2020, the SEC accused Ripple of selling XRP, which it claimed was an unregistered security, and raising $1.3 billion through those sales. In the long-running case, in 2023, U.S. District Court Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York ruled that Ripple’s so-called retail sales of XRP did not violate securities laws. However, she ruled that other direct sales of tokens to institutional investors were securities. Judge Torres also ordered Ripple to pay a $125 million fine. *This is not investment advice.

Just days before his departure, President Joe Biden’s administration announced a slew of trade restrictions. On Wednesday, the US Department of Commerce included the startup in its entity list, barring US suppliers from selling to the company without a license as part of a last-minute initiative by the outgoing administration. The measure coincided with new regulations designed to prevent advanced chips, including AI accelerators, from reaching China. Tencent Holdings Ltd. backed startup is considered one of China’s “AI Tigers” Zhipu is among a small group of promising AI developers in China that have attracted funding at high valuations. The firm originated from research at Tsinghua University and is backed by Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Zhipu focuses on large language models similar to those from OpenAI. The firm is one of China’s four “AI Tigers”, representing its best hope of narrowing its technological gap with the US. The unicorn, valued at 20 billion yuan (US$2.7 billion) last September, counts Alibaba Group Holding, Tencent Holdings, and HongShan Capital Group as investors. The Chinese start-up said it “strongly disagrees” with a US decision to add the company and its subsidiaries to an export blacklist. Zhipu responded by stating that the US decision “lacked factual basis.” According to a WeChat post on Wednesday, Zhipu said: Being included in the Entity List will not have a substantial impact on the company’s business. – Zhipu Existing export restrictions on advanced AI chips from US companies like Nvidia Corp. to China have already limited Zhipu’s access to cutting-edge AI development hardware. The company, which raised around $410 million in its latest funding round in December, claims to have tens of millions of users in China. US export restrictions target Zhipu and other Chinese tech firms Zhipu is among many Chinese firms recently targeted by US government blacklists. A week prior, Tencent was added to a Defense Department list of companies linked to the Chinese military, alongside Tesla Inc. battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. Also included in the updated list is Sophgo, a Chinese chip designer that came under scrutiny last year after a chip it ordered from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) was found to be identical to one used in a Huawei Technologies processor. Huawei has been on the Entity List since 2019. Several industry advocacy groups and companies have expressed their opposition to the restrictions. The US-based Semiconductor Industry Association stated that policies to curb China’s AI development might backfire and “undercut US leadership and competitiveness” in the chip and AI sectors.

Amidst a broader market anticipation for an altcoin surge, as echoed by @CryptooELITES who predict altcoins could skyrocket 50X soon, here’s a closer look at the cryptos JAVONMARKS has his eye on: 5 Crypto Coins to Watch for 200% Gains in 2025 XRP, Minotaurus (XRP), Immutable (IMX), Onyxcoin (XCN), and Litecoin (LTC) are altcoins to watch for potential 200% in 2025. 1. XRP (Ripple) JAVONMARKS has been vocal about XRP’s potential, noting its multiple attempts at a bullish breakout since late July 2024. With signals suggesting a sustained breakout above the $2-3 range, he predicts that XRP price could “rip higher” at any moment. This optimism is supported by XRP’s historical performance where, after reaching new all-time highs (ATH), significant further gains have followed. Source: @JavonTM1 The recent touch of $3 on January 15, 2025, the highest since 2018, aligns with this bullish forecast. Analysts are now eyeing $6 as a key level, spurred by regulatory optimism under the Trump administration and increasing demand. 2. Minotaurus (MTAUR) The Minotaurus (MTAUR) presale has captured significant attention, particularly among gamers and crypto enthusiasts, by raising over 247,000 USDT. Priced at 0.00006001 USDT during the presale, MTAUR offers an attractive entry point when compared to its projected listing price of 0.00020 USDT. Early buyers who bought the gaming token at 0.000040 USDT have seen their investment double, underscoring the token’s promising future. Minotaurus stands out with its gaming-centric approach, providing players with customizable avatars, in-game upgrades, and exclusive premium content access. As the casual gaming market grows, this early-stage cryptocurrency is strategically positioned to leverage this trend. Security is a priority, with audits from SolidProof and Coinsult ensuring platform integrity. Moreover, a 100,000 USDT giveaway, referral programs, and vesting schemes are fostering a vibrant community. The presale is easily accessible through Minotaurus’s official site, making it an opportune moment to participate before the price increases. 2. Immutable (IMX) Immutable (IMX) is also among altcoins to watch, having caught JAVONMARKS’s attention due to its post-breakout performance. He predicts IMX could surpass the $4.91 resistance level, potentially leading to a 255% increase, with further room for growth up to $9.4049, adding another 90% upside. This analysis follows Immutable’s price 378% climb towards the $4.91 target earlier in 2024, suggesting a robust foundation for continued growth in 2025. Immutable’s role as a layer-two scaling solution for NFTs on Ethereum, providing zero gas fees and enhanced scalability, underpins this bullish outlook. 3. Onyxcoin (XCN) JAVONMARKS recently noted that Onyxcoin (XCN) prices are moving significantly towards a targeted level of $0.00441, with a confirmed bull pattern suggesting another potential +27% upside to reach this target. This observation adds to the optimism around XCN, which has already shown a 20.88% increase in price within the last day, with trading volume jumping by 271.89% to $18.07M. Onyxcoin’s emphasis on node operation incentives and its ecosystem development might contribute to its potential for high returns, as one of the best cryptos to buy. 4. Litecoin (LTC) As another crypto coin to watch, JAVONMARKS sees Litecoin climbing back with signs of major strength, targeting $354.36, which would represent an over 207% upside. This prediction aligns with recent market activity where Litecoin has gained 18% in a day, reaching $120 levels amidst strong whale accumulation and optimism surrounding a potential Litecoin ETF approval . The surge in trading volume by 301% further supports the bullish case for LTC. Final Thoughts: Crypto Coins to Watch for Massive Gains The broader crypto market sentiment adds fuel to the bullish outlook for these coins. Influencers like @CryptoELITES have hinted at an altcoin surge, potentially delivering 50X gains. Javon Marks’ predictions align with this enthusiasm, offering a roadmap for investors eager to capitalize on the next big trends. Will 2025 be the year of unprecedented crypto gains? These five coins—XRP, MTAUR, IMX, XCN, and LTC—are certainly positioned to lead the charge. However, as always, investors should conduct their own research and consider market risks before diving in.

Een mogelijke reden achter deze stijging is dat Donald Trump volgende week de president van de VS wordt. Op 20 januari neemt Trump opnieuw plaats in het Witte Huis. Zijn plannen voor crypto kunnen goed uitpakken voor Ripple. In dit artikel kijken we naar wat we kunnen verwachten nadat Trump aan de macht komt in de VS. Niet alleen is dit positief voor de hele crypto markt, maar ook specifiek voor Ripple. Gaat de altcoin in januari nog stijgen naar een all-time high boven $3,84? Wat de inauguratie van Trump betekent voor Ripple Sinds Trump’s overwinning in november is crypto hard gestegen en de volgende grote rally staat mogelijk voor de deur. Volgende week maandag komt Trump aan de macht en zien we mogelijk vanaf dag 1 al positieve veranderingen. Wat voor veranderingen zijn dit? Denk bijvoorbeeld aan duidelijke crypto regulatie, die innovatie niet tegenhoudt, nieuwe wetten die crypto aantrekkelijker kunnen maken en de mogelijkheid voor een Bitcoin reserve. JUST IN: 🇺🇸 Donald Trump is expected to issue executive orders on the first day of his presidency regarding #Bitcoin and crypto — The Washington Post pic.twitter.com/6E8Y5ICB9d — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) January 13, 2025 Maar een groot voordeel voor Ripple is het feit dat Gary Gensler vanaf dag 1 (dus 20 januari) wordt vervangen door Paul Atkins. Onder leiding van Trump en Atkins kan het beleid van de SEC worden omgegooid en kan er een einde komen aan de jarenlange Ripple vs SEC rechtszaak. Uiteraard zal de SEC nog steeds als doel hebben om investeerders te beschermen, maar dit keer zonder crypto bedrijven en exchanges onnodig veel lastig te vallen. Dit kan innovatie binnen de sector waarborgen en helpt de VS om een “Crypto Capital” te worden. Kortom: verwachtingen zijn hoog dat crypto gaat stijgen, waardoor XRP een boost kan krijgen. Ook kan XRP direct profiteren door het einde van de rechtszaak en grotere kansen op de goedkeuring van een XRP ETF. XRP koers verwachting – Hoeveel kan Ripple waard worden? De Ripple koers ligt aan het eind van de ochtend vlak onder $3,10 en lijkt zijn dalingen van vannacht weer ongedaan te maken. De altcoin is rond middennacht naar een piek van $3,20 en kreeg daar te maken met verkoopdruk, waardoor hij tijdelijk onder $3 is gezakt. In het afgelopen uur is Ripple echter weer met 1,4% gestegen. XRP krijgt extra ondersteuning van zijn 30-daagse moving average (geel) op $2,36, terwijl zijn 200-daagse moving average (blauw) op $1,05 nog veel heeft in te halen. Ripple heeft wellicht een nieuwe support neergezet op $3, maar kan de komende dagen volatiel blijven na zijn stijging van 34% in de afgelopen 7 dagen. De Relative Strength index (RSI) is boven 70 gestegen, wat het risico voor een correctie vergroot. Maar zoals te zien in de stijging van eind november tot begin december, lag de RSI zo hoog als 95. Wat volgde was slechts een redelijke correctie vanuit $2,90 naar $2,25. Maar blijf in ieder geval op de hoede voor toenemende verkoopdruk. Als Ripple zijn huidige bullish momentum in stand weet te houden, kan het een kwestie van dagen of weken zijn voordat hij zijn all-time high van $3,84 breekt. Als Trump daadwerkelijk positieve veranderingen brengt aan het Amerikaanse systeem, kan Ripple de komende maanden boven $5 vliegen en later dit jaar zelfs hoger dan $10 gaan. Ripple gemist? Deze altcoins worden mogelijk de volgende grootste crypto stijgers Dit is de tweede keer sinds november 2023 dat XRP een gigantische stijging meemaakte. Toch is al te zien hoe de koers minder hard is gestegen, omdat er steeds meer kapitaal voor nodig is. Uiteraard kan XRP nog verder stijgen vanuit hier, maar op hetzelfde moment zijn er altcoins die meer kunnen doen. Hieronder kijken we naar 3 altcoins die indirect kunnen profiteren wanneer Ripple verder stijgt. Of het nu komt door speculatie of hun aantrekkelijke use cases, verwachtingen zijn hoog dat de prijs van deze altcoins gaat stijgen. Tijdens de presale kun je ze nog voor een vaste lage prijs kopen. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is een van de meest populaire presale crypto’s van het moment en heeft ruim $49 miljoen opgehaald sinds zijn lancering in december. $WEPE is een meme coin die mee kan liften op het succes van Pepe (PEPE), maar ook profiteert van een lage market cap en aantrekkelijke utility voor token holders. $WEPE holders krijgen toegang tot een exclusieve community van traders. Binnen deze community worden elite inzichten gedeeld waarmee traders hun winst deze bull run kunnen maximaliseren. Afhankelijk van hoe goed deze trading inzichten zijn, kan $WEPE een grote boost in waarde krijgen. With great memes comes great responsibility. 🐸 ⚔️ pic.twitter.com/CmaoJ8z2tI — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) January 15, 2025 Het is vandaag nog niet te laat om $WEPE voor een lage prijs te kopen. Zo heb je de tokens nog voor $0,00036648 per stuk. Nu het project bijna $50 miljoen heeft opgehaald, groeien verwachtingen dat de prijs van $WEPE gaat exploderen na zijn eerste lancering op exchanges. Nu naar Wall Street Pepe Solaxy ($SOLX) Na de grote stijging van Ripple, is het wellicht interessant om te kijken naar nieuwe utility tokens. De nieuwe Solaxy ($SOLX) is de native token van een opkomende blockchain. $SOLX heeft met zijn presale ruim $10,5 miljoen opgehaald en biedt toegang tot de allereerste Solana Layer-2 blockchain ter wereld. Solana is behoorlijk gegroeid in de afgelopen jaren en is daarnaast een hotspot geworden voor meme coins. Net als bij Solana, profiteer je bij Solaxy van lage transactiekosten en hoge snelheden, maar dan wel zonder de kans op storingen. Ook is het een mogelijkheid om in gloednieuwe projecten te investeren. Je kunt $SOLX kopen voor $0,001602 per token. Hiermee verkrijg je een vroege positie en help je het project met een succesvolle lancering. Omdat het project al $10 miljoen heeft opgehaald, is er duidelijk vraag naar de nieuwe Solana Layer-2. Dit betekent dat $SOLX na lancering nog verder kan stijgen. Nu naar Solaxy Best Wallet Token ($BEST) De Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is de native token van Best Wallet. Dit is een relatief nieuwe crypto wallet die gebruiksvriendelijkheid combineert met innovatieve ideeën. De presale van zijn native token heeft ruim $7 miljoen opgehaald en eindigt binnenkort. Maar wat zijn de voordelen van best Wallet, in combinatie met zijn native token? Door $BEST vast te houden, profiteer je van extra voordelen als gebruiker van Best Wallet. Je krijg bijvoorbeeld korting op handelingen zoals token swaps. Ook krijg je vroegtijdige toegang tot nieuwe presales en launches, hogere staking beloningen en voordelen bij partners van Best Wallet. Deze features kunnen de vraagprijs van $BEST omhoog drijven The Fastest Growing Wallet in Crypto! In a crowded market, Best Wallet delivers the tools you need to gain an edge. 🚀 1️⃣ Exclusive alpha on new projects. 2️⃣ Buy and claim tokens in the app. 3️⃣ Manage all your assets across multiple chains in one place.

In their first year, spot bitcoin ETPs have drawn unprecedented demand, accumulating over $105 billion in AUM across various issuers. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF became the fastest ETP to reach several milestones, including $50 billion AUM. Bitcoin ETPs have paved the way for more innovation in getting exposure to digital assets, including the launch of Ether ETPs, such as the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF and options on IBIT, giving investors more tools to participate in digital assets. By Samara Cohen & Jay Jacobs Introduction: One Year Of Digital Asset ETPs When spot bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) first launched in the U.S. on Jan. 11, 2024, it represented the creation of a proverbial bridge from traditional finance into bitcoin. Prior to the launch of bitcoin ETPs, U.S. investors primarily accessed digital assets through crypto exchanges, which often came with operational, tax and custody complexities. Based on the unprecedented demand for bitcoin ETPs, it seems a wide variety of investors — from individuals to institutions — had been interested in crypto but wanted a familiar and efficient vehicle in which to get exposure. Wrapping digital assets like bitcoin — the world’s largest digital asset by market cap 3 — in regulated financial instruments such as ETPs helped investors get exposure to these assets through trusted providers like iShares on familiar platforms like Fidelity. (Learn more about how to buy ETPs .) This bridge to bitcoin has proven to be a two-way street. While traditional investors have moved into digital assets via bitcoin ETPs, some investors previously focused only on digital assets are opening traditional brokerage accounts and using ETPs, possibly for the first time. This is creating an on-ramp for them to diversify portfolios across other asset classes, a cornerstone of long-term investing success . Timeline January 11, 2024 - Launch of spot bitcoin ETPs, including iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). March 1, 2024 - IBIT becomes fastest ETP to reach $10 billion AUM. April 20, 2024 - Bitcoin halving cuts rate at which new bitcoin is issued in half to 3.125 per block. July 23, 2024 - Launch of Ether ETPs, including iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA). November 19, 2024 - IBIT options begin trading, the first for spot bitcoin ETPs. December 4, 2024 - IBIT reaches $50 billion in AUM. 2 Source: BlackRock, December 31, 2024. Getting Exposure To Digital Assets With ETPs Creating more access points and expanding the investible universe are hallmarks of exchange-traded products, which have a long history of innovation. Since the first ETPs debuted in the early 1990s, this financial vehicle has empowered investors of all types to easily and conveniently access broad market exposures, as well as more-targeted investments in previously hard-to-reach markets. For many investors, bitcoin had been one such market prior to the launch of bitcoin ETPs. Being able to gain bitcoin exposure via the ETP wrapper has proven to be a compelling combination for investors. In their first year, bitcoin ETPs have drawn unprecedented demand, posting $57 billion in net in-flows through December, and over $102 billion in assets under management across various issuers. 1 The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) became the fastest ETP to reach $10 billion in AUM, 50 days after launch, and to reach $50 billion, in December 2024. 4 Figure 1: Number of months for ETPs to reach $50 billion in AUM ((USD)) IBIT is the fastest ETP ever to reach $50 billion in AUM Chart description: Line graph showing the AUM accumulation of ETPs across a variety of issuers. (Source: BlackRock Global Business Intelligence, as of Dec. 31, 2024. To better understand the similarities and differences between investments, including investment objectives, risks, fees and expenses, it is important to read the products' prospectuses.) Conclusion Bitcoin ETPs have paved the way for more innovation in accessing digital assets, including the launch of Ether ETPs such as the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHA ) and options on IBIT, giving investors more tools to participate in digital assets . Despite these early milestones, these are still early days for digital assets. Spot bitcoin ETPs are just one way investors can get exposure to bitcoin. They currently represent a small portion of the overall bitcoin market, just 6% of the total supply of bitcoin outstanding. 5 The iShares Ethereum Trust ETF and iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF are not investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and therefore are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds or ETFs registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Trusts are not commodity pools for purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risk factors and other information included in the prospectuses.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/another-us-state-prepares-bill-for-bitcoin-investment-here-are-the-details/,"Oklahoma Representative Cody Maynard has introduced the “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act” (House Bill 1203), a proposed bill that would allow the state to invest in cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, through savings accounts and retirement funds. Oklahoma Lawmaker Proposes Bitcoin Investment Bill for State Funds The move positions Oklahoma among a growing number of U.S. states exploring digital asset reserves. Basic Provisions of the Bill Crypto Investment Scope: The bill authorizes the State Treasurer to invest in bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies and stablecoins with a market value exceeding $500 billion. Investment Limits: Public funds allocated to cryptocurrency investments should not exceed 10% of the total size of the state's public funds. Staking of Assets: The bill allows the treasurer to stake crypto assets through third-party services, provided that the legal ownership of the assets remains with the state. Bitcoin, currently with a market cap of around $2 trillion, meets this threshold, while other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (market cap: $406.5 billion) sit just below it. The proposal aligns with President-elect Donald Trump’s strategic vision of creating a national cryptocurrency reserve to solidify U.S. leadership in the global crypto industry. “Bitcoin represents freedom from bureaucrats who suppress our purchasing power,” Maynard said. “As a decentralized form of money, Bitcoin cannot be manipulated or created by government agencies. It is the ultimate store of value for those who believe in financial freedom and sound monetary principles.” Maynard stressed that these investments will be carefully managed to provide stable returns, preserve citizens' purchasing power and protect against inflation. *This is not investment advice.

Early signs of the administration’s crypto-friendly stance include the appointment of David Sacks as artificial intelligence and crypto chief and the nomination of Paul Atkins, a longtime advocate of financial innovation, as SEC Chairman nominee. Insiders say these moves, along with the promised executive orders, could usher in a new era for the industry. One of the most anticipated changes is the reversal of debanking policies that made it harder for banks to work with crypto companies. Under the Biden administration, regulators like the FDIC have discouraged financial institutions from serving cryptocurrency clients, citing reputational risks. The effort, dubbed “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” by crypto investor Nic Carter, has stunted the growth of the sector and alienated startups. Related News: Another US State Prepares Bill for Bitcoin Investment! Here Are the Details While the crypto community has largely supported Trump’s executive orders, one proposal has stood out: the creation of a U.S.-first strategic reserve that would include U.S.-issued digital currencies like Solana (SOL), USD Coin (USDC), and Ripple (XRP), according to the New York Post . Trump has reportedly met with the founders of those coins and is open to the idea, but some experts worry that it could overshadow Bitcoin, which remains the asset of choice for many in the industry. “Giving priority to US-origin coins could undermine Bitcoin’s position as the global reserve digital currency,” one source warned. *This is not investment advice.

In the meantime, the AI personality is consistently making suggestions for tickers. The AI agent posts both new tickers and news on more established projects.

The trader decided to pick the new tickers AIXBT mentioned and invest a small sum in each one. The trader bought all AIXBT suggestions that were even slightly bullish, allocating $100 to each. After the initial buy, the token was divested in a dollar-cost averaging strategy, with orders set at 12, 24, and 36 hours. AIXBT promotes over 100 tokens a week The AI personality of AIXBT is highly active – posting hourly insights or token picks. The trader discovered 117 actionable posts on specific tokens. The selections were only a tiny portion of the tens of thousands of predominantly Solana-based tokens launched each week. AIXBT’s selections also gave insights into the most active narratives. The AI coins and AI agent tokens produced 54% gains for the trader, meme tokens gained 49%, while DeFi picks posted 21.5% gains over the short-term test period. Certain i ndividual token picks achieved gains of between 143% to 209% for some of the outliers. However, the experiment ended before some of the tokens posted their biggest gains. Older social media narratives, including ANON, ALPHA, and GRIFT, posted bigger gains within a slightly longer time frame. AIXBT picked those tokens because they typically return for a new rollover of funds. The trading experiment also happened during a relatively bearish week, but AIXBT’s selections still outperformed the general market. The deepest individual loss for one of the tokens capped at just 37.5%, a relatively minor drawdown for memecoins. The total returns from 117 tokens returned an average of 24.18% on the whole portfolio. The returns are lower compared to more strategic whales, but overall, it was enough to retain the portfolio’s value. AIXBT continues to trade near peak AIXBT itself turned into one of the hottest AI agent tokens. The asset gained to levels above $0.90 after days of waiting for a breakout. AIXBT rallied after a series of whale buying and has not yet seen a drawdown despite some profit-taking.

The AI coin and agent narrative is still the hottest, followed by the new category of DeFAI. The narrative is both the leader in terms of social media mindshare and price performance. The sector is still going through a rollover from meme tokens, as liquidity and creators shift to agent tokens. The easily available tools for token creation made agents compete in a similar way to memes.

Many made fortunes from this meme coin, which initially seemed a joke. However, a new contender, Rexas Finance (RXS), has a great chance of replicating SHIB’s growth. With its presale price of just $0.175, Rexas Finance is emerging as a promising contender that could redefine the crypto space. Through its ecosystem focused on real-world asset tokenization, a well-planned tokenomics structure, and a Certik-audited security profile, Rexas Finance offers more than just another speculative asset—it brings real utility to the table. As the presale grows, Rexas Finance is drawing attention and gaining momentum, which suggests it may outperform other popular projects soon. A Robust Ecosystem That Promises Long-Term Value Rexas Finance was founded with an innovative ecosystem that offers more than the standard tokenomics of virtually every project available today. The essence of this ecosystem is the tokenization of real-world assets, which significantly broadens the investment opportunities for a substantially larger number of participants. While most cryptocurrency platforms are generally macro in that they are limited to only digital tokens or speculative assets, this is not quite the case for Rexas Finance; it also allows for tangible asset tokenization in addition to just art, real estate, and even metals. This change makes it possible for people to have access to markets that were untouchable because of their steep entry barriers, allowing for fractional ownership and wide portfolios. Rexas Finance has turned out to be more than just a cryptocurrency; it introduced features like Rexas Token Builder and Rexas Estate, and it has developed into a full-fledged ecosystem where investors can access various asset classes through blockchain. This feature repositions the project quite a bit, giving it a face that is more than an obscure digital token and, in fact, a means of transforming interface with real-world assets. Tokenomics That Drive Growth and Sustainability Among Rexas Finance’s main competitive advantages is its tokenomics model. With a total supply of one billion RXS tokens, the distribution strategy is designed to encourage immediate growth and long-term stability. The presale has already been an overwhelming success, with 94.06% of the tokens sold and over $36.58 million raised as of Stage 11. The strong demand for the tokens indicates that investors are not just seeing potential—they are already committing substantial resources to the project. The presale has been structured to gradually increase the token price, creating a sense of urgency for early participants looking to maximize their returns. Notably, 42.5% of the total token supply was allocated for the presale, showing that Rexas Finance is committed to building a large community of early adopters. Beyond the presale, the tokenomics model includes significant portions dedicated to staking, liquidity, and strategic partnerships. This ensures that once the project is fully launched, the market will have a solid liquidity foundation, fostering growth and minimizing volatility. For investors, this balance between growth potential and stability is key to making Rexas Finance a sustainable asset rather than another speculative token that risks crashing after the hype fades. Security and Trust: The Certik Audit Unfortunately, scams and rug pulls are common in an environment where tight security is critical. Rexas Finance has taken all necessary measures to protect its investors. Certik, an established standard for blockchain security, audited the project in question. Certik’s rigorous examination ensures that Rexas Finance is built on a secure, transparent foundation, reducing the risks typically associated with less scrutinized projects. The audit’s stamp of approval showcases Rexas Finance’s willingness to comply with best practices regarding security and code integrity for investors. It also portrays Rexas Finance as a serious contender and trustworthy in the market, which is far better than other platforms that launch with no security backing. A Presale Success That Signals Strong Future Growth The Rexas Finance presale is about to finalize, and token sales exceeding $36.6 Million are increasing global investor hype about the project. Rexas Finance has grabbed the attention of both physical and institutional investors, and the growing interest in the presale shows that the vision has gained investors’ confidence. On the contrary, an aspect that differentiates Rexas Finance from others in the crypto sphere is the cross-involvement of real-world assets, sound tokenomics, and a highly engaged community. Combined with the successful presale, these signs indicate that Rexas Finance does not just have the likelihood of being a one-day sensation. The venture can expand impressively over time, placing it as one of the most notable challengers to the already established entities of the cryptocurrency world. Conclusion Rexas Finance is establishing itself as a revolutionary force in the crypto market. What it is building does not limit itself to mere speculative appreciation but rather provides real value through asset tokenization, robust tokenomics, and a successful presale campaign. Rexas Finance has positioned itself as a token that could generate a return rivaling Shiba Inu 2021 ROI.

While it worked in the initial days, all it could attract were tech savants who knew what they were doing. The technological complexities didn’t make this niche appealing to investors who didn’t care much for these nuances. Now that the market has understood that, accessibility has become the name of the game. More and more projects are coming out of the woodwork, trying to appease people through simplified measures. Some are introducing robust ecosystems with interfaces akin to Web2 space, while others are incentivizing users. SpacePay is using a different take. While it is not letting go of the technological nuances, it is doing so in a way that everyone can understand. Will it be enough to make it the next big DeFi crypto on the market? What Constitutes the Best DeFi Crypto? Let us come down to brass tacks as of now. While the term “DeFi” sounds good as a buzzword, no one has been able to clearly define what it should bring to the table. The following list showcases the qualities that most decentralized finance projects should have. First, it should have clear and robust documentation. The technological nuances should not be hidden but should be presented in a way that everyone understands. Security features should be implemented so that people have an easier time adopting a technology that most deem untested. Insurance and safeguards also go a long way. Uniqueness is an attribute that should not be ignored. If a project isn’t unique enough, chances are it won’t have much mileage to gain traction among common investors. Community governance should be the primary feature. Since the term is “DeFi,” emphasis should be put on the concepts of decentralization, and people should be incentivized to participate in a project. The project should have strong tokenomics. Developers shouldn’t have most of the tokens. This distribution avoids any issues like rug pulls from happening to investors. A strong utility should also be present, and plans should be made to make the project sustainable for the long term. Also, there should be a focus on user-centric design. Complexities have always plagued the DeFi space, and if it has to accommodate more users, it has to adopt a simpler approach to let investors use its features. Finally, one should not forget about risk management. The crypto market is volatile, and safeguards should be put in place so that merchants and customers can remain relatively safe if the market crashes in any event. With these seven qualities, a DeFi project becomes more well-defined. All of these features are encompassed within SpacePay. SpacePay Encompasses All the Best Qualities of a DeFi Project SpacePay isn’t just any DeFi project; it is a cryptocurrency project of modern times. After repeated market crashes, people have grown wiser to look for projects with feasible use cases, and SpacePay hits all the key points. When it comes to documentation, SpacePay has opted for a simplified whitepaper . Presented in a PPT form, it is the right mix between text and imagery, highlighting the key points of the project without overburdening people with technical terminology. That does not mean, however, that the project omits key details. All aspects are covered, making it a project worth relying on. SpacePay has also taken proactive measures when it comes to security. While standard smart contract audits have been done already, SpacePay also focuses on bringing the standard Web2 standards of understandable security to the Web3 space. User data will be secured, and the network will continually evolve to become more secure. The uniqueness of this project stems from its unique payment solution. It is not providing any hardware or some other breakthrough that requires the need for a new application. It has created a terminal-agnostic system that can interact with existing payment peripherals. The project is designed to be extremely decentralized, with SpacePay’s native crypto SPY acting as a governance token. It allows users to decide the direction in which the project grows in the future. In terms of tokenomics, only 5% of the total supply has been allocated to the team. The remaining tokens are divided among presale, future developments, marketing, strategic partnerships, and other aspects. SpacePay has ensured that only a single body isn’t in control of the whole system. The user-centricity of SpacePay comes across properly when we consider how it is naturally designed to integrate with standard payment card systems and over 325 wallets. The entire ecosystem has been designed to work similarly to how standard payment paradigms work. Payment companies need not pay any extra costs, and the transaction fee is only 0.5%. These points have enough appeal that SpacePay can attract a massive following. Finally, SpacePay addresses the volatility risks by making the fiat value of a product the basis that decides how much crypto will be transferred. SpacePay’s payment system is in tune with market conditions, ensuring that merchants don’t suffer any loss if the value of a crypto falls. SpacePay Raises Over $800k During Presale The aforementioned positive qualities of SpacePay have allowed it to raise upwards of $800k to date. The SpacePay presale is evolving into a paradigm-changing event, which means those who are interested should visit the website today and participate.

Interestingly, the move coincides with XRP holding steady above $3 amid Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC. Ripple Chairman Moves 20 Million XRP A recent report reveals that Chris Larson, the Chairman of Ripple, transferred around 20 million XRP tokens to an unknown wallet at a value of $3.027. The report also states that the recipient wallet moved at least 10 million XRP to another wallet, which then liquidated over 4 million XRP on Coinbase. This clearly implies that a total of 16 million XRP from the original transfer remains intact. Speculation Surrounding the Transfers As per reports, the XRP community speculates the transfer might relate to Ripple’s ongoing SEc lawsuit or Larsen’s personal liquidation efforts. Notably, the Ripple chairman’s wallet has transferred at least 80 million XRP in just five months, after being dormant for over 11 years. In September, at least 50 million XRP tokens were moved by Larson in a simpler manner. These tokens were liquidated in over two weeks. Some experts believe that the recent activity mirrors the September pattern. In conclusion, Chris Larson’s recent XRP transfer highlights ongoing whale activity and raises questions about market impacts.

Despite challenges in establishing a definitive buying zone, technical indicators suggest the cryptocurrency is nearing the end of its correction phase, with momentum shifting in favor of the bulls. Technical analysis points to bullish potential In a recent analysis , crypto analyst RLinda highlighted that the XLM/USDT pair has been gradually breaking intermediate resistance levels while consistently updating highs. XLM price analysis chart. Source: RLinda / TradingView The key technical hurdle lies in breaking out of the medium-term consolidation and overcoming the resistance of the descending channel visible on the four-hour chart (H4). “The coin, technically, is ending its correction. The price is gradually updating highs and breaking intermediate resistance levels, but the key factor is the exit from the medium-term consolidation” – the analyst noted. Currently trading at $0.477, XLM is holding above its critical support zone, but sustaining this level is crucial to maintaining bullish momentum. The $0.46 and $0.452 levels serve as a crucial foundation for further gains. A breach of this support could lead to a short-term pullback, while a successful breach would likely generate the momentum needed for medium-term growth, positioning XLM for a potential breakout. Key levels to watch Traders should keep a close eye on the immediate resistance at $0.486. A breakout above this level could trigger a significant rally to $0.61, solidifying the bullish outlook. On the downside, key support zones are between $0.4605 and $0.4522. Maintaining these levels is crucial for bulls to keep momentum intact. Consolidation above $0.46 would signal strong buying activity, while a false breakdown below support, followed by a quick recovery, could confirm aggressive bullish sentiment. Optimistic projections for Stellar Adding to the optimism, crypto analyst Javon Marks highlighted that XLM is regaining momentum, showing signs of major strength. XLM price analysis chart.Source: Javon Marks/X Marks identifies a breakout target of $0.681, representing a potential 44% price surge from the current level. If XLM surpasses this level, the rally could extend toward $1.2918, reinforcing the bullish narrative. AI models, including ChatGPT , project even higher levels, suggesting that under favorable conditions, XLM could reach $1.75 to $2 by late 2025, supported by strong market fundamentals. Key market catalysts Stellar is riding the wave of broader market optimism fueled by Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) rally, which has boosted altcoins across the board. XLM’s performance remains closely tied to Ripple’s XRP , with both tokens surging amid speculation of potential crypto-friendly policies under the Trump administration. Stellar’s partnerships with MoneyGram , Circle, and central banks further strengthen its growing role in cross-border payments and blockchain infrastructure, solidifying its position as a key player in the evolving digital finance landscape.

39048565,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=644801,1737027532,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39048565.jpeg,"XRP markets react to recent SEC filing, bullish momentum strongest since January 2018",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/xrp-react-to-sec-filing-jan-2018-bullish/,"Ripple (XRP) is experiencing its strongest price uptrend since early 2018 off the backdrop of a recent filing by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The financial regulator is seeking to overturn a federal court ruling that stated Ripple tokens were not offered to investors as unregistered securities. XRP has surged by 46% this month, reaching seven-year highs above $3. According to data from CoinGecko, the token’s price experienced a 30% uptick in the past week alone, propelling its market cap to over $175 billion, eclipsing financial asset manager BlackRock’s $156.9 billion. Analysts have noted that the token’s recent price performance is its fastest ascent since the altcoin boom of January 2018. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) indicator shows XRP’s 14-month RSI at 92, the highest level since October 2017. These indicators show that the token’s momentum since the start of 2024 is its strongest in seven years. Ripple: The SEC challenge is just noise The price surge follows the SEC’s January 15 appeal filing with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The agency is challenging Judge Analisa Torres’s ruling, which favored Ripple Labs. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP @Ripple The @SECGov has filed its opening brief. https://t.co/v0YTjHGxzV — James K. Filan 🇺🇸🇮🇪 (@FilanLaw) January 15, 2025 The judge found that while XRP sales to institutional investors constituted unregistered securities offerings, sales to retail investors through exchanges did not. She reiterated that those buyers were unaware of the seller’s identity. The SEC has requested that the appeals court overturn this decision , arguing that Ripple’s efforts rendered XRP an investment contract under the Howey test, the framework used to determine whether a transaction qualifies as a security. On his official X account, Ripple Labs CEO called the financial regulator’s efforts the “definition of insanity.” He pointed out that SEC chair Gary Gensler took Judge Torres’s decision to heart. One definition of insanity…. Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Gensler's SEC really took this to heart. https://t.co/giV8GiW6qV — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 16, 2025 Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, also dismissed the SEC’s appeal, calling it “a rehash of already failed arguments.” “ We’ll respond formally in due time. For now, know this: the SEC’s lawsuit is just noise. A new era of pro-innovation regulation is coming, and Ripple is thriving .” XRP markets reacted positively after the SEC filing news broke out, and the currency is now up by almost 10% in the last 24 hours. However, the reaction wasn’t felt in South Korean markets, where the crypto is down 2% against the local currency in the same period. XRP derivatives market activity surges Per market data, open interest in XRP perpetual futures reached a record 2.34 billion XRP, with funding rates stabilizing around 10%. This represents a much healthier market compared to the unsustainable conditions of early December, when funding rates soared to 100%, which caused weeks of market price corrections. XRP futures open interest (OI). Source: Coinglass Analysts have pointed out that the token has entered the breakout stage of a symmetrical triangle pattern, signaling potential for further gains. They predict XRP could rally to $3.80 by the end of January, a 25% upside from current levels. However, a decline below the triangle’s upper trendline, followed by a deeper correction below the lower trendline, could invalidate the current upward momentum. In this scenario, XRP’s price may drop towards its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) near $1.32.

Ripple has reportedly acquired over $250 million worth of companies, a move that positions the firm as a key player in tokenization and blockchain adoption by financial institutions. Tokenization: The Core of Ripple’s Strategy According to King, Ripple’s ultimate goal is to make the XRP Ledger the central hub for tokenization, particularly for the banking industry. Ripple has gone on a buying spree and has now acquired over $250,000,000 worth of companies. What is the strategy here for $XRP ? As one of the founders who sold their company to Ripple, here's what I believe they're building towards: pic.twitter.com/TmL6uUPx5q — Austin King (@0xASK) January 13, 2025 This strategy aims to enable banks to tokenize various assets and leverage the XRP Ledger for asset management and interoperability across blockchains. Ripple’s acquisitions of Metaco and Standard Custody are pivotal in achieving this vision. Bridging Banks to Crypto and Empowering Asset Tokenization Ripple’s acquisition of Metaco allows banks to offer crypto custody services to their customers. Metaco provides secure solutions that enable financial institutions, such as Citi, HSBC, and BNP Paribas, to integrate cryptocurrency products seamlessly into their portfolios. By enabling banks to provide crypto-related services, Ripple is positioning itself as a vital infrastructure provider for the digital economy. The acquisition of Standard Custody enhances Ripple’s ability to offer tokenization services to banks. King points out that Ripple’s launch of RLUSD , a tokenized asset on the XRP Ledger, is just the beginning. Ripple plans to enable banks to tokenize a wide range of assets, from real estate to securities, leveraging blockchain technology for greater efficiency, security, and accessibility. Expanding Beyond the XRP Ledger King emphasizes that Ripple’s strategy extends beyond the XRP Ledger. While the XRP Ledger will be the foundational platform for tokenized assets, Ripple aims to facilitate interoperability across multiple blockchains. This approach ensures that tokenized assets can participate in the broader on-chain economy, creating opportunities for liquidity and utility across various ecosystems. Monetization Through Tokenization Fees Ripple’s business model appears to go beyond traditional transaction fees. Ripple can generate revenue through tokenization services, by positioning the XRP Ledger as a tokenization hub. This model offers significant growth potential as banks increasingly adopt blockchain technology for asset tokenization.

He suggests that regulatory clarity and government support could accelerate Ripple’s progress, further solidifying its role in transforming the financial industry. King concludes by reiterating the significance of Ripple’s strategy and the long-term potential of the XRP Ledger. His current venture, Omni Network, aims to support the expansion of tokenized assets across blockchains, aligning with Ripple’s vision for interoperability. He describes this as a “100x opportunity” for the current market cycle, urging stakeholders to recognize the transformative potential of Ripple’s initiatives. As Ripple continues to make strategic acquisitions and partnerships, its vision for XRP and the XRP Ledger is becoming increasingly clear. By focusing on tokenization, interoperability, and innovative fee structures, Ripple is positioning itself to lead the next wave of blockchain adoption in the financial sector.

He has even questioned the regulator’s understanding of how the crypto market works. However, in the last 24 hours, XRP has outperformed almost all the top cryptos, marking an impressive growth of nearly 9.4%. Let’s dive in for more details. SEC’s Allegations: A Huge Misunderstanding? In the SEC’s opening brief, the regulator claims that Ripple violated securities law through its sales of XRP, alleging that Ripple’s statements to investors created an expectation of profits. Bill Morgan, however, countered this claim in an X post, pointing out that price increases in the crypto market are generally driven by overall market trends, not just the actions of issuers like Ripple. Whale Activity and Market Impact Reports suggest that whales have been active recently, moving at least 130 million XRP tokens amid the ongoing legal developments. Whale activity can significantly influence market sentiment, and XRP has not been immune to this. Over the past hour, the market has dropped by 0.2%, with a larger 1.5% decline observed throughout the day. XRP’s Bullish Outlook Despite the volatility and legal uncertainties surrounding the token, market sentiment for XRP remains positive. According to a JP Morgan analyst, there’s a strong possibility that an XRP ETF could be launched soon, which is adding to investor optimism. In conclusion, XRP continues to be a key player in the crypto market, driven by legal developments and whale movements. As the lawsuit progresses, XRP’s outlook remains strong, with long-term growth potential and increasing interest in an XRP ETF.

Best Presales to Explode in 2025,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/sec-may-approve-first-litecoin-etf-5-new-crypto-to-100x/,"What’s the next crypto to have its own ETF? That’s a question that’s been on everyone’s minds since last year, when both $BTC and $ETH ETFs debuted to great success and laid the foundation for the huge surge in new crypto offerings in the winter. For a long time, it looked like Solana would be the next major crypto to break through with an ETF, but an unexpected update to some paperwork has changed that prediction. Now, Litecoin looks poised to win the race for the next ETF. Canary Capital, the company behind the ETF application, submitted plans for not one but three different ETFs back in October 2024: Solana, Litecoin, and XRP. Going simply by market cap, you’d think XRP and Solana should be higher priority; as both are top-ten cryptos. Litecoin, with a sub-$10B market cap, just barely breaks the top 20. However, the latest development makes it seem likely that Litecoin, not the two higher-ranked cryptos, will be the next to market. Canary Capital just filed an amended S-1 form for their Litecoin application, a likely indicator that the SEC has been in conversation with Canary about the application. If that’s the case, then Litecoin could easily be the next ETF. Regardless, it sets the stage for continued acceleration in the crypto market, with a number of new crypto projects ready to break through. Here are five new cryptos that could go 100x as the market grows. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Memes + Wall Street for 100x Growth Potential The OG green frog, Pepe, has spawned a vast number of imitators. But only a handful have achieved the success of $WEPE , which has raised over $49M in an ongoing presale. Such a huge presale sets the project up to fully deliver on its aggressive roadmap, which has plans to deliver community-driven trading insights and insider trading strategies. As the traditional stock market and dynamic world of crypto move ever closer together – with ETFs a key example – new cryptos like $WEPE stand to benefit. The $WEPE presale moves quickly; the current price stands at $0.00036648 and is going up all the time. Visit the official presale here. Poke Casino ($POKE) – A Big Play for a Metaverse Casino Poke Casino combines three major market forces in one project: Telegram-based gaming, meme coins, and the metaverse. The result is Poke Casino , a Telegram-based online casino with big plans for an eventual metaverse integration. The $POKE token facilitates casino betting, provides access to NFTs, and opens the door for increased earning and staking. The project is currently in presale, setting the stage for bigger gains once the project launches. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Bridging the Gap Between AI and Memecoins What would happen if a leading meme coin branched out into the rapidly growing world of AI tokens? We’re about to find out with MIND of Pepe . The project intends to leverage an ambitious token presale to launch an AI ‘hive mind,’ an autonomous agent set to deliver advanced market analysis, token launches, and more – exclusively to $MIND token holders. Building on existing projects like iDegen, $MIND aims to blend AI and meme coins in a whole new way, with nearly limitless potential. This is a token with a major upside, as AI ($52B market cap) and meme coins ($105B market cap) continue to form ever-growing segments of the crypto market. Join the $MIND presale. Dreamcars ($DCARS) – Luxury Car Rental Income for Token Holders Ever wanted to make money off of top-end luxury car rentals? Now you can; just purchase $DCARS.The native Dreamcars token allows holders to buy, own, sell, and trade shares in luxury cars. When the cars are rented out, $DCARS holders earn income based on a fractional ownership model facilitated by NFTs. The whole system is powered by the $DCARS token. $DCARS unlocks the passive income possible in the luxury car rental market. And, of course, there’s always the growth potential for the $DCARS token itself as users see the value in the Dreamcars model. With the presale now on, don’t miss your chance to grab your $DCARS tokens today. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – Major Market Tools for Memecoin Mayhem Stock market indexes track pre-defined baskets of stocks to help investors diversify their portfolios and dilute risk across the entire market. The S&P 500 is a classic example, allowing investors to purchase one share instead of 500 individual stocks. Now, the Meme Index project brings that same potential to the wild and wonderful world of meme coins.Meme Index won’t offer just one meme coin market index, but four, each tailored to a certain kind of investor and risk appetite. For example, the Meme Titans index tracks the major meme players – Pepe, Doge, and the like. At the other end of the spectrum, the Meme Frenzy index focuses on up-and-coming projects with everything to lose and everything to gain. Regardless of which you prefer, the $MEMEX token is your entry into the whole ecosystem. Don’t miss out on the Meme Index presale for the lowest available price . As ETFs Loom, New Crypto Projects Look Set to Do 100x and Beyond The looming decisions by the SEC – and the forthcoming selection of a new SEC chair – could set the stage for a booming meme coin market in 2025. And as more ETFs emerge and the crypto market grows, these new crypto presales could surge ahead. As always, though, be sure to do your own research, as none of these projects are guaranteed to get off the ground. But with a favorable market, these new cryptos could be big winners.",Altcoin|Bitcoin News|Cryptocurrency Market News|Meme coins,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|LTC|MARKET|REGULATION|ZRX,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-16 11:50:13

XRP Price Climbs Amid Bullish Momentum, Eyes Key Resistance Levels XRP has recently seen a notable increase in its price. It is currently trading in the range of $2.27 to $2.67. Over the past week, the price has risen by over 25%, reflecting strong bullish momentum. The six-month price change shows an impressive gain of nearly 400%. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at a high level, indicating that the asset is approaching overbought territory. However, the upward trend suggests that bulls are still in control. The nearest resistance level is at $2.84, which if broken could lead XRP towards the next resistance at $3.23. This would represent a potential increase of approximately 20% from the current price. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is at $2.80, slightly above the current price range, suggesting that a breakout could be imminent. If the bulls maintain their strength, XRP could test higher levels soon. On the downside, the nearest support is at $2.04, which may act as a safety net if the price retraces. Conclusion While XRP contends with regulation, XYZVerse’s unique merger of meme culture and sports fandom positions it for remarkable growth in the current bull market.

The rally has catapulted Litecoin’s market capitalization from $7.64 billion to $8.95 billion, adding over $1 billion in value in just one day and securing its position as the 20th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The price surge has ignited bullish sentiment, driven by a mix of regulatory speculation, institutional activity, and technical accumulation. Analysts and investors are increasingly optimistic about Litecoin’s near-term prospects, viewing it as a prime candidate for broader adoption and institutional interest. Litecoin ETF speculation At the heart of Litecoin’s recent rally is growing speculation about the potential approval of a Litecoin ETF. The Canary Capital S-1 filing, recently amended and filed with the SEC, has signaled continued engagement, sparking hope that regulatory greenlights could be on the horizon. Well, whaddaya know. https://t.co/hlC77fqSdO pic.twitter.com/F9a3azS0RF — Litecoin (@litecoin) January 15, 2025 James Seyfart, a prominent ETF analyst, noted on January 15: “Canary Funds just filed an amended S-1 for their Litecoin ETF filing. No guarantees—but this might be indicative of SEC engagement on the filing. Still no 19b-4 filing yet though, which would start the approval/denial clock.” Adding further momentum to this narrative, Eric Balchunas, a well-known ETF expert, highlighted on January 16: “We had heard chatter that the Litecoin S-1 had gotten comments back from the SEC. This looks to confirm that, which bodes well for our prediction that Litecoin is most likely to be the next coin approved. All that said, the new SEC chair has yet to start, and that’s a huge variable.” We had heard chatter that the Litecoin S-1 had gotten comments back from SEC. This looks to confirm that which bodes well for our prediction that Litecoin is most likely to be the next coin approved. All that said, new SEC chair has yet to start and that's a huge variable. https://t.co/cKFswPwcr0 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 15, 2025 The transition of the SEC chair from Gary Gensler to Paul Atkins, a figure regarded as crypto-friendly, has provided additional confidence. The impending Trump inauguration has also intensified discussions about a more favorable regulatory environment, particularly for altcoin-focused ETFs. Litecoin, alongside XRP and ADA, is being positioned as a key beneficiary of this evolving regulatory landscape, with the potential to see significant demand from institutional investors should an ETF be approved. Litecoin whales emerge out of the blue Institutional interest has also played a pivotal role in Litecoin’s recent ascent. The Grayscale Litecoin Trust (LTC) raised $2.3 million through a private placement of 242,900 new shares on January 9, 2025. Simultaneously, on-chain analytics from Santiment have identified a significant accumulation of Litecoin by whales and sharks, who have collectively acquired 250,000 LTC since January 9. ⚡️📈 Litecoin has decoupled from other altcoins, jumping +16.1% in market cap in just the past 11 hours. Just as we saw in early December, the key driver appears to be whales and sharks holding at least 10K+ $LTC . They have accumulated 250K coins since Jan. 9th. 👀 pic.twitter.com/zCmu7tGKJl — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 15, 2025 LTC price prediction From a technical perspective, LTC’s short-term trend remains volatile, analysts like Javon Marks see signs of significant strength emerging. He noted: “Litecoin back climbing with signs of MAJOR STRENGTH here and could be ready for a continuation towards its first target at $354.36!

Aurora Labs said in an announcement today that it’s targeting decentralized application and memecoin developers who’re fed up with the sluggish transaction speeds and lack of customization options on better-known blockchains such as Ethereum. Instead of deploying your dApp or token on that network, the Aurora Cloud Console gives you the option of creating a dedicated and customized blockchain for your own purposes. In this way, it’s breaking new ground in blockchain accessibility by tearing down the technical barriers to building decentralized networks. Previously, the only people who would even dare to try and create their own blockchains are developers who possess years of expertise in software development, as well as knowledge of specialist programming languages like Solidity. What Aurora Lab’s platform provides Now, it’s possible for absolutely anyone to create their own blockchain, using Aurora’s sophisticated no-code platform. Aurora Cloud Console aims to make the task as simple as creating an online store using a service such as Shopify. All you have to do is follow the step-by-step instructions, where you’ll set parameters such as the gas fees, the native token and the kinds of permissions available. Once done, it will handle all the nasty, technical coding stuff for you. The end result will be a highly scalable Aurora Virtual Chain based on NEAR Protocol’s ultra-rapid infrastructure, boasting superfast transaction speeds, EVM-compatibility and enterprise-grade security, plus access to a vast ecosystem of other dApps and Web3 services. Aurora Labs has aspirations to get as many as 1,000 connected blockchains up and running by the end of the year. It’s targeting creators of memecoins and other Web3 projects, and argues that building your own, customized EVM-compatible network will be the fastest way to scale. The arrival of Aurora Cloud Console comes after the debut of TurboChain last month. That new network was one of the very first Aurora Virtual Chains to be deployed. It’s a dedicated chain for the popular meme coin TURBO, which was previously deployed on Ethereum. By launching its own chain, the TURBO coin community is setting itself up for further growth, enabling users to pay their transaction gas fees using the TURBO token instead of ETH. Aurora Labs Chief Executive Alex Shevchenko spelled out how big a deal the new platform really is, saying it allows anyone to create a fully customizable chain from scratch within days. “We’ve removed the complexity, so builders can focus on creating great products while tapping into a thriving ecosystem of liquidity, tools, and users,” the executive explained. “Aurora Cloud Console is the gateway to Web3.” The post Aurora Labs’ No-Code Blockchain Development Platform Goes Live! appeared first on CoinGape .",Blockchain News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|NEAR,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-01-16 11:52:51

The accumulation came after the Fidelity asset management firm initiated several BTC sell-offs, including one earlier this week worth 1,210 BTC and another at the end of last year worth 2,140 BTC. A Santiment report has also indicated a growing confidence among BTC whales, leading to more BTC accumulation. The report suggested that BTC accumulation in wallets with more than 10 BTC is increasing. Santiment explained that the spike came after a stagnation since mid-December. The report also mentioned that some of the upcoming political and economic stories will influence the health of the crypto markets. Santiment first touched on the upcoming President Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20. The crypto analytics platform also highlighted the upcoming Fed meeting, which will shed light on expected policies to curb inflation, including the Fed’s stance on rate cuts. Santiment also mentioned the Israel-Palestine ceasefire announced on January 15, which could fuel a positive reaction in crypto markets. Market analytics platform CryptoQuant also revealed the growing BTC accumulation by institutional investors despite the massive dump on December 21, amounting to over 79,000 BTC. The platform explained that institutional investors have accumulated over 34,000 BTC over the past 30 days, showing a growing confidence for a bull run. BTC adoption rises among institutions like Fidelity and governments A Fidelity Investment report detailing its crypto outlook for 2025 showed expectations of institutional and government BTC adoption increasing in 2025. The report explained that the current signs point toward the beginning of mass diffusion and adoption of crypto. Fidelity also commented that while the process might take years, 2025 will be a pivotal moment for the future of crypto adoption. The Fidelity asset management firm also mentioned that upcoming macroeconomic factors will fuel the expected adoption of BTC and crypto. Fidelity speculated that rising inflation in different countries, plunging fiat currency values, and fiscal deficits would fuel crypto allocation. Multiple countries, including the US, Brazil, Poland, and Russia, are exploring the establishment of BTC strategic reserves. The incoming pro-crypto Trump administration is also expected to set global standards, with crypto markets anticipating more crypto-friendly regulations. The Bitcoin Act of 2024, proposed by Senator Cynthia Lummis, is expected to be developed in 2025. The legislation is expected to fuel BTC adoption in the US. The proposed regulation also suggests the government continue purchasing approximately 1 million BTC over the next 5 years. If passed, the regulation would allow the US government to offload its gold reserves to obtain more funds for BTC accumulation. Institutional investors have likewise shown more interest in BTC since last year. Microstrategy led in BTC purchases, with the most recent purchase being 2,530 BTC earlier this week, bringing its holdings to 450,000. BlackRock has also purchased BTC significantly since its ETF approval last year, with the latest purchase being 318 BTC earlier this week. Predictions have BTC price surging over $200,000 in 2025 Analysts have predicted that BTC will surpass $200,000 in 2025 due to the expected development in crypto policies and adoption. The CryptoQuant report mentioned that institutional BTC accumulation at lower prices was in anticipation of a price surge in 2025. The coin’s price has plunged over 7% this year, reaching the low price of $90,692 on January 13. Asset management firms VanEck and Galaxy Digital predicted that BTC’s price would hit above $180,000 in 2025. Matrixport Head of Research, Markus Thielen, commented that the increasing interest in Bitcoin ETFs would boost the coin’s price above $160,000. Analysts from Standard Chartered, Bit Mining, and Maple Finance have predicted that the coin will cross above $200,000. The CoinShares Head of Research, James Butterfill, also expects that the US establishing a BTC strategic reserve will fuel the coin’s price more than the spike seen after BTC ETF approvals. Standard Chartered still warned of possible price corrections for BTC if the coin’s price drops below $90,000. One of the bank’s analysts, Geoff Kendrick, suggested that the plunge could lead to another 10% loss in the BTC price, reaching $80,000.

On Thursday, January 16, Bitcoin surged past a key resistance level of around $97.6K, reaching $99.2K during the mid-London session. Could this be the start of a new chapter for Bitcoin? Bitcoin is now facing a significant psychological resistance zone between $100k and $108k. A break above this range could trigger a new bull rally, potentially leading to new all-time highs. Meanwhile, the price of gold is also preparing for a potential bull run after breaking through a key downward trend at $2,697. Bitcoin’s Bull Market Still Has Room to Grow According to a report from CryptoQuant , Bitcoin has not yet reached the peak of the 2024/2025 bull market, based on several key indicators. After bouncing back from below $90k, Bitcoin is now possibly entering a phase of horizontal consolidation, setting the stage for further gains. CryptoQuant has shared several possible price targets for Bitcoin. On the high end, Bitcoin could reach $249k, with a market cap of around $4.969 trillion. In a more moderate scenario, the price could hit $197K by 2025, corresponding to a market cap of about $3.929 trillion. On the lower end, Bitcoin could reach $145K, implying a market cap of approximately $2.88 trillion.

This action follows allegations of the platform’s failure to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) obligations, including violations of the customer identification system (KYC). According to the financial sector on the 16th, the Financial Intelligence Unit ( FIU ) of the Financial Services Commission notified Upbit in advance on the 9th of sanctions centered on a suspension of business concerning violations of the Specific Financial Transaction Information Act. Upbit Faces Potential Sanctions Impacting New Customer Transactions If confirmed, the sanctions will prevent Upbit from engaging with new customers for up to six months, specifically restricting new customers from transferring virtual assets outside the platform. However, existing customers will still be able to trade. Upbit, which holds over 70% of South Korea’s domestic virtual asset trading market by volume, faces significant impact from these sanctions. Upbit has until January 20th to submit its response to the sanctions. After reviewing Upbit’s explanation, the FIU will hold a hearing on January 21st to finalize the sanctions, including the suspension period. Financial Authorities’ Push for Market Reform The stringent sanctions on Upbit have drawn attention from other virtual asset exchanges, which reflects the financial authorities’ commitment to addressing illegal and unfair practices in the market, especially after the Virtual Asset User Protection Act was introduced in July. The industry also watches how this sanction will affect Upbit’s future business license renewal review. The license must be renewed every three years, but Upbit’s license was renewed in October of last year and is currently under review. The FIU conducted inspections of Upbit’s business license renewal applications from late August last year and found 700,000 cases where KYC (customer verification) was not properly done. The virtual asset industry is focused on the potential fines, as the Special Financial Transactions Act allows fines of up to 100 million won per violation. The FIU also found that Upbit violated rules by doing business with unreported overseas virtual operators, leading to sanctions.

This rebound could continue ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration next week and as US core inflation drops. Let’s explore some of the best cryptocurrencies to buy as the bull run resumes. Best Crypto Coins To Buy As BTC Hits $100k Bitcoin jumped briefly above $100k on Wednesday after the US released encouraging inflation data. It also rose after reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was considering abandoning Gary Gensler’s policies. Some of the best crypto coins to buy are Sui, Hyperliquid, Raydium, and Shiba Inu. Sui (SUI) Sui is one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy because of its history of outperformance and its growing ecosystem. Its token has jumped by almost 1,200% from its lowest level in 2023, bringing its market cap to over $13 billion. It has become one of the biggest crypto chains with a total value locked (TVL) of $1.8 billion. The Grayscale Sui Trust has also seen strong inflows, with over $14.5 million in assets today. Technically, the coin remains above all moving averages and has formed a series of higher highs and higher lows, pointing to more gains in the longer term. In a recent SUI price forecast , we estimated that it would surge to $10. SUI Price Chart Hyperliquid (HYPE) HYPE is another top crypto coin to buy because of its strong market share in the perpetual futures trading industry. According to DeFi Llama, the network handled over $31.65 billion in perpetual futures derivatives in the last seven days. It has handled over $685 billion cumulatively, making it the biggest player in the industry. Unlike most airdrops, HYPE price has done well as it soared by 122% from its lowest point in December. The most likely scenario is where the token surges by 50% and retests its all-time high of $35.15. Raydium (RAY) The Raydium token has soared by 350% from its lowest level in August last year as it became the most dominant player in the decentralized exchange industry. Raydum has now become a bigger DEX network than some of the oldest networks in crypto like PancakeSwap and Curve Finance. It has also announced the strategic move to perpetual futures, where it will become a big competitor to companies like Hyperliquid and Jupiter. That launch will help to boost the RAY token price in the long term. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu is a good cryptocurrency to buy and hold during this crypto bull run. It continues to burn millions of tokens weekly, reducing the number of coins circulating. Shiba Inu’s Shibarium network also handles millions of transactions, a figure that will cross 800 million soon. Technically, the coin has formed a falling wedge chart pattern, pointing to a potential rebound in the next few days. This pattern comprises two falling and converging trendlines; in most cases, a breakout usually happens when they near their confluence level. Shiba Inu Price Other Top Cryptocurrencies To Buy There are other good cryptocurrencies to buy and hold are popular coins like Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), Ethena, Hedera Hashgraph, and Solana.

If you surf through crypto X, you may notice that some count the days until Trump’s inauguration, believing that on day one, he will get Ulbricht out of prison. Let’s figure out why crypto enthusiasts are so enthusiastic about Ulbricht’s clemency. Table of Contents The ideas behind Silk Road Why is he in prison? Is Ross innocent? Ross Ulbricht will be free in 8 days 🧡 pic.twitter.com/jz8z9VgUFL — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) January 13, 2025 Silk Road has at least two faces. For some, it was a forum where free-minded people, interested in economy, individual sovereignty, libertarian ideas, and other things could share their thoughts, discuss things, and so on. Others remember that the website facilitated the online trade of all sorts of drugs, and its revenue during the 2.5-year tenure reached from $200 million to over $1 billion. People who think that the evils of drugs can be fought via the drugs ban find Silk Road an ugly website that was run by criminals for criminals. Those who don’t support the war on drugs and rather lean to the harm reduction side of the spectrum find the marketplace’s activity even healthier than more traditional street-based drug trafficking. However, the website was not all about drugs. The ideas behind Silk Road Silk Road had multiple moderators, so it is not clear if they all shared the same ideology and goals. In their posts, they confronted violence and coercion and promoted individual freedom over tyranny. One of the messages had a portion that read, “what we’re doing isn’t about scoring drugs or ‘sticking it to the man.’ It’s about standing up for our rights as human beings and refusing to submit when we have done no wrong. Silk Road is a vehicle for that message.” According to a mythical prime operator of the marketplace, the Dread Pirate Roberts, Silk Road had several restricted types of goods and services. It included hitmen services, child pornography, counterfeit coupons and money, and stolen possessions. The goods and services sold on the Silk Road should not have been intended to harm the market users. One may wonder how Silk Road ended up facilitating drug sales if it didn’t allow harmful goods? Well, that’s complicated. The 2014 study shows that a substantial amount of deals on Silk Road were dealer-level, and the volumes were high enough to reduce the drug violence on the street. Instead of fighting each other, drug dealers began to adopt marketing stunts and try to get better products for sale as Internet-based drug trafficking dictated new rules. Now, the customers could post negative or positive feedback, impacting the dealer’s reputation on the market, and that mattered more than the guns. Additionally, the forum was full of instructions on how to get high safely – or, better say, how to reduce risks and harm, how to avoid overdose, and so on. People who dream about the total elimination of drugs are hardly impressed with this approach. However, the harm reduction supporters rather stand for a more conscious drug consumption promoted on Silk Road. We don’t know how much of the described above adheres to Ross Ulbricht. He is certainly an avid libertarian, and he already had these ideas in the days when he conceived Silk Road. About that time, he wrote in the LinkedIn post: “I want to use economic theory as a means to abolish the use of coercion and aggression amongst mankind… I am creating an economic simulation to give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force.” Ulbricht is seen by many as a non-violent idealist rather than a mercantile criminal. None other than Tim Draper said that America needs this guy to work in the economy. However, it’s clear that the deep web-based unlicensed market distributing drugs was illegal and couldn’t be tolerated by the authorities. But why exactly is Ross Ulbricht in prison? Why is he in prison? Ross Ulbricht was arrested in 2013. In the 2015 trial, he pleaded guilty to creating the marketplace. However, he insists that after creating the marketplace, he let others manage it. Now, he is serving a whopping two life sentences plus 40 years in prison without parole (a $180+ million fine aside) for a series of convictions. The list includes engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, distributing narcotics (including by means of the Internet), conspiring to distribute narcotics, conspiring to commit money laundering, conspiring to traffic in false identity documents, and conspiring to commit computer hacking. People advocating for Ulbricht’s clemency always stress that he is a first-time offender who committed no violent crime and had no victims. The two life sentences plus 40 years seem to be too much for operating an “eBay for drugs.” Before the trial, Ulbricht was charged with murder-for-hire attempts, but these charges were dropped. Someone in Silk Road was discussing the killing of other members in order to avoid data leakage, but no hit actually occurred, and no evidence that this “someone” is Ulbricht was presented. It’s worth saying that Ulbricht is not the only Silk Road team member serving a severe sentence. Roger Thomas Clark, the Second-in-Command on Silk Road, was sentenced to 20 years behind bars in 2023. According to the press release introducing Clark’s sentence, following Clark’s advice, Ulbricht resorted to hiring a hitman and paid a hitman $80,000. Is Ross innocent? The answer is negative and cannot be positive in any respect. Ulbricht pleaded guilty and expressed regret in the letter to the federal judge. He called his brainchild a “costly and naive idea that has ruined his life.” Read more: Transcript Reveals Judge’s Justification for Ulbricht’s Life Sentence While some remember Silk Road as a place where they could find cheap medications for their ill relatives, others share stories that reveal that Ulbricht’s life was not the only one that Silk Road helped to ruin. Drugs do it easily, and for many, Silk Road was a handy way to get some. Ulbricht may have dreamed of empowering freedom, but for some, he facilitated a fall for addiction. However, it is easy to mix up what we blame on Silk Road with what we blame on Ulbricht. The latter claims he distanced himself from Silk Road early. Allegedly, the Dread Pirate Roberts was the moniker used by several moderators, however, Ulbricht was found responsible for the DRP actions as if he had been the only person behind the handle. Although Ulbricht denied being the only person using this handle and named none other than the Mt. Gox founder Mark Karpelès as the person in question, Judge Katherine B. Forrest declined to discuss the possible involvement of other people in ‘being DRP’, denied the cross-examination, and chose to follow the prosecution narrative effectively barring the way for Ulbricht’s defense. In the documentary Deep Web, directed by Alex Winter, a senior writer for Wired, Andy Greenberg, who interviewed DRP remotely before the trial, says that a person he was talking to claimed that this moniker was handed to him by the marketplace creator, then unknown. The very name Dread Pirate Roberts refers to a character from the book Princess Bride and the eponymous movie. This Pirate could be multiple persons doing his deeds and using his image. Interestingly enough, while Ulbricht was in jail, awaiting a trial, Silk Road went live again, and the operator’s name was DRP again. Who knows if it was the same person, but generally,y it seems that Ulbricht may actually not be a man responsible for the marketplace’s activity. More than that, the FBI didn’t provide a trustworthy explanation of how they located the Silk Road servers, which was the first huge step in shutting the operation down. Many believe those federals could have illegally hacked the foreign servers without a warrant, violating the Fourth Amendment. However, Ulbricht didn’t succeed in pushing this narrative in the court. An eye-popping sentence for non-violent crimes committed by the first-time offender is sometimes attributed to a smear campaign in which Ulbricht was presented by the press as a drug kingpin who tried to kill his partners. The murder-for-hire charges were dropped soon, but the stain on Ulbricht’s image proved to be resistant. The jury, who wasn’t that tech-savvy to understand things like the deep web and bitcoins, was probably affected by the image imposed on Ulbricht in the press. According to Alex Winter , Ulbricht is a model prisoner who teaches his peers math and yoga, helping them get off drugs. He describes him as humane, highly educated, and self-aware. The Deep Web director believes that the time served by Ulbricht is more than enough for his wrongs. I just spent my 4,000th day in prison. I'll begin my 12th year in two weeks. During that time, I’ve tried my best to grow and be a better man. I want to use the hard lessons I’ve learned to make amends as a free man, if I’m given the chance. — Ross Ulbricht (@RealRossU) September 16, 2024 Many politicians, public speakers, and institutions voiced their support for Ulbricht, noting that America needs such people out of jail. So, if Trump told the truth, Ulbricht may soon have a chance to prove his talents, this time in a less harmful way. Answering the question of why people in the crypto community count days until the release of Ross Ulbricht from prison, we can cite two main reasons. Firstly, his libertarian views resonate with the views of many in the crypto community. Secondly, the crypto community does care about justice and injustice, and 11 years served by Ross in prison is widely perceived as enough term for his crimes, especially given that the Land of the Free already has the biggest incarcerated population on the planet and the life sentence of Ulbricht may cost taxpayers around $2 million.

The momentum, however, has slowed. With the inflation data out of the way, crypto traders are refocusing on President-elect Donald Trump's swearing-in on Jan. 20 and possible pro-crypto action on the first day. Some expect bitcoin to set new highs by then, while others are penciling in at least 10% price swings in XRP, SOL, ETH and BTC. On Polymarket , the probability of the U.S. holding BTC as a part of a strategic reserve has increased to 50% for the first time. Bitwise, a San Francisco-based crypto asset management company, said on X that it provided information about bitcoin ETFs to a nation-state, adding weight to the sovereign BTC adoption narrative. Speculation is rife that SEC commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda could rekindle crypto policy as early as next week. That said, don't overlook the importance and market-moving ability of Treasury nominee Scott Bessent's confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Finance Committee that kicks off at 10:30 a.m. in Washington. Bessent will likely face scrutiny on various topics, including dollar policy, tariffs and fiscal sustainability. In released remarks, Bessent said he wants the 2017 tax cuts to become permanent and ensure the dollar remains a dominant global reserve currency. He also said tariffs are a valuable negotiating tool. According to ING, the dollar could rally if Bessent highlights the supposedly inflationary tariffs as a key tool. A renewed uptick in the currency and Treasury yields may slow BTC's gains, potentially injecting volatility in risk assets in general. Stay alert!

At a time when the market is consolidating and recovering from an earlier crash, the AIXBT token price is constantly gaining new peaks, resulting in a 175795% surge in the last three months. Moreover, investor interest and adoption rates are rising, especially as the token nears the $1 milestone, which others failed. There are many reasons behind the ongoing rally, which could even fuel it to a higher target; let’s discuss. Reasons Behind AIXBT Token Price Rally, Fueling it To $1 The biggest reason behind AIXBT’s exponential growth is its high demand in the market, which was garnered due to previous chart movements and hype around the AI cryptos. As explained in an earlier CoinGape article, AI crypto will become the new cryptocurrency trend in 2025 due to the upscaling of the AI industry and its collaboration with crypto. The AIXBT coin has surged more than 30% in the last 24 hours and currently trades at $0.915 with 782M in market capitalization. Over the week, the price has surged 115% amid high trading volume and investor interest. Even at present, the trading volume is $689.54M after a 50% surge. Interestingly, if the technical factors align, the same could lead the AIXBT token price to $1 or even higher. Crypto whales are betting on this opportunity. One whale bought 3.81 million tokens and is holding almost 0.83% of the AIXBT’s total supply. Eventually, this will create increased buying pressure on the token. Further demand is clearly visible in the Open Interests, where the Coinglass derivative data presents the surge of OI from $73M to $208.83M within just two days. This reveals that investor confidence is in its prime for this AI crypto. There are additional factors like Binance listing and bullish sentiments for the token. Even the technical indicators present the buyer dominance on the token. Experts believe the continuous trend would lead to further Aixbt by virtual token price rally. Here’s When AIXBT Price Rally Can Hit $1 AIXBT’s recent surge to its current trading value of $0.915 clearly shows strong bullish momentum for the token. Although the technical indicators present mixed signals, the MACD and moving averages on the short frame present strong bullish signals. With that, the token is moving towards the 161.8% Fibonacci extension level, which could result in the AXIBT Token price hitting $0.9987. This level will become a crucial point for the further performance of the token, as the rejection from 168.1% could drop the price to $0.755. However, if the token surpasses the resistance, it can next target the 261.8% Fibonacci extension level, reaching a price target of $1.39. Bottom Line Amid the bullish momentum fueled by investor interest, high trading volume, and other factors, the AIXBT token price can definitely reach $1 soon. However, investors should monitor the price performance, as the RSI is closer to the overbuying zone, so a reversal could result in a crash. However, if things go smoothly, the token can create a new ATH at $1.39.

Speaking at the 2025 Virtual Asset Conference held in South Korea on January 16, CryptoQuant CEO stated that there is new capital inflow into the market and supports the rise. At this point, Ju noted that Bitcoin could potentially rise to $161,000 given the total capital inflow entering the market. Ju stated that according to technical indicators, the BTC market has not yet reached an overheated state and that further increases are on the way. South Korea: Land of Altcoins! Ju also described the South Korean cryptocurrency market as the “land of altcoins.” “In Korea, 97% of the trading volume is in altcoins, and this is entirely due to individual investor transactions rather than institutional transactions. “Our country can be a leader in Bitcoin. For this, after the institutional restructuring, our country needs to open the door for institutions to enter the Bitcoin market. Because this move will provide us with the opportunity to grow as a leader in the Bitcoin era.” CryptoQuant CEO recently made an interesting analogy for the largest altcoin Ethereum (ETH), stating that ETH is a stablecoin.

Analisten verwachten een opleving van de crypto markt. Hieronder gaan we daarom in op een aantal van de crypto met potentie die optimaal kunnen profiteren van Trump als nieuwe Amerikaanse president. Op 20 januari gaat Trump officieel van start met zijn tweede termijn als Amerikaanse president. De aanloop naar deze inauguratie lijkt nu al een positief momentum voor de crypto markt gecreëerd te hebben. De Trump crypto gekte lijkt begonnen, aangezien de market cap van de gehele markt over de afgelopen 24 uur al meer 3,5% gestegen is. Grootheden zoals Bitcoin en Ethereum bevinden zich allemaal in het groen, maar het is XRP die de grootste stijging heeft ervaren. XRP wist over de afgelopen zeven dagen namelijk meer dan 34% te stijgen en is daarmee overduidelijk de beste presterende crypto uit de top 10 van de crypto markt. Inauguratie Trump lijkt reden voor succes Ripple koers De reden hiervoor lijkt direct verbonden te kunnen worden aan de inauguratie van Trump. Ripple is namelijk nog altijd verwikkeld in een rechtszaak met de SEC. De aankomende veranderingen binnen de SEC lijken nu genoeg reden voor Ripple te zijn om deze rechtszaak te winnen. Met een nieuwe pro-crypto voorzitter van de SEC in het vooruitzicht, en mogelijk significante beleidsveranderingen lijkt de crypto markt een positieve periode tegemoet te gaan. Het blijft echter de vraag welke crypto nu kopen de beste optie is. Hieronder gaan we om die reden verder in op een aantal van de beste crypto met potentieel. Alledrie deze projecten hebben door hun unieke utility het potentieel om aanzienlijke stijgingen door te maken zodra ze live gaan op exchanges.

Coinbase case. Crypto exchange Coinbase secured partial victory in the lawsuit from the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals. Meanwhile, BNB price continues to grow with the most recent surge coming over the past 24 hours. Also, traders anticipated whether this development would trigger a rally to $1000. Binance Files Joint Notice Against the US SEC In a court filing late January 15, Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao filed a Joint Notice of Supplemental Authority . It informed the court of a recent conclusion drawn in the Coinbase vs SEC lawsuit. The case of Binance and the US SEC deals with the operations of the exchange platform, wherein the SEC has alleged that Binance has been operating as an exchange, broker-dealer, and clearing agency without registering with it. This comes as Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao along with its US arm requested the court to dismiss the lawsuit. The crypto exchange argued that the SEC has failed to show how its complaint satisfies the Howey test, why its complaint against third-party tokens to move ahead, and request for disgorgement should proceed to discovery. The exchange wants to leverage the partial victory of Coinbase in a recent judgment in the lawsuit to support dismissal of claims. US SEC v. Coinbase Case Judgment The US SEC has been asked to come up with a completely justified response about why it declined Coinbase’s rulemaking petition. Coinbase argued that the agency was applying existing securities laws to digital assets, and was chasing crypto platforms without telling them how they should comply with current regulations. It was further questioned during the US SEC v. Coinbase lawsuit proceedings if the old securities laws work for digital assets, which is a booming technology. Thereby, requiring the SEC to come up with either a justifiable reason to sue crypto platforms or address their requests to develop crypto-friendly regulations. BNB Price Analysis BNB price is trading up 2.25% over the past 24 hours, exchanging hands at $709.55. It has surged by 3% in the last 7 days and a rise of 123.58% over the year. The market cap and 24-hour trading volume of BNB are also up by 2.31% and 20.50%, respectively. Binance continues to grow support for crypto tokens amid the bull market. Some newly supported meme coins on Binance are DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE, with bullish speculation when it comes to their respective future prices. This new support is primarily aimed at the African region.

A recent analysis by trader CRYPTOWZRD, reshared by Cointelegraph, highlights that XRP has successfully flipped a critical resistance level into support. According to CRYPTOWZRD, this technical move lays the groundwork for a rally toward $4.00 , with the possibility of reaching $8.00 on higher timeframes. LATEST: XRP rally to $4 is possible after XRP/BTC pair clears 30-day resistance level. Crypto trader CRYPTOWZRD says, “XRP has flipped previous resistance to support, it is now ready to rally to $4.00 and then $8.00 in the higher time frame.” pic.twitter.com/zt8LOd7hFC — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) January 14, 2025 Technical Insights The analysis shared includes two key charts, both pointing to XRP’s technical breakout: USD Pair Analysis: The weekly chart showcases XRP breaking out of a multi-year triangle pattern. This breakout is accompanied by a flip of old resistance into support, a historically bullish signal in technical analysis. The trader draws parallels to XRP’s price action in 2017, where a similar structure led to exponential price growth. BTC Pair Perspective: The XRP/BTC chart emphasizes that XRP is trading at its highest weekly close since October 2022. The pair has also surpassed a four-year weekly resistance level, indicating strong momentum. A breakout above these levels could lead to further gains as market participants re-enter the asset. CRYPTOWZRD predicts that these flips could act as catalysts for a sharp price increase, with the potential for XRP to reach $4.00 in the medium term and $8.00 over the long term. Market Reactions and Skepticism The crypto community has responded with mixed reactions to these bullish predictions. Some traders and analysts share CRYPTOWZRD’s sentiment. They emphasize that flipping resistance into support is a classic technical move that often precedes strong upward momentum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other community members, such as Gavun WUD Agent, caution against relying solely on technical analysis. Gavun notes that while flipping resistance to support is noteworthy, the real test for XRP lies in its network fundamentals and utility. Without significant progress in these areas, historical patterns alone may not guarantee future performance. The Great Pupdini took a sarcastic tone, questioning the reliability of technical analysis and drawing comparisons to astrology. He urged investors to consider on-chain metrics and regulatory developments instead of speculative chart patterns. Current Market Context At the time of the analysis, XRP is trading at $2.54, reflecting a substantial recovery in 2024 following a prolonged bear market. The broader market sentiment has improved, aided by reduced regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. and the growing adoption of blockchain technology. While the prediction of XRP rallying to $4 or even $8 is speculative, the technical indicators shared by CRYPTOWZRD suggest that the asset has entered a bullish phase. However, as highlighted by community members, technical analysis alone may not suffice. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to a recent report from New York Post, President-elect Donald Trump plans to create an ‘America-first’ crypto reserve that will focus on U.S.-based crypto currencies like Solana ($SOL), Ripple ($XRP), and USD Coin ($USDC). Trump Strongly Backs Crypto Initiatives The next few days and weeks are going to be very busy as the Trump administration gets back to Washington, D.C., and plans to introduce new executive orders focused on cryptocurrency. The New York Post reports that President-elect Donald Trump is thinking about creating an “America-first” strategic reserve that would favor U.S.-based cryptocurrencies like USDC, SOL, and XRP. The report mentioned that Trump has recently met with the creators of these cryptocurrencies and is open to the idea. Also read: Crypto News Today (Jan 16th, 2025): Bitcoin Price Nears $100k | ETH, SOL Lead Altcoin Market Surge The plan to issue executive orders soon could lead to setting up a Bitcoin reserve and stopping banks from refusing to work with cryptocurrency clients. One of Trump’s key promises in crypto is setting up a national Bitcoin reserve. Expecting this plan to kick off, several public companies are now starting to include Bitcoin in their financial reserves. Meanwhile, individual states are getting involved too. For example, Oklahoma’s Representative Cody Maynard recently introduced a bill that would let the state treasurer invest in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and stablecoins. This initiative is part of a wider effort with states like Texas, Pennsylvania, and Ohio also planning to set up their own crypto reserves. Trump’s Approach Relieves Entire Market The crypto market is finally relieved after years of harsh actions by the Biden administration. During the Biden administration, banking regulators from the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) instructed banks not to engage with cryptocurrency companies, which paused the industry’s growth. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen referred to these actions as “terrorizing” startups. Hence, the latest initiatives taken by Trump to promote the market have boosted buying demand. Trump’s pledges included firing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, pardoning Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, setting up a Crypto Presidential Advisory Council, canceling SAB 121, stopping “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” and making the U.S. a leading bitcoin mining hub. Following these announcements, Gensler confirmed he would leave the SEC. Coinpedia previously reported that Trump’s revamped SEC plans to drop security allegations and create a new cryptocurrency policy. Additionally, David Sacks, chosen by Trump as the Crypto and AI Policy Advisor, is organizing the first-ever Crypto Ball this weekend in Washington, D.C. With sponsorship from key industry leaders such as Coinbase, Solana, and Galaxy Digital, the event highlights the administration’s dedication to promoting blockchain technology.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-16 13:33:59

This pullback suggests the price could be consolidating before making another move. Ethereum might have found a bottom , though it’s not as clear as with Bitcoin. If Ethereum can break above the previous high of around $3,750, it would strengthen the case for further upward movement. For now, more confirmation is needed to be certain about the bullish trend.

Despite that, the overall upward movement is still valid, and the price could continue higher if the support levels hold. Potential Correction: It’s also possible that the recent rise is part of a larger correction pattern. If this is the case, the price could face more pullback before pushing higher again. Key Support Levels to Watch For Ethereum to maintain its bullish outlook, it needs to hold the support zone between $3,033 and $3,251. If the price stays above this area, the consolidation could be shallow, and we might see the price climb again. A break below these levels could signal trouble for the bullish trend. If Ethereum manages to break above $3,480, which was the high from Wednesday, it could trigger a surge towards the $3,800 to $3,900 range. This would mean the continuation of the upward trend and possibly lead to even higher prices. Given the current market conditions, Ethereum could experience a shallow pullback, which is typical in a bullish phase. If the price doesn’t fully test support and instead moves directly upward, it could signal that the next price surge is already beginning.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-16 13:36:47

The new number will reflect market conditions, as the previously selected number remains unrelated to current demand. Solana may continue into the future with reduced inflation, to reflect the community’s vision. Mert Mumtaz, co-founder of Helius Labs, is preparing for a proposal coming next week, to re-establish the inflationary pace of SOL tokens. reduced inflation proposal coming to Solana manlets by next week current number is completely arbitrary — it's time to let the market set the price — mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) January 15, 2025 Comparing Solana’s model with Ethereum As of January 2025, Solana’s inflation is 4.78%, set to fall gradually by 15% after each 180-epoch period. The lowering of the inflation is somewhat similar to halvings, though happening at shorter periods. A Solana epoch is approximately two days, so the inflationary pace drops roughly once a year. Solana (SOL) expanded its supply since 2021, suggesting a deflationary approach may boost SOL prices. | Source: Statista Solana inflation comes from new SOL issuance, which goes toward validators as a subsidy. This makes Solana one of the chains with the biggest expenses for each $1 in revenues. Solana is also turning into the biggest fee producer based on app activity. However, the large printing rate means SOL holders are subsidizing app creators through inflation. Solana is also not directly competing with Ethereum (ETH) in being sound money. ETH inflation also varies depending on network usage, but cannot be controlled directly as the block issuance is fixed. For Solana, the proposal will change the tokenomics to reflect the community demand for a certain inflation rate. Around 65% of all SOL is staked in simple or liquid staking, which is the main mechanism against the chain’s inflation. A new proposal may cause a shift in the way SOL is used and redistributed, while still encouraging long-term holding and staking. One of the main reasons for demanding lower inflation is the perception that Solana has hurt its long-term holders. The supply of SOL has increased over the years, but the token remains at a relatively low price range. After the shock of 2022, SOL was expected to rival other L1 tokens for higher price ranges. SOL has recovered most of the lost ground since 2021, but its market supply has doubled due to the aggressive issuance of new tokens. The constant inflow of SOL has prevented the asset from reaching higher market valuations to rival BNB. SOL is seen as undervalued due to inflation, not reflecting the growing on-chain activity and the thriving meme and AI ecosystem. Will SOL become a deflationary asset? There are still no details on the proposal, but the Solana community has pointed to the option of a deflationary asset or reduced inflation. The immediate proposal is to entirely change the payment structure for validators. With a zero inflation rate, validators would only receive their incentives from transaction fees. Currently, Solana has extremely low base transaction fees, though JitoSOL gains extra from bribes. If the priority fees and bribes go to validators, with no new SOL issuance, the network would achieve 0% inflation. There are also proposals for a 10% burn for fees, which would instantly turn Solana deflationary. Solana inflation at current prices translates into around $7B in new tokens. For a deflationary SOL, the value would flow back and lift the market price. In the meantime, validators holding SOL would still get a reward from the deflationary token, which over time, would increase its scarcity. If SOL also gains sound money, the chain would further move closer to becoming the leader among new decentralized projects. The chain continues to gain ground over Ethereum as the chain attracts more developers due to the higher earnings potential . Another proposed scenario is to lower inflation and new SOL issuance up to 1.5% annually, then continue with inflation halvings over time. This scenario would put Solana close to Ethereum’s rate, which in the past year fluctuated between 0.3% and 0.7%. After the mention of a deflationary network, SOL recovered to $214.69, along with the rest of the market. The latest price move liquidated short sellers, opening the path for a higher range.

Coins such as Solana ( SOL ), USD Coin ( USDC ), and Ripple ( XRP ) are being discussed as potential inclusions. Trump has recently met with the founders of these projects and is said to be receptive to the idea, sources close to the matter revealed to the NYP. He reportedly aims to focus U.S.-based cryptocurrencies in his proposed “America-first” crypto reserve strategy.

However, the proposal has raised concerns within the cryptocurrency community, particularly among Bitcoin advocates. Critics argue that emphasizing U.S.-based coins could detract from efforts to establish Bitcoin ( BTC ) as the primary digital asset in the U.S. crypto landscape—a promise Trump highlighted during his campaign. Despite these concerns, industry insiders remain optimistic about the broader impact of Trump’s pro-crypto agenda. The incoming administration has already announced plans to issue executive orders to deregulate the sector, establish a Crypto Presidential Advisory Council, repeal restrictive policies such as SAB 121, and position the U.S. as a global hub for Bitcoin mining.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As the altcoin season heats up, Remittix stands out as a top contender for 50x-100x gains, cross-border payments with its blockchain-powered platform. Table of Contents Short-term FUD likely to be a blip in Solana’s long-term trajectory Trump’s inauguration could propel Dogecoin to further heights Discover Remittix’s immense profit potential in a lucrative niche The next altcoin season is fast approaching, and many cryptocurrencies are poised for 10x gains in the upcoming months. While top ten coins like Dogecoin and Solana are unlikely to deliver the outsized gains most investors are seeking with cryptocurrency, they remain solid safety nets for returns around 5x, providing stability and a hedge for diversified portfolios. For those aiming for parabolic returns in the 50x-100x range this bull run, Remittix stands out as a strong contender. With the cross-border payment sector at its core, Remittix is in its early presale phase and boasts potential growth of over 5000% in a bullish case scenario. Here’s the rundown on Remittix’s bullish potential. Short-term FUD likely to be a blip in Solana’s long-term trajectory Recent whale activity has raised caution among Solana investors, with a notable transfer of 149,999 SOL, valued at $27.9 million, from an unknown wallet to Binance. This transaction has sparked concerns about potential selling pressure or strategic repositioning, contributing to short-term market uncertainty for Solana. Currently trading at $186, Solana faces fluctuations and hesitant buyer sentiment as the market evaluates its troubling trajectory. Despite this, Solana continues to solidify its position as a leading layer-1 blockchain, having processed 66.9 million daily transactions even in bearish conditions last month. Institutional interest is growing, with Grayscale and 21Shares filing for Solana-based ETFs and developers working on a “lattice-based homomorphic hashing function” to enhance scalability and efficiency. These advancements position Solana for significant growth, with potential 2-5x returns expected in this cycle, keeping it competitive in the evolving blockchain landscape and continuing its 2024 hot streak where Solana was the trendiest layer-1 overall. Trump’s inauguration could propel Dogecoin to further heights Dogecoin has shown resilience despite a 17% decline this week, buoyed by increased whale activity and ongoing speculation about Elon Musk’s potential integration of Dogecoin into his envisioned “X Money” payments platform. Musk’s long-standing fascination with Dogecoin, paired with support from the pro-crypto Trump administration and the “Department Of Government Efficiency” (DOGE), also act as potential bullish catalysts for a strong Dogecoin recovery in 2025. Currently trading near $0.33, Dogecoin’s history of rebounding from market slumps suggests it could recover alongside other meme coins as market conditions improve. While a repeat of its monumental 2021 performance is unlikely due to market cap limitations, sustained whale accumulation and Dogecoin’s enduring cultural appeal position Dogecoin for steady growth, reinforcing its role as the #1 leading meme coin. Discover Remittix’s immense profit potential in a lucrative niche Remittix is transforming international payments by integrating blockchain technology with fiat transactions. Supporting over 40 cryptocurrencies, the platform enables seamless conversion to fiat currencies like USD and EUR.

The company is aiming to go public in a grand way. It has made a confidential filing with the SEC in January 2025, which marks a significant step in its journey. If things go as planned, this could reshape the position of the exchange in the competitive trading platform market. Worth of eToro eToro’s IPO could value the company at over $5 billion. For context, back in 2023, eToro was valued at $3.5 billion after raising $250 million in a funding round. That’s a massive jump in just two years. Filing confidentially with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a smart move. It gives company time to work out the details without revealing too much to the public or competitors. It’s like preparing in the shadows, only stepping into the spotlight when everything’s ready. Timing Is Key The IPO could happen as early as the second quarter of 2025. This timeline would give eToro ample time to prepare for its U.S. market debut, despite some recent hurdles. For example, in September 2024, the platform stopped trading most crypto assets in the U.S. after resolving regulatory issues with the SEC. A U.S. listing would open doors to a bigger pool of investors, even though the U.K. remains eToro’s largest market. Leading banks like Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and UBS are advising eToro on this major step. With their backing, the company seems well-positioned to navigate the tricky IPO waters. In September 2024, eToro faced a setback when it stopped trading most crypto assets in the U.S. after settling with the SEC over regulatory violations. Despite this, the platform remains a global force. Founded in 2007, eToro has grown into a trusted name for trading stocks, cryptocurrencies, and more. What’s Next for eToro? If the IPO becomes a success, it will be a game changer for eToro. This process is not just about raising funds but putting a name flag in the market. With all the regulatory challenges it has faced in the US, getting listed is no small win and the potential rewards are huge. Investors and industry watchers will be paying close attention to see how eToro plays its cards.",News|Crypto news|Exchange News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-16 13:48:58

How We Selected the Best Crypto Casinos There are certain aspects that one has to take into consideration when selecting the top crypto casinos. As we have reviewed tons of them and have now a more trained eye to understand their differences, advantages, and disadvantages, we will share in our following titles some of the most important aspects that we look for when we evaluate them. Licensing and Regulation One of the most important things to check when reviewing a casino is the security that it provides. After all, our recommendations will be taken seriously by our readers and they will deposit their funds in the chosen casino, so there is a great responsibility behind that. When a casino complies with certain regulations and has a license authorized by a reputable entity, it gives an idea of a robust platform that has the support of a regulation authority and is less likely to have security problems. Withdrawals and Deposits An important thing to check is the options that the casino offers in terms of payments and withdrawals. We know that the more options, the better it will be and the wider the audience that it will capture. Some popular options for payments are credit and debit cards, bank wire transfers, and e-wallets. Lately, a lot of online casinos are also accepting a wide variety of cryptocurrencies, as users are starting to use them more often, and these are great options to have quick and secure transactions and low fees. Game Variety and Promotions We know that our readers are looking to have a great time gambling, and this is provided by great games, and even better if there are several of these great games. A varied game library is crucial to determine if the crypto casinos evaluated are worth visiting or not. Many of them offer traditional casino games and slot games, but also a lot of players enjoy other types of games, like sports betting, bingo, or lottery. Recognizing and Avoiding Phishing Scams The internet is filled with information, platforms, and websites that we cannot be sure of their legitimacy. One of the most important things to perform is an evaluation of the security to determine if the site is to be trusted or not. This can be done by understanding if the site is a licensed casino or complies with certain rules or regulations like we mentioned earlier, but also by looking for information about the site in reviews, user comments, and other information available. Whenever there is room for doubt, we prefer to let it go and pass to the next crypto casino. Utilizing Reliable Digital Wallets Digital wallets are the place where you will store and make your transactions through cryptocurrencies, and in that sense, it is our duty to look for sites that integrate easily with well-known and trusted digital wallets to ensure that the safety and security of the site are 100% accurate and that there will be no problem with this platform. Why Crypto Casinos Are Gaining Popularity In recent years, as we mentioned in a section earlier, we have seen a great increase in online platforms that include cryptocurrencies as a method of payment. Even some of them are being launched as purely crypto-based casinos, and no other methods are accepted besides crypto tokens. In the following titles, we will try to explain why this is happening and why people are turning to crypto casinos more and more every year. The Benefits of Decentralization in Gaming If you heard about cryptocurrencies, you probably heard about the concept of decentralization. The idea behind this is to have a better sense of ‘freedom’ in the transactions and the control of the money, avoiding centralized controls that occur with traditional payment methods like bank wire transfers. This is due to the nature of blockchain technology. Enhanced Privacy for Players One of the reasons why players are moving to alternative payment methods like cryptocurrency transactions is the increase of privacy that they offer. With traditional methods, there is a large amount of personal information that needs to be provided, and this does not happen with cryptocurrency transactions. Transparent Payment Verification Payment verification in the cryptocurrency world is done in a very transparent and straightforward manner, and users are allowed to track it in real time. Traditional methods have more complex verification processes which often lead to delays that are not seen when a cryptocurrency transaction is done. Lower Transaction Costs Last but not least, cryptocurrency transactions are most of the time cheaper than traditional methods of payment. Bank wire transfers and credit card fees are usually a representative amount of the deposited amounts, and the fees related to crypto transactions are nothing in comparison to those. How to Create an Account at a Crypto Casino: Step-by-Step Guide In order to start enjoying crypto casino games you should first create an account at your chosen site. The process for this may vary from site to site, however, in our following titles you will find a general guide that is usually how these casinos work. Step 1: Selecting A Reputable Site First, you will have to decide which one of the casinos mentioned above (or the ones that you research yourself) you will choose to make your deposit. You should base your decision on the types of games offered, bonuses and promotions, methods of payments, or any of the features that we mentioned in our detailed review above. Step 2: Registration Process Once you decide which casino to play at, you should now follow the registration process to be able to start playing. Some sites require identity verification before you are able to make deposits or start gambling, so make sure to complete all the steps required to have your account fully operative. Step 3: Purchasing Cryptocurrency If you don’t hold any cryptocurrency, you should get some so you can deposit into your chosen gambling platform. Some of the crypto casinos mentioned above have the possibility to buy crypto tokens directly at their site using traditional payment methods like credit cards or e-wallets, so this step could be facilitated by it. Step 4: Making Your First Deposit Before you make your first deposit, make sure that you take advantage of the first deposit bonus that usually is offered by crypto casinos. Check if there is any code that you need to use to claim it, or if it will be credited automatically after your first deposit. Step 5: Navigating The Casino and Playing Games You have created your account and you made your first deposit, so all is set for you to start gambling! You should now see the money that you deposited in your balance, and it is now time to start navigating the site to play your favorite games and start making money. Step 6: Withdrawing Your Winnings If you got lucky enough to win some money after a few games, you may wanna withdraw it to spend it somewhere else. Review withdrawal limits and requirements before doing so, to make sure that you won’t face any trouble. If you have any questions, you can always contact the site’s customer support.

Enter Fan Tokens — where blockchain technology meets passion for sports. These are game changers in the way fans interact with their favorite sports teams, granting them exclusive rights, voting power, and many other benefits. What Are Fan Tokens? Fan Tokens are a type of digital currency that is blockchain-powered. They are designed to create more engagement between fans and blockchain and are not like conventional cryptocurrencies. They help bring fans closer to the sports team, club, or individual athletes. They are minted through platforms like Chiliz and Socios and create a unique opportunity for fans to take part in some decisions regarding the club, unlock content, exclusive opportunities, and VIP experiences. Why Are Fan Tokens Gaining Popularity? The power of Fan Tokens is that it converts a passive consumer to an active contributor. For fans, it increases a sense of belonging and decision-making power and reinforces the bond they share with their sports team. For sports organizations, it introduces a new stream of revenue and opens up the possibilities of getting fans to be more engaged and attentive. How Do Fan Tokens Work? Fan Tokens are digital assets fans can buy with crypto on powered exchanges, with the asset stored in a fan’s digital wallet. You can then use Fan Token in several ways, such as participating in polls and earning rewards. They can also be used to unlock exclusive content. Just like any other digital currency, the value of Fan Tokens may go up or down depending on supply and demand. This makes things fun and engaging for fans who think of Fan Tokens as investments. Future of Fan Tokens in Sports As blockchain technology grows, there is a high chance that Fan Tokens will have a major impact. Soon, we might even be able to enter virtual reality to watch a game, buy a collectible, and get exclusive live stream passes. And all we would need to do is use our Fan Tokens. What’s best is that Fan Tokens create new opportunities for fans and teams to connect. They are making sports more interesting, more global, and more rewarding. Get in the Game Fan Token is not just a trend. It is a way for sports fans to engage with sports in the future.

39052346,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=676874,1737035483,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,L’intelligenza artificiale di ChatGPT prevede il prezzo di Ethereum per il 2025,https://www.newsbtc.com/italia/lintelligenza-artificiale-di-chatgpt-prevede-il-prezzo-di-ethereum-per-il-2025/,"La seconda crypto per market cap, Ethereum , è in ripresa insieme al resto del mercato. L’asset ha raggiunto la soglia dei 3.346 dollari, con un guadagno del 4% nelle ultime 24 ore. Dopo mesi di consolidamento, ETH sembra aver trovato un nuovo slancio, alimentando le aspettative degli investitori. I modelli di intelligenza artificiale hanno previsto obiettivi di prezzo ambiziosi per il 2025, prevedendo una forte crescita alimentata da un mix di dinamiche di mercato e dall’ ecosistema di Ethereum. ChatGPT prevede il prezzo di Ethereum per il 2025 Per capire il possibile andamento di Ethereum, abbiamo consultato il modello avanzato ChatGPT-4o di OpenAI. L’intelligenza artificiale ha rilasciato una previsione bullish per l’asset, stimando un obiettivo di 6.000 dollari entro la metà del 2025. Secondo l’AI, Ethereum potrebbe raggiungere anche l’obiettivo di 10.000 dollari entro la fine dell’anno , sempre che l’attuale slancio rialzista persista. I fattori che impattano sull’andamento di Ethereum Il 13 gennaio, gli ETF spot su Ethereum hanno registrato 39,43 milioni di dollari di deflussi netti. Una tendenza che si protrae da quattro giorni, portando a un totale di 354 milioni di dollari fuoriusciti dal mercato. L’intelligenza artificiale ritiene che questi deflussi continui potrebbero riflettere una certa cautela da parte degli investitori istituzionali, probabilmente dovuta alla recente correzione nel mercato crypto. Ma non tutti i fondi hanno registrato dei deflussi. L’ETF di BlackRock , noto con il ticker ETHA , ha registrato un afflusso netto di 12,9 milioni di dollari nello stesso giorno, confermando che l’interesse per Ethereum rimane forte. Inoltre, lo dimostra anche il fatto che Ethereum sia riuscito a superare i 3.150 dollari nonostante i fondi abbiano registrato dei deflussi. Sentiment rialzista nel mercato dei derivati Il mercato dei derivati dipinge un quadro diverso rispetto ai deflussi degli ETF. L’ Open Interest , ovvero il valore complessivo delle posizioni aperte sui contratti derivati, è aumentato del 4,76%, raggiungendo un totale di 29,65 miliardi di dollari. Un dato che indica una maggiore attività e partecipazione da parte degli investitori. Inoltre sull’exchange crypto Binance, il rapporto tra le posizioni long e short, che si attesta a 4,7208, mostra chiaramente una preferenza per le posizioni long. Inoltre, nelle ultime 24 ore sono state liquidate posizioni short per un totale di 39,38 milioni di dollari. I trader ribassisti, costretti a chiudere le loro posizioni in perdita, hanno quindi contribuito a far salire il prezzo dell’asset. ChatGPT interpreta questi fattori come segno di un crescente ottimismo tra i partecipanti al mercato, che bilancia il sentiment ribassista derivante dai deflussi negli ETF Spot su Ethereum. I funding rate di Ethereum tornano a crescere I funding rate, che erano crollati durante la recente correzione del mercato, sono in ripresa mentre Ethereum mantiene un supporto solido nel range tra 2.900 e 3.150 dollari. L’intelligenza artificiale interpreta questa ripresa come un segnale di rinnovato interesse per gli acquisti, con i trader che riaprono le posizioni long , anticipando un possibile rimbalzo. La zona di supporto è diventata un punto chiave sia per i trader a breve termine sia per gli investitori a lungo termine, che vedono in questa fascia un’opportunità strategica per entrare e prepararsi per un possibile nuovo rialzo. A sostenere l’asset nel lungo termine, secondo altri modelli di intelligenza artificiale come Grok 2, è anche il suo ecosistema diversificato, che comprende la posizione dominante di Ethereum nella DeFi, negli NFT e nei Real-World Assets (RWA). Alternative a Ethereum Con la recente ripresa di Ethereum e del resto del segmento delle altcoin, molti investitori stanno considerando anche i nuovi progetti emergenti. Tra questi c’è Mind of Pepe , un progetto innovativo che unisce le tendenze del momento: meme coin e intelligenza artificiale (AI). Mind of Pepe introduce un AI Agent che analizza i dati del mercato in tempo reale, fornendo informazioni strategiche esclusive ai titolari del token $MIND. Inoltre interagisce anche con piattaforme social come X per monitorare le tendenze e influenzare le conversazioni nel settore crypto. Con un modello che unisce analisi del mercato e partecipazione della community, Mind of Pepe sta definendo un nuovo standard nel settore crypto. Il progetto sta riscontrando molto successo. La prevendita è iniziata il 14 gennaio e ha già raccolto più di un milione di dollari.",Italia|ETH|ethereum,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-16 13:51:23

The investigation, according to Politico hinges on halting the rushed approach of the regulator at a critical time in the country. The US Marshals and Bitcoin Sales The Politico report noted that Senator Cynthia Lummis sent a letter to the US Marshals on January 15, making the probe official. Per an except from the letter , the Senator is flagging a number of issues regarding the sale, including the timing during the Presidential transition. The pro-crypto lawmaker also noted that selling Bitcoin directly contradicts the stated objectives of President-elect Donald Trump. Senator Lummis pointed at the plans for a strategic Bitcoin Reserve by the incoming administration. One critical issue she also flagged is the revenue loss as previous sales made the United States lose as much as “$18.5 billion in unrealized value for American taxpayers.” Senator Cynthia Lummis plays a frontline role in the growing shift for pro-crypto policies.

By 2028, SPX may achieve a peak price of $4.73 and an average trading price of $4.44. In 2031, the target price for SPX is between $7.10 and $7.69, with an average price of $7.39. The cryptocurrency SPX6900 (SPX) operates on the Ethereum network. The point to remember here is that the SPX6900 Token is a meme token created for entertainment purposes only in reality, it has no association with any stocks, equities, or securities. There are about 930 million of its 1 billion tokens in circulation. The coin is available for trading on several exchanges, including decentralized ones like Aerodrome and Uniswap V2. Through these platforms, users can buy and sell SPX tokens, possibly making money off of market fluctuations and price volatility. However, it is quite volatile. Its price is impacted by worldwide cryptocurrency trends and market emotion. SPX can also be used to generate interest by spot trading or pledging, while perpetual and ETF/leveraged trading are not recommended for non-professionals because of their high risk. Following its record high of $0.95 earlier in October 2024, SPX has plummeted into a downward trend that has alarmed investors. Signs of deterioration are emerging in the SPX6900 (SPX) meme coin, which raked in millions for early investors. Once a lighthearted homage to the S&P 500, SPX6900 is one of the most popular meme coins of 2024. It started as another worthless token and ended up making millions of dollars. In just one month, the SPX posted a 9,000% return after starting to rise in mid-September. What’s next for the meme token SPX6900 in the remainder of 2025 and beyond?

The lending product isn't completely new: those familiar with playing on Base have long been able to borrow USDC against their bitcoin on Morpho or via other DeFi services. What's new here is the easy access: Coinbase is baking Morpho's borrow books into its own widely popular user interface, removing a critical barrier to entry. ""This is a moment where we're planting a flag that Coinbase is coming on-chain, and we're bringing millions of users with their billions of dollars,"" said Max Branzburg, head of Consumer Products at Coinbase. Personal loans in the on-chain world look fundamentally different from the predominant lending deals offered by banks and lenders. Those stalwarts of the regular economy rely on borrowers' credit score in deciding whether to write a loan, and determining its terms, whether or not the loan is secured. But credit scores are not a thing in crypto. Platforms like Morpho don't need to guesstimate how good for the money their borrowers are. Instead, they require their borrowers to post plenty of collateral; far more, in fact, than the sum they seek to borrow. This setup protects the platforms from carrying bad debt from defaulters. Coinbase's setup caps each borrow at $100,000 in USDC. To borrow that much money customers will need to post more than that amount of bitcoin. Morpho will start liquidating the collateral if the loan-to-value ratio flies too close to the sun. ""If price swings are reaching any sort of dangerous point, we will share liquidation warnings through the Coinbase app so that you're aware of it and can act,"" Branzburg said. Borrowing cash sits at the base of all financial services, but it has extra appeal to crypto traders who often sit on troves of tokens they refuse to sell. Those traders often take loans to farm airdrops and fund other risky trades. In Coinbase's view, Morpho-facilitated loans could help borrowers pursue perhaps nobler enterprises, like buying a car, or paying for a house. Under the hood, the new setup feeds Coinbase flywheel at every step. First, the rollout adds a new capacity to Coinbase's frontend. Second, users who post BTC collateral are minting cbBTC (Coinbase's wrapped bitcoin on Base) and borrowing USDC (Coinbase's stablecoin). Third, all of this is happening on Morpho (a Coinbase-funded lending platform) atop Base (Coinbase's Layer 2 network).",Finance|Coinbase,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|USDC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-16 13:59:50

Announced on Jan. 15, Scott outlined plans to develop a clear and tailored framework for cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, addressing longstanding concerns about regulatory ambiguity in the sector. This shift in focus comes amid broader efforts to promote financial inclusion, economic security, and innovation in the United States . As the committee transitions from its previous leadership under Democrat Sherrod Brown, industry stakeholders are anticipating a recalibrated approach that balances innovation with oversight. US Senate Banking Committee to Prioritize Digital Asset Regulation Under Senator Tim Scott's Leadership The United States Senate Banking Committee is signaling a shift in priorities with Republican Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina at its helm. In a Jan. 15 announcement , Scott, recently elected as the committee’s chair for the 119th Congress, emphasized that developing a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets would be a key focus for the legislative body. This move marks a critical juncture for the cryptocurrency industry, which has long grappled with regulatory uncertainty in the United States. Outlining the committee’s agenda, Senator Scott highlighted the importance of crafting policies aimed at financial inclusion and economic opportunity. Alongside addressing issues like affordable housing and economic national security, digital assets were mentioned as a significant area of focus. “Under Chair Gensler, the SEC refused to provide clarity to the cryptocurrency industry, which has forced projects overseas,” said Scott, referring to the leadership of Gary Gensler at the Securities and Exchange Commission. “Moving forward, the committee will work to build a regulatory framework that establishes a tailored pathway for the trading and custody of digital assets.” This declaration reflects a broader aim to balance innovation in the digital asset space with robust consumer protections, a challenge that has long divided lawmakers and regulators. Scott expressed a willingness to foster an “open-minded environment” for stablecoins and related digital asset products. Stablecoins, digital currencies pegged to traditional assets like the US dollar, have emerged as a focal point of regulatory debates due to their potential to bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems. However, the road ahead may not be without friction. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the committee’s ranking member, has historically been a vocal critic of the cryptocurrency sector and its regulatory gaps, signaling potential partisan challenges in shaping cohesive policy. Senator Scott’s leadership marks a significant transition for the Banking Committee. Former chair Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, had presided over the committee since 2021 but lost his reelection bid to Republican Bernie Moreno in the highly contested 2024 election. Brown’s tenure saw efforts to address stablecoin legislation and increased scrutiny of the cryptocurrency sector, particularly through hearings that evaluated the SEC’s enforcement actions against crypto firms. The committee’s change in leadership is widely viewed as an opportunity for a recalibrated approach to digital asset regulation. While Brown was often cautious about the sector, Scott appears to be positioning the committee to take a more proactive stance in fostering innovation while addressing risks. The 2024 election cycle saw significant cryptocurrency-related funding influencing key races. The cryptocurrency-backed political action committee (PAC) Fairshake reportedly spent over $40 million in media campaigns supporting Moreno’s campaign, making it one of the most expensive congressional races of the cycle. The Cedar Innovation Foundation, an organization aligned with the Blockchain Association and the Stand With Crypto movement, expressed strong support for Scott’s agenda. Colin McLaren, representing Cedar, stated that the group plans to work closely with Scott to advance a comprehensive crypto market structure bill. A Narrow Calendar for Early 2025 Despite the ambitious goals outlined by Scott, the committee’s immediate schedule for 2025 appears sparse. As of Jan. 15, the only event on the calendar is a nomination hearing for the Secretary of the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. This suggests that substantive progress on digital asset regulation may not materialize until later in the legislative session. Senator Scott’s leadership could usher in a new era for cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. Industry stakeholders, particularly those who have felt hampered by the SEC’s regulatory approach under Gensler, are likely to view Scott’s priorities with cautious optimism. However, achieving bipartisan consensus on digital asset policies will be a complex undertaking, given the polarized views within Congress. As the 119th Congress begins, the digital asset industry, lawmakers, and regulators will closely monitor the actions of the Senate Banking Committee. The committee’s decisions could shape the trajectory of the US as a global hub for cryptocurrency innovation—or risk ceding ground to international competitors with more welcoming regulatory environments. Malaysia Explores Crypto Policy to Modernize Financial System and Boost Innovation In related news, Malaysia may soon take significant steps to integrate cryptocurrency into its financial ecosystem, as the government explores the potential of a regulatory framework to modernize the nation’s financial infrastructure. Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim recently emphasized the importance of adopting a cryptocurrency-friendly approach during discussions with officials in Abu Dhabi and Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, according to a report by the New Straits Times . Prime Minister Anwar, speaking at the conclusion of a three-day official visit to Abu Dhabi, outlined Malaysia’s need to adapt quickly to the evolving global financial landscape. He stressed that lagging behind in the era of digital finance would hinder the country’s progress. “This is an evolution which happens quickly and requires us to be equally fast,” Anwar remarked. “We feel that Malaysia should not be left behind while mired in an old financial system. This will be a radical departure from the old ways.” Discussions with Abu Dhabi leadership and Binance’s Changpeng Zhao signal Malaysia’s intent to draw insights and expertise from global leaders in digital finance. Anwar emphasized that collaboration with countries like the United Arab Emirates could aid Malaysia in formulating a balanced and forward-looking crypto regulatory framework. “We need to discuss this in detail, leave behind the old business model, and give meaning to this digital finance policy,” Anwar said. The Prime Minister acknowledged that implementing such a policy would require comprehensive studies by various Malaysian authorities, including the Treasury, the Securities Commission, and Bank Negara Malaysia. Building Competence and Confidence The adoption of a cryptocurrency framework would not be without hurdles. Anwar highlighted the importance of addressing concerns through personnel training, competency development, and engagement with key industry players. These efforts, he noted, would ensure that Malaysia transitions smoothly into a digital-first financial model. “As with all new ideas raised, there will be some concerns. We have to train our personnel, develop competency, and get the players to participate,” he added. The push for crypto-friendly regulation comes amid heightened scrutiny of the digital asset sector by Malaysia’s Securities Commission (SC). In December 2024, the SC ordered crypto exchange Bybit to cease operations in the country, citing the lack of registration for running a digital asset exchange. The regulator also added the crypto wallet service Atomic Wallet and several other major platforms, including Paxful, KuCoin, and MEXC, to its investor alert list. These actions shed light on the challenges Malaysia faces as it seeks to balance fostering innovation with protecting investors and ensuring compliance. The Prime Minister’s initiative could signal a shift from a predominantly restrictive stance to a more collaborative regulatory environment. The proposed cryptocurrency policy aligns with Malaysia’s broader ambitions to modernize its economy and strengthen its position in the global financial ecosystem. By adopting a forward-looking regulatory framework, Malaysia could position itself as a hub for digital finance in Southeast Asia, attracting investments and fostering innovation in blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. Prime Minister Anwar’s commitment to a “radical departure from the old ways” signals a pivotal moment for the country’s financial future. As discussions unfold and studies commence, Malaysia’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation could serve as a model for other nations navigating the complexities of digital finance.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-16 14:00:00

I’ve reduced my crypto exposure, locking in profits, and will further reduce holdings as Bitcoin nears $125K to manage risk. A potential bearish phase could follow this bullish cycle, possibly leading to a prolonged period of limited progress for Bitcoin. Despite bullish news, markets often top when optimism peaks; I urge caution and recommend taking profits as Bitcoin reaches key levels. Catching Up It has been more than four months since I have been able to write an article. What started as a fun and busy late summer traveling precipitated into a challenging late 2024 working through a health scare with one of my family members. In the meantime, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) jumped out of its summer doldrums, after a brief breach of my key $50,600, into an unstoppable march toward my long-term target zone. I did have time to visit Rena Sherbill at the Seeking Alpha Podcast to discuss my concerns that Bitcoin breached $50,600. In that conversation, I was giving Bitcoin a chance since the breach was brief, lasting roughly 15 minutes. Early in November, I was invited to sit down via Zoom with Julie Morgan of Seeking Alpha and fellow analyst Florian Grommes at Seeking Alpha's Election 2024 Investment Forum . By then it was clear that my caution was no longer warranted and that Bitcoin was on the path to a breakout in November. Now that I have some time to write, I wanted to catch you up on how I see Bitcoin pulling into a price region I have been looking for since 2021. Current Price Action First of all, I want to explain how important the region between $125K and $195K is in Bitcoin's price history. Elliott Wave analysts look for price structures to culminate at the confluence of Fibonacci levels. Those levels are derived from targets of multiple degrees. Confluence across degrees gives us high probability zones for price to either top or bottom. In the current situation, I am watching for a major top, one that may usher in one of the most difficult periods in Bitcoin's history. I see four degrees of confluence between $125K and $195K: The 1.382 extension of Bitcoin's waves one and two is at $146K. That is based on Bitcoin's long-term, monthly chart, for which I am watching three alternatives. However, in all my alternatives, the zone just above $125K is a key target zone. After Bitcoin completes a third and fourth wave, Bitcoin tends to top between the 1.236 to 1.386 extension of the third. Tracking the five-wave rally that started at the 2018 low, my target zone is $125K to $195K. That target is generated by the third wave that occurred from 2020 to 2021. The 2.0 extension of the first and second wave formed off the 2023 low targets of $95K. The 2.0 extension is the base case for a typical fifth wave. This is slightly shy of our target zone; however, that target has been pierced without the 2023-24 rally showing completion. So, there is more to go. In the attached monthly chart, I use the black arrows to point out the important structures that led to this target. The blue arrows point the way to the target. I can point out a couple more structures that point here, but these are the most important. BTC Monthly (TradingView) Finally, as of writing, we are watching a fourth wave forming into the $80K region. Provided that the fourth holds $69K, the length of the third wave suggests the fifth will place Bitcoin in the $125K region. Should this fourth hold, we will have another level of confluence. Interestingly, the waves one and two set up for the move out of the $50Ks did not portend Bitcoin hitting $125K. However, the third wave extended to correct this potential miss. This is a common experience I have as an Elliottician - larger wave targets pull smaller degree waves like magnets. Less Prediction Than a Basis for Sound Tactics Before we dive into what a top means, do not believe I have pulled out my crystal ball and have called the top before it happens. I consider 'prediction' a very tainted word in markets. Elliott Wave Theory has both quantitative and qualitative means of interpretation. The quantitative measures are hard rules, limiting potential expectations in markets most would consider random. The qualitative aspects are interpreted through experience. If you have followed my writings over the last six years, you know I have made some prescient calls at major turns - although the market sometimes stretched a bit past my targets or broke supports I deemed critical. The fact that I have given any key levels ahead of time should be surprising. An example was calling for a bottom in 2018 at $3K. So that we don't live and die on attempts to predict the market, we have to watch how the market reacts at a key level before acting. In this situation, that would come in the form of a bearish impulse down through support. As mentioned above, the first relevant level of support is $69K. As the market climbs, it will be able to offer more critical support levels above $69K. I can also consider there is a means for this bull market to extend, so long as it stays above $52,500. I show that possibility in the red count below. Astute traders will immediately see the problem. It takes a big drop in price to confirm that the current bull cycle is over. This means that one would give up a great gain, taking a chance that the bull market continues. This calls for sound tactics. I have been reducing my overall exposure to the crypto market as it has reached these heights, locking in much profit. And I am playing this last fifth wave with a smaller size than the previous waves. By the time we hit $125K, I will be down to my long-term Bitcoin holdings, which I try to keep at 10% of my net worth. That level is also 'free' by way of being built by profit-taking in each cycle. As Bitcoin comes down and teases the potential of reversal over support levels, I can take some new longs. But once Bitcoin breaks $52,500, I will hunker down for the long winter. BTC, Daily (MotiveWave Software) What is Next? As stated above, I believe the next phase after this bullish cycle will be the most difficult in Bitcoin's history. In Elliott Wave speak, it is likely to be Bitcoin's primary fourth wave. Until now, Bitcoin has never had more than one bearish yearly candle in a row. And, after a bearish year, Bitcoin has always broken to new all-time highs within two years. I expect either or both of those conditions to end in this period. Wave fours in most asset classes are extended sideways movements that range between support for the pertinent degree and all-time highs. More or less, I see Bitcoin presenting bear market drops similar to previous bearish years and the intense multi-x rallies Bitcoin is known for. However, in aggregate, Bitcoin should make little progress over 5 to 10 years. That timeframe is an educated guess. However, the size of this wave four can dip as low as $10K. And it may drop as low as $3K, though I see the probability of that as low. While I expect Bitcoin to eventually emerge from this challenging period and start a multi-decade march toward $1M and $3M, patience will be tried and rewarded if my perspective proves true. A Bullish Narrative I am aware that I left material that will stir criticism from both Bitcoin's biggest detractors and its biggest fans. I am more than used to the arguments of Bitcoin's critics. My articles have repeatedly sparked criticism over the years, critiques that come straight out of standard scripts available across the internet. Most of the time they are not well-reasoned. However, I believe this article is likely more offensive to Bitcoin's most ardent bulls. Particularly, Bitcoin owners in America hail the coming of Bitcoin's most supportive administration and the end of a congress and SEC that attacked Bitcoin. The SEC didn't regulate Bitcoin. Rather, the SEC, supported by some in Congress, threw lawsuits at the industry with abandon and, according to the claims of the industry, closed the door to civil discussion. I celebrate this change, but I do not expect it to unduly extend this bull market. To those who are more bullish than they were one or two years ago, please consider a few points: Markets often top on the best of news, and bottom on the worst: Bitcoin topped in 2018 as the first regulated industry product entered the market: Bitcoin futures. Bitcoin topped in 2021 as the first ETF, albeit holding futures, launched in the US. When El Salvador became the first company to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender and put it in their reserves, Bitcoin dropped another 30% before it found a bull market low. Bitcoin even went down briefly after the spot ETFs launched in January last year. It was just temporary, but many thought that drop was surprising. Bitcoin bottomed in 2018 when it dropped below mining costs, sending droves of miners into bankruptcy, and supposedly threatening the network. Bitcoin found a bottom in 2022 after the FTX exchange failed. Shortly thereafter, Silicon Valley Bank, a crypto-exposed bank, failed. That was expected to drive the masses away from crypto for years, yet a two-year, 500% rally began. The truth is that markets top when everyone who will buy has bought. The market then has to come down to find buyers, even before real selling has started. The same happens at the bottoms. Sellers exhaust themselves selling, often because something in the headlines provokes fear. Then the market rises as there is no one left to sell. I can expound much more on the mechanics of bullish and bearish cycles. I can also wax lyrical about how Bitcoin is a global asset. Despite the US being one of the world's economic superpowers, the Bitcoin market is steered by the masses that trade it 24/7 in all corners of the world. No market - whether stocks, bonds, or metals - is as decentralized as the crypto market. Understanding when Bitcoin will top or bottom, requires a global view of mass sentiment. I did not intend this article to become a detailed view of how events echo market action rather than drive them. I simply want to urge you to deeply consider any mindset that prevents you from taking any profit out of Bitcoin as it comes into the key levels I expressed. I can be wrong in my expectations. However, an inflexible mindset can prevent good trading and investment decisions. Openly look at price action at these levels and let the market be the guide, not the headlines. Conclusion As I shared, the Bitcoin market is entering a price zone I have been looking for many years. If there is one way I have been wrong, it is that I didn't believe it would take this long. While I am not a fortune-teller who knows ahead of time that Bitcoin will top between $125K to $195K, my work finds this area worth attention. And tactically speaking, it is compelling enough for me to take some risk off. I have taken my Bitcoin holdings down to a level I can be comfortable with, whether the market is turbulent or continues to march higher. If the market does respond to these levels, turn, and break the supports that I have laid out above, I will know that this warning is prescient. There will be more opportunities down the road, but not until Bitcoin has tried its holders, perhaps for many years.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-16 14:00:00

Supernova Core will address performance and scalability issues associated with CometBFT while promoting decentralization within the Cosmos ecosystem. At the heart of the framework are the HotStuff consensus protocol and Boneh–Lynn–Shacham (BLS) signature aggregation, which allow blockchain developers to leverage new solutions without leaving already familiar frameworks. The core has been tested on the Meter mainnet, which supports a network of more than 300 validators and manages nearly eight million daily transactions. Addressing Cosmos SDK issues Cosmos SDK-based blockchains face ongoing scaling challenges, for example, bottlenecks caused by the growing number of validators. In turn, the bottleneck limits throughput, while restricted support for Ethereum ( ETH ) Virtual Machine (EVM) functionality limits cross-chain collaboration. Supernova Core directly addresses these issues by offering an optimized communication layer, enhanced message efficiency, and full EVM compatibility. Xiaohan Zhu, Co-Founder of Meter, highlighted the transformative potential of Supernova Core, stating: “With Supernova Core, we are empowering the community to overcome the limitations of existing Cosmos SDK consensus mechanisms. By introducing innovations like BLS signature aggregation, more efficient network communication layer and the latest advancements in consensus protocols, Supernova Core enables developers to reach new heights of scalability and performance.” — Xiaohan Zhu Meter EVM compatibility Supernova Core is designed to reduce communication overhead and enable networks to scale beyond 150 validators. Its layered peer-to-peer ( P2P ) network architecture ensures efficient message delivery, while the HotStuff-based consensus mechanism ensures swift transactions and linear communication overhead scalability. The framework’s architecture also separates transaction ordering from state processing to enable advanced Layer-2 solutions and promote censorship resistance. Future updates include parallel EVM execution capabilities as well as an optimized database tailored for Ethereum-inspired key-value access patterns.

This recovery reflects renewed buying interest and growing optimism among traders as SOL bounces back from recent consolidation. Drawing closer to $209, SOL is seeing increased trading activity, underscoring heightened confidence in the asset’s potential for further upside. However, the journey to $209 presents challenges as resistance levels and possible profit-taking could temper the pace of the rally. Maintaining this upward trajectory will require sustained buying pressure and strong market support. With Bulls leading the charge, Solana’s performance at the $209 level might be a defining moment. A successful breakout would confirm the recovery and open the door for more gains, reinforcing bullish sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency. Technical Indicators Signal Renewed Buying Pressure Several technical indicators are pointing to renewed buying pressure for Solana, suggesting that bulls are regaining control of the market. A key signal comes from the altcoin’s recent move above the 4-hour SMA, a widely regarded indicator of short-term momentum. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Back Above $200: Will It Hold or Fade? This breakout often reflects a shift in sentiment, with buyers gaining strength and setting the stage for possible upside. The 4-hour SMA now serves as a critical support level, reinforcing confidence in the bullish trend as long as the price remains above it. Adding to this optimism is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which has surged above the 50% neutral mark and is steadily climbing. The RSI’s position in bullish territory indicates that buying activity is outpacing selling pressure as traders are increasingly confident in SOL’s ability to sustain upward movement. If the RSI continues to rise but remains below overbought levels, it could create room for further growth without immediate risk of a reversal. With the 4-hour SMA and RSI painting a positive technical picture for Solana, its rally might extend toward higher resistance levels. However, keeping a close eye on these indicators for signs of exhaustion is important since any dips below the 4-hour SMA or an RSI overextension may hint at a potential pullback. For now, the market remains optimistic as technical signals align in favor of the bulls. Resistance At $209: A Make-Or-Break Moment For Solana The $209 resistance level is a decisive point, marking a key moment in SOL’s upward journey. A breakout above this level would validate the uptrend and pave the way for additional gains. Surpassing $209 may cause Solana’s upward momentum to extend to test higher resistance levels such as $240 and $260. Related Reading: Solana Reclaims Key Levels Amid Market Volatility – Reclaim $210 And New Highs Are Next However, if Solana fails to break through the $209 level, it could result in a pullback, with the price potentially testing lower support levels like $194 and $164. This might lead to a phase of consolidation, where the market re-evaluates its next move before attempting another rally.

To read full editions, subscribe . Crypto is a creature of extremes. Look no further than the major narratives right now. AI agents and memecoins are almost completely virtual. DePIN, meanwhile, derives practically its entire value proposition from very physical networks of hardware. In the real world. So, you can’t fault Helium — the decentralized wireless carrier powered by Solana — for teaming up with DAWN to expand both their networks, together. The pair have struck a partnership to allow Helium hotspot operators to serve DAWN broadband internet, and vice versa, to create “the world’s first fully decentralized last-mile internet solution.” Like how Helium is shooting to disrupt centralized telecoms, DAWN is pushing to change our relationship with traditional ISPs , allowing regular users to both own the infrastructure and be rewarded in crypto for providing wireless broadband to anyone in range. “The conversation started with a strong alignment on the mission of decentralizing internet access,” a Helium spokesperson told me. “We’re moving toward making connectivity owned by the many and accessible to everyone.” It means that the Helium Network will automatically grow by 8,000 nodes that already serve the DAWN ecosystem, according to a press release. A Helium Foundation dashboard meanwhile points to more than 25,000 mobile hotspots onboarded since last April, which hypothetically could serve DAWN broadband once the functionality is rolled out, although it’s not immediately clear how many are currently active. Helium’s HNT is still working on reclaiming highs from the last cycle. DAWN, which has an active points program, is yet to confirm a token launch The spokesperson said that there’s no equity or investment deal as part of the partnership. Still, it all suggests a certain coalescence in the DePIN space. Like how GPUs and ASIC mining rigs can be used to mine a number of different cryptocurrencies — switching between them based on profitability — we could be headed for a world where DePIN devices in our homes can be pointed to all sorts of different use cases depending on demand. It might mean additional income for the household without the often extreme overheads related to proof-of-work mining, although how much would be largely dependent on token prices and whatnot. Helium users are spending ~$6,000 HNT per week right now, up from under $3,000 in January 2024 What’s interesting is that had this partnership not been made, eventually Helium and DAWN would’ve been considered competitors. But not really anymore. Wouldn’t that make Elon Musk’s Starlink the biggest rival to the Helium-DAWN partnership, outside of the traditional carriers? “Starlink is disrupting the connectivity industry in ways that were unimaginable just a few years ago,” the Helium spokesperson said. “Several Helium deployments use Starlink as an internet backhaul in the US and Mexico.” The team has also developed a connectivity kit that combines Starlink with Helium Hotspots, to better serve phones in areas without cell coverage. In any case, the Helium-DAWN partnership makes total sense, especially considering the latter is expected to airdrop a token to early adopters at some point. After all, when it comes to incentivizing people to set up physical devices in their homes, two token flywheels must be better than one.

This impressive recovery is due to Bitcoin’s climb to revisit the historic $100,000 level. Despite the bounce, ETH is down No data found for ethereum on 4 seconds ago after No data found for ethereum on 4 seconds ago% in the last 24 hours as of January 16. Ethereum (ETH) price continues to hover around the $3,300 region after a quick recovery rally from the January 13 low of $2,900. eth price today *Ethereum price updated as of No data found for ethereum on 4 seconds ago. Can Ethereum (ETH) Price Bounce Amid $900M Buying Spree? Sanitment’s on-chain data shows that addresses holding between 1K and 10 K ETH increased their stack from 14.17 million to 14.44 million since January 7. Considering the current price of ETH , the 270,000 tokens accumulated by this cohort are valued at nearly $900 million. Such a massive accumulation in a short period indicates demand. Hence, the recent rally will likely continue in the long run regardless of short-term volatility. Ethereum Whales Accumulate $900 million ETH Falling Wedge Setup Forecasts Bullish Outlook Since December 16, Ethereum (ETH) has set up three distinctive lower highs and two lower lows. Connecting a trendline to the swing points shows a Falling Wedge setup. This technical formation forecasts a 17% price rally that targets $4,000. The target is obtained by measuring the distance between the first swing high and low and adding it to the breakout point. ETH/USDT 1-day chart Strategic Support & Take-Profit Levels For ETH Traders In this case, Ethereum will likely continue its descent toward the support zone, extending from $3,132 to $3,057. This zone is a good place to scoop more ETH. For short sellers, this area will be a good place to book profits. Hence, a dip into the $3,132 to $3,057 zone will lead to a massive spike in buying pressure from sidelined investors accumulating more ETH and short sellers closing their positions. As a result, ETH will trigger a volatile move to the upside that retests the upper limit of the Falling Wedge. A decisive daily candlestick close above the Wedge’s upper trend line around $3,400 will confirm a breakout from the setup. In such a case, the key targets for short-term investors to book profits include $3,592, $3,975 and $4,069. Invalidation Thesis While the outlook for Ethereum looks bullish from a big-picture perspective, investors need to consider the possibility of a bearish outlook. Investors need to watch the $3,132 & $3,057 support levels. A breakdown of this zone will signal a weakness from buyers and potentially kickstart a steep 13% correction to $2,657. Beyond this ETH could also revisit the $2,341 barrier if the selling pressure is too high.

But They Have a Big Warning!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/analysts-say-bitcoin-btc-is-waiting-on-trump-for-rally-but-they-have-a-big-warning/,"Bitcoin surpassed $100,000 in the last 24 hours. However, this was short-lived and BTC fell back to $99,000. While the US inflation data announced yesterday was shown as the reason for the rise in Bitcoin, analysts said they expect the BTC price to rise further as Trump's inauguration ceremony approaches. US President-elect Donald Trump’s upcoming inauguration sets the stage for strong gains in both stocks and cryptocurrencies, according to 21Shares crypto analyst Matt Mena. Mena emphasized that falling inflation and pro-growth policy expectations create a favorable environment for new highs in cryptocurrencies. “December inflation data suggests the last major macroeconomic barrier holding Bitcoin below $100,000 has disappeared. The easing of inflation fears could pave the way for Bitcoin to break through the $100,000 resistance level before Trump takes office, data shows. Such a milestone would be significant not only psychologically but also technically, allowing Bitcoin to surpass its $108,000 ATH and reach new records. Trump’s documented support for pro-growth policies and track record of supporting asset price appreciation further strengthens the bullish outlook for Bitcoin and risk assets in general.” Volatility May Be Seen in Bitcoin and Altcoins Next Week! Paul Howard, senior manager of cryptocurrency company Wincent, said that he expects more upside in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, and that the expected news about crypto sector regulation, favorable banking rules and the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve are not yet fully priced in. “With the change of administration in the US, we expect much more volatility next week. We expect to see 10% volatility up and down in Bitcoin and altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP. *This is not investment advice.

(TSMC) will miss President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration, which is expected to be attended by prominent tech sector figures. According to the firm’s Chief Executive Officer, CC Wei they will not make a donation either since the world’s largest chipmaker prefers to maintain a low profile. Tech industry leaders show support for Trump’s inauguration As Donald Trump prepares for his second term in the White House, prominent figures have publicly expressed their support for him, even through financial contributions. According to Axios , Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, is now on that list. Cook reportedly gave $1 million to Donald Trump’s inauguration committee. He’s hardly the only prominent tech figure to do this. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg have also contributed money, as tech company executives compete to win over the incoming government. The Monday inauguration is expected to draw leaders throughout the tech industry, including Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook, Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos, and Tesla’s Elon Musk. TSMC addresses US-China tensions and AI growth amid new chip restrictions Wei’s decision aligns with intensifying US restrictions aimed at curbing the flow of advanced chips to China. The outgoing administration of President Joe Biden recently introduced a new framework for the export of advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence. They noted that this is an attempt to balance national security concerns about the technology with the economic interests of producers and other countries. Several firms, including Nvidia, have criticized these restrictions. They believe that the decision, which was hastily implemented in the final days of the outgoing administration, would harm American innovation. Wei’s comments came as TSMC boosted market sentiment with a better-than-expected forecast for revenue and capital expenditures in 2025. This strong performance reinforced optimism surrounding an unprecedented AI spending cycle, which propelled companies like Nvidia to record-breaking levels. The rise of ChatGPT has driven rapid data center expansion over the past two years, benefiting hardware providers in the AI sector. Still, the lack of any big profit-generating AI applications so far has stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains around the world. Wei sounded unconcerned about how the limits would affect TSMC’s operations. He noted that the effects of the restrictions appeared “manageable” and would not affect chips used in non-AI sectors such as automotive and crypto-mining. He said: “ We have communicated with the US government. We understand from that communication that what they care about most is AI and that they view automotive, consumer electronics and other applications as normal business.

A milestone was reached as 30% of Ethereum’s network validators supported raising the gas limit above 30 million. According to data from Ethereum Toni Wahrstätter, this adjustment doesn’t necessitate a hard fork. Instead, validators can easily raise the gas limit when proposing blocks by modifying their node settings. Benefits of Higher Block Gas Limit Meanwhile, raising the gas limit on the Ethereum public ledger would see transaction fees slatched by about 15% to 33%. This would accommodate more transactions per block, distribute computational load, and lower user charges. With the current level at 30 million, the block gas limit will automatically increase once over 50% of validators consent. The limit will increase from 30 million to the next agreed-upon limit, aiming for 40 million units. Notably, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin previously recommended a 33% hike. Additionally, raising the gas limits serves developers better as the current limit hinders deploying high-demand applications. Some applications cannot be launched under the current gas limit, as viral adoption would trigger a gas price surge, severely impacting user experience. The higher limit aligns with Ethereum’s scaling vision. As Ethereum transactions rise, the increased gas limit helps regulate demand and ease transaction rates. Decentralized applications, smart contracts, and everyday Ethereum users will also benefit from this update. Ethereum’s Validators Worry about Network’s Security Meanwhile, as the Ethereum community considers raising gas limits, some members urge caution, citing potential stability and security risks. Ethereum Foundation’s Toni Wahrstätter and the “Pump The Gas” website acknowledge these concerns, emphasizing Ethereum’s core goal of maintaining decentralization. Rapidly increasing gas limits could have unintended effects, affecting more than storage and bandwidth. Ethereum validators’ growing support for a gas limit increase shows the network’s ability to adapt to user demands. With 30% on board, the community is preparing for a potential change to boost transaction capacity, while ensuring long-term sustainability. Ethereum’s Upgrade Fuels Market Optimism for 2025 The Ethereum network has undergone a transformative upgrade , dubbed “Serenity,” which significantly enhances scalability, security, and sustainability. This major milestone reduces energy consumption transitioning to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Furthermore, the upcoming Pectra upgrade, slated for early 2025, aims to establish its dominance in decentralized finance and smart contracts. Ethereum’s price could reach $12,000 by 2025, driven by key technological advancements from the upgrade and government influences. The upgrade also unlocks faster transaction processing, lower fees, and advanced smart contract functionalities, driving strong market enthusiasm. As a result, Ethereum reinforces its leadership in blockchain innovation.

Backed by a vibrant community and a robust utility-driven ecosystem, PEPETO continues to garner attention from investors seeking high-growth opportunities. PEPETO Presale Crosses $3.6 Million—The Next Big Thing in Crypto? The spotlight may be on BlackRock’s institutional product, but PEPETO’s presale success now owns the show.

As of January 10, the ETF managed net assets worth $701,338 with approximately 25,000 units outstanding. Despite its innovative appeal, critics argue that traditional investment products like ETFs lack the explosive growth potential that tokens like PEPETO offer during their early stages.

PEPETO stands out with zero-fee trading on PepetoSwap, offering a cost-free trading experience.

Multiple positive factors have driven XRP's price to soar, and analysts are optimistic about its prospects, predicting a potential breakthrough of the $5 milestone. In this regard, BYDFi has consistently retained its position as the go-to trading platform for XRP investors, thanks to its robust user base and superior trading matching system. SEC’s Appeal Fails to Shake Ripple’s Confidence On January 15, 2025, the SEC formally filed an appeal with the Second Circuit Court to overturn Judge Analisa Torres' July 2023 ruling. The SEC argues that Ripple's sale of XRP to retail investors qualifies as an unregistered securities offering. Using the Howey Test, the SEC claims Ripple's promotional activities created profit expectations, thus constituting an investment contract. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty responded: ""As expected, the SEC’s appeal brief is a rehash of already failed arguments –and likely to be abandoned by the next administration. We’ll respond formally in due time. For now, know this: the SEC’s lawsuit is just noise. A new era of pro-innovation regulation is coming, and Ripple is thriving."" This legal battle, ongoing since December 2020, remains one of the most closely followed developments in the crypto industry. XRP’s Technical and Sentiment Synergy Drives a Bullish Outlook Despite the SEC’s appeal, XRP's market performance has remained unshaken, exhibiting a strong bullish trend. As of now, XRP is priced at $3.2657, marking a 7-year high. Its 24-hour trading volume has surged to nearly $25 billion, with a total market capitalization of $187.485 billion, surpassing USDT and ranking third globally among cryptocurrencies. Technical analysis indicates that XRP has broken past key resistance levels, with bulls firmly in control. In a favorable macroeconomic environment, XRP is expected to challenge the $5 target in the near term. Global Search Trends and Whale Activity Boost XRP Confidence XRP's global search popularity has surpassed Bitcoin on Google, reflecting heightened market interest. This suggests investors may be shifting capital from Bitcoin to XRP, further fueling optimism. Data from analytics firm Santiment shows a continuous increase in whale interest in XRP. Since November 12, addresses holding 1 to 10 million XRP have added 1.4 billion tokens, worth over $3.8 billion. Even during price consolidations following early 2024 highs, whales maintained their accumulation behavior signaling that XRP's appeal to institutional and large-scale investors is steadily increasing.

Multiple positive factors have driven XRP’s price to soar, and analysts are optimistic about its prospects, predicting a potential breakthrough of the $5 milestone. In this regard, BYDFi has consistently retained its position as the go-to trading platform for XRP investors, thanks to its robust user base and superior trading matching system. SEC’s Appeal Fails to Shake Ripple’s Confidence On January 15, 2025, the SEC formally filed an appeal with the Second Circuit Court to overturn Judge Analisa Torres’ July 2023 ruling. The SEC argues that Ripple’s sale of XRP to retail investors qualifies as an unregistered securities offering. Using the Howey Test, the SEC claims Ripple’s promotional activities created profit expectations, thus constituting an investment contract. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty responded: “As expected, the SEC’s appeal brief is a rehash of already failed arguments –and likely to be abandoned by the next administration. We’ll respond formally in due time. For now, know this: the SEC’s lawsuit is just noise. A new era of pro-innovation regulation is coming, and Ripple is thriving.” This legal battle, ongoing since December 2020, remains one of the most closely followed developments in the crypto industry. XRP’s Technical and Sentiment Synergy Drives a Bullish Outlook Despite the SEC’s appeal, XRP’s market performance has remained unshaken, exhibiting a strong bullish trend. As of now, XRP is priced at $3.2657, marking a 7-year high. Its 24-hour trading volume has surged to nearly $25 billion, with a total market capitalization of $187.485 billion, surpassing USDT and ranking third globally among cryptocurrencies. Technical analysis indicates that XRP has broken past key resistance levels, with bulls firmly in control. In a favorable macroeconomic environment, XRP is expected to challenge the $5 target in the near term. Global Search Trends and Whale Activity Boost XRP Confidence XRP’s global search popularity has surpassed Bitcoin on Google, reflecting heightened market interest. This suggests investors may be shifting capital from Bitcoin to XRP, further fueling optimism. Data from analytics firm Santiment shows a continuous increase in whale interest in XRP. Since November 12, addresses holding 1 to 10 million XRP have added 1.4 billion tokens, worth over $3.8 billion. Even during price consolidations following early 2024 highs, whales maintained their accumulation behavior signaling that XRP’s appeal to institutional and large-scale investors is steadily increasing. XRP’s strong performance is not only attributed to positive legal developments but also its expanding ecosystem. The potential approval of an XRP spot ETF is a core driver of market optimism. According to a JPMorgan report, an approved ETF could attract $4 billion to $8 billion in net new assets.

Cardano ( ADA ) climbed to $1.10, its highest level since Jan. 7, and is now 43% above its lowest level in December. The cryptocurrency’s market cap currently stands at $35 billion. There are three main reasons why the coin may jump by 50% soon. Cardano potential ecosystem growth ADA has continued to trail popular coins like Sui and Solana due to its relatively weak ecosystem. Cardano currently has only 34 decentralized finance applications, with a total value locked of $553 million . Minswap, the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) in Cardano’s ecosystem, processes less than $10 million in daily volume. In comparison, Solana’s Raydium handles over $2 billion daily. However, Cardano’s ecosystem could see substantial growth this year, supported by the upcoming BitcoinOS integration and Midnight ZK launch. Integrating with Bitcoin could unlock over $1 trillion in assets for Cardano. Meanwhile, Midnight, a zero-knowledge scaling platform, may attract more developers to the ecosystem. Additionally, Cardano could benefit from the rise of meme coin creators, which could increase transaction volume and overall activity within its ecosystem.

Polymarket traders anticipate that the SEC will approve several Ripple ( XRP ) and Solana ( SOL ) ETFs. JPMorgan analysts anticipate billions of dollars in inflows to these funds. If these ETF approvals go through, there is a possibility that an ADA ETF could also be approved. Cardano, being an American crypto project with a market cap exceeding $35 billion, could benefit from such approval. An ADA ETF would likely attract more institutional capital and drive its price higher. Cardano price has strong technicals ADA price chart | Source: crypto.news Finally, ADA’s technical indicators suggest that its price could rise significantly during the ongoing crypto bull run. The daily chart reveals that Cardano has formed a bullish flag chart pattern, consisting of a long flagpole and a rectangle consolidation. Such patterns often result in strong bullish breakouts, as demonstrated recently with XRP, which formed a bullish pennant. Cardano has also developed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a popular bullish reversal pattern. Furthermore, it has formed a break-and-retest pattern, revisiting $0.810, its highest point in March last year. The cryptocurrency is also supported by the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, while the MVRV remains at 2.5. The MVRV indicator is commonly used to assess whether an asset is undervalued or overvalued. An MVRV score of 3.5 indicates that the asset is still undervalued. As a result, ADA’s price could jump 50% from its current level to reach $1.60. This price aligns with the 50% retracement level on the weekly chart.

Younger generations are no longer content with one-size-fits-all pension systems. They’re looking for modern solutions that give them more control, flexibility and transparency. Chen added that the rise of crypto pensions is part of a larger financial revolution. Emphasizing the significance of evolving financial mindsets, Chen posited, “Young people are reshaping the way we think about money.” Crypto Funds Gaining Traction Amid Bitcoin Rally The younger people’s affinity towards crypto pensions was revealed amidst increasing digital asset acceptance among conservative investors. Triggered by the recent Bitcoin surge past $100k, pension funds have shown a greater interest in crypto investments. Experts believe that the pension industry could see a faster development with cryptocurrency and Bitcoin investments.

The settlement resolves allegations that Abra violated federal securities laws by failing to register its retail crypto lending product, Abra Earn, and by operating as an unregistered investment company. As part of the agreement, Abra has consented to pay a $1.65 million civil penalty and comply with a permanent injunction imposed by the SEC . Although Abra settled the case without admitting or denying the allegations, the SEC emphasized that the enforcement action underscores its commitment to protecting investors in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

According to the SEC, Abra marketed the program as a secure investment and, at its peak, managed over $600 million in assets—nearly $500 million of which came from U.S. investors. Additionally, the company held more than 40% of its assets in investment securities, in violation of the Investment Company Act. The SEC’s settlement with Abra comes amid heightened scrutiny of crypto lending platforms. In August 2024, the New Jersey Attorney General required Abra to return remaining cryptocurrency assets to investors and issue refunds as part of a multistate investigation. This case mirrors other SEC actions, including its February 2024 settlement with Genesis Global Capital over its Gemini Earn program. The SEC continues to target firms that fail to comply with registration and disclosure requirements, emphasizing the risks posed by unregistered securities in the crypto sector.

The altcoin performed so well amid legal issues with the SEC. Analysts predict more price discoveries for XRP in the current bull run . XRP has outperformed Bitcoin over three and five-year periods, delivering impressive returns despite ongoing legal challenges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Renowned crypto lawyer Bill Morgan recently highlighted XRP’s standout performance, emphasizing its resilience amid prolonged scrutiny. It is extraordinary after 4 years of litigation involving the SEC and the largest holder of XRP with the biggest project that uses the XRPL, that XRP has now outperformed Bitcoin, the only token with a complete regulatory free pass from the SEC over 3 and 5 years as of today. pic.twitter.com/VNGVhiVKBT — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) January 16, 2025 In a post on X, Morgan revealed that XRP outperformed Bitcoin by 72.86% over three years and by 16.68% over five years.

Multiple positive factors have driven XRP’s price to soar, and analysts are optimistic about its prospects, predicting a potential breakthrough of the $5 milestone. In this regard, BYDFi has consistently retained its position as the go-to trading platform for XRP investors, thanks to its robust user base and superior trading matching system. SEC’s Appeal Fails to Shake Ripple’s Confidence On January 15, 2025, the SEC formally filed an appeal with the Second Circuit Court to overturn Judge Analisa Torres’ July 2023 ruling. The SEC argues that Ripple’s sale of XRP to retail investors qualifies as an unregistered securities offering. Using the Howey Test, the SEC claims Ripple’s promotional activities created profit expectations, thus constituting an investment contract. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty responded: “As expected, the SEC’s appeal brief is a rehash of already failed arguments –and likely to be abandoned by the next administration. We’ll respond formally in due time. For now, know this: the SEC’s lawsuit is just noise. A new era of pro-innovation regulation is coming, and Ripple is thriving.” This legal battle, ongoing since December 2020, remains one of the most closely followed developments in the crypto industry. XRP’s Technical and Sentiment Synergy Drives a Bullish Outlook Despite the SEC’s appeal, XRP’s market performance has remained unshaken, exhibiting a strong bullish trend. As of now, XRP is priced at $3.2657, marking a 7-year high. Its 24-hour trading volume has surged to nearly $25 billion, with a total market capitalization of $187.485 billion, surpassing USDT and ranking third globally among cryptocurrencies. Technical analysis indicates that XRP has broken past key resistance levels, with bulls firmly in control. In a favorable macroeconomic environment, XRP is expected to challenge the $5 target in the near term. Global Search Trends and Whale Activity Boost XRP Confidence XRP’s global search popularity has surpassed Bitcoin on Google, reflecting heightened market interest. This suggests investors may be shifting capital from Bitcoin to XRP, further fueling optimism. Data from analytics firm Santiment shows a continuous increase in whale interest in XRP. Since November 12, addresses holding 1 to 10 million XRP have added 1.4 billion tokens, worth over $3.8 billion. Even during price consolidations following early 2024 highs, whales maintained their accumulation behavior signaling that XRP’s appeal to institutional and large-scale investors is steadily increasing. XRP’s strong performance is not only attributed to positive legal developments but also its expanding ecosystem. The potential approval of an XRP spot ETF is a core driver of market optimism. According to a JPMorgan report, an approved ETF could attract $4 billion to $8 billion in net new assets.

The research outlines several factors that could shape the market this year. 2024 was a year of two extremes for the crypto market that literally told a tale of two halves: unbearable sobering setbacks and the biggest triumphs seen for however long Bitcoin has been around. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were approved at the beginning of the year, but even institutional adoption wasn’t enough to carry the market to the “promised land.” It took the victory of a certain Donald J Trump in the November US elections to push the BTC train over the “dream target” of $100,000. And with that, investors managed to nurse their pocket’s wounds as the crypto market traded in the green for weeks. So, what really took place in 2024? And will the trends that influenced the market last year carry over to 2025? Here’s a breakdown of CryptoQuant’s 2024 survey. The crypto demographic: A younger, experienced investor base In the crypto market data platform’s survey , 60% of respondents fell within the 25-44 age range; Gen-Zs and millennials undoubtedly have a better understanding of crypto. But what’s particularly striking is that over 62% of participants have been in the industry for more than three years. Crypto demographic | CryptoQuant Research So, young people are not just riding the “next big thing” wave; they know what they’re getting themselves into. On the gender front, 89% of respondents identified as male and only 11% as female; the space remains predominantly male-dominated. Retail investors dominate the market Even though there’s presumably a high level of experience, the majority of these investors are still classified as retail. Most of them reported annual investments under $10,000. CryptoQuant analyst Emma Lee notes, “ This indicates that while crypto has attracted retail investors, it remains a highly fragmented market. The majority of users are not large-scale institutional players, but rather individual investors who continue to fuel the market’s growth. “ Regionally, Asia led the crypto investment bandwagon, with 40% of users coming from this region, followed by Europe at 29% and North America at 10%. Analyst David W. Kim explained that retail investors have driven many exchanges to cater to smaller trades. “ Traders are prioritizing exchanges with simplified user interfaces, which is one reason platforms like Binance remain so popular ,” Kim noted. Meanwhile, spot crypto trading continues to dominate the crypto landscape, with 76% of users prioritizing it over activities like derivatives trading or staking. Only 28% of participants used trading platforms for their earn products, and this is where exchanges can tap in if the market grows. Binance: Everywhere but the US The CryptoQuant survey revealed that Binance is the top choice for crypto enthusiasts. More than half (53%) of respondents were in favor of Binance, and nearly half held the majority of their assets on the exchange. Crypto holders survey | CryptoQuant Research The numbers don’t lie: Binance commands a staggering 46.59% of the total market share, based on a cumulative spot volume of $7.23 trillion. However, according to CryptoQuant founder Ki Young-Ju, Coinbase leads the way in North America, with a market share of 45%. U.S. uses Coinbase. The world uses Binance. https://t.co/LwAPxBXVG9 pic.twitter.com/PuW749PsKL — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) January 16, 2025 The survey also revealed that 83% of participants were mindful of exchanges’ security and compliance status. Most traders avoided exchanges that faced regulatory challenges. In terms of compliance, 32% of respondents considered Binance the most regulatory-compliant exchange. 14% of respondents felt Coinbase played by regulatory rules. Industry expert Maria Alvarez explained, “ The heavy concentration around top exchanges like Binance means traders are betting on liquidity. In such a competitive market, smaller exchanges face a difficult challenge in attracting and retaining users. ” The report also highlighted the concentration of market activity around a small number of exchanges. The top five exchanges—Binance, Bybit, Crypto.com, OKEx, and Coinbase—control a staggering 81.24% of the cumulative spot volume. This means that smaller exchanges like Upbit, Huobi Pro, and Bithumb Korea, while still relevant, contribute a fraction of the overall volume. Interestingly, the survey notes a steep drop-off in trading volume as you move down the list of exchanges. Smaller platforms like Coinone, Korbit, and Binance USA barely register new players and hold barely 0.4% of the total market share. Bitcoin and Ethereum market leaders, AI will grow too When it comes to profit generation, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) remain the market’s eye candy. The occasional surge in the popularity of memecoins or seasonal tokens wasn’t enough to sway investors’ focus. Investor Interest Survey | CryptoQuant Research Traders overwhelmingly preferred these established cryptocurrencies; there’s no sign they won’t do so this year. Bitcoin and Ethereum will more than likely continue to lead the charge in 2025. That said, the survey notes an emerging trend: the growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) blockchain integrations. Currently valued at approximately $15 billion, AI tokens saw a remarkable price uptrend in the final quarter of 2024, experiencing a 222% growth. Gracy Chen, CEO of the crypto exchange Bitget, believes the AI token market could hit a market capitalization of $60 billion by 2025. As reported by Cryptopolitan, this trend is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to disrupt financial markets in the coming years, though not as soon as 2025.

In seguito l’asset ha subito una correzione, scivolando sotto la soglia dei 95.000 dollari. Ieri la crypto di maggior valore ha ripreso slancio e ha superato nuovamente la soglia dei 100.000 dollari spinto dai dati sull’inflazione americana. Oggi si sta mantenendo leggermente al di sotto e attualmente sta scambiando al livello di 98.859 dollari. A spingere l’impennata dell’asset è stata la pubblicazione dei dati sul Consumer Price Index (CPI) del Dipartimento del Lavoro degli Stati Uniti per il mese di dicembre. Anche se il CPI su base annua si è attestato al 2,9% come previsto, l’inflazione di base, pari al 3,2%, è risultata inferiore alle attese. Anche se ancora lontani dall’obiettivo di inflazione del 2% della Federal Reserve, i risultati migliori del previsto hanno contribuito a calmare i timori degli investitori riguardo a un possibile aumento dei tassi di interesse. Per capire i possibili movimenti di prezzo di Bitcoin nel corso del mese abbiamo deciso di consultare l’algoritmo avanzato di intelligenza artificiale utilizzato dalla piattaforma di analisi e previsione delle crypto PricePredictions. L’intelligenza artificiale prevede un rally per Bitcoin Tenendo conto di tutti i fattori in gioco, l’algoritmo avanzato di intelligenza artificiale ha rilasciato una previsione bullish per Bitcoin nel breve termine. Secondo l’AI, BTC potrebbe presto superare nuovamente la soglia dei 100.000 dollari, per poi raggiungere livelli leggermente superiori, come i 105.000 dollari, nel giro di una settimana. Lo slancio rialzista potrebbe portare l’asset crypto fino alla soglia dei 107.050 dollari entro fine gennaio, aprendo la strada a ulteriori aumenti di prezzo. L’AI e gli esperti prevedono nuovi massimi storici per Bitcoin Inoltre, l’intelligenza artificiale della piattaforma PricePredictions prevede che Bitcoin possa toccare un nuovo massimo storico di 110.928 dollari entro il 15 febbraio, un’impennata che probabilmente cancellerebbe ogni sentiment ribassista e stimolerebbe un rinnovato interesse all’acquisto. Sono diverse le previsioni rialziste su Bitcoin. Per esempio, il rinomato analista crypto TradingShot prevede un obiettivo di 200.000 dollari per Bitcoin, basandosi sui cicli di mercato precedenti. Un target simile è stato proposto anche dal gigante bancario Standard Chartered , che aveva già previsto con precisione il traguardo dei 100.000 dollari, spinto dall’interesse crescente degli investitori istituzionali. Anche il trader Peter Brandt condivide questa visione positiva, aspettandosi una spinta imminente che porterà Bitcoin sopra la soglia dei 100.000 dollari. Un’altra previsione rialzista arriva da Kevin Svenson , trader e analista, che si aspetta nuovi massimi storici per Bitcoin quest’anno. Secondo Svenson, la criptovaluta potrebbe toccare i 124.000 dollari entro la metà dell’anno. Dopo una possibile correzione estiva, l’analista prevede un altro rally che potrebbe spingere Bitcoin a nuovi livelli intorno a ottobre. Best Wallet: La nuova soluzione sicura per gestire Bitcoin Per la gestione sicura di Bitcoin, diversi investitori stanno considerando Best Wallet . Il nuovo wallet Web3, pensato per rispondere alle esigenze del mercato, si distingue non solo per la sua sicurezza, ma anche per un’interfaccia semplice e intuitiva che lo rende un’alternativa ideale a wallet più noti come MetaMask. Best Wallet supporta diversi asset crypto su oltre 50 blockchain, tra cui Bitcoin, Ethereum e USDT. Gli utenti possono facilmente acquistare, scambiare, conservare e vendere le proprie criptovalute direttamente all’interno dell’app. Inoltre, Best Wallet integra anche Best DEX , un aggregatore decentralizzato che ottimizza gli scambi per gli utenti. Il progetto presto lancerà Best Card, una carta di debito crypto che permetterà di spendere BTC, ETH e altri token crypto. Ma le novità non finiscono qui. Il progetto ha avviato la prevendita del token $BEST, offrendo numerosi vantaggi ai suoi titolari. Oltre a sconti sulle fees di transazione nell’ecosistema di Best Wallet, i titolari di $BEST possono ottenere ricompense maggiori tramite lo staking e accedere a esclusive prevendite crypto, come Wall Street Pepe , grazie alla funzione “Upcoming Tokens” presente nell’app.",Italia|AI|bitcoin|btc,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-16 15:51:46

This is grounded in a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network, or DePIN, and is set to change the dynamics of linking real-world data with Web3. By decentralizing data management, XYO enables users to fully own and profit from their data, enhancing both the security and reliability of Web3 data. But how does XYO accomplish this, why is it essential, and how does it contribute to Web3's scalability? We spoke with XYO's co-founder Markus Levin to learn more. Q1: XYO has experienced significant growth since the beginning. Could you elaborate on XYO's mission and what distinguishes it in the blockchain arena? The foundation of XYO is to empower both individuals and businesses with control over their data through decentralized technology. As the first pioneer in Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN), we utilize blockchain to connect real-world data with digital systems. Since our launch in 2018, we have grown into the largest DePIN network globally, with over 8 million nodes worldwide. Our uniqueness lies in our commitment to trustless and precise data validation, achieved using tools like Proof-of-Location and Proof-of-Origin. We're not just building a network but nurturing an ecosystem where data is transparent, secure, and advantageous for all its participants. Q2: The theme of data sovereignty is prevalent for XYO. Why is it crucial, and how does it influence XYO's strategy? Data sovereignty involves individuals and businesses having control over their data, including its usage and beneficiaries. At XYO, our ecosystem ensures that users maintain ownership and receive appropriate rewards for their data contributions. By using blockchain's transparency and permanence, we remove intermediaries, establishing a trustless system where data integrity is key. This approach aligns seamlessly with our mission of decentralization and empowerment. Q3: Could you give examples of where XYO's technology is making a real impact? Certainly. Our technology is applied across various sectors, such as gaming, where Proof-of-Location enhances industries that require real-world data. XYO offers transparency and efficiency in ways that centralized systems cannot compete with. Some exciting applications of XYO include artificial intelligence, logistics, and technologies like virtual and augmented reality. Currently, one of the primary use cases for XYO is in the gaming and metaverse sectors, where we enhance real-world experiences with Proof-of-Location. In logistics, our verifiable location data improves transparency and data validation in tracking products and supplies. Meanwhile, in AI, our community aids in compiling and verifying the data necessary for training advanced models using XYO’s sovereign methods and opt-in compliance. Q4: How can someone get involved with the XYO Network and become an active community member? The simplest way is to download the COIN app, designed to offer a smooth entry point for newcomers who want to engage with our ecosystem and start generating and owning data. After downloading the COIN app on your device, you can begin collecting and validating data for the network, earning XYO tokens as rewards for your efforts. For those eager to dive deeper, we have recently launched xyOS, our groundbreaking sovereign data platform that redefines digital interaction. We stand on the brink of a new digital era, and xyOS offers unprecedented control and autonomy in accessing it. Essentially, it is an operating system that allows anyone to run an XYO node through a user-friendly graphical interface, enabling access to the XYO Platform, Protocol, and Network without requiring specialized blockchain skills, thus opening participation to everyone. The launch is a significant milestone in our quest to create a more decentralized and sovereign internet, equipping users with the tools they need to reclaim ownership of their online interactions. It simplifies access to our core dApps, offers tools for dApp developers eager to leverage sovereign data, and introduces users to xyoNS, our innovative domain name system, allowing anyone to create a “display-friendly” name instead of using a random hash or crypto address. Soon, we'll also introduce our mini-game Daily Payload, providing users with daily challenges, rewards, badges, and a chance to climb the leaderboard and gain recognition within our community.

It’s based on a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network or DePIN, and it promises to revolutionize the way real-world data connects to Web3. By decentralizing the data management process, and allowing users to fully own and monetize the data they create, XYO says it is enhancing the reliability and security of Web3 data. But how exactly does XYO do this, why is this necessary, and how can it help Web3 to scale? We sat down with XYO’s co-founder Markus Levin to find out. Q1: XYO has grown significantly since its inception. Can you share XYO's mission and what sets it apart in the blockchain space? XYO was built on the idea of empowering individuals and businesses with data sovereignty through decentralized technology. We’re the first pioneer in Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN), using blockchain to connect real-world data with digital systems. Since launching in 2018, we have grown to become the world’s largest DePIN network, with more than 8 million nodes distributed across the planet What makes us unique is our focus on trustless, accurate data validation, which we achieve through tools like Proof-of-Location and Proof-of-Origin. We’re not just creating a network but also fostering an ecosystem where data is transparent, secure, and beneficial for all participants. Q2: Data sovereignty is a recurring theme for XYO. Why is this important, and how does it shape XYO's approach? Data sovereignty is about individuals and businesses having control over their data — how it’s used and who benefits from it. At XYO, we’ve built our ecosystem to ensure users retain ownership and receive fair rewards for their data contributions. By leveraging blockchain’s transparency and immutability, we eliminate middlemen, providing a trustless system where data integrity is paramount. This approach aligns perfectly with our mission of decentralization and empowerment. Q3: Can you highlight a few use cases where XYO's technology is making a difference? Absolutely. Our technology is being used across industries like gaming, where Proof-of-Location enhances virtually any industry requiring real-world data. XYO is uniquely able to provide both transparency and efficiency in a way centralized systems can’t compete with. Some of the most exciting use cases for XYO include A.I., virtually any kind of logistics, or technologies like virtual and augmented reality. One of the most common uses cases for XYO at present is in the gaming and metaverse industries, where we are able to enhance real-world experiences with Proof-of-Location. In logistics, our verifiable location data helps to bring transparency and improve data validation in terms of tracking products and supplies, while in AI, our community is helping to compile and verify the data needed for training powerful new models, using XYO’s sovereign methodology and opt-in compliance. Q4: How can I get started and participate in the XYO Network and become a useful member of your community? The easiest way is to download the COIN app, which is designed to provide a seamless on-ramp for new users wanting to participate in our ecosystem and start generating and owning data. When you download the COIN app onto your device, you’ll be able to start collecting data for the network and validating it, and for your efforts you’ll earn rewards in the shape of XYO tokens. For those who want to get more involved, we recently launched xyOS, which is our groundbreaking sovereign data platform that redefines how people can interact with the digital world. We’re on the cusp of a new era in the digital world, and xyOS gives you unprecedented control and autonomy in the way you can access it. Essentially, what it is is an operating system that makes it simple for anyone to run an XYPO node through a user-friendly graphical interface. Users can access the XYO Platform, Protocol and Network without needing any specialist blockchain skills, ensuring that everyone can play a part in our project. Really, its launch is a key milestone in our mission to create a more decentralized and sovereign internet, giving users the tools they need to reclaim ownership of their online interactions. It streamlines access to our core dApps, provides tools for dApp developers looking to leverage sovereign data, and introduces users to xyoNS, our novel domain name system, through which anyone can create their own “display-friendly” name instead of using a jumbled hash or crypto address. Soon, we’ll also be launching our mini-game Daily Payload, which will provide users with daily challenges, rewards, badges and a chance to fight to the top of the leaderboard and earn recognition in our community. Q5: What's coming next for XYO and its community in 2025? Is there anything to look forward to? I think 2025 is shaping up to be another groundbreaking year. We’re focused on launching some incredibly exciting new technologies which we intend to expand and iterate on throughout 2025, while also expanding our ecosystem with tools like xyOS, and fostering some truly incredible partnerships. I could not be more excited for what we have coming in the near future. Our community, especially XYO token holders, has been the backbone of our success, and we’re committed to empowering them with innovations that redefine how decentralized data is used globally. We’re building a future where data sovereignty and transparency are the norm. We are at the forefront of what we believe will become a titanic movement.

The sales process was triggered after the company received two M&A approaches late last year, Dubie said.

The business has subsequently engaged investment bankers to organise a sales process and Ctrl Wallet is being advised by Imperii Partners, Dubie added. An auction process is ongoing with bids due by Jan. 28., and a winning bidder is expected to be announced by Jan. 31. Ctrl Wallet currently has 650,000 users, with a goal to get to over 2 million by the end of the year, the CEO said. The firm's main competitors are Coinbase Wallet, Binance's Trust Wallet and OKX's wallet.

Two prominent names in this field are Nexo and Cryptonomy, each offering unique services to their users. But which one stands out as the better choice? In this detailed comparison, we’ll analyze both platforms, their offerings, and why Cryptonomy emerges as the superior solution for modern crypto investors. Nexo: A Global Crypto Lending and Interest Platform Founded in Europe, Nexo has established itself as a go-to platform for crypto lending and interest-earning accounts. With a broad user base spanning over 200 jurisdictions, Nexo combines accessibility with a range of financial products designed for crypto users. Key Features of Nexo: Crypto Lending Services:Nexo allows users to borrow fiat or stablecoins by using their crypto assets as collateral. Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios vary depending on loyalty tiers, with interest rates starting as low as 0% for Platinum-tier users holding sufficient NEXO tokens. Earn Interest on Crypto:Nexo provides daily compounding interest on deposited assets. Users can earn up to 12% on selected cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, depending on their loyalty level. Nexo Token Benefits:The NEXO token is central to the platform’s operations, providing benefits like higher interest rates on deposits and reduced loan rates. Users are incentivized to hold NEXO to unlock additional perks. Nexo Card:The platform offers a crypto card that allows users to spend their crypto seamlessly while earning cashback in NEXO tokens. Security and Insurance:Nexo partners with custodians like BitGo and Ledger Vault to safeguard user assets, backed by a $775 million insurance policy. While Nexo offers a robust set of services, the platform’s heavy reliance on its token loyalty system and limited diversification of offerings may not appeal to every investor. Cryptonomy: A Comprehensive Platform for Crypto Investors Cryptonomy redefines the crypto experience by providing a holistic suite of services that cater to both everyday users and high-net-worth individuals. Beyond traditional staking and lending, Cryptonomy offers cutting-edge solutions like Launchpool and Private Wealth Management, positioning itself as a forward-thinking platform for modern investors. Why Cryptonomy Excels: Advanced Staking Programs:Cryptonomy offers both flexible staking, which provides liquidity for users who need quick access to their funds, and fixed staking options that deliver higher returns over a set period. Unlike Nexo, Cryptonomy integrates staking with lending, allowing staked assets to generate passive income while contributing to a robust peer-to-peer lending ecosystem. Launchpool for Early-Stage Investments:Cryptonomy’s Launchpool offers a unique opportunity to access early-stage blockchain projects, where tokens are carefully vetted before being made available to investors. This feature helps users diversify their portfolios with high-growth projects that may not be accessible on other platforms like Nexo. Private Wealth Management (PWM):Tailored specifically for high-net-worth individuals, PWM provides personalized investment strategies designed to grow and protect wealth. With dedicated relationship managers, investors can access exclusive opportunities, including private token sales and real-world asset integration. Institutional-Level Security:Cryptonomy ensures the highest standards of security, with a £6.1 billion insurance fund and collateral-backed loans safeguarding user assets. The platform’s commitment to security outshines Nexo’s $775 million insurance coverage, offering investors greater peace of mind. Transparency and Support:Cryptonomy’s clear profit-sharing models and dedicated support team ensure investors remain informed and confident in their decisions. From tracking investments to offering detailed insights, Cryptonomy prioritizes user empowerment at every step. Comparative Analysis: Cryptonomy vs. Nexo Why Cryptonomy Stands Out While Nexo provides a dependable platform for crypto lending and earning, it lacks the diverse offerings and tailored solutions that Cryptonomy delivers. Cryptonomy’s emphasis on early-stage investments, advanced staking programs, and personalized wealth management positions it as the ideal choice for investors looking to maximize their returns while managing risk effectively. Highlights of Cryptonomy: Holistic Investment Tools: Unlike Nexo, Cryptonomy provides a seamless blend of staking, lending, and exclusive access to blockchain projects. Enhanced Security: Cryptonomy’s insurance fund is significantly larger, demonstrating a greater commitment to safeguarding user assets. Innovative Wealth Management: The PWM service fills a gap in the market, offering solutions that cater to high-net-worth individuals with sophisticated financial needs. Why Cryptonomy appears as the Better Choice While both platforms cater to crypto investors, Cryptonomy offers a more comprehensive suite of services that address the needs of a wider range of users. From staking rewards and Launchpool opportunities to tailored wealth management and unparalleled security, Cryptonomy bridges the gap between traditional finance and the future of cryptocurrency. For investors seeking a forward-thinking platform to grow their portfolios, Cryptonomy is the ultimate choice. Discover the difference at Cryptonomy .

To read full editions, subscribe . If I were to boil it down, I’d say there are three key reasons why Tribe Capital’s Evan Park is bullish on DePIN. The use cases, sustainability, and — of course — the revenue potential. Tribe’s backed a few DePINs including Wynd Networks (the company behind Grass ), flight tracking project Wingbits and Akash. When looking at DePIN projects, Park’s biggest question is whether or not the project is “solving a problem where real demand can be generated.” Specifically, when Park is being pitched, he’s skeptical when a project shows him revenue figures that aren’t necessarily coming from the underlying network. I asked him what makes him call bullshit on a DePIN pitch and he told me: It’s “important to distinguish revenue in crypto, but also in DePIN.” He wants to know where the revenue is coming from, essentially. Are the users also validators? Are individuals “contributing to the network and their data, is that the thing that’s making revenue?” He also keeps a close eye on organic growth and gets validation on potential demand. But a good team, and a founder “deep in the space” are huge green flags for Park. If this sounds familiar to you, it’s probably because Wyatt Lonergan of VanEck Ventures told us that he also pays close attention to project teams last month. “It’s a consideration that’s more important in DePIN than any other sector. But also having domain expertise, or having advisors and team members that have that domain expertise in your given industry, while bridging that with crypto native experience. It’s not enough to have one without the other,” he noted. And there’s your insider scoop for the day. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Then, Eric Tomaszewski from Verde Capital Management shares tips on preparing for tax season in Ask and Expert. – Sarah Morton You’re reading Crypto for Advisors , CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday. Bitcoin Could Be On The Verge Of A Major Breakout: Is Your IRA Ready For The Opportunity? Top researchers and very large investors are putting price targets on bitcoin that project it is potentially on the brink of a significant bull run. Tom Lee says bitcoin will be $250,000 this year, and Michael Saylor says bitcoin will get to $500,000 overnight. Imagine having a substantial allocation of bitcoin in your retirement account before this bull run kicks into ultra-high gear – a tax-advantaged allocation funded by an old Individual Retirement Account (IRA) you may have forgotten about. The opportunity is right in front of you, but it’s essential to set it up the right way with a platform that offers comprehensive support and peace of mind. Step 1: Self-Direct Your IRA Or Work With An Advisor When investing in bitcoin through your IRA, security and compliance are paramount. A qualified custodian ensures your retirement assets are managed per IRS regulations, offering a layer of protection beyond simple wallet management. If you select a self-directed method, know it will be up to you to handle the transfer and make investment decisions. If you go with an advisor, they will handle the bulk of the transfer process for you, all the way through managing the portfolio. Self-directing means you have to watch your investments, which are vulnerable to errors, fraud, or mismanagement. An advisor has done the due diligence on service providers and regularly monitors accounts for the best outcome. Step 2: Set Up Your Tax-Advantaged Crypto IRA Once you have chosen a self-directed platform or advisor, the next step is signing up, which involves executing and approving a client agreement. While the process is similar for both options, working with an advisor offers critical advantages. An advisor can help design a portfolio tailored to your risk profile, guide you in determining the appropriate position sizes relative to your other investments, and assist in implementing a long-term investment plan that aligns with your financial goals. In contrast, self-directed platforms don’t provide personalized guidance, don’t care what you buy, and are often incentivized to encourage frequent trading, which can erode your returns over time. Additionally, setting up the correct IRA structure is crucial. For example, if you already have a Traditional IRA, you’ll need to open a new Traditional IRA with the crypto IRA provider to maintain consistency. Transferring assets can be complicated, especially if you're unsure which investments to sell, how much to roll over, or how to track the transfer process. An advisor can guide you through these steps, handling much of the complexity and ensuring a smoother experience. Step 3: Invest For Growth As The Crypto Sector Surges As discussed above, a self-directed platform leaves you on your own to select investments, determine position sizes, and decide when to buy or sell. If you’re confident in your ability to outperform the market and manage these decisions independently, this approach might work for you – but it demands time, expertise, and discipline, with no safety net if mistakes are made. In contrast, working with an advisor offers a distinct advantage. Advisors provide guidance tailored to your financial goals, help you select high-quality investments, and may offer pre-designed portfolios with proven track records. Rather than going it alone, you’ll gain access to a team of experts whose full-time job is managing digital assets and staying ahead of industry trends. As many experts predict, the upcoming bitcoin bull run could drive prices well into six figures. By securing a bitcoin IRA today, you can position yourself to benefit from this potential growth while leveraging tax advantages and professional management to support long-term success. - Bryan Courchesne, CEO, DAIM Ask an Expert Q. It’s the beginning of a new year. What are some things I should consider so I can kickstart the year effectively? It's important to focus on systems more than goals. Goals will give you direction, while systems will create progress. Identify daily and weekly actions that will help you achieve larger goals, personally and professionally. From there, start small, repeat consistently, and tie new habits to existing ones to help you remember and reinforce. Q. It's 2025, so what strategies can I use for tax year 2024? Fortunately, it is not too late to find tax deductions, as there is a range of options to consider. Traditional IRAs, Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), and self-employed retirement plan contributions – such as those made through a SEP IRA or Solo 401(k) plan for freelancers or contractors – are just some of the available options. Q. How do I tackle an upcoming tax bill in April? Everything comes back to planning. If you are addressing this situation today, work with professionals to project the needed amount. From there, prioritize your liquidity needs and goals over the upcoming months while developing a payment plan. This may require adjusting your budget and exploring creative payment options, such as IRS installment plans, securities-based lending, etc. - Eric Tomaszewski, Financial Advisor, Verde Capital Management Keep Reading President-elect Trump is set to host an inaugural crypto ball .

According to a recent Binance report, XRP could reach $10 by 2025, driven by Ripple’s successful legal battles with the SEC and the adoption of RLUSD, a stablecoin that supports Ripple’s network. On the other side, Web3Bay , a decentralized e-commerce platform, is quickly becoming known as a revolutionary project that combines e-commerce with cryptocurrency, offering a novel opportunity for users. Could Ripple (XRP) Realistically Reach $10 by 2025? Ripple’s potential to hit $10 depends on multiple key elements. Ripple’s courtroom success against the SEC has brought much-needed legal clarity, prompting more financial bodies to consider XRP for worldwide money transfers. This momentum, alongside technical signs like an RSI approaching overbought territory and solid trading volumes, indicates that XRP could climb further. Additional support from RLUSD Integration The inclusion of RLUSD in Ripple’s network bolsters its position in global finance by improving international payment solutions. Large-scale wallet accumulations by whales also contribute to the positive outlook for XRP’s price to reach and possibly exceed the $10 mark. Web3Bay: Shaping the Future of E-Commerce with Blockchain Technology Web3Bay is transforming e-commerce by integrating crypto payments with traditional financial systems. This platform cuts out middlemen and reduces fees, enabling sellers to access global markets with cheaper transaction costs. Its features go beyond simple transactions, including NFT integration and loyalty schemes, crafting an ecosystem for merchandise, collectibles, and decentralized finance. Web3Bay’s robust security protocols, such as smart contracts and permanent blockchain records, ensure trust for both individual users and large investors. Moreover, its decentralized governance model lets token holders help steer platform choices, enhancing loyalty and community involvement. Web3Bay’s Unique Approach and Presale Success 3BAY’s distinct blend of e-commerce and crypto attracts global merchants and shoppers, promoting ease and accessibility in online shopping. Its ongoing presale has successfully raised over $700,000, selling 200 million tokens at a price of $0.0039675. With a future listing price expected at $0.1959, early backers could see substantial gains. Web3Bay also offers staking options during its presale, giving participants a chance to earn passive income while aiding the platform’s expansion. Features like NFT marketplaces and community-led governance further secure Web3Bay’s position as a notable project. Final Say! Ripple’s (XRP) path to $10 is shaped by regulatory advancements, market trust, and practical applications like RLUSD integration. Meanwhile, Web3Bay is making an impact in the retail world by blending blockchain with e-commerce, offering a new outlook on global commerce. As Ripple works on transforming international payments, Web3Bay introduces inventive crypto uses in retail. Both projects show the diverse and transformative potential of cryptocurrency in finance and commerce. While Ripple (XRP) continues to lead in payment solutions, Web3Bay’s innovative approach to e-commerce marks it as a significant player in the growing digital market. Together, they highlight the expansive potential of blockchain technology to revolutionize industries and offer opportunities to investors for 2025.

This pair of developments is generating excitement in the crypto market, with BlackRock’s ETF facilitating broader Bitcoin adoption, while PEPETO's presale triumph establishes it as a memecoin that blends fun with practical applications. Backed by an enthusiastic community and a strong utility-focused ecosystem, PEPETO continues to attract investors looking for high-growth possibilities. PEPETO Presale Surpasses $3.6 Million—A Potential Game Changer? While BlackRock’s institutional offering grabs attention, PEPETO’s presale achievement is stealing the spotlight. In just a few weeks, PEPETO has garnered over $3.6 million from enthusiastic investors who view the token as a promising mix of meme culture and real utility. Contrary to typical memecoins that rely solely on hype, PEPETO provides a comprehensive ecosystem, featuring zero-fee trading, a cross-chain bridge, and staking rewards for generating passive income.

With rising demand for its tokens, PEPETO’s forthcoming exchange listings could potentially lead to significant price increases, similar to early-stage gains seen in other major tokens. BlackRock’s BTC ETF: A Significant Step with Some Constraints BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF, introduced on CBOE Canada under the symbols IBIT and IBIT.U, offers Canadian investors a regulated way to access Bitcoin without the complexity of direct crypto management. With a competitive management fee of 0.32%, the ETF aims to attract long-term investors interested in Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainties. The ETF operates on a funds-of-funds structure, meaning it predominantly invests in BlackRock’s U.S.-listed iShares Bitcoin Trust, which holds actual Bitcoin. As of January 10, the ETF managed net assets worth $701,338 with about 25,000 units outstanding. While appealing, critics point out that traditional investment products like ETFs may not offer the explosive growth potential that tokens like PEPETO can provide during their early phases. Why PEPETO Stands Out Among Traditional Crypto Products While institutional ETFs like BlackRock’s draw cautious investors, PEPETO represents a new wave of crypto investments that blend entertainment with tangible value. PEPETO distinguishes itself with zero-fee trading on PepetoSwap, providing a cost-free trading experience. Its cross-chain compatibility ensures smooth bridging across major blockchains, while staking rewards enable holders to earn passive income by staking PEPETO tokens. These distinctive features are more than just flashy add-ons; they build a real, functional ecosystem capable of sustaining long-term growth and adoption. That’s why analysts are closely monitoring PEPETO as a potential breakthrough in the increasingly crowded crypto space. Conclusion: With over $3.6 million already secured, PEPETO’s presale is rapidly approaching its conclusion. If you're searching for an asset that offers both entertainment and practical utility, PEPETO is an excellent choice. Early adopters are poised to gain the most as the token gears up for its initial exchange listings. Don’t miss out—join the thousands of investors already betting on PEPETO’s future.

Meanwhile, the intersection between decentralized finance and TradFi is among the most intriguing. At the forefront is DTX Exchange (DTX) . This new player will combine DeFi and TradFi, aiming to meet traders’ evolving needs. Its unique offering will be a one-stop platform that combines the best elements of centralized and decentralized exchanges and allows the trading of asset classes across the financial markets. DTX Exchange (DTX): The Next Big Thing in the Global Trading Scene DTX Exchange (DTX) will stand out in the $3.2 billion global trading landscape as a hybrid platform. This novel model involves combining the best elements of centralized and decentralized exchanges—a groundbreaking innovation. Considering the key challenges of both models, the future of finance has been hailed as a blend of both. As the first crypto-native platform to offer stocks, ETFs and forex, DTX will bridge the gap between traditional and decentralized finance. Users won’t need to patronize different platforms for asset management; they can simply use the exchange for all trading needs. Hailed as a trailblazer, it is set for massive adoption—a new DeFi project to keep on the radar. Further, by combining key elements of CEX and DEX, some of its key features will include wallet-based trading and non-custodial storage solutions. Individuals with little or no access to formal banking systems can participate in the global financial markets by trading directly from crypto wallets without needing traditional bank accounts. Additionally, users will retain control of their private keys and assets, addressing risks around centralized asset custody. DTX Exchange: Addressing Key Challenges in the Trading Industry Through its hybrid trading model, DTX will address the critical challenges within the trading industry. It will employ different innovative solutions, particularly decentralized principles, poised to reshape users’ trading experience. Financial Inclusion Through Wallet-Based Trading: Slightly explained in previous sentences, DTX Exchange will guarantee financial inclusion by allowing users to trade directly from their crypto wallets. This will be crucial in emerging countries or developing economies with limited access to formal banking systems. Improving Asset Classes Through Tokenization: It will represent real-world financial instruments, tangible assets and commodities on the blockchain via tokenization, opening up a world of opportunities. Non-Custodial Storage and Improved Security: The DTX Exchange platform will adopt a non-custodial storage solution over a centralized model. This means users will have full control of their private keys and assets, reducing the risks associated with centralized custody solutions. DTX Exchange: Shaking Up the Crypto and Broader Financial Landscape Besides its imminent adoption in the global trading market as a hybrid exchange platform, the DTX token is about to take the crypto market by storm—one of the new altcoins to watch. It boasts staggering upside potential as a top ICO and a low-cap gem, driving interest and pushing early funding past $11.8 million. Besides, it has exploded over 500% in the past few months after debuting, hinting at its potential. With its run just starting, investors have been betting more on the DTX token over top crypto coins. It costs just $0.14 in the seventh round of the ICO, underpriced and undervalued. Top analysts predict a 75x jump in value after listing on Tier-1 exchanges, positioning it as arguably the best new crypto to invest in and edging out most top altcoins.

The convergence of decentralized finance and traditional finance is one of the most captivating developments, with DTX Exchange (DTX) leading the charge. This emerging platform aims to integrate DeFi and TradFi, striving to fulfill the evolving demands of traders. It offers a comprehensive solution by merging the finest aspects of centralized and decentralized exchanges, enabling the trading of diverse asset classes across financial markets. DTX Exchange (DTX): A Major Player in the Global Trading Arena DTX Exchange (DTX) is set to make its mark on the $3.2 billion global trading market with its innovative hybrid platform. This approach combines the most effective elements of centralized and decentralized exchanges, representing a significant advancement. With the challenges faced by both models, the future of finance appears to be a blend of the two. As the first crypto-native platform to offer stocks, ETFs, and forex, DTX aims to bridge the gap between traditional and decentralized finance. Traders won't need to juggle multiple platforms for managing assets; they can handle all their trading needs within this single exchange. Recognized as a pioneer, it is primed for substantial adoption and is a DeFi project worth monitoring. Moreover, by integrating key components of CEX and DEX, its standout features will include wallet-based trading and non-custodial storage solutions.

Additionally, users maintain control over their private keys and assets, mitigating risks associated with centralized asset custody. DTX Exchange: Tackling Major Issues in the Trading World Through its hybrid trading platform, DTX seeks to resolve significant challenges within the trading industry. Employing various innovative solutions, particularly those grounded in decentralized principles, it plans to transform the trading experience for users.

Enhancing Asset Classes with Tokenization: It will bring real-world financial instruments, tangible assets, and commodities onto the blockchain through tokenization, unlocking numerous opportunities. Non-Custodial Storage and Boosted Security: The platform will adopt a non-custodial storage solution instead of a centralized model, allowing users full control over their private keys and assets, thus minimizing risks tied to centralized custody. DTX Exchange: Transforming the Crypto and Financial Domains Beyond its anticipated adoption in the global trading market as a hybrid platform, the DTX token is set to create waves in the crypto arena as a notable new altcoin. Its massive growth potential as a leading ICO and low-cap gem is drawing interest, with early funding exceeding $11.8 million. Furthermore, it has surged over 500% in recent months since launching, indicating its promising future. With its momentum just beginning, investors are increasingly favoring the DTX token over other leading cryptocurrencies. Currently priced at only $0.14 during the seventh round of the ICO, it is considered undervalued. Leading analysts forecast a 75x increase in value once it lists on Tier-1 exchanges, potentially making it the best new crypto investment and surpassing many top altcoins.

The sale, which could come as early as the second quarter, could value the company at more than $5 billion, the FT said. Goldman Sachs, Jefferies and UBS are advising the company. If successful, eToro would join Coinbase (COIN) and Robinhood (HOOD) as one of the few publicly listed companies offering crypto trading in the U.S. It would be much smaller than either: Coinbase has a $69 billion market cap and Robinhood $40 billion. The valuation would also be less than half the level it sought in 2021, when it planned to go public through a $10.4 billion deal with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). The attempt was abandoned late in 2022 as a result of unfavorable market conditions. In 2023, eToro secured $250 million in funding at a $3.5 billion valuation from investors including SoftBank as its valuation plunged, according to the FT. The valuation has since risen amid an equity and cryptocurrency market rally, and after the company agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle SEC charges it operated as an unregistered broker and unregistered clearing agency and facilitated trading in some crypto assets as securities. While eToro's cryptocurrency trading volume isn’t known, Finance Magnates reported last year that it surged more than 500% in the year ended November. The company, founded in Israel in 2007, reportedly manages $11.3 billion for over 3 million customers. These assets include not only cryptocurrencies, but also stocks and exchange-traded funds. Last year, as a result of its settlement with the SEC, it agreed to drop trading for multiple cryptocurrencies in the United States, limiting its users in the country to trade bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), and ether (ETH).

Community Awaits,https://cryptopotato.com/will-trump-make-a-pro-crypto-move-on-day-1-community-awaits/,"The crypto industry is optimistic that the United States President-elect, Donald Trump, will issue pivotal executive orders regarding the industry upon taking office on January 20. According to sources cited by the New York Post, Trump is exploring the creation of an “America-first” digital asset reserve, emphasizing cryptocurrencies developed within the United States. The initiative aligns with previous discussions among Trump’s transition team about forming a strategic Bitcoin reserve. With his inauguration nearing, there is widespread speculation about the potential content of these executive orders and their implications for the crypto industry. America-First Reserve to Focus on U.S. Digital Assets Reports indicate that Trump and his team are drafting executive orders to promote cryptocurrencies. One major action under consideration is repealing the controversial crypto accounting rule, SAB 121. The proposed “America-first” reserve could also prioritize digital assets such as XRP, Solana, and the USDC stablecoin, which have strong U.S. connections. In light of this, during recent meetings at the Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump reportedly engaged with Ripple executives, including CEO Brad Garlinghouse and CLO Stuart Alderoty, signaling openness to their proposals. However, some have expressed concerns that Trump’s support for altcoins could overshadow efforts to enhance Bitcoin’s legitimacy and adoption. Crypto Community Awaits Regulatory Shift The crypto community views Trump’s inauguration as a potential turning point, following what they describe as years of regulatory hostility under the Biden administration. Measures such as “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” allegedly restricted banking access for crypto companies, stifling innovation and startups. According to a recent article published in the Washington Post , the incoming administration is expected to address these issues through executive orders. Proposed actions include establishing a Bitcoin reserve and ending practices that have excluded crypto firms from traditional banking services. The industry also anticipates significant regulatory changes with a reshaped SEC under the potential leadership of Paul Atkins. Meanwhile, Trump has appointed venture capitalist David Sacks as the first AI and crypto czar for the United States. In addition, a celebratory “Crypto Ball” is planned for Friday, ahead of Trump’s inauguration, underscoring the sector’s hopes for a more favorable regulatory environment.

An altseason, also known as altcoin season, is a market phenomenon marked by other cryptocurrencies significantly outperforming the leader BTC. The Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D), measured by Bitcoin’s share of the cryptocurrency market capitalization, is a canary for an altseason. Looking at this leading metric, some crypto analysts like Mikybull believe a “Bitcoin dominance massive decline is around the corner.” Indeed, the analyst believes that the BTC.D chart formation with three-day candlesticks signals a clear top, forecasting a decline. This could be “huge for an altseason,” in Mikybull’ s words – an opinion also shared by other traders and analysts. Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) 3D chart. Source: TradingView / Mikybull Other analysts who expect an altseason (atcoin season) Also looking at a potential Bitcoin dominance decline, the prominent crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe expects an altseason soon. He shared this vision on January 16, mentioning BTC consolidating at $100,000 after a correction to $88,500. According to him, “Altcoins have seen a strong move upwards,” predicting “Bitcoin dominance to fall.” Van de Poppe predicts this strong momentum for altcoins to continue in the coming weeks. Moreover, the long-term crypto and stock investor who goes by Jelle on X highlights a bullish pennant pattern for altcoins. In particular, he is looking at a potential breakout of the altcoins’ total market cap of its all-time high resistance . “Altcoins have broken out from the daily bullish pennant! Running straight into all-time high resistance here — once that breaks, the sky is the limit. Strap in boys, we’re in for one heck of a ride.” – Jelle Altcoins total market cap, bullish pennant, and all-time high resistance. Source: TradingView / Jelle These bullish expectations are also aligned with recent news that hint at Donald Trump considering adding US-based altcoins to the United States Treasury reserves , instead of only Bitcoin, as many enthusiasts first thought. On that note, Michael Saylor was one of these investors who previously held a “BTC-maximalist” position, now admitting being wrong . If an altseason really happens, altcoin investors are expected to see far higher gains than Bitcoin holders in the following months. However, many altcoins lack solid fundamentals and can usually expose investors to higher risks; requiring caution while opening positions.

This new offering, powered by the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Morpho, operates on the exchange’s Ethereum Layer 2 network, Base. The service is currently available to U.S. customers, excluding those in New York, with plans for further market expansion. Coinbase Rolls Out Bitcoin-Backed Loans Powered by Morpho Protocol In a recent development , the Coinbase crypto exchange has launched a new loan service allowing users to borrow up to $100,000 USDC using Bitcoin as collateral. The service leverages Morpho, a DeFi protocol, to facilitate these loans on the Base blockchain. This integration is a step in the exchange’s efforts to merge traditional financial services with DeFi. More so, Bitcoin pledged by users is converted into cbBTC, a wrapped version of BTC created by Coinbase. This wrapped token enables Bitcoin to function seamlessly within decentralized finance systems. By utilizing cbBTC, Coinbase ensures that the collateral remains compatible with Morpho’s lending platform. This provides users with access to liquidity without the need to liquidate their Bitcoin holdings. Meanwhile, in the ongoing SEC vs. Coinbase case, Binance has filed a joint notice with the district court, leveraging the partial victory Coinbase secured in its rulemaking petition lawsuit. Binance aims to use this judgment to support its request for the dismissal of the US SEC’s claims. The exchange argues that the SEC’s complaint fails to meet the requirements of the Howey test. How the Loan Process Works Notably, Coinbase users can initiate a loan by pledging their Bitcoin as collateral through the Coinbase app. Once the Bitcoin is pledged, it is converted to cbBTC at a 1:1 ratio and transferred to the Morpho DeFi protocol . In return, borrowers receive USDC loans directly into their Coinbase accounts within seconds, allowing for quick access to funds. Additionally, the process is streamlined to ensure efficiency and user convenience. There are no fees associated with the conversion of Bitcoin to cbBTC, and the entire transaction is completed on-chain. Users can utilize the borrowed USDC for various purposes, including expenses, global transfers, or converting it into U.S. dollars as needed. Flexible Repayment Terms and Risk Management One of the key features of Coinbase’s Bitcoin-backed loans is the absence of a fixed repayment schedule. Borrowers have the flexibility to repay their loans at their own pace, provided they maintain a safe loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. The LTV ratio ensure that the loan remains adequately collateralized, mitigating the risk of liquidation. However, if Bitcoin’s value decreases, the exchange will liquidate the collateral to cover the loan.. This mechanism ensures that the loan remains secure and the exchange can manage risks associated with BTC volatility. Currently, Coinbase’s Bitcoin-backed loan service is available to customers in the United States, excluding New York. The company plans to expand this service to additional markets to broaden its accessibility to a wider user base. While Bitcoin is the initial collateral option, Coinbase will support more cryptocurrencies in future iterations of the loan service. Additionally, the crypto exchange has continued to expand its offerings, recently adding Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) meme coin on the Solana network. PNUT will be available for trading on the exchange starting this January, with the trading pair PNUT-USD launching in phases.

However, its growing ties to the stock market, the rise of Bitcoin ETFs, and evolving market dynamics are prompting investors to explore altcoins for potentially greater returns. Leading the charge are Cardano, Toncoin, and the innovative Remittix project. Here’s a closer look: Bitcoin ETFs Redefining Market Dynamics In the past year, Bitcoin's price has reacted similarly to macroeconomic factors like Federal Reserve announcements and Nonfarm Payroll (NFP) figures, echoing the trends seen in the S&P 500. While Bitcoin ETFs have increased accessibility, their alignment with traditional market mechanisms has also diminished Bitcoin's independence from stocks. These shifts highlight a growing need for investors to look beyond Bitcoin. As its dominance wanes, cryptocurrencies like Cardano, Toncoin, and Remittix are stepping into the spotlight. Cardano's Stability Indicates Growth Potential Cardano (ADA) maintains $1.2 billion in open interest, demonstrating its enduring popularity among crypto enthusiasts, even as its price dropped to $1.06. Historically, the $0.90 price range for Cardano has been a strong support level, often leading to significant accumulation. Fortunately, technical signals suggest a possible recovery for Cardano, with the MACD indicating a bullish crossover and potential rallies toward resistance at $0.96 and $1.02. Toncoin Exhibits Strong Upward Momentum Toncoin (TON) is bolstered by robust technical and fundamental indicators, trading at $5.30 after a recent 4.45% increase. The asset's Golden Cross on the 4-hour chart suggests bullish tendencies, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates room for further upward movement. Predictions of a surge to $7.43 and a long-term target of $17.37 have analysts optimistic about Toncoin's future. Toncoin’s expanding market capitalization and increasing trading volumes underscore its growing acceptance. Its emphasis on scalable, efficient payment solutions makes it a strong player in the blockchain payments arena. Why Remittix Could Be the Best Investment Opportunity of 2025 Though Cardano and Toncoin are well-established, Remittix is the game-changing newcomer in the crypto and payments landscape. By integrating blockchain with traditional payment systems, Remittix’s PayFi concept facilitates effortless crypto-to-fiat transactions globally. What Distinguishes Remittix? Remittix tackles the challenges of conventional banking systems. Supporting over 40 cryptocurrencies, the platform allows users to convert and transfer money to any bank account worldwide. Businesses can use the Remittix Pay API to accept crypto payments and settle in fiat, making it perfect for freelancers and companies alike. Freelancers can generate invoices via the platform, while merchants have complete control over cashing out in their preferred currency. Capturing a Share of a $183 Trillion Market Traditional payment systems process trillions annually, but none integrate crypto and fiat effectively. Remittix is set to capture a portion of this $183 trillion market, challenging industry leaders like Stripe, Wise, and Coinbase. Presale Opportunity Currently in its presale phase, Remittix aims to raise $36 million. With only 750 million tokens available and a distinct value proposition, demand is high. Investors are eagerly joining, expecting rapid growth after its launch. To ensure project stability and confidence, the team tokens and liquidity pool are locked for three years. In summary, as Bitcoin's dominance decreases, the crypto market is ripe with opportunities for savvy investors. Remittix represents a groundbreaking shift in cross-border payments, while Cardano and Toncoin offer stability and potential for growth. For those seeking exceptional returns, now is the time to diversify beyond Bitcoin and consider these promising assets. With its innovative approach and strong presale momentum, Remittix could be a once-in-a-lifetime investment. Join the pioneers of PayFi with Remittix.

However, with its increasing correlation to the stock market, the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs, and shifting market conditions, investors are becoming more interested in altcoins that have the potential to generate higher returns. Among the top contenders are Cardano, Toncoin, and the emerging Remittix project. Here’s why: Bitcoin ETFs Triggers Changing Role in the Market Over the past year, Bitcoin's price fluctuations in response to macroeconomic events like Federal Reserve statements and Nonfarm Payroll (NFP) data have closely mirrored those of the S&P 500. Also, while Bitcoin ETFs have made Bitcoin more widely available, but by adopting conventional market processes, they have also lessened its independence from stocks. These changes show the necessity for investors to diversify their holdings outside Bitcoin.As its dominance faces challenges, alternative cryptocurrencies like Cardano, Toncoin, and Remittix are capturing the spotlight. Cardano Price Stability Shows Upside Potential Cardano (ADA)’s $1.2 billion in open interest, is proof that it remains a fan-favourite with crypto enthusiasts despite its recent price drop to $1.06. The Cardano price range of $0.90 has historically served as an important support level and has repeatedly resulted in high-volume accumulation. Thankfully, technical indicators are predicting a likely rebound for Cardano’s price as the MACD indicates a bullish crossover and a likely rally toward resistance levels at $0.96 and $1.02. Toncoin Signals Bullish Momentum Toncoin (TON) is supported by solid technical and fundamental indicators and is currently trading at $5.30 following a recent 4.45% increase. On the 4-hour chart, the asset's Golden Cross suggests bullish momentum, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows potential for additional higher movement. With forecasts indicating a breakout toward $7.43 and a long-term aim of $17.37, analysts are upbeat about Toncoin's prospects. Toncoin’s growing market capitalization and rising trading volumes highlight its increasing adoption. Its focus on scalable and efficient payment solutions positions it as a top contender in the blockchain payments sector. Why Remittix Could Be the Best Investment Opportunity of 2025 While Cardano and Toncoin are established players, Remittix is the revolutionary newcomer shaking up the crypto and payments space. Remittix combines blockchain technology with traditional payment systems in a concept called PayFi, enabling seamless crypto-to-fiat transactions worldwide. What Sets Remittix Apart? Remittix addresses the pain points of traditional banking systems. With more than 40 cryptocurrencies supported on the site, users can convert and move money to any bank account in the world. Businesses can also leverage the Remittix Pay API to accept crypto payments and settle in fiat, making it ideal for freelancers and enterprises. Freelancers can use the platform to issue invoices, while merchants enjoy complete control over cashing out in their preferred currency. Dominating a $183 Trillion Market Traditional payment networks process trillions annually, but none effectively merge crypto and fiat systems. Remittix is poised to claim a slice of this $183 trillion market, positioning itself as a serious challenger to industry giants like Stripe, Wise, and Coinbase. Presale Opportunity Remittix is currently in its presale phase, aiming to raise $36 million. With only 750 million tokens available and a unique value proposition, demand is soaring. Investors are flocking to the project, anticipating rapid growth once it launches. To maintain stability and confidence in the project, the team tokens and liquidity pool are frozen for three years. In conclusion, the cryptocurrency industry is full of chances for astute investors as Bitcoin's prominence waned. Remittix is a revolutionary development in cross-border payments, while Cardano and Toncoin provide stability and room for expansion. For those seeking extraordinary returns, now is the time to diversify beyond Bitcoin and explore these promising assets. With its revolutionary approach and strong presale traction, Remittix might just be the investment of a lifetime. Become one of the pioneers of PayFi with Remittix.

The price of Litecoin ( LTC ) rose to $126, up 26% from its lowest level this week. It was the second-best performing coin after XDC Network ( XDC ). Litecoin’s surge is primarily attributed to rising hopes that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot LTC ETF by Canary Capital . In an X post, Eric Balchunas, a Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, stated that the SEC had sent comments to Canary. These comments suggest that the agency may ultimately approve the fund. We had heard chatter that the Litecoin S-1 had gotten comments back from SEC. This looks to confirm that which bodes well for our prediction that Litecoin is most likely to be the next coin approved. All that said, new SEC chair has yet to start and that's a huge variable. https://t.co/cKFswPwcr0 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 15, 2025 Litecoin, a Bitcoin fork, has a higher chance of approval compared to other projects like Hedera Hashgraph ( HBAR ) and Solana. Both HBAR and Solana are proof-of-stake networks with staking features, which the SEC often considers unregistered securities. A Polymarket poll with nearly $10,000 in assets indicated that the odds of a spot LTC ETF approval rose to 60%, up from this week’s low of 40%. Analysts remain optimistic that the SEC, under Paul Atkins, will adopt a more favorable stance toward crypto ETF approvals compared to Gary Gensler’s tenure. However, it remains unclear whether a Litecoin ETF would attract significant capital from institutional investors. Data shows that institutional investors overwhelmingly prefer Bitcoin, which boasts over $120 billion in assets, compared to Ethereum’s $12 billion.

Litecoin price analysis LTC price chart by crypto.news The daily chart shows that the LTC price has gone parabolic over the past few days. This rebound occurred after the coin formed a double-bottom pattern around $96. It has now surged above the neckline of this pattern at $117.17, its highest level on Jan. 6. Litecoin is also supported by the 100-day moving average, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD indicators are both pointing upward. Therefore, the coin is likely to continue rising as bulls target the next key level at $146, which was its highest point on Dec. 5. This target represents an 18% increase from the current price.

Qubetics Is Skyrocketing as the Best Crypto to Buy in January 2025 to Catch Up,https://thecoinrise.com/held-back-from-investing-in-cosmos-during-its-bull-run-qubetics-is-skyrocketing-as-the-best-crypto-to-buy-in-january-2025-to-catch-up/,"Ever look back and regret missing out on major crypto bull runs? Cosmos ($ATOM) had one of those moments when early investors watched their portfolios skyrocket, turning modest investments into massive profits. Missing out on such opportunities can sting, especially when the price keeps climbing and you’re stuck on the sidelines. But the good news? The crypto market is always full of second chances, and 2025 might just be the perfect time to catch up. Right now, one project is catching serious attention— Qubetics ($TICS) . Its ongoing presale is creating major buzz, and this could be the next big shot for anyone looking to recover from past missed opportunities like Cosmos. Qubetics isn’t just another altcoin—it’s solving real-world problems that many of its predecessors couldn’t address. By tackling blockchain interoperability and simplifying cross-chain transactions, Qubetics is setting a new industry standard. If you missed out on Cosmos, ignoring Qubetics now could be an even bigger mistake. With its cutting-edge solutions and an exploding presale, Qubetics might just be the best crypto to buy in January 2025 for investors eager to catch up and ride the next wave of crypto success. Qubetics Is the Biggest Opportunity You Can’t Afford to Miss If you thought missing Cosmos was rough, imagine sitting out on Qubetics. You probably didn’t hear about the exclusive whitelist phase where early adopters got in without any upfront investment. Those who signed up for the whitelist were notified first when the presale officially launched at just $0.01—yeah, that low. Fast forward to now, and Qubetics is in its 17th presale stage, priced at $0.0501. Over $9.6 million has already been raised, with more than 14,600 holders and 420 million $TICS tokens sold. The presale is structured for serious growth: every stage lasts just seven days, ending every Sunday at midnight, followed by a 10% price increase. Missed the first 15 stages? No problem—you still have a golden chance to hop in before prices climb even higher. But it’s not just the presale that’s making waves. Qubetics is solving one of the biggest headaches in crypto: interoperability. Right now, moving assets across different blockchains can be frustrating and expensive. Qubetics changes the game by acting as a Web3 aggregator, seamlessly connecting leading blockchains. Think about it—whether you’re a small business owner wanting to accept multiple cryptocurrencies or an investor juggling tokens across networks, Qubetics makes it simple. With its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet , managing diverse crypto portfolios is as easy as using Venmo or PayPal. Now, let’s talk numbers because that’s where the FOMO kicks in. Analysts predict that after the presale, $TICS could explode. If $TICS hits $0.25, that’s a 398.73% ROI. At $1, you’re looking at a 1,894.93% ROI. And if it skyrockets to $10, we’re talking a mind-blowing 19,849.33% ROI. To put this into perspective, a $500 investment today at $0.0501 would buy you about 9,980 $TICS tokens. If $TICS reaches just $1, that $500 could turn into nearly $9,980. And if it hits $10, you’re staring down almost $99,800. That’s the kind of profit that could rewrite your financial story. The window is closing, but it’s not shut yet. With the current price still affordable and another 10% price hike around the corner, now’s the moment to act. Missing this presale could hurt even more than missing Cosmos. Cosmos Proved Timing Is Everything in Crypto Cosmos ($ATOM) is a perfect example of how getting in early can completely change the game. Launched in 2019 with an ICO price of around $0.10, Cosmos was all about creating an “Internet of Blockchains”—a vision for seamless blockchain communication. Fast forward to its all-time high, and $ATOM hit around $44 in 2022. That’s a staggering return for those who believed in its vision from day one. But let’s be real, most people didn’t pay attention until it was already soaring. Cosmos built a strong ecosystem by focusing on interoperability with its Tendermint consensus algorithm and Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. It wasn’t just hype; it solved a real problem. But like many early projects, it took time to gain momentum, and by the time mainstream investors noticed, the biggest gains were long gone. Even now, Cosmos remains a solid project, but the window for those insane returns has closed. If you were one of the investors who watched Cosmos rise from the sidelines, this is a tough pill to swallow. But the beauty of crypto is that it always offers second chances. That’s where Qubetics comes in. It’s tackling similar interoperability challenges but on an even broader scale, offering not just blockchain connections but also seamless cross-chain transactions, tokenized asset marketplaces, and decentralized finance tools. Cosmos taught us that projects solving big problems can deliver huge rewards—but only for those who act early. Qubetics could very well be the next big thing, and this time, you’ve still got a shot to get in before the masses. Don’t Wait for the Next Wave of Regret Let’s be honest—missing out on Cosmos was painful for many, but sitting back while Qubetics takes off could be even worse. Right now, Qubetics is set up to be one of the best cryptos to buy in January 2025 , thanks to its innovative approach to solving blockchain interoperability and its booming presale. Qubetics isn’t just another coin—it’s redefining how we interact with blockchain technology. And let’s not forget those massive ROI predictions. A smart move now could lead to life-changing profits down the line. The crypto market rewards those who take bold action, not those who hesitate. Don’t let another game-changing opportunity pass by. Take the leap, join the Qubetics presale, and set yourself up for massive gains in 2025 and beyond.

These platforms accounted for $1.4 billion in market activity in 2024, with projections estimating growth to $95.5 billion by 2035, according to Metatech Insights . Source: Metatech Insights Decentralized prediction markets use blockchain technology and cryptocurrency to facilitate betting on future events. These platforms rely on smart contracts and oracles to automate transactions and integrate real-world data, making them more efficient, transparent, and trustworthy compared to centralized prediction markets. Decentralized Prediction Markets in Scientific Research While sporting events and election outcomes have driven the popularity of decentralized prediction markets, there is a growing interest in using these platforms to predict scientific research outcomes. Benji Leibowitz, founder of decentralized science (DeSci) platform pump.science, told Cryptonews that pump.science uses crypto-funded research to generate open-source data and transform the future of longevity research. “Pump.science allows scientists to fund their own projects with tokens, while making that data available to the public. Users can additionally participate in prediction markets on the research outcomes,” Leibowitz said. Most recently, pump.science partnered with Solana-based prediction market Hedgehog Markets , allowing users to bet on the outcomes of longevity experiments involving mice. welcome to the RODeo – a mouse rotarod experiment mice are placed on a rotating rod (hence – RODeo) the rod accelerates the mice hold on for dear life when they fall, the experiment is over if this isn't hodling idk what is pic.twitter.com/9ROfuIO0Dn — Pump Science (@pumpdotscience) January 11, 2025 Leibowitz described one such experiment, called “RODeo,” which features weekly live-streamed tests using the rotarod device, a widely used tool for assessing mouse endurance and motor function. “Each week, mice are administered potentially life-extending compounds and undergo endurance testing,” Leibowitz said. Participants can access video footage of the mice, preliminary data, and insights from previous experiments to make informed predictions on which mouse will stay on the rotarod the longest. “Our goal is for anyone to be a scientist and make predictions about experimental outcomes. If research can be gamified and entertaining, and this entertainment value can help fund its progress. Here, citizen scientists can use predictive data, like the speed the mice move around their cage, to make an informed decision on which mouse will be the fastest.” Leibowitz said. Kyle DiPeppe CEO of Hedgehog Markets, told Cryptonews that creators on pump.science also get a percentage of all the incorrect predictions placed on the platform. The platform uses USD Coin (USDC) for transactions and runs on the Polygon blockchain to take advantage of its scalability and lower transaction fees. “Users put money on which drugs or placebo will work the best, but a percentage of the incorrect predictions goes back to the creators. This incentivizes scientists to create these markets to help fund their own research,” DiPeppe explained. Broadening Participation in Scientific Research Through Prediction Markets DeSci platform Stadium Science is taking a similar approach by encouraging broader participation in scientific research. Michael Fischer, founder of Stadium Science, told Cryptonews that the platform essentially lets anyone be a scientist. “The core of what we do is create prediction markets around scientific topics,” Fischer said. For example, Stadium Science hosts competitions to see which of its users are the best sleepers, who may have the most motile sperm and how intermittent fasting affects resting heart rate, or how vitamin C impacts sleep quality. who will win? @_TomHoward or @0xMikeyF pic.twitter.com/3cZJpuRTMz — Stadium Science (@StadiumScience_) January 14, 2025 Fischer believes that users competing with each other will enable people to strive to be their best selves, discover what works for them, and learn from others. “There is an intermittent fasting challenge where participants follow intermittent fasting protocols to observe changes in their resting heart rate. This helps in understanding the effects of fasting on cardiovascular health,” Fischer explained. The Role of Prediction Markets in Advancing Research According to Fischer, the challenges hosted by Stadium Science generate unique datasets that are invaluable for scientific research. “Prediction markets bring together a broader range of contributors,” he said. “Science thrives on interdisciplinary collaboration. Fringe knowledge areas can often lead to breakthroughs. With more people involved, science can accelerate.” Echoing this, DiPeppe noted that having users predict which drugs are most effective on platforms like pump.science should enable more accurate data sets. Additionally, data is streamed in real-time to Stadium Science, which may help reduce data fabrication seen in traditional science. Since the platform is fully decentralized, data generated belongs to the participants. Challenges Hindering Adoption Despite the benefits, there are challenges associated with prediction markets and DeSci platforms . Fischer pointed out that proving the accuracy and utility of the data remains a major hurdle. Limited on-chain data storage capacity and the high costs of storing large datasets also pose challenges. Additionally, legal and compliance issues must be addressed for these platforms to gain widespread adoption. For example, privacy concerns such as the right to erase data conflict with blockchain’s immutable design. “We believe DeSci will start with simple ‘toy’ experiments, allowing people to see their benefits and limitations firsthand,” Fischer said. “As trust and understanding grow, more complex trials will be conducted, eventually making DeSci the standard approach in scientific research.” The post Decentralized Prediction Markets Aim to Advance Science appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|AI crypto predictions|DeSci|Polymarket,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|MATIC|ZRX|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-01-16 17:15:44

Unglaublicher Start für Mind of Pepe,https://www.newsbtc.com/deutsch/coin-mit-massivem-potenzial-unglaublicher-start-fur-mind-of-pepe/,"Dieser Coin hat wirklich einen erstaunlichen Start hingelegt. Binnen des ersten Tages im Presale investierten Anleger 1,5 Millionen US-Dollar in Mind of Pepe. Doch was steckt eigentlich hinter diesem neuen Projekt? Und welche Chancen als auch Potenzial können sich hier ergeben? Unglaublicher Start für Mind of Pepe Aktuell kommt eine echte Flut von Kryptowährungen auf den Markt. Dies ist nicht zuletzt dem aktuellen Bullenzyklus geschuldet. Aufmerksamkeit erregen nur wenige von ihnen, doch wer es schafft, der könnte definitiv für Anleger einen Blick wert sein, da hier der nächste Hype lauern könnte. In diesem Kontext kann sich ein Blick auf den Mind of Pepe Coin lohnen. Dieser ist erst vor einem Tag in den Presale gestartet und hat in diesem Zeitraum bereits 1,5 Millionen US-Dollar an Anlegergeldern einsammeln können. Ein erstaunlicher Wert für ein vormals noch gänzlich unbekanntes Projekt. Hier geht es direkt zum Presale von Mind of Pepe Mind of Pepe ist dabei übrigens nicht einfach nur das nächste Meme, das durch das Internet geistert, sondern ein AI-Agent-Coin. Hierbei handelt es sich um eine Verschmelzung aus Kryptowährung und Künstlicher Intelligenz, die die Vorteile beider Welten wie Dezentralisierung und technischen Fortschritt miteinander vereint. So kann die Softwarelösung eigenständig Trends analysieren, kommunizieren und lernen. Konkret soll Mind of Pepe unter anderem zukünftige Trends in der Kryptowelt erkennen und somit das Geld der Anleger vermehren. Auf der Webseite selbst heißt es: ”MIND of Pepe ist ein sich selbst entwickelnder KI-Agent, der mit Twitter und anderen Plattformen interagiert und seine eigene Präsenz und Meinungen generiert.

Im Laufe der Zeit erstellt es seine eigenen Token und bietet den Inhabern von $MIND-Vorverkaufs-Token exklusive Einblicke, sodass sie als Erste von seinem wachsenden Einfluss profitieren können.” Damit kann der AI-Agent-Coin deutlich mehr als die klassischen Kryptowährungen die als Nachfolger des ikonischen Pepe-Memes erstellt wurden und am Ende des Tages häufig nur ein lustiges Bild sind. Hier geht es direkt zum Presale von Mind of Pepe Das sollten Sie außerdem zu Mind of Pepe wissen Dass dieser Mind of Pepe Coin sehr aussichtsreich sein könnte, zeigt wie erwähnt bereits das große Interesse an der ersten Phase des Presales. Doch auch beachtlich ist das Staking-Angebot von Mind of Pepe. Dieses offeriert Anlegern aktuell geschätzte 1184 Prozent an Rewards pro Jahr und das für die kommenden zwei Jahre. Dabei ist wichtig zu beachten, dass die Anzahl der Vorverkaufs-Token bereits festgelegt ist und anschließend eine Inflationierung der Coins geplant ist. Konkret ist die Verteilung wie folgt: 25% befinden sich im KI-Agenten 20% sind für Marketing angedacht 15% sind Staking-Prämien 30% sind für die Entwicklung reserviert 10% verbleiben für das Listing an den Börsen Dementsprechend kann sich aktuell ein Blick auf den gerade gestarteten Mind of Pepe Presale lohnen, wenn man bereit ist, für unter Umständen höhere Renditen ein höheres Risiko zu gehen.

Mind of Pepe ($MIND) , a fresh AI meme crypto initiative, is also garnering substantial interest due to its real-time market insights, hive-mind analytics, and collective intelligence from its community. The MIND presale quickly exceeded $1.5 million within just a few hours of launching its ICO, with investors who missed out on leading tokens in the niche eager to jump on this new, low-cap AI agent coin early. Given the initial excitement and presale success, some analysts consider $MIND among the top AI meme coins worth acquiring. Mind of Pepe — The New Sensation in AI Meme Coins Wednesday’s post-CPI surge was a revelation for those who thought the AI meme coin trend had faded. Typically, tokens that experience the most significant bounce during recovery rallies have the greatest underlying demand, making them strong contenders for the next bull market. After the favorable CPI report, AI16Z, AIXBT, and FARTCOIN were standout performers, surging by 14%, 35%, and 27%, respectively. Meanwhile, large investors and savvy traders who missed these gains are now scouting for low-cap tokens in the sector, fueling the demand for $MIND.

Additionally, Mind of Pepe leverages community insights, gathering valuable tips from social media experts through its self-managed X and Telegram platforms.

Furthermore, it's a strategic marketing move, as the agent can engage with social media influencers, create new trends, and even promote $MIND. It also maintains a self-operated crypto wallet and can launch its own tokens. $MIND holders might enjoy discounted access to future tokens like Fartcoin or Goatseus Maximus. With such a range of distinctive features, it's no wonder Mind of Pepe has risen as the latest viral AI meme coin. Is MIND the Top AI Meme Coin to Acquire? Low-cap AI meme coins are among the most coveted crypto assets in the market. Take the Solana AI token Moby, for example, which hit a $100 million market cap in just 3 days. Early $MOBY investors reaped massive returns, with one individual turning a $704 stake into $396,000, achieving a remarkable 562x return. https://x.com/kkashi_yt/status/1879259291783516639 Another investor transformed a $40 investment into $90,000 in just 41 minutes. Given that Mind of Pepe is still in the early presale phase, it's no surprise that astute investors are considering it one of the best AI meme coins to purchase. According to a price prediction from the popular crypto YouTube channel 99Bitcoins, MIND could potentially grow 10x following its IEO. https://youtu.be/KE7F64F9ZmI?feature=shared This forecast might even be on the conservative side, especially for early investors who stake their MIND holdings. The Mind of Pepe staking pool is currently offering returns in the four-digit range. However, these yields are intended to benefit early adopters and will decline over time. Additionally, the MIND price is on an upward trajectory as presale stages are selling out faster than anticipated.

The firm claimed the platform exploited users and allowed harmful content to thrive while profiting from its fees. Legal Action Against Pump.Fun In a detailed X post on Wednesday, Burwick announced it represents investors who alleged they were scammed by Pump.fun’s memecoin offerings. The firm revealed it has been working with these victims for months, hoping to hold the platform accountable for its actions. Burwick claimed Pump.fun took millions of dollars while failing to protect users from harmful content and deceptive practices. The legal firm believes the rise of memecoins is a major problem for crypto investors. These speculative assets, often manipulated by a small group of people, have become a risk to many. Max Burwick, the firm’s founder, compared memecoin trading to a rigged casino, where the odds are stacked against regular investors. Burwick Accuses Pump.Fun of Profiting from Harmful Content Burwick also criticized the platform for allowing offensive content, including drug use and abuse, to appear on its site. The legal firm alleged that the platform profited hundreds of millions in fees while its platform became home to disturbing content. In November, the platform disabled its live-streaming feature after these issues were reported, but many still question its lack of accountability. Burwick also pointed out that the anonymous creator of the platform has made it hard to hold anyone responsible. Pump.Fun’s Growth Despite Controversy Despite the controversies, Pump.fun’s popularity grew in 2024, making it a significant player in the memecoin market. Last month, the platform reported $80.3 million in revenue, although this is slightly down from November’s $93.8 million , according to DefiLlama data. This success has made Pump.fun a major part of the rise of Solana-based memecoins. However, its rapid growth has raised concerns about its ethical practices. Burwick is pushing forward with its lawsuit, inviting investors who feel wronged to join the legal fight. They hope to see justice for what they believe is exploitation and manipulation by Pump.fun and other memecoin platforms.

This strategic move positions Intesa Sanpaolo at the forefront of financial innovation in Italy, reflecting a broader trend of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies . This was revealed in a short video clip made available on X by Watcher.Guru . A Calculated Shift Toward Digital Assets This announcement follows Intesa Sanpaolo’s recent milestone: its first direct investment in Bitcoin. On January 13, 2025, the bank purchased 11 BTC for approximately €1 million ($1.03 million). Carlo Messina, the bank’s CEO, described this as an “experiment” towards preparing for future client demands while maintaining a cautious approach. “This shows there can be some attention to digital channels, but with limited investment amounts,” Messina remarked. The bank’s portfolio, which exceeds €100 billion in securities, highlights the relative modesty of the Bitcoin investment. Expanding Digital Capabilities Intesa Sanpaolo’s foray into Bitcoin is not an isolated event. In November 2024, the bank broadened the scope of its crypto desk to include spot trading, building on its existing operations in crypto options, futures, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) . This progression reflects Intesa’s strategy to position itself as a leader in digital asset services, particularly as demand from institutional investors and high-net-worth clients continues to rise. By making this direct Bitcoin investment, the bank signals its readiness to not only understand but also engage with the cryptocurrency market on behalf of its clients. The Timing: A Bullish Market Environment Intesa Sanpaolo’s move comes during a period of renewed optimism in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin’s value surged significantly in 2024, more than doubling in price following pivotal developments such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs . Regulatory optimism, further fueled by the incoming administration of U.S. President Donald Trump , has also contributed to the upward momentum. Currently nearing the $100,000 mark, Bitcoin is poised for further growth, with analysts predicting it could double in value by the end of 2025 . Intesa’s proactive approach positions it to capitalize on this growth while preparing its clients to benefit from the opportunities within the cryptocurrency market. Implications for the Financial Sector Intesa Sanpaolo’s entry into Bitcoin has significant implications for the financial industry in Italy and beyond: Pioneering Institutional Adoption: Intesa’s direct investment marks a pivotal moment in Italy’s banking history, making it the first Italian bank to invest in Bitcoin. This sets a precedent for other financial institutions in the country to consider similar moves, potentially accelerating the adoption of cryptocurrencies across Italy’s financial sector. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bridging Traditional and Digital Finance: By preparing to meet the Bitcoin demand of “bigger clients,” Intesa is effectively bridging the gap between traditional finance and the rapidly growing cryptocurrency market. This integration could encourage more institutional investors to explore Bitcoin as a viable addition to their portfolios. Reinforcing Market Confidence: The involvement of a banking giant like Intesa Sanpaolo lends credibility to Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. Such moves from established institutions can reassure hesitant investors about the legitimacy and potential of digital assets. Encouraging Regulatory Evolution: Intesa’s venture into Bitcoin may prompt regulators in Italy and the European Union to develop clearer and more supportive frameworks for cryptocurrency adoption, fostering innovation while ensuring compliance and security. Opportunities and Challenges Ahead While the potential benefits are immense, Intesa Sanpaolo’s move into Bitcoin is not without challenges. Regulatory compliance remains a significant hurdle, especially given the stringent oversight of digital assets within the European Union. Additionally, managing the inherent volatility and security risks associated with cryptocurrencies will require robust infrastructure and risk management strategies. Despite these challenges, the opportunities are equally compelling. By investing early and cautiously, Intesa is positioning itself as a trusted partner for clients seeking exposure to digital assets. This strategic alignment with market trends ensures the bank remains competitive in an evolving financial landscape. A Vision for the Future Intesa Sanpaolo’s preparation to address Bitcoin demand from its high-net-worth and institutional clients signifies a transformative moment for Italy’s financial sector. By blending traditional banking expertise with the innovative potential of digital assets, the bank is laying the groundwork for a future where cryptocurrencies are seamlessly integrated into mainstream finance. This bold step not only highlights the increasing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin but also solidifies Intesa Sanpaolo’s role as a pioneer in Italy’s journey toward embracing the digital asset revolution. As the financial industry continues to evolve, Intesa’s leadership in this space could inspire further innovation, driving the next wave of growth in the global cryptocurrency market.

Pointing out that the value of sold Bitcoins would increase greatly if they were held, Lummis argued that BTCs should be kept. “I am writing to request additional information regarding the U.S. Marshal Service's planned disposal of approximately 69,370 Bitcoins seized from the Silk Road case. Given the recent decisions made by the Court and the fact that these assets are currently valued at over $6 billion at market prices, this matter must be addressed immediately. The U.S. Marshal Service’s track record in handling seized Bitcoin presents an alarming loss for American taxpayers. According to historical sales data, the Service sold approximately 195,092 Bitcoins for a total of approximately $366.5 million between 2014 and 2023. At current market prices, those same Bitcoins would be worth over $18.9 billion, representing a loss of over $18.5 billion in unrealized value for American taxpayers, a staggering 98% loss in potential value.” *This is not investment advice.

According to reports , Chew will sit on the dais alongside tech giants like Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos. Google’s Sundar Pichai will also attend, making it a veritable who’s who of tech leaders. The timing is almost poetic, as TikTok’s future in the U.S. hangs by a thread with a possible ban just days away. This unexpected gathering comes after weeks of legal battles, high-level political discussions, and mounting pressure on ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, to sell its U.S. operations to an American firm. ByteDance hasn’t budged, and with Sunday’s deadline looming, the stakes couldn’t be higher for TikTok and its 170 million American users. Trump’s change on TikTok and the ban’s complex politics Donald Trump’s relationship with TikTok has been anything but consistent. Once a fierce critic of the app, calling it a national security threat and promising to ban it during his first term, Trump has recently changed his opinion. During his campaign, TikTok became a powerful tool for rallying voters, a move that played no small part in his return to the White House. Now, as president-elect, Trump has filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court, urging justices to delay enforcing the ban to allow his administration time to strike a deal. “Why would I want to get rid of TikTok?” Trump posted on Truth Social, attaching a graphic showcasing his massive reach on the platform. His legal team argued that a negotiated resolution would protect free speech for millions of Americans who rely on TikTok to connect, entertain, and inform. At the heart of the controversy is a law requiring ByteDance to divest TikTok’s U.S. operations, citing concerns over Chinese government influence and potential data misuse. Chief Justice John Roberts didn’t mince words during last Friday’s hearing, pointing out that TikTok’s parent company, based in Beijing, is subject to Chinese intelligence laws. “Are we supposed to ignore the fact that the ultimate parent is, in fact, subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?” he asked during arguments. The Supreme Court hasn’t issued a ruling yet, leaving TikTok in limbo. If the law is upheld, ByteDance must sell its U.S. operations by Sunday or face removal from app stores like Google Play and Apple’s App Store. Without a sale, the app could remain operational but without critical updates, leaving users vulnerable to bugs and security risks. Biden administration explores options Outgoing President Joe Biden’s administration has also been working on a contingency plan to avoid TikTok going dark. An unnamed official hinted at the possibility of a temporary solution, saying, “Americans shouldn’t expect to see TikTok suddenly banned on Sunday.” However, the White House made it clear that deferring enforcement isn’t an option, with one official stating, “Statutorily, we don’t believe we have the authority to do that.” TikTok has considered several last-ditch options, including keeping the app running without updates or bug fixes. But ByteDance’s refusal to sell has left its U.S. subsidiary teetering on the edge. Meanwhile, millions of American users have already started downloading alternative apps from Chinese developers, raising similar national security concerns. The law targeting TikTok passed as part of a $95 billion spending package, has drawn criticism from lawmakers like Rep. Ro Khanna and Sen. Ed Markey. Both have called on the White House to extend the deadline for divestment, arguing that a sudden ban would disrupt the lives of millions of Americans who rely on the app for everything from entertainment to business. “I’m hopeful that President Biden will listen to the millions of voices who don’t want the lights to go out on this app,” Khanna said, pointing out the app’s significance in American culture and commerce. Sen. Markey shares those sentiments, saying he’s pressed White House officials to delay enforcement but has yet to receive a clear response. Trump’s team eyes negotiated sale Incoming Trump officials, including national security adviser Mike Waltz, have signaled that the president-elect is prepared to step in to preserve TikTok’s access to the U.S. market. Waltz told Fox News that TikTok’s importance to American users and its role as a campaigning tool make it a priority for the new administration. Pam Bondi, Trump’s pick for attorney general, added to the uncertainty by refusing to commit to enforcing the ban during her Senate confirmation hearing. This hesitance, combined with Trump’s shifting position, suggests that a negotiated sale could be on the table. Congressional Republicans, like Rep. Mike McCaul and Sen. John Kennedy, have made it clear that divestiture is the only viable path forward for TikTok. “They have to divest by law,” McCaul said, describing Trump as a “top negotiator” who could broker a deal that satisfies both national security concerns and the app’s American users. Kennedy said, “What I’m hoping for is the owners of TikTok come forward and say, ‘We will never share Americans’ data with the Communist Party of China and here’s how that will be enforced: divesting from the parent company.’” He warned that ByteDance’s current ownership poses a risk not just to Congress but to American children. As the Sunday deadline looms, all eyes are on Washington. The drama surrounding TikTok is as much about politics as it is about technology, with the app becoming a flashpoint in the ongoing battle between the U.S. and China.

Solana (SOL), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Remittix (RTX) each offer unique advantages. Whether you're interested in cutting-edge blockchain tech, the allure of meme coins, or shaking up financial technology, these three should definitely be on your radar. Right now, the early 2025 presale of Remittix is capturing investor attention as more people recognize its potential for significant returns. Solana: The Speed King of DeFi Developers are flocking to Solana’s platform due to its ability to handle thousands of transactions per second, a testament to its advanced blockchain capabilities. Back in February 2023, decentralized exchanges on Solana recorded a staggering $3.8 billion in trades in just one day, while Ethereum DEXs managed $1.7 billion in the same timeframe. These impressive numbers highlight Solana's appeal for short-term trading. Yet, the journey hasn't been without challenges. As of this writing, Solana's price stands at $190, and short-term indicators suggest a possible decline. However, long-term supporters view this as merely a minor setback. With an active developer base and plans to integrate trending features like AI, Solana remains a promising choice for those with a long-term perspective. Shiba Inu: The Meme Coin That Endures Although Shiba Inu started as a humorous endeavor, it's proving to be quite serious. Despite a 17% drop recently, bringing it to $0.000022, dismissing it might mean overlooking its potential. The strength of Shiba Inu lies in its vast and dedicated community. Token burning continues to decrease supply, and projects like Shibarium, a layer-2 scaling solution, are quietly enhancing its ecosystem. While it might not reach its 2021 peaks again, it could surprise us in the next meme coin surge. Remittix: The Game-Changing Underdog Remittix is a forward-thinking cryptocurrency that should be on everyone's watchlist. Introducing Remittix—new players revolutionizing cross-border transactions. With support for over 40 token pairs and more than 30 fiat currencies, it enables instant transactions to bank accounts. This kind of service could make traditional VASPs like Wise take notice, not to mention crypto-only wallets such as Coinbase. In its early 2025 presale, the RTX token is priced at $0.0207. There's buzz that it might gain significant traction before its official market debut, expected to raise over $35 million. The cross-border payment services industry, valued at over $250 trillion, presents substantial growth opportunities. Why These Three Tokens? So, what connects Solana, Shiba Inu, and Remittix? The answer is potential. Solana is pushing blockchain boundaries, Shiba Inu shows meme coins' staying power, and Remittix tackles real-world issues with innovative solutions. For 2025, diversification is crucial. Solana offers a fast blockchain with high transaction throughput; Shiba Inu provides access to the meme coin arena, and Remittix delivers innovation in financial technology. These three should pique your interest, whether you're an experienced trader or new to cryptocurrency. The crypto landscape is full of surprises, but preparation pays off. From Solana's transaction speed to Shiba Inu's loyal following and Remittix pioneering decentralized finance for cross-border payments, each coin offers a chance to join the next big crypto trend. If you're intrigued by Remittix, its early 2025 presale is already making an impact.

Solana, Shiba Inu & Remittix",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/price-prediction-three-cryptos-that-are-vital-to-have-in-2025-solana-shiba-inu-remittix,"The crypto industry just does not stand still, and there are tokens that are on the list of favorites for those who are going to start investments to dominate in 2025. Among them, Solana (SOL), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Remittix (RTX) each bring something unique to the table. Whether you're chasing cutting-edge blockchain technology, meme coin momentum, or financial tech disruptors, these three are worth keeping an eye on. Currently, the Remittix early 2025 presale seems to be the major highlight for investors as more people discover the next big project with the potential to yield astronomic gains. Solana: The Speed Demon of DeFi Community Many developers are entering Solana’s ecosystem because the network is capable of processing thousands of transactions in a second under the rapidly growing blockchain technology. In February 2023 in Solana, decentralized exchanges achieved $3.8 billion in trading in a single day. Conversely, the Ethereum DEXs processed $1.7 billion within the same period of the study. Figures like that one can’t be fake – Solana is clearly a preferred asset for short-term trading. However, it has not been plain sailing through the journey. At the time of writing this article, Solana’s price was trading at $190; trading indicators pointed out that Solana's price may fall in the short term. Long-term believers though view it this way as nothing more than a blip, that is an obstacle in a race. The active developer community, along with the fact that Solana can and will incorporate trending features like AI into its system, makes it a safe bet for anyone who has a long-term vision. Shiba Inu Maintains Reputation as a Reliable Meme Coin Shiba Inu might have started as a joke, but it’s proving to be no laughing matter. Sure, the market hasn’t been kind lately—SHIB dropped about 17% in the last month, settling at $0.000022. But anyone dismissing it entirely might be missing the bigger picture. The thing about Shiba Inu is its community. It’s massive and loyal, and tokens are still burning like there’s no tomorrow, which helps reduce supply. Plus, projects like Shibarium—a layer-2 scaling solution—are quietly laying the groundwork for more utility in the ecosystem. Will it hit its 2021 highs again? Probably not. But could it surprise us during the next meme coin rally? Absolutely. Remittix: The Underdog That Could Change Everything Remittix is the next-generation cryptocurrency that everyone should consider putting their money on. For those who have been here before, let me introduce you to Remittix — the young guns shaking up cross-border payments. It provides support to more than 40 token pairs and more than 30 fiat currencies; it also enables instant transactions and transfers to bank accounts. Now it is that sort of functionality that may make traditional VASPs, such as Wise, sit up and take notice, let alone Crypto-only wallets like Coinbase. Currently during its early 2025 presale, the RTX token is valued at $0.0207. There are whispers that this one will already become big before it even gets an official release scene of the market ounce, which is expected to raise over $35m. The global cross-border payment processing services industry is valued at over $250 trillion indicating the prospects for growth. Why These Three? So, what ties Solana, Shiba Inu, and Remittix together? In a word: potential. Solana is pushing blockchain technology to new limits, Shiba Inu is proof that meme coins can have staying power, and Remittix is tackling real-world problems with a fresh approach. For 2025, diversification is key. It has a fast blockchain, which promotes a high level of transaction throughput; Shiba Inu gives exposure to the meme coin space, and Remittix addresses something as fundamental as innovation in Money. These three, we believe, should be of most interest to you – no matter if you are a professional trader, or still testing the waters with cryptocurrency. The crypto market is never short on surprises, but one thing’s for sure: being prepared pays off. From Solana’s ability to process thousands of transactions per second to Shiba Inu’s army of loyal supporters or Remittix being the first token to establish a decentralized finance platform for cross-border payments, each of these coins enables a person to hop on the next big crypto craze. If you’re curious about Remittix, the early 2025 presale is already making waves.

The crypto market revival and rumors of pro-crypto US policies under Trump might be the factors fueling the asset’s rise. SOL on the Run Solana (SOL) is among the best-performing cryptocurrencies today (January 16). Its price briefly jumped above $215, representing a 15% increase on a 24-hour scale. Shortly after, it slightly retraced to the current $210. SOL Price, Source: CoinGecko According to some industry participants, this could be just the beginning of a massive rally that may result in a new all-time high price. The popular X user Ali Martinez recently claimed that the “TD Sequential indicator” presents a buy signal on the asset’s daily chart. That said, the analyst anticipates a move toward $220. Jelle and Satoshi Flipper were much more bullish. The former thinks a daily close above $210 might proper a bull run towards as high as $330. Satoshi Flipper predicted that SOL’s price could skyrocket to a whopping $1,000 sometime this year if a Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) goes live. As o the moment of this writing, such a product remains unavailable in the United States. Nonetheless, some prominent names such as Grayscale, VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Canary Capital have revealed their intentions to launch that type of investment vehicle. The agency which approves or denies such applications is the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In less than a week, its Chairman Gary Gensler will step down and will be succeeded by the pro-crypto Paul Atkins. Some might suggest that the new leadership could adopt a more favorable stance toward cryptocurrency-related financial products, potentially facilitating the approval process for Solana ETFs. Is This Why SOL is Pumping? Solana’s impressive price resurgence could be attributed to the overall revival of the cryptocurrency sector. Over the past 24 hours, the industry’s market capitalization exceeded $3.6 trillion, while Bitcoin (BTC) briefly crossed $100,000. Another reason might be the rumors that the upcoming president of the USA, Donald Trump, is open to the idea of establishing a crypto reserve that prioritizes digital assets like Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and USD Coin (USDC). The entities behind those tokens are all based on American soil. This could be one of the factors triggering a massive price rally for XRP. As CryptoPotato reported , the asset’s valuation exploded to $3.39, missing its all-time high by just 1%.

Amid this remarkable price surge, recent activity by whales and investors has raised concerns about a potential sell-off. 80 Million XRP Moves to Binance The price of XRP has shown consistent growth over the past week, with a significant 45% surge. During this period, some whales and investors have dumped their holdings on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. According to the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, Binance’s XRP reserve increased by 80 million over the span of seven days, indicating a potential sell-off and raising concerns about a price decline. Despite this substantial dump of tokens onto the exchange, the XRP price remained neutral and showed consistent growth. Source: CryptoQuant Current Price Momentum Currently, XRP is trading near $3.39 and has experienced a price surge of over 16% in the past 24 hours. This impressive price increase has attracted significant attention from investors and traders, leading to a 45% jump in trading volume, indicating their participation during the same period. Expert View on XRP Despite the notable upside momentum in the past 24 hours, a prominent crypto expert recently made a post on X (formerly Twitter) and stated, “Buying XRP at $3 may seem like a good idea, but buying when I did at $2.48—and during the dip at $2.40—would have been better.” This statement by the expert suggests that XRP is still undervalued and has the potential to soar significantly in the coming days. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, XRP appears bullish as this rally follows the breakout of the bullish flag and pole price action pattern. Source: Trading View Additionally, the XRP price had been consolidating before this rally began, which is another bullish sign. Based on the recent price action, there is a strong possibility that XRP could soar another 32.5% to reach the $4.45 level in the coming days. However, as we approach President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration, this forecasted target seems easily achievable. Though time will tell what happens, it’s clear that sentiment and the cryptocurrency market are likely to soar once Trump takes his presidential oath.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|XRP|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-16 17:38:56

The headline CPI figure aligned with market expectations, rising 2.9% year-over-year and 0.4% month-on-month. More notably, the core CPI increased by 3.2% annually and 0.2% M/M, coming in below the forecasted 3.3% and 0.3%, respectively. Crypto prices skyrocketed following the weak core CPI print, with the Bitcoin price hitting just shy of $100k and XRP reaching $3 for the first time since 2018. However, AI agent coins are stealing the spotlight with a 25% growth in their cumulative market cap today. Experts are viewing VIRTUAL, AI16Z, AIXBT and new tokens like MIND as the best investments in the sector. Is The Crypto Bottom In Following Weak CPI Print? The broad-based recovery in the crypto market certainly suggests that Monday’s “long-legged doji” BTC candle to $89,000 could have been the local bottom. The Bitcoin price is trading at just under $100,000 two days later. Bulls calling Wednesday’s CPI “the most important inflation reading of their lives” wasn’t just a meme. The soft CPI print appears to have invalidated all bearish scenarios, considering even bulls like Fundstrat’s Tom Lee were gearing up for a drop to the $50k -$70k zone. In addition, Tuesday’s Producer Price Index data and the UK’s CPI also revealed that inflation concerns may have been overblown, even as levels remain far away from the Fed’s 2% target. For instance, the supercore CPI saw its lowest print since July of 2024. The US Dollar and the 10-year Treasury Yields, both of which have an inverse relation with BTC, fell following the weak CPI. In fact, DXY momentarily fell below 109 after trading as high as 110 on Monday, resulting in a broad-based crypto market rally. It is typically during these broader market recoveries that smart money investors find the best cryptos to buy. Tokens with the largest bounce have the highest latent demand. Unsurprisingly, AI agent coins are leading the charge. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) and ai16z (AI16Z) have posted the highest gains of any top 100 cryptocurrencies, rallying by 27% and 20%, respectively. The AI agent market cap is up by 25%, data from CoinGecko reveals. It is clear that AI agent coins and AI meme coins will be among the top performers in the upcoming altseason. Which Are The Best Cryptos To Buy Now As previously stated, VIRTUAL and AI16Z are the two top performers in today’s market recovery, which suggests they have the most latent demand, making them the two best AI agent coins to buy. Legendary trader Bluntz is also bullish on AIXBT, particularly following its Binance spot listing. The AIXBT price is also up by 17% today, suggesting strong demand for the token. However, smart money investors are also searching for low-cap AI agent coins, eyeing 10x to 100x returns. Unsurprisingly, a new token in the sector, Mind of Pepe ($MIND) has raised over $1 million in its ICO in just a span of a few hours. The project promises a “self-evolving AI agent” with its own X account, much like AI16Z. Besides cutting-edge AI tech, Mind of Pepe will also rely on community intelligence for market alpha. $MIND holders are in store for alpha market insights, trading strategies and a front-row seat to a paradigm shift. Moreover, early MIND buyers are also benefitting from its native staking protocol, which is currently offering a reward rate of over 1500%. Considering the demand for low-cap AI agent coins, it is no surprise that smart money investors are viewing Mind of Pepe as a 10x investment in the coming weeks.

The main CPI figure met market predictions, climbing 2.9% over the year and 0.4% monthly. Significantly, the core CPI rose by 3.2% year-over-year and 0.2% month-to-month, falling short of the expected 3.3% and 0.3%, respectively. In response to the weaker core CPI numbers, crypto values soared, with Bitcoin nearing a $100k milestone and XRP hitting $3, marking its highest since 2018. Yet, AI agent coins are capturing attention with a 25% surge in their overall market cap today. Analysts are highlighting VIRTUAL, AI16Z, AIXBT, and the newcomer MIND as prime investment opportunities in this space. Has the Crypto Market Reached Its Lowest Point After Weak CPI Data? The widespread recovery in cryptocurrencies hints that Monday’s “long-legged doji” BTC candle at $89,000 might have marked a local bottom. Bitcoin Approaches the $100,000 Mark Two Days Post-CPI Release Investors calling Wednesday’s CPI report “the most critical inflation reading of their lives” weren’t exaggerating. The softer CPI data seems to have dismissed all bearish outlooks, as even optimists like Fundstrat’s Tom Lee had braced for a potential dip to the $50k-$70k range. Moreover, recent figures from the Producer Price Index and the UK's CPI suggest that inflation anxieties might have been overstated, despite levels not yet reaching the Fed's 2% goal. Notably, the supercore CPI recorded its lowest figure since July 2024. The US Dollar and 10-year Treasury yields, both inversely related to Bitcoin, decreased following the soft CPI data. In fact, the DXY briefly dipped below 109 after peaking at 110 on Monday, sparking a broad crypto market rally. These broad recoveries often signal the best opportunities for investors to identify promising cryptos. Tokens that experience the most significant rebounds usually indicate high underlying demand. Unsurprisingly, AI agent coins are leading this charge. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) and ai16z (AI16Z) have seen the most significant gains among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, with increases of 27% and 20%, respectively. The AI agent market cap has risen by 25%, according to data from CoinGecko . AI agent coins and AI meme coins are expected to be top performers in the upcoming altseason. Top Cryptos to Consider Buying Now As mentioned, VIRTUAL and AI16Z have emerged as top performers in today’s market recovery, indicating strong latent demand and making them leading AI agent coins to purchase. Well-known trader Bluntz is also optimistic about AIXBT, especially after its listing on Binance. AIXBT has risen by 17% today, reflecting robust demand. Nevertheless, savvy investors are also on the lookout for low-cap AI agent coins, aiming for 10x to 100x returns. Notably, a new token in the space, Mind of Pepe ($MIND) , raised over $1 million during its ICO within just a few hours. The project is set to introduce a “self-evolving AI agent” with its own X account, similar to AI16Z. Beyond its innovative AI technology, Mind of Pepe will leverage community insights for market advantages. $MIND holders can expect market insights, trading strategies, and a unique perspective on market shifts. Furthermore, early MIND investors are enjoying benefits from its native staking protocol, currently offering a reward rate exceeding 1500%.

The South American nation has become a rising player in the global Bitcoin economy since Javier Milei took over as president. Now, analysts predict the country could follow El Salvador’s footsteps and go all in on crypto adoption this year. Bitfarms, Mercado Libre, and Globant are the trio of Argentine corporate entities leading Argentina’s BTC market activity. Argentina’s largest crypto-holding institutions Bitfarms is the largest holder, with 870 BTC. Founded in 2017, Bitfarms is a global Bitcoin mining firm operating 12 data centers in Canada, the United States, Paraguay, and Argentina. “ The changes we have implemented over the last six months have laid the foundation for a better future, ” stated Ben Gagnon, CEO of Bitfarms, in a recent event. He also spoke about the company’s transition from an international Bitcoin miner to a North American energy and computing enterprise. “ We enter 2025 as a stronger, more diversified company with tremendous opportunities, ” Gagnon added. Mercado Libre, a major e-commerce giant in Latin America, comes in second with 412 Bitcoins in its custody. However, Richard Cathcart, the company’s Chief Investment Officer, clarified in May 2024 that users of its crypto wallets own these funds. He asserted that the company owns zero BTCs. The company has been a player in the region’s crypto market. It launched its stablecoin, Meli Dolar, in the third quarter of 2024. Initially rolled out in Brazil, the stablecoin’s reach was extended to Mexico in September. Founder and CEO Marcos Galperin has consistently advocated for Bitcoin, calling the crypto “the future of personal finance.” Rounding out the list is Globant, an IT and software engineering firm that holds 15 BTC in reserves. Although its holdings are modest compared to its counterparts, the company’s CEO, Martin Migoya, supports President Milei’s positive views on crypto. Collaboration with El Salvador on crypto adoption Last year, high-ranking officials from Argentina’s National Securities Commission (CNV) met with representatives of El Salvador’s National Commission of Digital Assets (CNAD). The talks focused on sharing experiences and regulatory frameworks related to Bitcoin and broader cryptocurrency adoption. Roberto E. Silva, president of the CNV, praised El Salvador’s leadership in the crypto space. Silva noted that the country’s expertise in crypto regulations holds significant value for Argentina. This comes as it explores expanding its own crypto initiatives. “ El Salvador has emerged as one of the leading countries, not only in the use of Bitcoin but also in creating a robust regulatory framework through the National Commission of Digital Assets ,” he said. Juan Carlos Reyes, head of El Salvador’s CNAD, explained that the nations will share tips on how to support well-regulated crypto industries globally and expand the reach of regulated companies. To that end, Reyes commended Argentina’s innovative approach and high crypto adoption rate, citing these as key drivers for collaboration. While details of the agreement remain undisclosed, Reyes described the partnership as a foundation for greater regional cooperation. “This collaboration aims to foster knowledge exchange and promote innovation in the digital asset sector,” he explained. El Salvador, spearheaded by President Nayib Bukele in 2021, introduced Bitcoin as a legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar and launched the government-backed Chivo Wallet. However, El Salvador’s government announced that it could either sell or close down the digital wallet as per the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recommendation.

With the departure of the SEC chairman and the appointment of Paul Atkins as his successor, some investors are hopeful that the regulatory body might choose not to continue with the case. XRP Rises With Strong On-Chain Data XRP’s price has hit a new record high, topping its previous major high from 2017. This rise is fueled by increasing interest in derivatives markets. According to data from Coinglass, liquidations over the last 24 hours are approaching $43 million, with sellers experiencing the majority of these at $25.2 million.

This altcoin, which is primarily used for payments, has shown strong growth recently, increasing by over 12.6% in just the last day, 43.8% over the past week, and an impressive 460% in the last three months.

The lack of downward pressure on the price is due to the announcement that Gary Gensler will be stepping down from his position after Trump’s takeover. Over the last 24 hours, the total open interest in XRP futures on major crypto derivatives exchanges has increased by 14.07% to a new high of $8.17 billion, as reported by Coinglass. Additionally, the long/short ratio has made notable surges as it trades at 1.23. This suggests that betting against a price surge is surging as 55.2% traders are now expecting a break above the all-time of $3.4. What’s Next for XRP Price? XRP successfully maintained its position above the breakout level, showing that the bulls are still in charge. The price is now aiming for further surges as it holds its momentum above $3.3. As of writing, XRP price trades at $3.35, surging over 14.8% in the last 24 hours. The XRP price continues to climb, aiming to hold momentum above $3.4. If it stays above the EMA20 trend line, this will suggest a move toward $3.5, potentially leading the XRP/USDT pair towards a target of $4.84. As a result, XRP will attain a new all-time high. On the other hand, if the price cannot hold above $3.4, it means the bears are exerting pressure at higher prices. This might send the price toward the EMA20 trend line, resulting in a retest of the support level. This could prompt short-term traders to take profits, potentially driving the price down to the EMA100 trend line at $2.5.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-16 17:53:02

Reuters reports that an internal memo it has seen shows that Intesa Sanpaolo bought 11 BTC worth over $1 million on Monday. CEO Carlo Messina says the bank conducted the small trade as a test to prepare for clients interested in the nascent asset. “As a wealth management company that has the ambition to become like (Swiss rival) UBS, we have very sophisticated clients that may ask for this kind of investment and you can’t serve them unless you have a presence (in the market).” Intesa Sanpaolo is currently the world’s 36th largest bank with $1.06674 trillion in total assets at the end of 2023. Messina says that the purchase does not mean that the bank will become a Bitcoin player, as it has “very limited” room to invest in crypto assets. “We tested how to handle any potential requests from clients, but there will anyway be very tight limits and clients will need to prove they understand potential risks.” Analysts say the king coin will hit $200,000 by this year amid expectations of a more favorable regulatory environment under the administration of Donald Trump.

The billionaire investor and Donald Trump’s pick for Treasury Secretary didn’t waste time defending Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E). Scott declared the department “absolutely essential” to the administration’s economic policies. The department, co-led by Elon and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, is tasked with an impossible-sounding job: cut a third of the federal budget while keeping key programs like Social Security intact. Elon’s D.O.G.E plans to rewrite Washington’s rulebook Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E was born out of an October 2024 rally when Trump announced the initiative as a centerpiece of his second-term agenda. Standing beside Trump, the eccentric billionaire confidently pledged to reduce the federal budget from $6.5 trillion to $4.5 trillion. “We’ll simplify, streamline, and save,” Elon said at the time, drawing cheers from the crowd. The plan includes wiping out departments like the IRS and the Department of Education. These cuts, Elon argues, would free up resources and pave the way for a leaner government. But critics aren’t convinced. “There’s no way you cut $2 trillion without touching mandatory programs like Medicare,” said one unnamed policy expert. And that’s where things get sticky. Nearly three-quarters of the federal budget is locked into mandatory spending. With Trump promising not to touch those programs, D.O.G.E has only $1.7 trillion in discretionary spending to work with. Even Elon admits it’s a tough road ahead. Conflict of interest? Critics eye Elon’s government ties While Elon’s ideas are big, his business ties are even bigger. SpaceX alone holds over $15 billion in federal contracts, and Tesla isn’t far behind. Critics are already crying foul, accusing Elon of using D.O.G.E to benefit his own empire. “How do you audit the government when you’re one of its biggest contractors?” asked one skeptical senator during the hearing. Scott brushed off these concerns. “Elon’s track record speaks for itself,” he told the committee, sidestepping questions about potential conflicts of interest. Scott framed Elon as the ultimate problem-solver, someone who thrives on disruption. But not everyone in Washington is buying it. There’s also the issue of authority—or lack of it. D.O.G.E is set up as an advisory body, meaning it has no regulatory power. Its members will fan out across federal agencies to conduct audits and recommend cuts, but nothing they propose is binding. The success of their work depends entirely on Trump’s ability to push it through Congress. And Congress? Let’s just say they’re not all on board. Political experts predict a fierce battle as lawmakers dig in to protect their districts and pet projects. Without bipartisan support, D.O.G.E could end up as nothing more than a symbolic effort. Now, Elon and his team have set an ambitious deadline for their work. By July 4, 2026, they plan to complete a full review of federal agencies and propose sweeping reforms. Yet Scott remains optimistic. He pointed to the department’s deployment plan, which places teams inside agencies to identify inefficiencies. Details of this plan surfaced just yesterday, raising eyebrows across Washington. The idea of outsiders evaluating federal workers hasn’t gone down well with career civil servants, who see it as a direct threat to their jobs. Adding to the skepticism is Elon’s lack of experience with government operations. While he’s a genius in the private sector, critics say running Tesla and SpaceX is nothing like managing the federal budget. Public policy expert Donald Moynihan described Elon’s approach as “oversimplified,” focusing more on cost-cutting than understanding government complexities.

Considering the American tax filing system changes, MetaLawMan said he had to flag some clauses for 50 million crypto holders. Changes on Crypto Tax New Filing System According to MetaLawMan, the IRS Form 1040 poses a question at the top of the page under the filing status. The question reads; “At any time during 2024, did you: (a) receive (as a reward, award, or payment for property or services); or (b) sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of a digital asset (or a financial interest in a digital asset?)” While the question is presumably to uncover whether the tax filer has realized crypto gains, the inquiry is not generalized.

He specifically tagged Crypto & AI Czar David Sacks amid an industry-wide push for accountability. Controversial IRS Position This surveillance flag stems from an earlier controversy regarding DeFi broker tax rules the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rolled out in December. Per the new rules, crypto exchanges, including the DeFi platform, were mandated to report user transactions to the regulator. The demand, especially from the Decentralized Exchange standpoint, forced the DeFi Education Fund to sue the IRS . This lawsuit has attracted support from members of the digital currency ecosystem, with many calling for its repeal. The controversial stance of the U.S IRS and the Treasury Department also spanned staking services. The markets regulator unveiled plans to tax proceeds from crypto staking last year, another controversial move. Bringing Clarity to the US Treasury In a bid to correct the crypto tax surveillance of crypto investors, all eyes are on the US Treasury and changes that might be introduced under President Donald Trump. Trump has already nominated Scott Bessent to lead the Treasury Department. Scott Bessent is pro-crypto, and many are expecting crucial changes, including a potential repeal of SAB-121 accounting rules and bringing clarity on tax related affairs. Already, anti-crypto Senator Elizabeth has requested Bessent to adopt strict measures on crypto ; it now remains to be seen whether he will trail this path.

39060669,https://blockworks.co/news/transparency-of-btc-derivatives,1737050400,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,Risky business? Transparency in BTC-backed derivatives,https://blockworks.co/news/transparency-of-btc-derivatives,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . The rise of “ Bitcoin DeFi ” on new networks looking to scale Bitcoin has primarily come through bitcoin-backed derivatives like SolvBTC.BBN and LBTC. These derivatives receive staking rewards from Babylon, offering new avenues for liquidity and yield generation. However, concerns about the transparency of these platforms, particularly regarding the management of bitcoin reserves, have sparked debate within the Bitcoin community. A recent article by the co-founder of Nubit, known online as Hans, raised alarms about the potential for unbacked reserves and the inflation of total value locked (TVL) in platforms like Solv. These concerns highlight broader risks in the bitcoin-backed derivatives space, especially as market volatility persists. SolvBTC is minted by depositing either BTC or flavors of wrapped bitcoin so that solvBTC tokens mirror the value of the BTC held in reserves 1:1. But after that, solvBTC can be moved freely across chains and apps, making it challenging to track TVL. That led to allegations of double-counting solvBTC issuance. Solv co-founder Ryan Chow called the claims “a smear campaign, coordinated and orchestrated” by Solv’s competitors. SolvBTC.BBN suffers from a liquidity discount which deepened to 7% last week following a hack of the protocol’s X account. Solv has pledged to reimburse user funds lost as a result of the hack. Despite these clarifications, the core issue remains that Solv, like other bitcoin-backed derivatives platforms, introduces additional layers of trust. While some transparency improvements are being made, the underlying reliance on centralized mechanisms to mint and manage bitcoin-backed derivatives adds risk for users. As @0xTindorr pointed out in an X thread defending Solv, any bitcoin liquid staking tokens (LSTs) inherently carry additional risk. As the bitcoin-backed derivatives market continues to expand, ensuring these platforms are genuinely backed by reserves and thus remaining transparent will be crucial to maintaining trust and mitigating risks. Users must remain cautious, understanding that the promise of liquidity and yield often comes with hidden risks, especially when the backing of assets is unclear. Solv Protocol’s native token, SOLV, is set to list Thursday on Binance with a total supply of 9.66 billion and an initial circulating supply of approximately 1.48 billion at time of listing. The token’s launch, which followed a points campaign, adds a new layer to the growing ecosystem of bitcoin-backed derivatives. It will be revealing to monitor performance in this space in light of the potential risks associated with Solv’s expanding offerings. Other bitcoin derivative issuers, including Lombard and Bedrock, have been using points programs to entice deposits, often a prelude to launching a token.

This ADA prediction is majorly rooted in the advisory role of the Cardano co-founder, Charles Hoskinson. But that’s not it! Cardano price analysis also supports the prediction. While ADA prepared for a rally, SUI blockchain and DTX Exchange are set to explode more than ADA, reaching new ATHs! Cardano Price Analysis: A 25% Boom Likely Ahead Of ADA Cardano price is exhibiting a bullish technical setup, combining a double-bottom pattern and an ascending channel structure. The double bottom—a bearish reversal pattern—formed as ADA tested the $0.882 level twice, confirming it as a strong support zone. The subsequent recovery has pushed the Cardano price above its 50-EMA ($0.965 on the 4-hour chart), signaling growing bullish momentum. A breakout above the interim resistance near $1.026, which marks the neckline of the double bottom, would confirm the pattern and pave the way for further upside. Adding to the bullish case, ADA is trading within an ascending channel defined by higher highs and higher lows. The channel’s upper trendline, currently near $1.20, coincides with the double bottom’s measured move target, up 25% from the current Cardano price levels. The confluence strengthens the likelihood of the price reaching that level if ADA maintains momentum. Another reason for this price surge is the appointment of Charles Hoskinson as the advisor. SUI Blockchain Poised For 15% Rally! SUI blockchain has bounced off the lower trendline of its prevailing rising wedge pattern, exhibiting a bullish rejection similar to its price action in December 2024. Back then, the SUI blockchain avoided a breakdown from the wedge’s support and subsequently rallied over 40%, reaching the wedge’s upper trendline as resistance. The rising wedge, a traditionally bearish setup, has yet to confirm its downside bias as the SUI blockchain defends its ascending support line. The latest rejection of a breakdown attempt near $4.45, marked by a strong rebound and increasing volume, suggests a resurgence of buying momentum. Notably, the current price recovery has brought the SUI blockchain back above its 200-EMA ($4.48), a key technical indicator that could support a sustained uptrend. Further validating the bullish outlook, SUI blockchain’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart hovers near 45, leaving ample room for upside without entering overbought conditions. If buying pressure persists, SUI blockchain could challenge its interim resistance near $4.80 (50-EMA) before reaching the upper trendline at $5.32, up about 15% from the current price levels. DTX Exchange- A New Platform Set To Soar Explosively! Unlike existing trading protocols, DTX Exchange (DTX) takes a hybrid approach to trading—a blend of the best elements of centralized and decentralized exchanges. It represents the best of both worlds, assisting it in offering innovative solutions to key users’ challenges. Through a combination of an intuitive and user-friendly interface and decentralized principles like wallet-based trading and non-custodial storage solutions, it is poised to reshape the trading scene. Further, at its heart will be a unified hybrid blockchain: VulcanX. The VulcanX blockchain will fit conventional financial instruments with Web3 products. Remarkably, it will allow users to trade stocks, ETFs, bonds, and crypto instruments, hailed by experts as trailblazing. While the mainnet isn’t live, the testnet is, with an expected TPS of over 100,000. As a top ICO and one of the most promising new cryptocurrencies, DTX Exchange (DTX) is quickly becoming a favorite ahead of top crypto coins with limited upside potential. The low-cap DeFi gem is buzzing with promises, set to shake up the crypto market. Ahead of its scheduled listing on Tier-1 exchanges in Q1, over $11.8 million has been raised in early funding, highlighting investor trust. Further, a token is massively undervalued at $0.14 in round 7 of the ICO, cheaper and more promising than most top altcoins. Industry experts, filled with optimism, predict a 9,500% rally this cycle, positioning DTX as arguably the best new crypto to invest in. Alongside its staggering upside potential are its solid fundamentals as the first trading platform with a hybrid Layer-1 blockchain, on course to reshape the global trading scene. Key Takeaways According to experts, there will be a significant increase in the Cardano price during this session. SUI blockchain and DTX Exchange are poised to soar over ADA, hitting new highs as ADA braces for a rally!

In an announcement on Jan. 16, Ink revealed that Tether had selected it as the first blockchain for the deployment of the omnichain Tether ( USDT ) expansion and interoperability token, USDT0. The new token is built on LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token standard and aims to accelerate USDT adoption by offering a “unified liquidity layer” for cross-chain transfers.

The use of LayerZero’s OFT standard ensures that USDT0 functions as a “unified asset,” eliminating the need for liquidity pools or custom bridges. “Today USDT is the most popular digital dollar and stablecoin in the world, with hundreds of millions of users in emerging markets and developing countries… Continuing in this direction, I believe that USDT0 will help scaling the support of USDT across many more blockchains, pushing the boundaries of interoperability forward,” Tether chief executive officer Paolo Ardoino commented via X. The partnership with Ink makes USDT0 available on the Kraken Exchange. Other projects in the first wave of partnerships include MegaETH and Berachain. USDT0 works by locking USDT on Ethereum and minting the USDT0 token on Ink. This solution eliminates liquidity fragmentation for USDT, offering an omnichain experience for the community. USDT0 maintains a 1:1 backing with Tether’s USDT on Ethereum. Users can redeem USDT0 for USDT at a 1:1 ratio at any time.

33767162,[object Object],1737050730,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Las mejores meme coins para comprar hoy: El precio de SHIB, DOGE y PEPE se dispara hasta un 10%",https://bitcoinist.com/mejores-meme-coins-comprar-shib-doge-pepe-precio/,"Las criptomonedas basadas en memes podrían seguir su tendencia alcista durante todo 2025. Para finales de enero las principales memecoins podrían generar altos dividendos. Algunos inversores esperan que febrero sea el mejor mes de PEPE. Es todavía el primer mes del año y los traders buscan las mejores meme coins para comprar, sin importar su músculo financiero. La intención de todos -sea un inversor grande o pequeño- es encontrar aquellas opciones que tienen el potencial más alto para convertirse en el próximo hit y explotar. En ese sentido, las opciones más recomendables para estos días son SHIB, DOGE y PEPE , cuyos precios se dispararon hasta 10% impulsados por las expectativas positivas del mercado, el avance del BTC hacia la frontera de los 100.000 dólares y el comienzo de la segunda presidencia de Donald Trump. El sector de las meme coins fue uno de los más beneficiados durante el ciclo alcista de las crypto en 2024. Los tres productos que vamos a analizar están entre los mejores 30 por capitalización de mercado, y representan una de las inversiones más seguras a corto plazo para los inversores . Además, todas forman parte de la cultura meme, tan popular y querida dentro de la comunidad de entusiastas de las criptomonedas. SHIB acumula más de 4% en la semana El token de Shiba Inu muestra un comportamiento en verde al cierre de la primera quincena de enero, con un avance en los últimos días que ya está en 4% . El precio de SHIB comenzó el 13 de enero en 0.00002016 dólares y no parecía dar señales de vida hasta que experimentó un salto de poco más de 5% en unas horas para cotizar a 0.00002114 dólares. Desde ese piso, la cripto que usa de imagen un perro de la raza Shiba y que ha sido elogiada en el pasado por Elon Musk , no ha parado de crecer día tras día. Ahora mismo, cuando ya estamos casi en el cierre del viernes el costo de SHIB está por encima de $0.00002206 dólares. Si mantiene el paso positivo podríamos esperar un incremento de 10%. En cuanto a la capitalización de mercado , SHIB se mantiene como una de las mejores memecoins con mayor liquidez. En sus más recientes jornadas tiene un salto en sus operaciones de 2% para ubicar su total por encima de 2.100 millones de dólares. Debemos recordar que esta criptomoneda viene de un 2024 de récord con un aumento de su precio por encima del 100%. DOGE con buena perspectiva para un ATH DOGE es la memecoin más antigua y por ende la más grande en su categoría. Incluso, es un token importante dentro de la lista general ocupando el séptimo lugar por tamaño. En los primeros días de 2025 , algunos expertos pronosticaron un avance explosivo y hasta ahora va en ese camino. Para la tercera semana de enero, Dogecoin tiene un aumento de precio superior a 13% , que ha estado apuntalado por el paso redoblado mostrado en las jornadas, que se materializó con un aumento de los 0.33 dólares del 13 de enero hasta picos de 0.37 y 0.38 dólares en menos de 72 horas. De todas las criptomemes es la que mejor perspectiva tiene para asomar una posible explosión en el primer trimestre. El precio referencia para DOGE es 1 dólar, un valor que nunca ha logrado a pesar de su conexión profunda con Bitcoin y el apoyo que Elon Musk le ha dado en meses pasados. Sin embargo, todo apunta que ese récord podría ser quebrado en el futuro cercano. PEPE promete rentabilidad Pepe coin es una de las criptomemes estrellas y todo parece indicar que el 2025 también tendrá un papel estelar. El token que tiene de imagen a la popular caricatura de un anfibio ofreció rentabilidades por encima de 3% para finales de semana luego de un inicio un poco lento. Además, la capitalización de mercado también ofrece datos en verde con más de 7.700 millones de dólares de liquidez. El sentimiento que tienen los i nversores con Pepe es alcista y muchos estiman que su mejor mes será febrero. Si esto se cumple, entonces ahora mismo es un buen momento para adquirir posiciones pensando en obtener rentabilidades en cuestión de semanas. Con un precio actualmente rondando los 0.0000185 dólares, esperar un valor en torno a 0.000030 dólares no es una locura. Las memecoins , además, podrían salir beneficiadas del impulso que están teniendo las nuevas criptomonedas para invertir en 2025 . Con la subida de Donald Trump al poder en Estados Unidos, se especula que el valor de Bitcoin pasará por encima de 100.000 dólares en pocas semanas y esto redundará en las demás altcoins.

In this context, two cryptocurrencies are standing out, presenting potential entry points for traders and investors seeking opportunities. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is currently trading around $100,067 after a 4% rally fueled by the latest US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. Meanwhile, renowned analysts have their eyes on altcoins , forecasting an incoming altseason. Amid this backdrop, Finbold analyzed CoinGlass’s Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) heatmap on January 16, identifying notable buy signals across the cryptocurrency market. With the 12-hour RSI averaging 50.98, several assets are showing strong potential, offering promising opportunities for traders and investors navigating the sector’s persistent volatility. Cardano (ADA) Cardano ( ADA ) is positioning itself as a strong buy this week, backed by robust technical indicators and market momentum. The 12-hour RSI stands at 65.82, well above the market average RSI of 50.98, signaling steady upward movement while staying below overbought territory. ADA Market RSI Heatmap, 12-hour chart: ADA. Source: CoinGlass Shorter time-frame RSIs, such as the 15-minute RSI at 72.29 and the one-hour RSI at 68.7, indicate consistent buying pressure, with values close to the overbought zone. This sustained interest in ADA suggests a continuation of bullish momentum in the short term, as traders are actively entering positions, driving demand upward. Complementing its RSI metrics, all 14 tracked moving averages , from short-term exponential to long-term simple averages, classify ADA as a strong buy. With an 18.19% price increase over the past 12 hours, ADA’s strong technical setup reflects growing market interest, making it a solid choice for traders seeking to capitalize on its momentum and investors looking for near-term gains or strategic accumulation. Stellar Lumens (XLM) Stellar Lumens ( XLM ) is emerging as a strong buy, supported by robust RSI metrics and technical indicators that signal sustained bullish momentum. The 12-hour RSI stands at 68.65, comfortably above the market average of 50.98, reflecting steady upward momentum while leaving room for further growth. XLM Market RSI Heatmap, 12-hour chart: XLM. Source: CoinGlass Shorter time-frame RSIs, including the one-hour RSI at 61.64 and the four-hour RSI at 67.2, highlight consistent buying pressure, showcasing active trader interest in driving demand. Further supporting its bullish case , XLM has recorded a notable 19.3% price increase over the last 12 hours, indicating growing market interest and strong accumulation. All tracked moving averages, from short-term exponential to long-term simple averages, position XLM as a buy. These aligned technical indicators point to XLM’s potential for further upside, making it a compelling choice for traders seeking momentum and investors looking to position themselves for longer-term gains. While RSI provides valuable insights into momentum and potential price movements, relying solely on this indicator can be risky. A comprehensive approach that incorporates additional technical tools, market trends, and fundamental analysis is crucial for making well-informed investment decisions.

Web3Bay Presale Overshadows Solana Price Gains and XRP Market Trends,https://thecoinrise.com/730k-raised-in-weeks-web3bay-presale-overshadows-solana-price-gains-and-xrp-market-trends/,"Cryptocurrencies such as Solana and XRP are gaining prominence in 2025 due to their expanding networks and market activities. Solana is broadening its ecosystem with NFT partnerships and the soon-to-launch Seeker Mobile device, showcasing its leadership in blockchain tech despite its fluctuating prices. Simultaneously, XRP’s market has shown encouraging signs, with the SuperTrend indicator giving a buy signal and patterns that may suggest upcoming price increases. While Solana’s price is at key support levels and XRP is rebounding from a slow period, Web3Bay (3BAY) is emerging as an exciting new entity, merging blockchain with e-commerce to tackle real-world commerce challenges. With its innovative features and strong presale results, these projects demonstrate the varied opportunities present in today’s crypto market. Why Choose Web3Bay as 2025’s Premier Crypto Opportunity Cryptocurrencies have evolved into a multi-trillion-dollar market with wide applications across various sectors. Despite the ongoing market volatility, Web3Bay stands out in 2025. Web3Bay merges blockchain’s disruptive capabilities with the expansive possibilities of e-commerce. The platform reinvents online shopping by removing intermediaries, cutting down on fees, and supporting payments via cryptocurrencies or traditional methods like PayPal. In contrast to purely speculative assets like Bitcoin or Ether, Web3Bay offers practical solutions to longstanding global commerce issues. Its successful ongoing presale has already garnered over $730,000 with over 200 million tokens sold at a presale price of $0.0039675, positioning Web3Bay as a potential high-growth investment. The projected market price of $0.1959, staking rewards, an upcoming NFT marketplace, and decentralized governance underline its utility-focused long-term potential. For those looking to expand beyond common cryptocurrencies and engage with a project that has a real impact, Web3Bay is a leading choice for 2025. Its forward-thinking approach and presale achievements mark it as a transformative force in blockchain and e-commerce. Solana Price Prediction for Q1: What to Expect in 2025 Solana continues to aggressively expand its network with key initiatives. Solana Mobile has announced the mid-2025 launch of the Seeker Mobile device, which will integrate Web3 tools, NFTs, and advanced hardware to enhance the user’s blockchain experience. Furthermore, Solana has formed a partnership with Japan’s SBI Group to promote NFT adoption in Asia, including an exclusive NFT release through SBI’s Web3 Wallet, which is expected to boost Solana’s presence in the Japanese market. Nevertheless, the price of Solana has been unstable. Following a general downturn in the crypto market, the price of SOL dropped below the crucial $200 support level, sparking fears of a further drop to $150. Market analysts are closely watching these developments for signs of recovery. XRP’s Market Trends: What’s Coming Up? XRP has shown significant market activity early in 2025. A buy signal from the SuperTrend indicator suggests a potential major rise in price, which in the past has led to substantial increases, with forecasts reaching up to $13.85. However, the optimistic outlook is tempered by some investors choosing to cash out, with around $1.6 billion withdrawn during a six-week period of market stagnation. This cautious strategy reflects a balancing act between immediate gains and future prospects. Moreover, a bullish pennant breakout pattern identified in XRP’s trading, along with increasing trading volumes, points to heightened market activity and the possibility of further price gains. Traders are advised to stay alert to these dynamics, which could significantly affect XRP’s direction shortly. Wrapping Up! The crypto environment in 2025 offers a variety of opportunities, from Solana’s ecosystem growth sparking interest in its pricing to XRP’s increasing role in international payments and positive market indicators. Meanwhile, Web3Bay’s unique e-commerce model presents an attractive option for investors looking for real-world applications and significant ROI potential . Together, these projects underscore the transformative capacity of blockchain to redefine industries and foster growth. Whether monitoring Solana’s price, observing XRP’s market movements, or investigating Web3Bay’s innovative presale, 2025 promises to be a key year for crypto investments.

Model headwinds rising: Bitcoin peaked at $108,000 on December 17th, the day before the Federal Reserve eased, and our model might help determine what to look for in 2025. My bias is that $100,000 is formidable resistance, and the model shows top forces for Bitcoin’s almost 15% drawdown have been changing monetary policy expectations and crypto-specific factors.” Source: Mike McGlone/X McGlone is warning that Bitcoin’s correlation with the performance of the S&P 500 (SPX) is elevated, suggesting price volatility. However, he says if Bitcoin could stay above $100,000 it may suggest the flagship crypto asset is acting more as a store of value like gold, rather than a risk-on tech stock. “Bitcoin strategic reserve dependency in 2025? Bitcoin may need to stay above the $100,000 threshold achieved in 2024 to show risk-asset stabilization. My bias is last year’s launch of US exchange-traded funds, Bitcoin halving, record-setting stock market and re-election of convert turned zealot, [US President-elect Donald] Trump, may be about as good as it gets for stretched speculative digital assets.” Source: Mike McGlone/X He also warns that gold is showing market strength against the SPX, which could signal stocks may decline as well as Bitcoin if BTC’s high correlation with the SPX remains intact. “Do stocks face a lose-lose versus gold, Bitcoin? Despite increasing competition from Bitcoin, gold has been outperforming the S&P 500 (SPX), with implications for risk assets. Did the launch of US ETFs and Trump’s reelection change the trajectory/correlation for highly speculative digital assets?” Source: Mike McGlone/X Bitcoin is trading for $99,790 at time of writing, up 1.1% in the last 24 hours.

Now, she is questioning federal authorities. Lummis urges them to reconsider liquidating BTC and to reserve the tokens for future plans. In a letter addressed to US Marshals Service Director, Ronald L. Davis, Lummis questioned the timing, decision-making process, and transparency surrounding the sale. According to the Wyoming Senator, the BTC holdings are estimated to be worth over $6 billion at current market prices. The Bitcoins are linked to the Silk Road darknet marketplace seized in 2020 from an anonymous individual. Before that, the platform was dismantled in 2013 for aiding and abetting illegal drug transactions. At the onset of 2025, the US Department of Justice ( DOJ ) announced plans to sell the holdings following a federal court ruling. Lummis: US Marshals Service’s BTC record is underwhelming Senator Lummis also pointed out the concerning history of Bitcoin sales by the US Marshals Service, which manages the liquidation of seized digital assets. According to her notice, the agency sold approximately 195,092 BTC between 2014 and 2023 for a total of $366.5 million. This amount was reportedly lower than the current market value of those holdings, which would now be worth $18.9 billion. “This represents a staggering 98% loss in unrealized value for American taxpayers,” Lummis wrote. She stressed the need for a more strategic approach to managing digital assets. The DOJ has cited Bitcoin’s price volatility as a key reason why sales should be made swiftly. The government arm noted in a recent court filing that the value of the BTC seized tanked by $881 million in a single month. This is not a line of thought Senator Lummis wants to accept or concede to. She stands by a crypto power play from one government that was against crypto to another that is pro-crypto. Lummis suggests the decision could undermine the incoming Republican administration’s long-term crypto interests. Her letter also raised concerns about the lack of transparency regarding the government’s total Bitcoin holdings. She has questioned the protocols put in place to manage these assets. “Why has this information not been made readily available to the public in a transparent, up-to-date online format?” she asked. US government’s BTC wallet activity raises questions Last month, blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence reported that government-controlled wallets associated with Silk Road BTC moved $1.9 billion worth of crypto to Coinbase. The move spooked crypto investors, who interpreted it as a precursor to a large-scale liquidation. Since then, traders and investors have asked the US government to explain its crypto decisions. This follows a similar trend in Germany.

Lummis has pushed for clarity on whether the incoming administration’s policies – including Trump’s National Bitcoin Reserve proposal – were considered in the decision-making process. “The timing and aggressive pursuit of this sale raises serious questions about whether proper consideration has been given to the long-term strategic interests of the United States,” Lummis reiterated. Calls for strategic Bitcoin holding and planning Senator Lummis called for a reassessment of the government’s approach to managing BTC assets. She urged the US Marshals Service to explore alternatives to liquidation. She outlined a couple of questions in her letter, focusing on the rationale behind the planned sale. She asked for lessons to be learned from past transactions, and the implementation of mechanisms to align asset management with national interests. Excerpts from Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis’ letter to the US Marshals Service. Source: X “The magnitude of these holdings and their potential strategic importance to our nation’s future financial position demand careful consideration and transparency,” Lummis stated. She has called for the need for a more comprehensive strategy in dealing with Bitcoin assets. President-elect Trump has been vocal in his sup p ort of BTC. As usual, he has criticized past government sales as “short-sighted” and advocated for a more fitting look into the crypto’s potential.

This initiative is going to facilitate the compatibility of USDT stablecoin within various blockchain infrastructures. Through the use of Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard for USDT0 there is efficient cross chain asset transfer backed 1:1 by USDT. Tether Partners With Kraken’s Ink L2 for USDT0 Stablecoin In a recent announcement , Tether confirmed the deployment of its new USDT0 stablecoin on Kraken’s Layer 2 blockchain, Ink. This partnership marks a step in enabling smoother cross-chain transfers for Tether’s users. USDT0 leverages LayerZero’s OFT standard to facilitate token transfers across multiple blockchains. The OFT framework ensures that every USDT0 token minted on a destination blockchain is backed by locked USDT on Ethereum. Consequently, this maintains the token’s stability and reliability. Following the development, Tether CEO, Paolo Ardoino commented, “USDT0 introduces a much-needed solution for seamless USDT movement across ecosystems. It’s exciting to see this innovation emerge and tackle real market demand.” Notably, USDT0 debuted on Ink, Kraken’s Ethereum-based Layer 2 solution designed for institutional liquidity and optimized transaction speeds. The integration allows users to deposit and withdraw USDT0 seamlessly through Kraken’s platform. Tether plans to expand USDT0 to other blockchain ecosystems, including Berachain and MegaETH. This move will enhance liquidity access and broaden the reach of USDT in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications across different chains. Enhanced Liquidity and Efficiency with LayerZero Integration USDT0 utilizes LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard to streamline liquidity and token transfers across blockchains. The LayerZero protocol secures, accelerates, and reduces the cost of transactions by backing every USDT0 token with locked USDT on Ethereum. More so, the integration with Kraken’s Ink provides institutional users with a reliable and secure environment for managing USDT0 transactions. This approach simplifies cross-chain operations while maintaining reliability and security. CEO of LayerZero Labs, Bryan Pellegrino, expressed excitement with the partnership stating, “Years in the making, USDT0 is one of the most exciting things we’ve seen in a very long time.” Future Prospects For The Stablecoin Issuer Tether’s collaboration with Kraken’s Ink and the use of LayerZero technology underlines its commitment to expanding USDT’s usability. The deployment of USDT0 is a step forward in establishing a unified liquidity layer across blockchains. Moreover, as part of its expansion strategy, the stablecoin issuer has moved its base of operations to El Salvador. Tether secured a DASP license to legally issue stablecoins within the country.

Table of Contents Dogecoin price: A long road ahead RCO Finance: The rising star in crypto The shift from Dogecoin to RCOF How RCOF is poised to outperform Dogecoin vs. RCO Finance: A comparative outlook Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility and rapid shifts in investor sentiment. Dogecoin (DOGE) , once a top performer, is now facing uncertainty. With traders losing hope of reaching an all-time high (ATH) in 2025, many are pivoting toward RCO Finance (RCOF) , a project gaining traction for its utility and potential to deliver massive returns, with forecasts of a 22,098% surge. Dogecoin price: A long road ahead Since its rise to fame as a meme coin, Dogecoin price has struggled to maintain momentum. Despite sporadic rallies, Dogecoin price has been unable to break through major resistance levels. Why traders are losing hope Development: Unlike newer projects with robust ecosystems, Dogecoin remains limited in utility, primarily serving as a transactional currency. Market Saturation: With the influx of creative projects, Dogecoin’s appeal as a speculative asset is waning. Bearish Trends: Recent price movements suggest Dogecoin price might face prolonged consolidation, further discouraging traders. The Dogecoin price has remained stagnant, with resistance near $0.45 proving difficult to overcome.

Future roadmap With plans to expand its ecosystem, integrate more AI-powered tools, and launch on major exchanges, RCOF is set to deliver continuous value to its investors. Dogecoin vs. RCO Finance: A comparative outlook While Dogecoin has the advantage of an established community, its future growth is hindered by a lack of innovation. In contrast, RCO Finance’s focus on utility and technology provides a clear path to dominance. Why RCOF Outshines DOGE Innovation: RCOF’s AI-driven approach offers features that go beyond mere transactional capabilities. Market Appeal: As the crypto market evolves, projects with strong fundamentals like RCOF are attracting serious investors. Scalability: With its comprehensive ecosystem, RCOF has the infrastructure to support long-term growth.

Maynard proposed the “ Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act ” or House Bill 1203 to Oklahoma to invest in cryptocurrencies like other U.S. states. Motivation Behind the Bill Speaking on the motivation behind the proposed bill, Maynard maintained that Bitcoin represents freedom from manipulation either by government or private entities. He stated that Bitcoin prevents the system from printing away the purchasing power of the citizens, and as a decentralized form of money, it represents financial freedom. The Oklahoma lawmaker described Bitcoin as the ultimate store of value . He also noted that people who believe in sound money principles embrace the asset. Provisions of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act According to the bill’s proposal, if passed, Oklahoma’s savings accounts and pension fund could be invested in different crypto assets, including Bitcoin. If the lawmakers enact the bill, the State Treasures could hold Bitcoin or any other crypto assets with a market capitalization of $500 billion. The same conditions apply to stablecoins. As it stands, only Bitcoin qualifies as its market capitalization is approximately $2 trillion. Ethereum, the second largest crypto asset by market cap, is almost $100 billion short of cutting. Its market capitalization stands at $401.87 billion at current market price. Ethereum and other assets can only qualify when their value exceeds the prevailing price. However, the bill’s terms specify the public funds that can be safely invested in these crypto assets. It stipulates that crypto investments must not exceed 10% of the cumulative public funds. Other notable provisions in the bill include allowing the treasurer to stake crypto assets using third-party services. This provision comes with a clause that states the treasurer can retain legal ownership of the assets. Legislative Path to Actualization The proposed bill will gain legislative consideration at the next House session, which will commence on February 3. If it scales all legislative proceedings and gets approval for enactment, it would take effect on November 1, 2025. Oklahoma is not alone in the push for a Bitcoin Reserve Act. Lawmakers from other states, such as Pennsylvania, New Hampshire , and Texas, have recently pushed to accumulate Bitcoin by establishing a reserve in their different states.

In the face of uncertainty in the Avalanche market, 1Fuel offers a smart, defensive play for those in it for the long haul. If you’re looking for a solid investment with strong growth potential, 1Fuel could be the opportunity you’ve been waiting for. Keep reading to see why this token is generating so much buzz! AVAX price analysis: Is this the best crypto under $50 to watch? AVAX has been facing some bearish pressure recently, with a strong resistance zone between $40 and $42 that has been keeping prices from rising further. Whenever the price approaches this range, there’s been a noticeable increase in selling, which has established a solid bearish trend. On the flip side, the $27 level has acted as a stable support in the past, where investors have typically stepped in. This could become an important level again if the bearish sentiment strengthens, making it a key point for any traders looking for potential reversals. Market activity has been slowing down as well, with both open interest and trading volume decreasing, which signals that interest in AVAX is fading. The RSI is also showing a bearish outlook, dipping close to oversold levels at 35, although there hasn’t been a sign of recovery yet. That said, there’s a bit of a silver lining—AVAX has bounced back by 9.82% in the last 24 hours, now trading at $40.42. While the overall sentiment remains cautious, this recent uptick suggests there’s still some hope for a positive shift. In other news, The Uplink team aims to roll out the first physical Infrastructure Network, which will be an Avalanche L1 project that forms the basis for integrating physical assets into blockchain systems. This should boost Avalanche’s future appeal. With more short positions opening than longs, sentiment suggests traders anticipate further declines soon. However, for long-term investors, Avalanche remains a contender for the best crypto under $50, especially as analysts predict a potential rise to $50 by Q1 2025. 1Fuel: The top presale token for January 2025 with 100x potential Investors are increasingly focusing on investing on 1Fuel because it has identified unique opportunities in the blockchain market regarding its solutions targeting important deficiencies in the cryptocurrency space. It is developed with open access and ready for integration with the most popular cryptocurrencies and reliable wallets to enhance the convenience of cryptocurrency trade and attract both experienced and beginner users. This sets it uniquely apart to compete effectively in the congested world of cryptocurrencies. The project’s roadmap is also outstanding, and it involves successful partnerships with the largest platforms to increase the project’s environment and demand. Besides, 1Fuel incorporates such advanced solutions as a privacy mixer and seamless integrated cold storage so that investors gain even more control and privacy over their funds, which remains critically important on the contemporary scene. The most crucial element behind the intensifying trends is the clear mechanisms for its presale. 1Fuel provides a promise and rewards system for those backing early, laying a foundation for sustainable future growth. Trading at just $0.017 per token, this presents a fantastic investment opportunity for significant profits, especially during the presale stage. Its affordability has caught the attention of Avalanche whales, who are keen to invest in promising new assets with high growth potential. Market experts foresee a 100x boost in value post-launch, consolidating its position as the top presale token for January 2025. With its unique features, strong roadmap, and accessible pricing, 1Fuel is emerging as a prime contender for 2025’s best crypto investments, outshining even Avalanche’s previous performances. Investors seeking a high-potential opportunity should closely monitor this top presale token for January 2025.

Waller noted that the December inflation data showed “a very good performance” and that inflation appeared to be “gradually returning to trend”. He expressed hope that this momentum would continue and pave the way for a change in monetary policy. “If the data continues to develop this way, we have reason to believe that interest rates could be cut in the first half of this year,” Waller said. Noting that inflation has been close to the Fed’s 2% target for six of the last eight months, Waller reinforced his optimism. While he warned that unforeseen economic disruptions like those seen last year could delay policy changes, Waller argued that the trend of falling inflation remains encouraging. Waller also speculated on the potential timing and frequency of rate cuts, suggesting that if positive data continues, there could be “three or four rate cuts this year,” with cuts possible as early as March. He highlighted the strength of the U.S. labor market, describing it as “robust, not explosive,” and noting that strong December employment reports offset earlier weak data. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Futures Announces the Listing of Three New Altcoins Regarding inflationary pressures, Waller downplayed the impact of tariffs, describing their impact on prices as “marginal and short-lived.” Waller added that inflation stickiness had weakened, and he took a more optimistic view than some of his colleagues. In discussing regional factors, Waller acknowledged the economic impact of the California wildfires but said the effects would remain localized and were unlikely to significantly impact the national economy. Following Waller's comments, interest rate futures traders adjusted their expectations, with the probability of a Fed rate cut in May rising to nearly 50% before focusing on June. *This is not investment advice.

Lummis warns FDIC staff against destroying OCP 2.0 docs,https://crypto.news/sen-lummis-warns-fdic-staff-against-destroying-ocp-2-0-docs/,"Senator Cynthia Lummis has threatened criminal referrals for FDIC staff allegedly involved in destroying documents linked to “Operation Choke Point 2.0.” Whistleblowers at the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have alerted policymakers to alleged efforts within the agency to withhold and destroy information regarding what industry advocates have dubbed an anti-crypto campaign. The initiative, referred to as “Operation Choke Point 2.0” (OCP 2.0), involves a multi-agency crackdown on crypto businesses, with the primary goal of denying the nascent sector access to banking services. In a Jan. 16 letter addressed to FDIC Chair Marty Gruenberg, Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming warned agency staff against tampering with documents related to OCP 2.0. Lummis promised criminal referrals for anyone found involved in the allegations and demanded the preservation of all relevant materials, including those related to the wind-downs of Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank. Notably, Gruenberg has already announced his resignation ahead of the incoming Trump administration. I have also been informed by whistleblowers that staff access to these materials is being closely monitored by management to prevent them from being supplied to the Senate before they can be destroyed and that certain staff have been threatened with legal action to prevent them from speaking out. This is illegal and unacceptable. You are directed to ensure your staff cease and desist destruction of all materials and end all retaliatory actions immediately… If it is uncovered that you or your staff have knowingly destroyed materials or sought to obstruct the oversight functions of the Senate, it will result in swift criminal referrals1 to the U.S. Department of Justice. Senator Cynthia Lummis to FDIC chair Marty Gruenberg Almost shed a tear reading this to be honest with you. Justice is coming. We've fought for two years now for the truth, and we're finally going to get it. — nic carter (@nic__carter) January 16, 2025 You might also like: FDIC chair to resign as Trump-win thaws crypto scrutiny The battle over OCP 2.0-related documents has been a contentious issue between the FDIC and crypto participants. Giants like Coinbase have sued the agency for access to files, including the so-called “pause letter,” which allegedly directed financial institutions to “de-bank” crypto businesses. A judge ordered the FDIC to submit the relevant documents. However, Coinbase argued that the provided information was heavily redacted. A second court order chastised the federal agency for bad faith practices related to the case and demanded that the FDIC engage in full cooperation. The latest turnover from the FDIC revealed an attempt to cover up OCP 2.0 as the agency surprisingly released more documents after the court’s scrutiny, according to Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Remittix is gaining traction as a top crypto investment in 2024, with its smart PayFi protocol reshaping cross-border payments. Table of Contents Remittix: A new PayFi protocol that challenges the status quo Will potential Solana ETFs bring in massive inflows? Can SUI hit $10 in January? Join the Remittix bandwagon Remittix is rapidly gaining attention as one of the most promising crypto investment opportunities of 2024. With its presale already making waves, investors from established projects like Solana and SUI are shifting their focus to this PayFi protocol. Read on to find out why traders are making the switch to Remittix. Remittix: A new PayFi protocol that challenges the status quo Despite technological advances, the global remittances market is far from perfect as sending money across borders is costly and time-consuming. The average cost of sending $200 internationally is 6.4%, more than double the UN’s recommendation of 3%. This high cost, together with slow transaction times and limited accessibility, disproportionately affects developing nations and underbanked populations. That is why Remittix was created. Leveraging cryptocurrencies and linking blockchains with local payment networks, it allows near-instant crypto-to-fiat transactions. Remittix users can send fiat to any bank account, right from their crypto wallets, which is a game changing utility. This approach not only reduces cross-border transaction costs, it also banks the unbanked and bolsters the adoption of cryptocurrencies all over the world. As a result, it has drawn tremendous attention from the crypto world. Its presale is a success, raising $3 million in record time. This new altcoin is available for $0.0207 and is designed to fetch early investors as much as a 1,500% ROI during the presale stage alone. You might also like: Solana and Dogecoin holders rush to buy Remittix Will potential Solana ETFs bring in massive inflows? While Remittix is gathering steam, Solana is likely to have its own surge. That is because the SEC seems likely to approve a number of Solana ETFs. According to a research carried out by JP Morgan, these Solana ETFs could attract between $3 billion to $8 billion once they launch. This Solana news has sent SOL holders into a state of euphoria. Inflows of this magnitude will expose more investors to Solana, likely jack up SOL’s price, and fetch decent profits. However, this is still uncertain. It all hinges on the SEC’s approval of the ETFs and market sentiment can shift at any time. Can SUI hit $10 in January? SUI is a Layer-1 blockchain that offers a powerful, secure, and scalable ecosystem for the launch of dApps. Having hit an all-time high above $5 late last year, hopes are high that SUI will hit the ground running in 2025 and appreciate stellarly. As a result, SUI price predictions for January are in the range of $7 to $10. SUI currently stands around $4 and there’s a good chance it could hit these price levels before the end of the month. A big market movement with sustained buying pressure is necessary to achieve this feat though. Join the Remittix bandwagon Although recent Solana news projects a SOL boom and SUI is gearing up for a strong rally, Remittix is the go-to for those in pursuit of higher returns. Even SUI and SOL holders are jumping on the Remittix bandwagon. Its unique solution to real-world financial problems, along with the successful presale, positions it for greatness in 2025.

In a temperature check proposal submitted to the Aave DAO, the firm is offering to partner with the DeFi protocol to mine BTC. According to the proposal , Aave, which has grown to become a leading DeFi protocol in terms of total value locked (TVL), could benefit tremendously from mining. Blockware Head of Institutional Sales David Gamble explained that the successful lending platform could create a new revenue stream through Bitcoin mining, which would improve its balance sheet and position it for more adoption. Gamble wrote: “This isn’t just any treasury strategy—it’s an untapped opportunity that not only strengthens the protocol’s balance sheet but also opens the door to significant capital gains tax depreciation strategies.” The proposal also noted that Bitcoin mining as a strategy would benefit Aave-issued decentralized stablecoin GHO. GHO, which launched in 2023, has struggled to compete with more established stablecoins such as USDT and USDC. The Blockware proposal believes BTC mining could help GHO adoption rate. The strategy is expected to enable the integration of the Aave protocol into the Bitcoin network, expanding its reach and creating more market attention for the platform. Blockware wants to offer white-glove mining service to Aave A critical part of the proposal is the possibility of a partnership between Blockware Solutions and Aave. According to the proposal, Blockware has been offering mining services since 2017 and could aid Aave mining efforts without extra cost. Gamble explained that Blockware has economies of scale for its mining services, and the DeFi platform can leverage this to acquire Bitcoin mining machines at a significant discount while Blockware hosts them. He added that this strategy offers multiple benefits for the platform as they get their own discounted mining hardware that will appreciate over time, grow their treasury, and generate positive publicity. Interestingly, the mining expert noted that this is the best time to make such a move due to the current stage of the mining cycle. According to him, the cost of acquiring rigs is currently low, and there is an increasing appetite to acquire BTC among institutions. Aave DAO member questions mining profitability While the proposal is still in the “Temp Check” phase, where the proponent determines whether there is enough interest from the community, there are already some opponents. One member of the Aave DAO disagreed with Gamble’s projections, noting that Bitcoin mining is not as profitable as the proposal makes it. They observed that several publicly traded Bitcoin miners are unprofitable on a cash basis, adding that the proposal fails to account for several other costs, including the acquisition and hosting of the miners. In response, Gamble noted that publicly traded miners usually have more overhead costs, which is why they are not so profitable. He added that Blockware clients produce BTC at approximately $44,402.85, which represents a significant return on investment. However, the influential DAO delegate, Aave Chan Initiative (ACI), is also against the proposal. Its founder, Marc Zeller, posted, “The ACI is strongly against this proposal.” ACI is one of the key delegates responsible for decision-making on Aave, and its opposition increases the odds that the proposal will not get past the initial phase. Nevertheless, it is still a relatively new proposal that could be discussed further. Aave already holds close to $100 million worth of non-native assets in its treasury including ETH, stablecoins, and other cryptocurrencies. It remains to be seen whether its own mined BTC will join the list.

The court found that the crypto exchange willfully failed to establish adequate anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) protocols. BitMEX’s Response In addition to the fine, the company was sentenced to two years of probation. U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky emphasized the ruling’s significance, stating that it sends a strong message to companies that non-compliance with AML and KYC requirements will result in severe consequences. The development follows the firm’s guilty plea in July 2024 to BSA violations after a prolonged legal battle. The company had initially agreed to pay $110 million in penalties but faced additional financial sanctions imposed by the court. BitMEX responded to the judgment in a statement , expressing disappointment over the added penalty but highlighting that the amount was significantly lower than the $420 million the DOJ had pursued over the past three years. The firm characterized the charges as “old news” and expressed relief at resolving the matter, revealing its commitment to moving forward with a renewed focus on innovation and quality services. It also noted efforts to strengthen regulatory compliance, including implementing advanced user verification systems and comprehensive AML and KYC frameworks. Legal Fallout Court documents disclosed that BitMEX, founded in 2014 by Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed, with Gregory Dwyer joining in 2015, knowingly operated in the United States without proper registration or a sufficient AML program. Despite being fully aware of legal requirements, the company’s executives bypassed KYC protocols, allowing U.S. traders to access the platform with minimal verification. Investigations further revealed that the exchange deliberately took steps to evade U.S. laws and misled a bank about a subsidiary’s operations to funnel millions of dollars through the financial system, prioritizing profits over compliance with regulatory obligations. This latest judgment is part of a criminal case following separate settlements. Hayes, Delo, Reed, and Dwyer had all previously pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act and were sentenced in 2022. Earlier that year, the executives were also fined a combined $30 million in a civil case brought by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). At the time, BitMEX agreed to pay $100 million to settle with the CFTC and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Hayes also stepped down as CEO in 2020 and later surrendered to U.S. authorities in connection with the criminal charges.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. PEPE and SHIB enter accumulation, signaling growth, while a new Solana coin eyes 1000x gains amid the crypto bull run. Table of Contents Catzilla: The new crypto warrior’s meme coin PEPE: The deflationary meme coin Shiba Inu: A meme coin with Ethereum integration Conclusion The crypto market is buzzing with activity as certain coins show signs of potential growth. Analysts note that both PEPE and SHIB are experiencing a quiet accumulation phase, suggesting a promising future. Meanwhile, attention shifts to a new Solana-based coin, which some believe could skyrocket. With the bull run underway, opportunities for substantial gains are drawing investor interest. You might also like: SOL works to revive momentum while Catzilla emerges as rising star Catzilla: The new crypto warrior’s meme coin In an era where financial independence feels like a distant dream, Catzilla enters the fray. Born from the playful chaos of meme culture, this token isn’t just a coin; it’s a movement. Catzilla is primed to dominate the meme coin battlefield, offering explosive growth for those daring enough to join the fight. 14 stages. Unlimited growth potential. Channeling the spirit of a fearless cat warrior, Catzilla gives investors 14 thrilling stages to secure the mighty CATZILLA token before it goes public.

But be warned, warriors: time is running out. Only the swiftest and boldest will claim their share before Catzilla obliterates the competition. The cat takeover: Say goodbye to Doge dominance For years, the crypto space has been all bark and no bite with dog-themed tokens. But now, it’s time for cats to claw their way to the top. MEW and Popcat have already shown that felines mean business: MEW: Leapt into the top 15 meme coins with a stellar 103.7% climb in just three months. Popcat: Pounced ahead with a jaw-dropping 157.44% surge in record time. The message is clear: cats are staking their claim in the meme coin kingdom. If MEW and Popcat have paved the way, Catzilla is set to roar even louder, shattering expectations and reshaping the market. Catzilla’s mission: Chaos, profit, and a new era of crypto Catzilla isn’t just here to participate — it’s here to rewrite the rules.

This is a chance to join the rebellion. Time is running out, and Catzilla’s presale won’t wait for hesitant investors. The clock is ticking, the battlefield is set, and only the brave will secure their place in crypto history. PEPE: The deflationary meme coin PEPE is a meme coin on the Ethereum blockchain, launched as a tribute to the famous Pepe the Frog meme. It aims to capitalize on the success of similar coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. The creators implemented a no-tax policy to appeal to the crypto community, emphasizing its simple memecoin status without utility promises. In spring 2023, PEPE’s market cap skyrocketed to $1.6 billion, rewarding early investors and sparking interest in meme-based cryptocurrencies. This surge prompted the creation and fluctuation of other memecoins. PEPE’s roadmap includes listing on major exchanges and generating social media buzz, fueling hope for continued success as enthusiasts anticipate future market developments. Shiba Inu: A meme coin with Ethereum integration Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin and operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Introduced in August 2020 by an anonymous creator known as Ryoshi, SHIB launched with 1 quadrillion tokens. A notable feature in its early development was the transfer of half its supply to Ethereum’s co-creator, Vitalik Buterin, who donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and reduced supply by “burning” 40%. This act brought significant attention to SHIB. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB benefits from Ethereum’s infrastructure, allowing for innovations like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. There are plans for further growth through a future NFT platform and a governance system, suggesting expanded utility prospects. Conclusion While PEPE and SHIB may offer less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to all. With a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale and triple utility features, Catzilla unites crypto enthusiasts to join the fight against crypto villains and reach new heights together.

Whereas, President-elect Donald Trump seems to be prioritizing SOL and XRP for America’s first strategic reserve. These notable developments and updates are gaining massive attention from crypto enthusiasts, resulting in an impressive price surge. SOL’s Current Price Momentum Today, on January 17, 2025, SOL has experienced an impressive price surge of over 6.5% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading near $212. However, during the same period, its participation from traders and investors skyrocketed, resulting in a significant 85% jump in trading volume. Solana (SOL) Price Action and Key Levels Besides this development, Solana (SOL) appears bullish, as it has formed a bullish price action pattern on the daily time frame. According to expert technical analysis, SOL seems to be forming a bullish double-bottom price action pattern and is poised for a breakout from a trendline that it has been facing since November 2024. Source: Trading View SOL Price Prediction Based on the recent price action and historical price momentum, SOL could easily breach this trendline, and there is a strong possibility it could soar by 22% to reach the $265 level in the coming days. However, the performance of SOL has been impressive over the last three days, as it has soared more than 18%. Despite this notable gain, SOL’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still below the overbought area, indicating that the asset still has enough room to soar significantly in the coming days. $60 Million of SOL Inflow Onto the Exchanges As the price continues to rise, some long-term holders seem to be dumping SOL on the exchanges, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm CoinGlass. Data from the spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed an inflow of over $59.15 million worth of SOL. This on-chain metric indicates that long-term holders have moved their holdings onto the exchanges, which has the potential to create selling pressure and further price decline. However, looking at the current market sentiment, it won’t impact the SOL price. Additionally, a prominent crypto expert shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) stating that a technical indicator named TD Sequential is flashing a buy signal for Solana (SOL).",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-16 19:32:37

In a new announcement, Binance says it will be adding support for Sonic ( S ), formerly known as Fantom (FTM), to many of its programs. “Binance is excited to announce that Sonic will be added to Binance Simple Earn, ‘Buy Crypto,’ Binance Convert, Binance Margin, Binance Auto-Invest, and Binance Futures.” News of the addition helped push Sonic’s price up, as the digital asset went from a weekly low of $0.68 on January 13th to a peak of $0.835 on January 15th, a gain of about 28%. The crypto asset has since retraced and is trading for $0.789 at time of writing. Fantom was a layer-1 blockchain first launched in 2018 by a South Korean computer scientist as a tool to aggregate smart contracts into decentralized applications (dApps) as well as improve scalability. Earlier this year, the development team behind the blockchain announced a rebrand to Sonic as a way to improve transaction efficiency. According to Sonic Labs, previously known as Fantom Labs, investors can trade in their FTM tokens at a 1:1 rate for S tokens, which will have multiple functions within the Sonic ecosystem. “The S token will be the native token for Sonic. It has multiple roles within the Sonic network, such as paying for transaction fees, staking, running a validator, and participating in governance.

Selon les estimations de Messari, ces actifs atteignent une capitalisation boursière combinée de 11,3 milliards de dollars . Cela représente 0,34 % de l’ensemble du marché des crypto-monnaies. Leur poids actuel est, certes, modeste. Toutefois, les projections futures indiquent un potentiel de croissance exponentielle. En effet, leur valeur pourrait grimper jusqu’à 250 milliards de dollars . C’est l’équivalent d’une multiplication par plus de 20. Il s’agirait juste de l’un des segments les plus dynamiques du marché. CoinGecko est un autre acteur majeur de l’analyse crypto. Il répertorie 43 actifs spécifiques dans la catégorie émergente DeFAI (DeFi alimenté par l’intelligence artificielle). Ces actifs totalisent actuellement une valorisation proche de 3 milliards de dollars . Encore plus impressionnant, cette catégorie a enregistré une augmentation spectaculaire de 92 % de sa capitalisation au cours des dernières 24 heures. Des exemples concrets illustrent cette tendance explosive. Le jeton $VIRTUAL, issu de Virtuals Protocol, a vu sa valeur grimper de 35 000 % en seulement un an. Il est devenu un acteur clé dans le secteur des agents IA tokenisés. Sa capitalisation boursière actuelle est de 3,5 milliards de dollars . De même, le token ai16z a été lancé en octobre 2024. Il a enregistré une progression phénoménale de 15 183 % depuis son plus bas historique environ une semaine après son lancement.

According to local media outlet Izvestia, a man from the Mirninsky district of Yakutia is now detained in a maximum security prison after using cryptocurrency to repeatedly transfer funds to the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). The report says the man aided a unit of the AFU in carrying out intelligence and subversive activities against Russia by providing financial assistance. He is said to have received instructions to transfer funds to a digital wallet after joining a group on a social network. Says Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), according to the report, “A criminal case was initiated and investigated against a resident born in 1988 under Art. 275 (‘Treason in the form of financial assistance to a foreign state, international or foreign organization or their representatives in activities directed against the security of the Russian Federation’) of the Criminal Code of Russia.” Russia and Ukraine are taking advantage of crypto amid the ongoing war between the two countries. Following Russia’s invasion, the Ukrainian government announced it was accepting crypto donations for wartime support . Companies in Russia now use Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other digital currencies to engage in foreign trade as the nation faces Western sanctions.

Like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), Solana was among the affected assets that recorded negative weekly figures after showing signs of a bullish uptick. Despite these exits, a spark in Solana’s institutional demand has ignited explosive optimism in bulls. Solana Records Weekly Fund Inflows Solana turned the tide in a week that saw most altcoins in the red zone, holding on to weekly inflows. A new CoinShares Weekly Fund Flows Report shows crypto assets saw a modest $48 million inflows last week, a sharp decline from previous positions. Amid massive whale exits, the total crypto market cap slumped 7%, with billions liquidated within days. Solana proved its status as an institutional investor favorite, recording slight gains. Last year, the asset picked up consecutive gains as anticipation for spot ETFs grew in the United States. According to CoinShares, SOL notched a $15 million net flow to its funds, recovering monthly gains to $14 million. At the time of writing, total assets under management (AUM) surpassed $1.59 billion. Most traders view these gains as a catalyst for SOL demand. Notably, Solana rebounds faster than the wider market, leading to projections of explosive gains in the next bull peak. In the last 24 hours, crypto prices have gained momentum as most on-chain metrics flipped green. SOL trades at $212, moving up over 5% and recovering weekly outflows. Cardano (ADA) also notched swift gains as participants leveraged intraday trading to open new positions. The community dubbed ETH killer exchanges hands at $1.13, gaining 5.7% today. Ethereum Woes Continue Ethereum (ETH) lagged amid slight gains recorded on the institutional front in many altcoins. ETH saw $255 million in outflows in one week, changing the dynamics of Bitcoin and other assets. Ethereum loss comes as whales dump the asset to gauge little gains. After the ETH price fell below $3,300, several large holders heightened sell pressure, lowering sentiments. Overall, the market saw large outflows towards the end of the week due to macroeconomic factors. “ Although nearly US$1 billion poured in during the first half of the week, the release of new macroeconomic data and the US Federal Reserve’s minutes which pointed to a stronger US economy and a more hawkish Fed led to outflows of US$940 million in the latter half. This suggests that the post-US election honeymoon is over, and macroeconomic data is once again a key driver of asset prices,” CoinShares wrote.",Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-16 19:46:26

In the past year, TRON still saw its fair share of illicit activity, but it also saw an increase in intercepting illegal funds. Justin Sun, the founder of the network, recounted the 2024 achievements of the T3 Financial Crime Unit. He claimed the unit succeeded and maintains hopes it will continue to decrease illicit activity and recover funds in the new year. Scammers and dark market shops often chose the network for its low costs. The initiative intercepted some of the illicit volumes on TRON by making implicated funds inaccessible. Illicit activity on the network decreased by $6B in 2024. TRON also cooperated with Tether to track and return some of the USDT from hacks or extortion schemes. The numbers speak for themselves. Already seeing huge success for T3 FCU… and this is just the start. @Paoloardoino @Tether_to Looking forward to what we achieve together in 2025… and reading the full Crypto Crime Report from @trmlabs https://t.co/jS6jHCxgeq . pic.twitter.com/QPvarHg6uH — H.E. Justin Sun 🍌 (@justinsuntron) January 16, 2025 TRON ramped up action against illicit activity The recent 2024 report by TRM reveals threats still exist. It also presented evidence that mitigation strategies have helped to decrease illicit activity. TRON joined the effort to remove fraud from its network in a bid to improve its reputation. The network aimed to join the 2024 boom for multiple token trends, but faced some skepticism on the real value of its assets. TRON also tried to repair its reputation before becoming a carrier for WBTC, one of the most valuable DeFi assets. In 2024, stablecoins carried a bigger share of crypto transactions, which together exceeded $10.6 trillion, up 56% from the bear market of 2023. TRON achieved records for both transaction counts and volumes toward the end of 2024. TRON carries a significant share of professional and whale transactions, with a big part of the volume for transactions over $100K and in the millions. TRC-20 USDT expanded its volumes to new records toward the end of 2024. | Source: Dune Analytics TRC-20 USDT slightly decreased its supply toward the end of 2024, down to 59.75B tokens. The network still carried over $7B liquidity in bridged assets and its native DeFi protocols, relying on the stablecoin for collaterals and general transfers. TRON had to deal with the highest volumes of illicit activity TRON retained legacy status as one of the chains with the highest levels of illicit activity, primarily in the form of USDT transactions. The stablecoin transfers often ended up on the Huione Guarantee market , which accepted payments in TRC-20 USDT. The token offered immediate transfers with much lower fees while being widely recognized as a payment tool in some regions. As a result, TRON carried up to 58% of illicit volume, compared to 24% for Ethereum, and 12% for Bitcoin. Binance Smart Chain and Polygon together contributed 6% of transactions from threat actors, sanctioned locations, scams, or blacklisted addresses. Threat actors and scammers prefer networks with low transaction fees, surplus DeFi contracts, and active stablecoins. Around 49% of TRON’s illicit transactions involved sanctioned entities, while 32% was for blacklisted funds. Sanctioned wallets belonged to Russian individuals, and contained addresses traced to terrorism funding. This type of illicit transaction was more common, as more organizations found their way to the most active chains. The blacklisted addresses were a key contribution to TRON’s investigations, as the threat actors were no longer capable of accessing the funds. The token freezes were part of the T3 FCU activity, combining the capabilities of TRON and Tether, Inc. The initiative intercepted a total of $132M in the first few months since its launch. Fraud was a significant part of illicit transactions, though the activity also slowed down in 2024. Confidence scams received around $2.5B based on TRM estimates, down 58% in 2023. On the other hand, dark marketplaces resumed their activity, rising by 20% from 2023 levels. Illegal item purchases reached $2.4B, with $600M in incoming traffic to identified illicit traders. Trading for illegal items accelerated in the past year as traders became more proactive and spread to multiple platforms, including social media and Telegram apps.

Elon Bromance (ELOBRO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOBRO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Bromance can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Bromance could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Bromance launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Bromance on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Bromance by entering its contract address – FY7aYv7K3yEE9Z8hzgURj5z7biTE8Z6BpunBPAnCEpxj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELOBRO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-16 19:53:00

Among the top 10 crypto by market cap, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) recorded double-digit gains.

DOGE and ADA Swing Forward Dogecoin saw fair gains before recording larger inflows in the last 24 hours. The asset is up 10.1%, trading at $0.3836, taking its market cap to $56.6 billion. Meme coins often react to the broader market, and due to volatility, they swing sharply in the overriding direction. Despite creeping volumes, daily volumes improved with meme coin bull resuming accumulations. Dogecoin whales have amassed huge assets, buying the dip as anticipation grows. Rising whale activity has affected other meme coins, suggesting an 85% volume rise. According to meme traders in crypto spaces, the last dip can trigger a spark in price due to the broader price cycle. Elon Musk’s nomination to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) rallies investors as Trump’s inauguration nears. Trump’s pro-crypto plans to position the US as a global crypto leader resonated among institutional participants. On the other hand, ADA recorded a similar 10% growth, bouncing stronger after the recent dip. The asset’s rally wiped off weekly losses, placing flow gains at 2%. Demand for ADA comes from institutional leaning to its decentralized ecosystem and project roadmap over the years. The last quarter was bullish for the asset’s DeFi numbers. At press time, the network boasts $534 million in TVL, while daily volumes are up $7 million. Will The Surge Sustain? Generally, crypto corrections are still expected but the market has not hit its bull peak in this cycle. Volatility concerns and negative macro factors bite down on bullish gains, changing the market sentiments. Digital asset investor CryptoJellNL hinted at more gains as the market capitalization grows. “ They want you to be bearish crypto here, and judging by the state of my replies over the last few days — it’s working. Meanwhile, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization looks like it’s going a lot higher. The best is yet to come.” Institutional investors remain key for the wider market to retest December highs. This will lead to inflows in DOGE and other meme coins coupled with DeFi growth, which impacts ADA price.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano|Doge|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,ADA|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-16 19:53:39

Table of Contents Ripple breaches $2.8 resistance Cardano rises over $1 DTX Exchange: Fractional trading excellence for maximum gains Conclusion Recently, both Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) have been in the news. Cardano (ADA) because of its co-founder Charles Hoskinson’s close links with the incoming Trump administration, while Ripple is in the news due to its regulatory issues with the SEC. Both of these coins have done well in the post-election market surges, but both slumped in 2025. However, since mid-January, both coins are back to bullish behavior as they booked double-digit gains as the markets appear to revive. Both these coins are predicted to hit new ATH this Q1; however, recent predictions place DTX Exchange (DTX) as the most likely to hit a new all-time high in this bull cycle. It is currently in hyped status and positioned as one of the most serious crypto launches of 2025.

Price targets have been as realistic as $3 and as high as $5. Cardano rises over $1 Cardano is another bearish crypto coin that has turned bullish early. The ADA token has been bearish for most of late December and January. However, in the past 24 hours, Cardano has gained over 10% value, rising from $0.95 to $1.05 Source: CoinMarketCap Market volume is $1.45 billion, which is down almost half a percent, which is exciting some investors as they prepare for another big surge. However, traders are still cautious, since Cardano (ADA) has already booked strong gains, many do not expect it to rally enough to touch another ATH this bull cycle. DTX Exchange: Fractional trading excellence for maximum gains DTX Exchange is a trading platform that boasts of a trader’s bucket list of trading features.

Data shows that optimism on the meme coin grew, fueled by an uptick in the coin’s open interest and an ongoing price recovery that led the token to breach its resistance level. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Absorb $1 Million Loss As Market Caution Intensifies Dogecoin Open Interest Hits $4.7 Billion Analysts believe that Dogecoin could potentially experience a rally that would lead to the meme coin hitting the $0.39 level, saying that the token is currently on a recovery mode and gaining momentum. One of the positive indicators that tell a possible upward trend for DOGE is open interest. Data show that there is growth in the open interest in the token. According to CoinGlass, open interest in Dogecoin surged by nearly 10% in the last 24 hours, allowing the meme coin to hit $4.74 billion. Meanwhile, a crypto analyst noted that the long-to-short ratio of 0.9964 might show a slightly higher number of bearish positions. Still, the token is on the positive side in terms of volume-weighted funding rate which has increased by 0.0098% — an indicator that investors are willing to pay a premium to maintain their bullish positions. Overall, analysts are confident that the derivatives data points suggest that the upward movement for the largest meme coin would continue. Remaining Above The Fibonacci Support Level Crypto analysts noted that DOGE reached a price of $0.31385, which remains above its 23.62% Fibonacci support level. They highlighted that while DOGE initially faced strong bearish pressure, the token managed to recover and gain bullish momentum. Market observers said that data indicated that the price of DOGE soared to near the 50% Fibonacci level, trading at $0.3675 and seeing a series of consecutive bullish candles. Dogecoin climbed above the 200 EMA line and reached the 38% Fibonacci level, driving the higher likelihood of positive crossovers for the token. Moreover, indicators highlighted that DOGE has reached its overbought boundary in its 4-hour RSI, supporting the chances that the token will continue to surge. As of press time, Dogecoin is being traded at $0.3776 with a total market capitalization of $55 billion. DOGE is up 3.1% and 15.8% in the daily and weekly frames, data from Coingecko shows.

Crypto observers noted a 5% increase in the altcoin market, another metric that could help Dogecoin with its upward trend.

This strategy, which relies on Japan's ultra-low interest rates, is facing significant pressure due to expectations of a rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BOJ). “The BOJ rate hike will likely cause a significant unwinding of yen carry trades, which could dampen the enthusiasm of the ‘Trump Trade’ market,” Marcin Kazmierczak, COO of RedStone Oracles, told Reuters. WeFi Head of Growth Agne Linge shared similar concerns, saying that the rate hike could lead investors to sell risky assets like Bitcoin to cover carry trade loans. The yen carry trade, a long-standing investment strategy in which investors borrow yen at low interest rates to invest in higher-yielding global assets, could face a serious unraveling if the BOJ raises interest rates. Markets are closely watching the BOJ’s policy meetings next Thursday and Friday, with speculation the central bank could raise its short-term interest rate target to 0.45% from 0.25%. Hawkish signals from BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda and rising Japanese government bond (JGB) yields have fueled these expectations. A stronger yen would raise borrowing costs for investors using carry trades, potentially making it harder to liquidate global equities and riskier assets like BTC. Related News: Spot ETF Hype for Surprise Altcoin: Countdown for SEC's Decision Begins “If the BOJ raises rates, this could strengthen the yen and cause rapid unwinding of risky asset positions, causing a ripple effect in global markets, as we saw in early August 2024 when Bitcoin fell from $66,000 to $55,000 in a week,” Kazmierczak said. While the weakening of the yen carry trade could dampen optimism around the “Trump Trade,” a term used to describe market optimism tied to President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-growth policies, Kazmierczak believes the impact will be gradual. “The important thing will be to watch how they balance domestic inflation targets against global market stability,” he said. Bitcoin markets remain particularly fragile. BTC has already seen high volatility as investors monitor both BOJ policies and US economic developments. However, positive US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released earlier this week supported risk sentiment. “Core CPI data showed inflation rose less than expected,” Linge said, adding: “With the upcoming inauguration, the so-called ‘Trump Trade’ effect is likely to trigger a breakout in Bitcoin price, pushing it close to all-time highs.” *This is not investment advice.

As his inauguration draws near, investors are betting big on small-cap cryptocurrencies, driving up prices. The market is flooded with anticipation, and it’s not subtle. XRP shot up 13%, and Litecoin soared a ridiculous 22%. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is hanging around $100,000 after a modest 1% gain, and Ethereum, oddly enough, dropped 3%. Everyone’s chasing gains before Trump officially steps into office, hoping his pro-crypto agenda will electrocute the market. Altcoins are stealing Bitcoin’s thunder Since Trump’s election win in November, the CoinDesk 20 index has skyrocketed 98%, with Bitcoin itself posting a respectable 46% gain in the same period. But those numbers pale in comparison to what’s happening with smaller coins. One wild theory making the rounds is that Trump’s team could establish an “American crypto reserve.” This would supposedly include XRP and Solana. While most experts think this is a long shot, it’s not stopping speculators from throwing money at these tokens. Trump himself has yet to confirm these claims. Meanwhile, crypto trading platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood both saw their stocks climb about 2%. MicroStrategy, famous for hoarding Bitcoin like a dragon with gold, ticked up slightly. Rate cuts, inflation, and a Federal Reserve twist As if the crypto frenzy wasn’t enough, the Federal Reserve is throwing its own brand of unpredictability into the mix. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller dropped a bombshell during an interview , saying that rate cuts could come as early as the first half of the year. If inflation continues to cool, Waller said, “I can certainly see rate cuts happening sooner than maybe the markets are pricing in.” His comments immediately sent traders scrambling. Market-implied odds for a May rate cut shot up to 50%, and expectations for a second reduction by year-end jumped to 55%. Inflation , which has been stubbornly high, slowed to a 3.2% core reading in December, fueling hopes that the Fed might ease up on its aggressive policies. But here’s the thing, Waller also admitted that if inflation doesn’t behave, rate cuts could be limited to just one or two. “If the data doesn’t cooperate, then you’re going to be back to two and going maybe even one,” he said. So, while the market is pricing in a rosier scenario, there’s still a lot that could go wrong. Lower interest rates typically boost riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, and any signs of a dovish Fed could add even more fuel to the already blazing market. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to meet on January 28-29. Markets aren’t expecting much action this time around, but the meeting will still be closely watched for clues about the Fed’s next moves. Waller said, “We’re in really no rush to do things,” but that doesn’t mean the market isn’t bracing for surprises.
