Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Saves California on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Saves California by entering its contract address – 2mtzeaYqDPLtCemX5jNPuuq8jw65cbgNUXuT3fBra2M2 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCALI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-15 23:11:00

Similarly, Chainlink(LINK) has endured a tragic month, as its value spirals downwards. Many long-time holders of these assets are now considering alternatives, and Remittix (RTX) has become a popular choice. This modern PayFi protocol brings solutions to the longstanding problems in the cross-border payments sector, and is gearing up to carve out a large piece of this market. So are Pepe (PEPE) and Chainlink (LINK) likely to see a price resurgence in 2025, and why are so many investors shifting funds to Remittix (RTX)? Solana Price Drops 19% In 30 Days Solana (SOL) has spiralled, losing more than 19% of its value in the last month alone, and having posted a similar loss in the last week. Industry commentators are torn over whether the most recent Solana price drop has been due to whale sell offs or a general downturn in the crypto market. Technological analysis shows that Solana (SOL) has dropped below key support levels, such as the $196 200-day Exponential Moving Average, representing a bearish trend. Perhaps more worryingly, Solana's Total Value Locked (TVL) has also fallen more than 7% in a day, indicating less trust in its ecosystem. Solana (SOL) still has a $86.74 billion market cap and remains an influential player in the crypto space, though its price trajectory is looking weak going into 2025. Chainlink Finds Itself On Thin Ice Chainlink ambled through 2022 and 2023 at snail pace before a major rally in November 2024, raising questions about whether Chainlink (LINK) could make a meaningful comeback. Despite recent losses, it still holds standing as one of more modern decentralized oracle networks, facilitating secure communication between smart contracts and real worlddata. Chainlink (LINK) too has had a poor start to 2025. Over the last 30 days, Chainlink lost 37.47% of its value and is also down 21.9% in the last week, now sitting at $18.97, down a staggering 64% from its ATH in 2021. Technically, Chainlink is trading in a descending wedge pattern, which is usually a bullish reversal indicator. The key resistance level to watch is $23.92, as a breakout above this could push Chainlink towards $30. Remittix Carves Out Its Place in Cross-Border Payment Space Remittix (RTX) has entered the PayFi space with a powerful offering as it sets out to address longstanding inefficiencies in the cross-border payments space. This is a $190 trillion industry in which Remittix (RTX) is considered a game changer due to its practical, real-life utility. Remittix lets users change over 40 cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies and transfer money directly to bank accounts worldwide, solving some of the biggest problems in global finance.

With support for over 30 fiat currencies and 50 cryptocurrency pairs, Remittix is ideal for freelancers, e-commerce platforms, and international service providers. Remittix Nears $2.8 Million Raised In Presale Proactive adopters of Remittix can seize up tokens at an alluring price of $0.0207 in the current phase of the presale , which has already attracted over $2.8 million in investment. Due to the project’s practical utility within a high value sector, analysts have anticipated an 800% increase by the presale’s end, followed by a potential 5,000% rally post-launch, positioning RTX as one of the most anticipated tokens in the market.

Similarly, Chainlink (LINK) has faced a challenging month, with its value on a downward trend. Long-standing investors in these cryptocurrencies are exploring other options, and Remittix (RTX) has emerged as a favored alternative. This innovative PayFi protocol aims to tackle the persistent issues in cross-border payments and is poised to seize a significant share of this market. So, will Pepe (PEPE) and Chainlink (LINK) see a price revival in 2025, and what drives so many investors to shift their focus to Remittix (RTX)? Solana Sees a 19% Decline Over a Month Solana (SOL) has taken a hit, shedding more than 19% of its value in just the past month and showing similar losses over the past week. Experts are divided on whether this recent drop in Solana's price is due to significant sell-offs by major investors or a general decline in the crypto market. Technical analysis reveals that Solana (SOL) has fallen below crucial support levels, such as the $196 200-day Exponential Moving Average, indicating a bearish trend. Adding to the concern, Solana's Total Value Locked (TVL) has also decreased by more than 7% in a single day, suggesting diminishing confidence in its ecosystem. Despite these setbacks, Solana (SOL) maintains an $86.74 billion market cap and remains a key player in the crypto space, although its price outlook appears weak as 2025 approaches. Chainlink Faces Uncertainty After trudging through 2022 and 2023 at a slow pace, Chainlink experienced a significant rally in November 2024, sparking discussions about whether Chainlink (LINK) could stage a meaningful recovery. Despite recent setbacks, it remains a leading decentralized oracle network, enabling secure interactions between smart contracts and real-world data. Chainlink (LINK) has also started 2025 on a poor note. Over the past 30 days, Chainlink has lost 37.47% of its value and is down 21.9% in the last week, now priced at $18.97, which is a significant 64% drop from its all-time high in 2021. From a technical perspective, Chainlink is trading within a descending wedge pattern, typically viewed as a bullish reversal signal. The critical resistance level to monitor is $23.92, as breaking through this point could propel Chainlink towards $30. Remittix Establishes Its Role in the Cross-Border Payment Industry Remittix (RTX) has entered the PayFi sector with a strong proposition, aiming to resolve long-standing inefficiencies in cross-border payments.

Remittix has drawn the interest of investors looking for high-growth prospects with its ground-breaking PayFitechnology, which is intended to transform international payments. Here's a deeper look at the progress with Tron growth, ADA price volatility, and PayFi innovation. Cardano Faces Market Volatility, but Investors Remain Optimistic A notable price correction just occurred for Cardano (ADA), which fell 10% on Monday and closed at $0.91. After a period of strong performance during which the asset posted a 17.8% gain last week, there was a drop. The fall was largely caused by macroeconomic concerns, such as inflation concerns brought on by better-than-expected U.S. job data. Despite the ADA price drop, Cardano remains a significant player in the cryptocurrency industry with $1.16 billion in open interest, suggesting investor optimism. Future developments, including the incoming U.S. administration's proposed crypto tax reforms, are stoking expectations for a possible recovery. According to analysts, Cardano ADA price may soon rise toward $0.99 if it sustains support at $0.90. Cardano's capacity to withstand market swings is demonstrated by its resilience, which also emphasizes the need for diversity. Many ADA holders are looking for new options like Remittixto enhance their portfolios as they navigate this turbulent time. Tron Growth Inspires Confidence Among Investors Tron (TRX) has demonstrated remarkable performance in the cryptocurrency space, with a 95% price gain in the last 12 months and an incredible 115.73% revenue growth in 2024. According to projections, Tron TRX may hit $0.50 by 2025 as a result of ongoing network expansion and uptake. Tron is a strong rival, even outperforming Ethereum and Solana in terms of profitability, with its emphasis on quick transactions and decentralized software. And so far, Tron growth has been impressive. Nonetheless, Tron investors are alert to the market's natural volatility and are searching for new ventures with substantial upside potential. Presenting Remittix, a revolutionary payment network that combines the ease of fiat money with the speed of cryptocurrency. With its innovative features and early-stage presale, Remittix offers a compelling opportunity for Tron investors to diversify and potentially maximize returns.

Cardano's Market Challenges and Investor Optimism Cardano (ADA) recently faced a significant price drop, falling 10% on Monday to close at $0.91.

Future developments, such as the upcoming U.S. administration's proposed crypto tax reforms, are fuelling hopes for a potential rebound.

Tron's Growth Fuels Investor Assurance In the crypto realm, Tron (TRX) has shown impressive performance, with its price surging 95% over the past year and an astounding 115.73% revenue increase in 2024. Projections suggest that Tron's TRX could reach $0.50 by 2025, driven by ongoing network growth and adoption.

As reported by Ali Martinez, an on-chain analyst, the number of transactions on the network has risen to above $1 million in the last few days. Source: X According to Martinez, within one day, Santiment registered 341 transactions of more than $1 million. These high volume value transfers are believed to be made by XRP whales, individuals or entities with large number of XRP holdings. Their entry demonstrates a pick up in market participation and confidence. XRP price new high XRP has also shown significant growth as it hit $3, the first time since its previous high of $3.84 in January 2018. At the time of writing, the token is trading at $2.94. XRP went up by 14.45% in the last 24 hours. Peter Brandt, a veteran trader, recently pointed out that the half-mast flag seen on the weekly chart of XRP should be completed within the next six weeks. A half-mast flag is a neutral pattern that has the potential to go either up or down. The consolidation phase usually indicates the probability of the continuation of the trend. Source: X According to Brandt, if the pattern completes bullishly, XRP’s market capitalization might attain $500 billion, a 262% increase and a potential price of $6.40. But Brandt pointed out that the pattern needs to “rock and roll soon,” otherwise it can switch to something else. This broader bullish trend has also been seen in the meme coins on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as well. Among the most popular tokens, ARMY, LIHUA, and DROP have increased the value significantly. ARMY rose by 26.52% to close at $0.1792, while LIHUA rose by 24.89% to $0.051588. At the time of reporting, DROP was also 26.10% up and was trading at $16.66. Most of these tokens are currently being traded on the Bitrue exchange. In the last week alone, DROP has surged by a massive 95.41%. Factors driving XRP’s recent surge The price surge is happening against the backdrop of increasing rumors of the possible approval of an XRP-based ETF. Also, the anticipation for new developments by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its lawsuit against Ripple.

Despite this development, BTC traders still look apprehensive as their strategy suggests they are still bearish on the current price action. Bitcoin Traders Turn Bearish Following Price Recovery In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that Bitcoin traders have turned bearish despite the price recovery above $97,000. The crypto analyst mentioned that the percentage of traders on Binance betting BTC will rise has declined from 66.35% to 55.22% over the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Has Entered Another Bull Cycle, Puts Price Above $20 This development is significant as these Binance traders have a track record of being right most of the time. While most traders (55.22%) are still longing BTC, the decline in those betting on a rise suggests that there is the possibility that the recent price recovery is just a relief bounce and not a bullish reversal. The Bitcoin price has recovered above $97,000 after dropping to below $90,000 two days ago. This recent rally could pave the way for the flagship crypto to reclaim the psychological $100,000 price level. Crypto analyst Jelle is confident that this could happen soon, as he stated that a price breakout above $97,000 could lead to new highs for Bitcoin. However, there is still a lot of market uncertainty, which could explain why some of these Bitcoin traders are choosing not to bet on a further rally despite the recent price recovery. Recent macro data have suggested that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to implement as many quantitative easing (QE) policies as compared to last year. This is bearish for the Bitcoin price since investors could become more skeptical about investing in this risk asset. On the other hand, Donald Trump’s incoming administration provides some optimism for market participants since the US president-elect has promised to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which would lead to greater adoption of BTC. BTC’s Market Structure Has Changed Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade also provided a bullish outlook for the Bitcoin price. In an X post, he stated that Bitcoin has shifted the market structure from a downtrend to an uptrend. He explained that when BTC was in a downtrend with lower highs and lower lows, it created an equal high, signaling a “change of character.” Related Reading: Analyst Who Predicted Bitcoin Price Crash To $89,000 Reveals Where BTC Is Headed Next Now, Bitcoin has broken through the resistance to form a higher high. According to Trader Tardigrade, if BTC maintains a higher low at the support/ resistance flip level of $96,000, it could start the bull run again. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the flagship crypto could reclaim $100,000 and then rally to new highs. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $97,300, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

HBAR price analysis shows Hedera trapped between $0.25 and $0.33, hinging on Bitcoin’s next move to break free. Similarly, Bitget Token (BGB) struggles with selling pressure, falling 26% from its ATH of $8.49, and facing resistance at $6.29-$6.48. While both tokens show potential, the clear winner emerging is BlockDAG (BDAG). With its PoW-powered technology, $180.5 million raised in presale, and the game-changing LAUNCH300 campaign offering a 300% bonus, BDAG is attracting whales and positioning itself as the next big Layer-1 network. The project’s momentum, supported by an upcoming mainnet launch, sets it apart as the most promising option for investors seeking exponential gains. BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 – 300% Extra Coins Attracts Crypto Whales In the cryptoverse, institutional giants are on the lookout for smart money and they often gain the first mover advantage. Spotting the next big layer 1 is troublesome for average buyers, but what if there’s a way to follow where the smart money went and join them. BlockDAG (BDAG) is a PoW based crypto that raised over 180.5 million through presale. No other major presale has recorded such massive inflow of money in the last 5 years. So shouldn’t we listen? The layer 1 termed the successor of Kaspa (KAS) is doing everything Kaspa did but much better. Similar to what Elon Musk did with the space industry, they reinvented the wheel and they are bold about it with out-of-the-world marketing stunts in crypto history. Now the team has launched one of the biggest offers till date – the code LAUNCH300 offers buyers with 300% extra BDAG coins for a limited time. Within a few hours of the campaign launch, the project recorded massive selling pushing the coins sold to 18 billion. The momentum can partly be attributed to the upcoming mainnet launch where the coin price is planned to hit $0.05. With an altcoin season in the background, this could be the ultimate coin that could trigger massive gains in short time. HBAR Price Analysis: Will Hedera Break Free From Its $0.25-$0.33 Range? Hedera (HBAR) has been stuck in a tight consolidation range between $0.25 and $0.33 for over a month, frustrating traders eager for a breakout. HBAR price analysis suggests that its future trajectory depends heavily on Bitcoin’s performance, with a 0.65 correlation indicating that HBAR often mirrors Bitcoin’s movements. Currently trading at $0.27, HBAR faces a critical test. A dip below $0.25 could signal further bearish momentum, while flipping $0.33 into support could pave the way for a rally toward $0.39. Much of this depends on Bitcoin reclaiming $100,000 and sparking a broader market rally. For investors, HBAR’s potential upside in a bullish Bitcoin-led market makes it a worthwhile consideration. While short-term risks remain, a breakout could deliver significant gains, especially as Hedera continues to develop its ecosystem. HBAR price analysis highlights a promising opportunity for those willing to take calculated risks. Bitget Token (BGB) Struggles as Selling Pressure Mounts—What’s Next for the Price? Bitget Token (BGB) has faced significant selling pressure, dropping from its all-time high of $8.49 on Dec. 27, 2024, to $6.25 at press time—a 26% decline. This drop comes amid profit-taking and reduced buying momentum, with on-chain data showing a decrease in holding time for transacted coins. Lower holding times often indicate rising selling activity, which could extend BGB’s downward trend in the short term. Resistance between $6.29 and $6.48, highlighted by the In/Out of Money Around Price (IOMAP) metric, adds further challenges. Unless buying volume increases, Bitget Token (BGB) could face difficulty reclaiming the $7 level. Technically, BGB is trading within a descending triangle, a bearish pattern that suggests potential further declines to support levels at $5.04 or even $4.22. However, a shift in momentum could push the price toward $7.24 if buying pressure strengthens. Takeaway Among the three, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out as the most compelling opportunity. Hedera, as shown in HBAR price analysis, depends heavily on Bitcoin’s performance, leaving its trajectory uncertain. Similarly, Bitget Token (BGB) faces mounting resistance and bearish patterns, with recovery relying on a shift in buying pressure. In contrast, BDAG has already demonstrated unmatched success with $180.5 million raised, a loyal whale-backed community, and the innovative LAUNCH300 campaign. With its presale price of $0.0248 and a potential listing price of $0.05, BDAG combines high growth potential with tangible momentum.

The breach resulted in the theft of nearly 120,000 Bitcoins, valued at approximately $12 billion today. Of this, $9.3 billion worth, equivalent to 94,643 Bitcoin, has been recovered and approved for return to Bitfinex. Court Ruling: No Victims Identified in Bitfinex Hack The DOJ stated in the court filing that no identifiable victims exist in the Bitfinex hack due to the exchange’s repayment measures and loss generalization policies. GOV’S ABOUT TO HAND BACK BITFINEX BITCOIN TO REAL OWNERS So, the US government’s making crypto history by talking about returning those Bitfinex hack Bitcoins they seized back in 2016. That’s millions in BTC, getting handed back to the OGs. Sounds like a plot twist, right?… pic.twitter.com/hCOvtuXj5b — Mario Nawfal’s Roundtable (@RoundtableSpace) January 15, 2025 The filing read: “For the foregoing reasons, there is no ‘victim’ for the specific offenses of conviction in this proceeding.” The 2016 hack exploited a vulnerability in Bitfinex’s multi-signature wallet system, allowing hackers to steal vast amounts of cryptocurrency. According to the DOJ , the stolen Bitcoin was laundered using advanced methods, including crypto-mixing services. The hack led to the conviction of Ilya Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather “Razzlekhan” Morgan. Lichtenstein was sentenced to 60 months in prison for money laundering, while Morgan received an 18-month sentence for assisting in laundering the stolen funds. Their cooperation enabled the recovery of 80% of the stolen Bitcoin, marking one of the largest asset seizures in DOJ history. Despite her legal troubles, Morgan, a rapper and social media personality, recently released a music video titled “Razzlekhan vs. The United States,” dedicated to “misfits.” She is scheduled to report to prison this month. January 28 Deadline for Bitfinex Users to File Restitution Claim s Following the hack, Bitfinex implemented a repayment program to address customer losses. The exchange reduced user account balances by 36% and issued BFX tokens as compensation. These tokens were redeemable for cash or convertible into equity in Bitfinex’s parent company, Ifinex. The company also issued Recovery Right Tokens (RRT) to address potential future recoveries. Bitfinex stated that its repayment program fully compensated users, though some have argued that Bitcoin’s price increase since 2016 has left them undercompensated. While Bitfinex will receive 94,643 Bitcoin, valued at $9.3 billion, not all stolen funds could be recovered due to the complexity of laundering transactions. The plea agreements facilitated voluntary restitution to Bitfinex, focusing on assets linked to the hack. Separate forfeiture processes address other laundered funds not directly tied to the stolen Bitcoin. As part of the restitution process, affected users have until January 28, 2025, to file claims or objections to the terms. The DOJ has established a mechanism for individuals identifying themselves as affected parties to submit their claims.

The impersonators extorted $855,000 from the victim, who believed she was sending the funds to assist her lover, Brad Pitt. Perpetrators of romance scams have long preyed on lonely individuals seeking companionship with various deceptive tactics. Over the years, these methods have become fairly easy to spot and evade. However, recent developments in artificial intelligence have shifted the balance of power back to the fraudsters. Anne meets Brad Pitt Anne’s ordeal began in early 2023 when she was contacted by someone claiming to be the actor’s mother, Jane Etta Pitt. The person impersonating Brad Pitt’s mother then introduced her to another individual claiming to be Brad, who then expressed romantic interest in her. Over 18 months, the scammers strengthened the relationship using AI-generated photos and messages on several platforms, including WhatsApp and Instagram. The communications apparently helped convince Anne of their identity. After a while, the fake Brad Pitt started to ask Anne for money, claiming he needed it for cancer treatment. The scammers claimed that Pitt’s bank accounts were frozen due to his divorce proceedings with his ex-wife, Angelina Jolie. Anne, though doubtful at first, ended up transferring the large sum of money to an account in Turkey after receiving an email from the doctor who claimed to be treating Pitt. “I’m not used to social media, and I didn’t really understand what was happening to me,” Anne told TF1. Anne only realized she was the victim of a scam after seeing pictures of Pitt with his current partner, Inés de Ramon. Anne shared her story on the French television channel TF1 and rather than compassion or comfort, she was hit with a wave of mockery and trolling from the viewers of the show. The backlash got so bad that the broadcast had to be removed. Explanation about the removal of the Brad Pitt AI romance scam from social media. Source: @7a8 (X) TF1 presenter Harry Roselmack posted on his account that the broadcast would be withdrawn from the station’s platforms in order to protect the victim. AI has become a useful tool for cybercriminals This incident is just one of the many similar schemes gaining popularity in recent years. In 2024, reported scams involving Brad Pitt impersonators in Spain led to the arrest of five individuals after they conned the sum of $350,000 from two women. In 2022, romance scams ranked second among the most costly scams reported in Canada, resulting in losses of $59M from 1400 reported cases. Similarly, such scams accounted for over $652M in lost funds in the US in 2023. Romance scams aside, advancements in artificial intelligence have also made the job of identity thieves and online fraudsters easier, contributing to over $8.8M in losses in the US. Artificial intelligence gives cybercriminals easy access to sophisticated tools that amplify the effectiveness of their scams. Using AI tools available to the average, non-paying user, anyone can generate images and create deepfake videos to populate a fake profile on dating platforms or social media.

The Injective ecosystem is rolling out the governance proposal for INJ 3.0, setting the stage to elevate INJ as a standout deflationary asset. On another exciting front, Filecoin (FIL) rides a bullish wave, posting a 5% gain this week after a robust 19% increase, thanks to Bithumb’s new trading pair announcement and compelling on-chain metrics. Meanwhile, the trailblazing decentralized e-commerce platform, Web3Bay , is capturing attention with its presale, amassing over $700K from selling 200 million tokens. This surge confirms Web3Bay’s rapid ascent beyond just a decentralized marketplace. Injective Ecosystem: Latest INJ 3.0 Rollout The Injective ecosystem, vital to DeFi applications, has introduced the INJ 3.0 governance proposal, targeting to secure INJ’s position as a foremost deflationary asset in the cryptocurrency realm. This proposal is geared toward slashing the token supply with advanced burning techniques and strategic supply reduction, aligning perfectly with Injective’s vision for a sustainable ecosystem. Highlighted features include bolstered staking rewards and streamlined procedures to cut down the circulating supply. Set to launch in stages throughout the year, INJ 3.0 is poised to offer enduring benefits for traders, stakers, developers, and ecosystem partners, with anticipated substantial growth in 2025 driven by this forward-thinking approach to tokenomics. Filecoin (FIL) Price Eyes the $8.42 Mark Filecoin’s price trajectory remains bullish, climbing 5% this week to about $6.20 after a 19% upsurge last week triggered by Bithumb’s listing of a new trading pair, boosting FIL’s exposure in South Korea. The optimism is reinforced by strong on-chain metrics, with Open Interest swelling to $358.30 million and Total Value Locked hitting $93.12 million, signaling robust network activity. Technical forecasts predict potential advances for Filecoin’s price toward $8.42, propelled by a 35% surge to the Fibonacci retracement level, contingent on sustained momentum. Web3Bay’s Decentralized Marketplace: Explosive $700K Presale in Just Days! The e-commerce domain is undergoing a seismic shift, and Web3Bay is at the forefront of this revolution. As a decentralized marketplace fueled by blockchain, Web3Bay restores power to users, eliminating intermediaries, concealed fees, and data misuse—enabling secure, transparent, and effective transactions. Contrasting traditional e-commerce platforms that often involve hefty fees, privacy risks, and dependency on fallible centralized systems, Web3Bay eradicates these problems by enabling users to retain ownership of their data and assets. Thanks to its blockchain foundation, Web3Bay ensures lower costs, swifter transactions, and enhanced security. Yet, the catch is: accessing this exceptional platform requires Web3Bay’s native token, 3BAY. Possessing the 3BAY token is crucial for engaging with Web3Bay’s unique offerings. Without it, users would miss out on reduced transaction fees and the chance to shape the platform’s future through governance participation, all while enjoying rewards. Securing 3BAY tokens during its presale is not only astute due to the current affordable price but also a gateway to potentially huge returns, with the token price set to soar from just $0.0039675 to $0.1959—an astounding 4,839% ROI opportunity for early investors. As the presale has already gathered over $700,000, an increasing number of crypto enthusiasts are seizing this opportunity, driving demand and price upwards. Those interested should act quickly to participate in the presale, securing tokens at a lower price. Web3Bay crypto isn’t just another token—it’s the cornerstone of a platform poised to redefine online commerce. In Conclusion In essence, the Injective ecosystem, Filecoin’s bullish price trajectory, and Web3Bay’s pioneering decentralized marketplace are collectively spearheading a transformation in the crypto arena for 2025. Injective’s INJ 3.0 plan introduces a strategic deflationary model aimed at boosting long-term sustainability and growth. Filecoin remains a key market driver with its optimistic price forecasts supported by vigorous on-chain activity and strategic updates. Meanwhile, Web3Bay steals the limelight by reinventing e-commerce with its blockchain-integrated platform, offering unparalleled user control, transparency, and cost efficiency. Web3Bay’s booming presale and innovative approach to Web3 commerce firmly establish it as one of the leading web3 crypto coins in decentralized marketplaces and digital trade, making it an opportunity not to be missed.

The new ETF will invest in digital asset transformation businesses and products, giving investors access to the emerging digital economy. The Onchain Economy ETF, which will trade under the ticker NODE, plans to invest at least 80% of its net assets in companies and assets that support the digital asset economy. The fund was proposed on January 15 and will have two main investment streams: “Digital Transformation Companies” and “ Digital Asset Instruments”. Source:SEC The Digital Transformation Companies include companies involved in activities that are vital to the digital asset industry. Some are crypto exchanges, payment gateway service providers, mining companies, and those that provide software or infrastructure for digital asset functioning. The ETF’s investment strategy also includes exposure to companies involved in energy infrastructure, data centers, and other technologies supporting the digital asset market. While other digital asset funds will invest in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, the Onchain Economy ETF will not do so directly. Instead, it will gain exposure to digital assets through companies and instruments closely related to the sector. This approach is useful as the fund can focus on firms essential for the expansion of the digital currency industry but do not hold digital currencies. VanEck’s head of digital assets research, Matthew Sigel, said that more information about the ETF would be disclosed in the coming weeks. Increased interest in Crypto ETFs VanEck’s application is just one of many crypto-related ETFs that have been proposed to the SEC. Financial firms are looking up as they expect new regulations under the newly reelected administration. Bitwise Asset Management applied for its 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF in the last quarter of 2024. These major digital assets are listed in the index, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). Likewise, WisdomTree filed an application for an XRP-related ETF in December 2024, and Grayscale applied to transform its Solana Trust into an ETF. BlackRock is expected to roll out a Bitcoin ETF product for Canadian investors. The new iShares product will trade on CBOE Canada. Bitwise also proposed a Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF, which would track firms that hold Bitcoin in their treasuries. As reported by Cryptopolitan, in just one year, US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) broke all the rules, holding 1.13 million Bitcoins. Bitcoin ETFs alone have already grown larger than gold ETFs in terms of AUM. Gold ETFs, for instance, have only taken 20 years to get to $128 billion in AUM. Bitcoin ETFs got to $107 billion in one year only.

Tokens like XRP and WIF are typical examples of high-growth coins that went from below $1 valuation to exponential growth in 2024. As 2025 arrives, full of bullish promise, we've highlighted some top crypto coins that could potentially see similar growth in Q1 of the year. These tokens include Tron (TRX), Stellar (XLM), and Lunex Network (LNEX) . But why these coins? Tron (TRX) to Consolidate on Existing Bullish Sentiment The Tron token has entered into the new year on the back of bullish momentum. For context, the price of Tron gained over 22% within the month of december to maintain support above the $0.25 mark. According to CoinMarketCap , Tron's price recorded a 136% increase in value in 2024, with 64% of the entire year's price growth coming in Q4. This bullish momentum has also propelled Tron into the top 10 crypto coins with a market cap valuation of over $21.8 billion. Having already set an all-time high at $0.4407 in early December, While analyzing the Tron price chart on X, Andrew Griffiths noticed that the Tron crypto price is moving in a descending channel in the one-hour timeframe. A bounce could lead to a positive reversal, with Andrew's target price around $0.26. Coincodex shares a similar opinion. The popular prediction platform expects the Tron price to hit $0.26 in the short term. Possible Bullish Wave Imminent for Stellar (XLM) Having lost over 28% of its value within the last 30 days, as per market stats , Stellar crypto is genuinely in its correctional phase. This is coming after Stellar’s price recorded over 500% growth between November and December when the token reached a year-long price high of $0.56. Meanwhile, despite the decline, the Stellar token has maintained support above the $0.30 mark. A crypto analyst, JavonTM1 , has pointed out that the Stellar token is nearing a converging point, which will likely trigger another bullish wave in the coming weeks. The increasing DEX volume growth, averaging 80% within the past few days, could also influence the token's market trend to a bullish momentum. Over 20 key market indicators are flashing buy signals, and the altcoin is trading above the 50-day and 200-day SMA . Although the Stellar market sentiment is neutral, the booming market activity is likely to propel the price towards $0.63, which Coincodex experts forecasted for the short term. This makes it one of the top crypto coins to watch out for in Q1. The Launch of Lunex Network (LNEX) Draws Closer Amid Surging Presale Momentum Before the end of Q1, Lunex Network (LNEX) will be launched, and its true potential will be revealed. The ongoing presale offers investors an opportunity to be early adopters of the project. So far, over 2.4 billion LNEX tokens have been sold, helping the team to raise more than $6M in cryptocurrency ICO funding. This value is expected to rise above $10M before the end of the presale. Given its unique use case and growth potential, the Lunex Network project has been tipped to surge by 100x before launch. At $0.0054, investors have the best chance to accumulate the token at this nascent stage. So far, early investors have made over 350% ROI within a few weeks. Just like the BNB, the Lunex Network token LNEX holds strong utility in the DeFi exchange. Outside of being used as listing fees in the Lunex Network trading exchange, holders will access discounts on transaction fees. They are also entitled to the profit-sharing model designed to reward active LNEX holders with more tokens. Investors can also stake the token for as little as 30 days and earn high APY yields. For context, the Lunex project is a DeFi protocol where members can perform cross-chain asset transfers in a fast, secure, and non-custodial exchange. The mobile exchange gives users access to over 50k crypto pairs, opening the door for various trading opportunities which will boost users' profits. Overall, Lunex Network is one of the best DeFi coins not to miss in Q1. Which Crypto Project Should Investors Zero in on? Both Tron and Stellar are high-potential crypto projects, especially now that they've gained significant value in the last quarter. Meanwhile, Lunex Network is a top investment alternative investors can jump into and start earning profits even while on presale. With robust features like the revolutionary portfolio tracker and the merchant payment gateway, the adoption of the trading exchange will surge soon, pushing the LNEX price above $1 sooner than anticipated.

Stellar (XLM) May Be on the Verge of a Bullish Surge Recently, Stellar has experienced a correction phase, with its value dropping over 28% in the past month, as reported by market stats . This follows a period of over 500% growth from November to December, during which the token reached a yearly high of $0.56. Despite this downturn, Stellar has managed to hold support above $0.30.

Although current sentiment remains neutral, the surge in market activity could drive the price to $0.63, a short-term target set by Coincodex experts. This positions Stellar as a key crypto to watch in Q1.

Chainlink or Remittix,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/which-one-of-these-should-you-invest-for-500-gains-in-january-chainlink-or-remittix,"Investors are looking for their next opportunity as the start of 2025 is expected to be very promising for the crypto market. Chainlink (LINK) is among the best cryptos among the more spoken names. Even market analysts like Captain Faibik have made a bold price prediction. Meanwhile, an emerging token named Remittix (RTX) is also gaining mass appeal. Remittix will disrupt the cross-border payments market, which Mordor Intelligence predicts could be worth $295B by 2029. Many investors are gravitating towards this rising presale star, which has already rewarded early buyers with a 36% return. They believe it may have higher upside potential in 2025, with numbers like 500% being mentioned. Captain Faibik: The Price of Chainlink (LINK) Could Reach $200 Chainlink (LINK) is one of the top crypto coins, but it has recently seen some red price charts. According to CoinMarketCap , its value has fallen from around $30 to below $20 in the past 30 days. In other words, the Chainlink price fell over 30% in just a few short weeks. But the community is still excited about Chainlink (LINK), thanks to bullish statements by market analysts like Captain Faibik. In his recent X post , he said this altcoin will reach $200 in this bull run. The technical analysis supports this Chainlink price prediction. TradingView data shows this crypto coin is valued above its 100-day EMA ($18). Additionally, its momentum indicator of -3.369 is in the buy zone and suggests an uptrend potentially coming for the Chainlink coin. Remittix (RTX) Seen as a New Contender With Massive Upside Potential While Chainlink (LINK) is experiencing some volatility right now, Remittix (RTX) is creating a lot of positive buzz. This is because of its great performance in the crypto ICO event. Notably, Remittix has seen seven price increases and raised over $2.8M in just three weeks. Early investors in this project are already 36% richer, and more price spikes are coming. Hype for Remittix is growing fast as it could dominate the cross-border payments market. Unlike Stripe or Wise, Remittix will launch a crypto-to-fiat platform that lets users convert 40 cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies like YEN or EUR. Afterward, they can be sent to any global bank account at a flat fee with no hidden costs for FX or wires. Plus, the Remittix Pay API will allow businesses to accept crypto payments, benefiting all parties involved. Those interested now buy its native token, RTX, at a discount. To incentivize purchases, Remittix will give all RTX holders governance voting rights and staking rewards. Currently, one RTX costs just $0.0207, but the next block of tokens will cost $0.0217. With the recent CoinMarketCap listing of this altcoin, demand for RTX is bound to increase. This factor, plus a projected top-tier crypto exchange listing, could trigger a massive rally for RTX soon. Chainlink (LINK) vs. Remittix (RTX) – Which Crypto Coin Could Surge First? Chainlink (LINK) and Remittix (RTX) are the altcoins to watch this quarter, as they could both see big price gains. However, Remittix stands out as it will have a smaller market cap than LINK, which means it will need less money for its price to grow. Additionally, its groundbreaking technology could make it a fan-favorite for millions of individuals in unbanked regions. Therefore, its long-term growth potential could also be better. Because of all these factors, many investors are turning to RTX as the best cryptocurrency to buy now for potential 500% gains.

Chainlink or Remittix,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/which-investment-could-yield-500-returns-in-january-chainlink-or-remittix,"As 2025 approaches, the crypto market is expected to offer exciting opportunities for investors. Chainlink (LINK) is one of the standout cryptocurrencies that has garnered significant attention. Even prominent market analysts like Captain Faibik have ventured bold predictions for its price. On the other hand, a new player called Remittix (RTX) is rapidly gaining popularity. This token is set to revolutionize the cross-border payments sector, a market that Mordor Intelligence forecasts could reach $295B by 2029. Many investors are flocking to this promising presale star, which has already delivered a 36% return to early adopters. They speculate it might offer even greater potential gains in 2025, with figures like 500% being suggested. Captain Faibik: Predicts Chainlink's (LINK) Price May Hit $200 Chainlink (LINK) remains a leading cryptocurrency, despite experiencing a downturn in recent price trends. According to CoinMarketCap , its value has dropped from approximately $30 to under $20 in the last month. In summary, Chainlink's price has decreased by more than 30% in just a few weeks. Nonetheless, the Chainlink (LINK) community remains optimistic due to the bullish outlook from analysts like Captain Faibik. In a recent X post , he predicted that this altcoin could soar to $200 during the current bull market. Technical analysis backs this Chainlink price forecast. Data from TradingView reveals that this digital asset is trading above its 100-day EMA ($18). Also, its momentum indicator at -3.369 suggests it is in the buy zone, hinting at a potential upward trend for Chainlink. Remittix (RTX): A Rising Star With Tremendous Growth Potential While Chainlink (LINK) faces some turbulence, Remittix (RTX) is generating significant excitement. Its impressive performance during the crypto ICO event has attracted attention. Remarkably, Remittix has experienced seven price hikes and raised more than $2.8M within just three weeks. Early backers of this venture have already seen a 36% increase in value, with further price surges anticipated. The buzz around Remittix is rapidly intensifying as it aims to lead the cross-border payments industry. Unlike services like Stripe or Wise, Remittix is set to introduce a crypto-to-fiat platform that enables the conversion of 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies such as YEN or EUR. These can then be transferred to any international bank account with a flat fee, avoiding hidden FX or transfer charges. Additionally, the Remittix Pay API will allow businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments, benefiting all users. Potential investors can acquire its native token, RTX, at a discounted rate. Remittix encourages buying by offering RTX holders governance voting rights and staking rewards. Currently, RTX is priced at $0.0207, but the cost for the next batch of tokens will rise to $0.0217. With its recent listing on CoinMarketCap, the demand for RTX is expected to grow. This, combined with an anticipated listing on a major crypto exchange, could spark a significant rally for RTX soon. Chainlink (LINK) and Remittix (RTX): Which Crypto Might Surge First? Chainlink (LINK) and Remittix (RTX) are two altcoins to watch this quarter, both holding the potential for substantial price increases. However, Remittix stands out due to its smaller market cap compared to LINK, meaning it requires less capital to drive its price upward. Moreover, its innovative technology could make it particularly appealing to millions in underserved regions. Consequently, its prospects for long-term growth might be superior. Considering these aspects, numerous investors are viewing RTX as the top cryptocurrency to invest in now for potential 500% returns.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/only-five-whales-hold-565-trillion-shib-heres-the-significance/,"The distribution of Shiba Inu tokens has come under scrutiny as five whale addresses now collectively hold 57% of the total supply, amounting to 565 trillion SHIB. This significant concentration of assets within a small number of wallets raises questions about potential market volatility and the implications for token decentralization. Among these wallets, one address alone accounts for 41.7% of the entire SHIB supply, highlighting a clear disparity between high-activity and low-activity holders. Such centralization could amplify market risks, particularly in the event of abrupt movements by these large holders. As a result, tracking the activity of these wallets is crucial for anticipating short-term price fluctuations and understanding broader market trends. SHIB On-chain Data Highlights Key Trends Recent on-chain data further sheds light on current dynamics. Over the past week, outflows from large holders have decreased by 31%, signaling reduced selling pressure from whales. This decline may contribute to greater price stability in the short term. On the other hand, inflows into large wallets have risen by 53%, suggesting that prominent investors are accumulating the token at lower price levels. From a technical perspective, the token’s price is above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) support level at around $0.00002079. If the price continues to hold above this critical threshold, this move could signal a potential shift in market sentiment. However, caution is still advised, as sustained upward momentum would require SHIB to break above resistance levels near $0.00002250 and $0.00002325. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Strategic Investor Accumulation Offers Hope The recent accumulation trends hint at growing interest from strategic investors seeking to capitalize on lower prices. Resistance levels at $0.00002250 and $0.00002325 remain key hurdles for the bulls, and breaking above these thresholds would be necessary to shift market sentiment in a positive direction. The centralization of SHIB holdings in a few wallets poses unique challenges for market stability. Large-scale transactions by these whales have the potential to significantly impact prices, underscoring the importance of monitoring their activity. As the token navigates its current support levels, market participants should approach cautiously, considering the heightened risk of volatility stemming from the concentration of assets. The coming days will likely be vital for the asset’s price trajectory. A sustained defense of the $0.00002079 support level and continued accumulation by larger players could lay the groundwork for a price rebound. However, the reliance on a small number of investors leaves the market vulnerable to sudden shifts, emphasizing the need for vigilance among traders and stakeholders. By closely observing wallet activity and technical indicators, market participants can better prepare for the potential outcomes of this concentrated asset distribution.

Trump’s Crypto Law (TRUMPLAW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPLAW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Crypto Law can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Crypto Law could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Crypto Law launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Crypto Law on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Crypto Law by entering its contract address – 7mYansF38wyaSvnj7C1Gr536FdMbGA4ufqY7PwzC7CxM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPLAW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|REGULATION|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-16 00:38:14

This perspective aligns with technical analysis of its previous price actions, which suggest an imminent shift in market dynamics. While PEPE has captured attention for its inherent volatility, a new AI altcoin, PropiChain (PCHAIN) , is making waves by redefining the crypto space with its innovative approach to real estate investment. Projections indicate that a PEPE price surge could act as a catalyst, triggering an impressive 15,000x growth for PCHAIN. Whale Moves and Market Shifts: Can PEPE Price Rebound Amid Rising FUD? Last year, the PEPE price reached an all-time high of $0.000028 on December 9, 2024, boasting a market cap of $7.20 billion. Currently priced at $0.00001670, the PEPE price bearish trend persists as it struggles to hold critical support levels. Over the past three months, the network activity has plummeted by 95.52%, signaling declining investor confidence and rising FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). However, the story isn’t entirely bleak. Whales are stepping in as key players, offering a glimmer of hope for the PEPE price recovery. In the past 24 hours alone, two significant whale purchases have infused over $8.72 million into PEPE, reinforcing its potential for a reversal. While the token remains vulnerable to further dips, bullish divergence in RSI and whale support could drive a rebound. The PEPE price uncertain trajectory for investors starkly contrasts PropiChain (PCHAIN), an upcoming AI altcoin offering tangible utility and a promising 15,000x growth potential. PropiChain (PCHAIN) Revolutionalizes Real Estate Investing With its AI Altcoin In contrast to speculative memecoins like PEPE, PropiChain (PCHAIN) offers tangible utility by integrating blockchain technology with the real estate market. PropiChain tokenizes real estate assets, allowing investors to purchase fractional ownership through digital tokens. PropiChain’s key feature is that it enables the tokenization of real estate assets into NFTs, simplifying ownership and trading. These digital assets allow users to purchase fractional shares of high-value properties, democratizing access to an industry traditionally dominated by high-net-worth individuals. AI plays a pivotal role in PropiChain’s operations, offering predictive market analysis, real-time property valuations, and automated transaction execution. With its AI tools, PropiChain enables users to identify the best investment opportunities, automate complex processes, and optimize returns. For instance, the platform’s predictive analytics empower investors to anticipate market shifts, while smart contracts , audited by BlockAudit, provide smooth and tamper-proof transactions, from leasing agreements to monthly rental payments. PropiChain also uses the immersive potential of the metaverse. Through its “Propiverse,” users can virtually explore properties in 3D, providing an interactive and comprehensive understanding of assets without needing physical visits. Security is another cornerstone of PropiChain. Each transaction is recorded on the blockchain via its “Title Contract,” ensuring transparency and mitigating risks like fraud or mismanagement. By eliminating intermediaries such as brokers and reducing dependency on traditional systems, PropiChain significantly lowers transaction costs and accelerates processes. The Golden Opportunity of the PCHAIN AI Altcoin Presale PropiChain’s presale is attracting significant attention from crypto enthusiasts eager to capitalize on this groundbreaking project. Currently priced at just $0.011 per AI-powered altcoin, early investors seize a rare opportunity to secure their position before prices escalate. With the third stage of the presale set to raise the price to $0.023 and an anticipated final listing price of $0.032, participants in this initial phase could enjoy an impressive ROI of up to 800%. Projections for PCHAIN are nothing short of extraordinary, with some analysts forecasting returns as high as 15,000x. Savvy investors recognize this as a pivotal moment to enter what could become one of the most lucrative AI altcoin opportunities of 2025. Beyond its speculative potential, PCHAIN is a gateway to revolutionary real estate investments, enabling users to purchase property NFTs, access DeFi applications, and use cutting-edge AI analytics. Currently listed on CoinMarketCap , early adopters also stand to gain additional benefits, including frequent airdrops, staking rewards of up to 225%, and the ability to use PCHAIN as loan collateral, making this a multi-functional asset with long-term value. While bullish forecasts suggest a possible rebound in the PEPE price, analysts predict a significant ripple effect that could amplify PCHAIN’s trajectory, potentially driving its value by over 15,000x. For investors seeking high-growth opportunities, this presale offers an unparalleled entry point.

This article looks into four best performing cryptos, offering traders well-informed insights to tailor their investment strategies effectively. Web3Bay, Chainlink, Filecoin, and Stacks each bring unique benefits that could make them prime candidates for substantial portfolio impacts. 1. Web3Bay: Lead the E-Commerce Evolution with 6430% ROI! Leading the charge, Web3Bay revolutionizes online shopping by harnessing layer-1 blockchain technology to enhance transparency and efficiency. Its platform is fortified with smart contracts that manage transactions, governance, and staking—each audited rigorously to minimize security risks and protect user assets. Integration with major crypto wallets like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and WalletConnect allows seamless asset management and reward generation directly from the platform, coupled with decentralized storage to safeguard user data against single-point failures. Currently priced at a mere $0.$0.0039675 in its third presale stage, the 3BAY token has already accumulated over $700,000 in sales. With an anticipated launch price of $0.1959, early adopters could potentially realize a 6430% ROI, positioning Web3Bay as one of the best performing cryptos for 2025. 2. Chainlink: Facilitating Real-World Connectivity for Blockchain Applications Chainlink continues to bridge the gap between blockchain smart contracts and real-world data, serving critical sectors like finance and supply chain management. With the introduction of its staking mechanism in 2022, LINK holders now play a pivotal role in securing the network, with ongoing enhancements aimed to bolster these capabilities through 2025. Chainlink’s strategic collaborations, including partnerships with Google Cloud and SWIFT, underscore its vital role in the blockchain infrastructure landscape. The platform’s consistent expansion and reliability make it a top Web3 crypto pick, poised for continued growth. 3. Stacks: Expanding Bitcoin’s Capabilities Stacks enriches the Bitcoin ecosystem by integrating smart contracts and decentralized applications, enabling developers to innovate on Bitcoin’s secure network without altering its foundational attributes. Looking ahead to 2025, Stacks is focused on scaling its platform and enhancing developer engagement. Its unique position as a bridge between Bitcoin and advanced blockchain functionalities opens new avenues for development and growth within the Web3 space. 4. Filecoin: Setting New Standards in Data Storage Filecoin is at the forefront of decentralizing data storage, offering secure and cost-effective solutions that allow users to monetize unused storage space. As concerns over data privacy mount, Filecoin’s model is increasingly relevant, providing a decentralized alternative that integrates seamlessly with burgeoning Web3 projects. With its innovative approach and alignment with current trends, Filecoin is poised to be a central player in the decentralized infrastructure, making it a key investment target for forward-thinking crypto enthusiasts. Wrapping Up These four best performing cryptos are not just participating in the Web3 revolution—they are actively shaping its future. Chainlink’s role in seamlessly connecting blockchains with external data, Filecoin’s innovative approach to data storage, and Stacks’ expansion of Bitcoin’s functionality illustrate the dynamic evolution of the crypto landscape. Above all, Web3Bay exemplifies the potential of smart contracts and decentralized systems in transforming e-commerce, offering users unprecedented control and security. With a launch price that hints at significant returns, the 3BAY token is an enticing prospect for investors seeking both innovation and profitability in 2025.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 308,500 followers on the social media platform X that DeFi lending platform Aave ( AAVE ) is flashing multiple bullish signs on the eight-hour chart. “AAVE [is] one of my favorite looking alts here, clear ABC down on the eight-hour chart, clear five waves within the C wave AND a cracking eight-hour bullish divergence brewing. T1 (tier-one) setup in my opinion.” Source: Bluntz/X Bluntz follows the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to witness a five-wave surge after completing an ABC correction. Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that AAVE has completed the ABC retracement with a bullish divergence to support his stance on a potential reversal. A bullish divergence is typically viewed as a reversal signal as it indicates that an asset’s momentum is rising even though its price is dropping or trading sideways. Bluntz seems to predict that AAVE will soar as high as $460 for the next leg up, a potential upside of about 56%. Looking at AAVE/BTC, Bluntz says the pair is also flashing a similar setup, suggesting that the coin is gearing up to outperform Bitcoin. “AAVE/BTC also looks identical, with a nice high time frame eight-hour bullish divergence.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, AAVE/BTC is trading for 0.003034 BTC worth $294.71.

Investors are closely watching this level, as holding it as support could signify a strong foundation for ADA to challenge higher resistance zones. Cardano Finds Strength To Rise After a recent sharp drop, Cardano (ADA) is showing resilience, finding the strength to rise and eyeing a push above last year’s high of $1.32. This recovery has sparked optimism among analysts and investors, many of whom are calling for a significant rally. Cardano is increasingly viewed as a strong contender to become a market leader, driven by its robust development ecosystem and expanding use cases. Top analyst Ali Martinez has shared compelling data highlighting growing interest from smart money investors. Posting on X, Martinez revealed a chart showing that whales have accumulated 100 million ADA over the past 48 hours. This substantial purchase underscores confidence among large holders that current price levels present a valuable buying opportunity, setting the stage for further upward momentum. This surge in whale activity aligns with broader expectations for Cardano to capitalize on its technological advantages and potential as a leader in the blockchain space. The cryptocurrency’s ability to attract significant capital from institutional and high-net-worth investors reinforces its potential to outperform in the coming months.

Successfully breaking this level would likely trigger a substantial rally, potentially propelling ADA into a new bullish phase. The coming days will be pivotal in determining whether Cardano can sustain this momentum and fulfill its promise of becoming a market frontrunner. ADA Bulls Eye Key Levels Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $1 after briefly reaching $1.05 earlier in the session. The price is consolidating and seeking support at the psychologically significant $1 level. If this key support holds, the next target for ADA is $1.15, a resistance level that could open the doors to further gains. Market sentiment around ADA remains cautiously optimistic. As a result, holding the $1 mark would signal strong demand and set the stage for a potential surge as bullish momentum builds. A breakout above $1.15 could lead to an extended rally, potentially revisiting previous highs and entering a new bullish phase. However, losing the $1 support would suggest that demand is faltering. In this scenario, ADA could see a drop to its next major support level around $0.91, putting additional pressure on bulls to regain control.

Therefore, traders and investors are closely watching for signs of strength or weakness that could dictate the altcoin’s short-term trajectory. Whether Cardano can maintain its footing above $1 will determine whether the recent recovery evolves into a sustained rally or another period of consolidation.

Concurrently, Tron trends suggest an approaching downturn, highlighted by a 45% drop from its 2024 peak. Amid these fluctuations, BlockDAG (BDAG) is launching pivotal updates that are capturing widespread attention. Its presale has successfully amassed $180.5 million, as it prepares for imminent listings on ten secondary exchanges. Furthermore, BlockDAG’s advanced Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain and its dynamic “Affiliate Program” offering up to 10% USDT cashback are solidifying its reputation among the upcoming popular crypto coins for 2025. Sui Foundation Drives Growth in Its DeFi Ecosystem In an extraordinary fourth quarter of 2024, the Sui Foundation documented a surge in growth and strategic initiatives. Sui’s ecosystem saw its TVL reach a new high of $1.8 billion, with the total trading volume escalating to $44.3 billion—a notable 444.79% rise from the previous quarter. This growth of the Sui foundation has been propelled by the introduction of stablecoins and sophisticated protocols such as DeepBook and Suilend. Strategic partnerships, like those with SatLayer and Babylon Labs, which incorporated Bitcoin liquidity, have further broadened Sui’s ecosystem. These developments underscore the Sui Foundation’s crucial influence in crafting a resilient and expanding DeFi network. Tron Trends Point to Decline as TRX Plummets 45% Tron’s (TRX) trends are nearing a pivotal threshold as it faces a significant 45% decline from its peak in 2024. Despite surpassing Ethereum with a $2.19 billion blockchain revenue last year, TRX is struggling to uphold its growth momentum. Presently at a decisive point, Tron trends hint at a likely reevaluation of its long-term support level around $0.20. Bearish indicators from technical analysis tools like the RSI and MACD amplify the uncertainty, making Tron’s upcoming moves critical for its market standing. BlockDAG Readies for Major Exchange Listings BlockDAG is gearing up to transform its presence in the cryptocurrency market with upcoming listings on 10 tier-two and tier-three exchanges, enhancing its visibility and liquidity. This strategic expansion is intended to make BDAG a recognizable name among global crypto enthusiasts. The company is integrating its cutting-edge Proof-of-Work blockchain to build a scalable, decentralized financial system, with exchange listings already secured in preparation for its 2025 Mainnet launch. The addition of the BlockDAG Affiliate Program offers up to 10% USDT cashback for referrals and a steady 6% back on purchases, promoting community involvement and turning social networks into profitable platforms. The program resets rewards daily at 00:00 UTC, motivating users to maximize their earnings and boosting excitement within the BDAG community. BlockDAG’s market initiatives have led to a highly successful presale, with revenues exceeding $180.5 million and over 17.8 billion coins sold. With the price of BDAG at only $0.0248 in its latest batch and an impressive 2,380% ROI since its inception, buyers are eager to capitalize on these gains before further listings potentially elevate prices. Projections place BDAG’s value at $1 within the year, positioning it among the most sought-after crypto coins. Its community-driven Affiliate Program, combined with strategic exchange listings, underscores its commitment to sustained growth and broad accessibility, providing substantial returns and advantages for early adopters. Highlighting the Most Popular Crypto Coins The Sui Foundation’s significant DeFi achievements underscore its leadership in nurturing a robust ecosystem. Meanwhile, Tron’s (TRX) position as a top revenue generator, despite current market challenges, emphasizes the need for strategic market navigation. BlockDAG’s robust presale outcomes and its compelling Affiliate program, rewarding up to 10% USDT cashback, have established it as one of the popular crypto coins to watch in 2025. As it gears up for more exchange listings, the ongoing interest from traders and developers signifies a bright future for BlockDAG in the competitive cryptocurrency landscape.

This would position our state at the… pic.twitter.com/dRdCt86Otr — Charles Schwertner (@DrSchwertner) January 15, 2025 Texas is pushing to lead Bitcoin adoption Senator Charles Schwertner emphasizes that Texas should lead in adopting Bitcoin. This proposal could allow the state to collect taxes, fees, and donations in BTC. With President-elect Trump’s inauguration just a week away, Republican state leaders will relentlessly try to adopt BTC as a strategic reserve asset—at least at the state level, if not as a national reserve. Texas has the second-largest economy in the U.S. and the eighth-largest globally. It also has the highest concentration of Bitcoin miners in the country. The call for a national strategic Bitcoin reserve – one of President-elect Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly campaign promises – has grown stronger since the election. Bitcoin has risen by more than 45% as optimistic investors bet that establishing such a reserve will further boost its price. U.S. states and countries are actively exploring Bitcoin reserves as a market catalyst While there is some skepticism about whether the U.S. will establish a Bitcoin reserve or if it does, whether it will be the first, the mere prospect of it could act as a positive market catalyst in the new year. This could prompt other nations to create their own reserves, even if the U.S. does not follow through. Several states are eager to take the lead in this new area. Oklahoma Representative Cody Maynard introduced House Bill 1203, dubbed the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act. The bill proposes allocating some of the state’s pension funds and savings accounts to Bitcoin. At the end of last year, Pennsylvania lawmakers proposed that the state Treasury invest up to 10% of its assets in Bitcoin. Representative Mike Cabell emphasized that Pennsylvania could follow private asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity. On January 10, North Dakota and New Hampshire also introduced their own Bitcoin reserve bills. New Hampshire’s legislation uses broader terminology, like “ digital assets, ” which indicates a potential interest in cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin.

On Jan. 15, 2025, asset management company VanEck filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the “Onchain Economy” exchange-traded fund. Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of digital assets research, disclosed the filing in a now-deleted social media post, revealing the company’s ambitious plans to invest in the rapidly growing digital transformation sector. Deleted a post on an ETF filing. Details coming soon — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) January 15, 2025 The proposed ETF aims to allocate at least 80% of its assets to businesses and products within the digital asset ecosystem. These include software developers, mining firms, cryptocurrency exchanges, infrastructure providers, payment firms, and other crypto-focused companies collectively referred to as “Digital Transformation Companies.” VanEck outlined a strategic selection process for these investments, emphasizing fundamental research, market trends, valuation, and each company’s role in the broader digital asset ecosystem. While the fund will not directly hold cryptocurrencies, it plans to invest in digital asset products such as commodity futures contracts. VanEck’s application is part of a broader wave of activity in the ETF market, driven by speculation that the regulatory environment may become more favorable for cryptocurrencies under President Donald Trump’s administration. Bitwise Asset Management applied in November 2024 for its 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF, which tracks leading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and Solana ( SOL ).

The value of the recovered assets has appreciated by 16,618.31% to $11.97 billion from $72 million at the time of the hack. As crypto investors prepare for an eventful year under Trump’s incoming administration, the U.S. government has given a glimmer of hope to victims who lost their Bitcoin holdings in August 2016 from a hack on the Bitfinex crypto exchange. The U.S. government announced that the funds seized from the hack’s recovery operation should be reimbursed to victims through “in-kind” restitution. U.S. court rules that funds from Bitfinex hack must be returned to the exchange As expected *GOVT SAYS SEIZED BITCOIN FROM 2016 BITFINEX HACK SHOULD BE RETURNED IN-KIND Do they just ask Paolo for the addy? https://t.co/8iwx6J1XR6 pic.twitter.com/ndNd1UrdWG — db (@tier10k) January 15, 2025 According to an official document circulating online, a US court ordered that the US government should return the funds seized from the Bitfinex crypto hack back to the exchange. The court also ordered the U.S. government to notify all victims of the hack. The court also ruled that the government should post a link on the Department of Justice website directing potential victims to the case’s specific website where all vital information will be relayed. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia filed a legal motion in October last year where it identified the Bitfinex crypto exchange as the only entity eligible for restitution after the hack. The hack resulted in the loss of 120,000 Bitcoin worth $72 million at the time meaning that each Bitcoin was valued at around $600. The digital assets were recovered and have been in the custody of the government since then. A 2023 report from Chainalysis revealed that FBI, IRS Criminal Investigation, Homeland Security Investigations, and other government agencies initially recovered over 94,000 BTC. Further recovery efforts ran till June 2023 and brought the recovered assets to 108,068 Bitcoin. The recovered digital assets are worth $11.87 billion in today’s Bitcoin prices. This makes asset recovery rank among the top most valuable crypto recoveries in history. The victims literally made 16,618.31% if the government executed the reimbursement process. The U.S. government arrests charges and sentences Bitfinex hack perpetrators The U.S. government arrested and charged two individuals, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Rhiannon Morgan, on counts of money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to defraud the United States as part of the charges related to the 2016 Bitfinex attack. On November 14th, 2024, Ilya Lichtenstein was sentenced to five years in prison for participating in a money laundering conspiracy arising from the hack and theft of approximately 120,000 bitcoins from Bitfinex, a global cryptocurrency exchange. On the other hand, his accomplice and wife Morgan was sentenced to 18 months for helping her husband launder the stolen funds. U.S. Government linked address compromised for $20 million While in government custody, on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence showed something fishy happened. In October last year, about $20 million in digital assets that were believed to be the proceeds of the Bitfinex hack were moved from the government-controlled wallet in what appeared to be suspicious activity. The funds were moved into a relatively new wallet at the time that was five days old. From there, the wallet owners moved the stolen funds through various blockchain accounts in what seemed like an attempt to conceal the funds’ source. Some funds found their way into instant exchanges that derive their liquidity from Binance and are typically used for money laundering activities. The incident was not officially reported and the reason for the transactions remained unknown. The event occurred in 24 hours and the majority of the funds were returned to the government-controlled wallet. Theories suggest that the incident originated from compromised keys following the speed at which the recovery process was accomplished.

Social Media Is Now Bullish On Dogecoin, Solana, & Cardano In a new post on X, the analytics firm Santiment has discussed what sentiment the traders on social media currently hold toward the various top assets in the cryptocurrency sector. The metric of relevance here is the “Positive/Negative Sentiment,” which, as its name suggests, tells us about how the bullish and bearish sentiments related to a given asset compare on the major social media platforms. Related Reading: Massive Dogecoin Rally Incoming? Experts Point To Over 1,000% Upside This indicator works by putting the posts/comments/messages present on the platforms through a machine-learning model to separate between positive and negative ones. It then takes the ratio of these counts to calculate the net situation around the coin. When the Positive/Negative Sentiment has a value greater than zero, it means the bullish posts outweigh the negative ones. On the other hand, it being under the mark implies the investors as a whole share a negative sentiment. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the indicator for six top coins: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA): As displayed in the above graph, the Positive/Negative Sentiment has witnessed an increase for Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano recently, suggesting the sentiment around the assets has improved. Out of these, traders are the most positive toward SOL, with its bullish comments being around six times the bearish ones. The metric has a value of around 3 for ADA and 2 for DOGE. The improvement in sentiment for Dogecoin and others has come after a sector-wide rebound in prices. Interestingly, while the bullish wave has made investors more optimistic about these coins, it has failed to do so in the case of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, the top three cryptocurrencies by market cap. The indicator is sitting close to the neutral zero level for these assets, which implies there are about as many positive posts as negative ones. This fact, however, may not actually be bad for BTC and the crypto market. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Fun Will Begin When This Flip Happens Historically, digital assets have tended to show moves in a direction that’s opposite to the expectations of the majority. This means that an overly bullish crowd can lead to tops, while an extremely bearish one can result in bottoms. Thus, the hype around Dogecoin, Solana, and Cardano may act to the detriment of their prices, while Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP could have bullish room to run before they reach a top. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.352, up more than 2% over the past week.

While meme coins wobble under market pressures, 1FUEL is charging forward. Its presale has already raised $1.3 million, with early adopters seeing prices jump from $0.01 to $0.017 and there’s still a 20% bonus for those getting in now. If you’re hunting for the next big thing, 1FUEL’s mix of privacy, utility, and innovation might just be it. Read on to find out more! Pudgy Penguins and PENGU: Can this bird fly higher? PENGU, the cryptocurrency tied to the adorable yet wildly popular Pudgy Penguins NFTs, is back in focus. Its recent rally above $0.032 was no fluke, breaking out of a falling wedge pattern has put it in the bull’s crosshairs. Still, the numbers tell a complicated story. A $1.9 billion market cap and $328 million in daily trades showcase its market heft, yet the token is still 55% down from its ATH of $0.06845. That drop, combined with a 10% slide over the last two weeks, reveals the fragility of its recovery. Investors eyeing this project are asking a tough question—can PENGU truly rise, or are we looking at another false dawn? Is Dogwifhat losing its bark? Dogwifhat once led the pack in meme coin mania, roaring past expectations with social media hype and massive exchange listings. Today, though, WIF’s bark has quieted. Trading between $1.39 and $1.86 , WIF is testing a crucial support level. Falling 68% from its $4.83 ATH, it’s simply a shadow of its former self. The 40% drop over the past month is more than market turbulence. A strengthening US Dollar and tighter monetary policies have clipped WIF’s wings. While WIF’s $1.5 billion market cap and $240 million trading volume remain impressive, they mask the real story: volatility. WIF’s wild swings attract thrill-seekers but spook long-term backers. Analysts aren’t ready to write it off, though—if WIF stabilizes, it could stage a comeback. But for now, WIF’s path forward looks as unpredictable as its rise to fame once did. What’s making 1FUEL the best cryptocurrency to buy right now? At 1FUEL’s core is a revolutionary cryptocurrency wallet, designed not just for storage but as a gateway to secure, cross-chain transactions and unmatched privacy. It is built for the complexities of today’s multi-chain world. With cold storage, a built-in mixer, and intuitive design, it’s a leap forward. The dev team is laying the groundwork for P2P trading, creating a network effect where every new user enhances the ecosystem. And for those who crave passive income, staking rewards of up to 30% APR are on the table. With virtual debit cards also in the pipeline, 1FUEL’s promising to merge crypto with real-world spending in ways that feel natural. Presale stages 1 and 2 sold out at lightning speed, raising over $1.3 million. Prices have already climbed 70% to $0.017, and analysts predict this is just the beginning. Unlike PENGU and WIF, which hinge on trend cycles, 1FUEL is the best cryptocurrency to buy right now for its practical applications and room to grow. The bottom line Meme coins like PENGU and WIF may thrive on chaos, but 1FUEL is building a foundation for the long haul. Early backers are already seeing gains, and with a presale price of just $0.017 and a 20% bonus still on the table, the window for getting in early is closing fast. The market is already responding, but the best gains might still be ahead.

While these tokens have enjoyed viral success, emerging platforms like Lightchain AI are redefining what it means to build value in the crypto space. With a focus on utility and long-term growth, Lightchain AI’s momentum could spell trouble for speculative tokens reliant on social hype. Limitations of Dogecoin and Pepe Coin Dogecoin and Pepe Coin, both well-known joke coins, have clear limits. Dogecoin’s endless supply can cause inflation which may lessen value with time. Its dependence on social media and famous people ͏makes it weak to changing market feelings causing price ups and downs. Also, Dogecoin’s lack of growth with few changes brings worry about its ability to compete. Pepe Coin, though using funny internet images, has no real usefulness, working mostly as a gamble. This lack of true uses leads to big ups and downs and makes it easy to mess with in the market. The unknown group behind its making adds more worry about trust and responsibility. Both digital coins rely on group support and excitement, showing how they are risky to put money in for buyers. Lightchain AI Future of Blockchain Innovation Unlike Dogecoin and Pepe Coin, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a pioneer in blockchain technology, addressing real-world challenges with a forward-thinking approach. Currently in its Stage 12 presale, priced at $0.00525, and having raised over $10.4 million, Lightchain AI has already demonstrated its ability to attract investor confidence. Lightchain AI focuses on creating a scalable and efficient blockchain ecosystem designed to support diverse applications. Its emphasis on decentralization and energy efficiency ensures it can meet the growing demands of industries and developers without compromising sustainability. By targeting meaningful applications and solving critical challenges in the blockchain space, Lightchain AI is building an infrastructure for long-term success, making it a strong contender for future market leadership. What This Means for Meme Tokens The rise of projects like Lightchain AI highlights the market’s shift toward utility-driven platforms that deliver lasting value. While Dogecoin and Pepe Coin may continue to draw attention in the short term, their speculative nature makes them less competitive against innovative solutions with real-world applications. For investors, this signals the importance of diversifying portfolios to include projects like Lightchain AI , which offer both growth potential and practical utility. Plus, with the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the demand for efficient blockchain technology will only continue to grow. As a result, projects like Lightchain AI that prioritize scalability and sustainability are positioned to thrive in this evolving landscape.

Understanding these shifts is crucial for prospective buyers to determine the most promising crypto investments for the upcoming year. SUI’s market cap is rapidly approaching a significant milestone of $16 billion, propelled by recent strategic developments. Simultaneously, Chainlink has registered an impressive 18% increase, largely driven by significant whale purchases. However, BlockDAG (BDAG) is establishing itself with a standout feature of dual compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM), positioning it as a potential leader in the meme coin arena. The platform’s success is underscored by its robust presale performance, with substantial funds raised, indicating strong market confidence. SUI Market Cap: Close to a $16 Billion Achievement The SUI cryptocurrency is rapidly gaining momentum, with its market capitalization approaching a robust $16 billion, making it the 12th largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap. The price of SUI has recently surged to about $5.09, reflecting an 8% increase. This notable rise in value comes in the wake of the unlocking of 82 million SUI coins, which has significantly enhanced the trading volume. Additionally, the network’s open interest has witnessed a substantial 37% rise, climbing to $1.22 billion. This surge in market activity and investor interest underscores the growing confidence in SUI’s potential and its strengthening position in the cryptocurrency market. Chainlink Whales: Indicators of an 18% Increase Chainlink (LINK) has experienced an 18% surge, largely driven by significant purchases from Chainlink whales. These major investors have snapped up over 1.4 million LINK following a price dip to a support level around $19, suggesting a potential rally ahead. This uptick in whale activity underscores LINK’s resilience in a fluctuating market and indicates growing investor confidence. Additionally, a decrease in exchange outflows points to fewer holders selling their LINK, supporting a bullish forecast for Chainlink as it potentially tests higher resistance levels soon. BlockDAG’s Dual Compatibility: A Foundation for Meme Coins BlockDAG (BDAG) is emerging as a top destination for meme coin creation in 2025, swiftly establishing itself as a premier platform in this niche. Its standout feature is the exceptional compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM), which allows developers to utilize robust programming languages like Rust and C++. This dual compatibility not only simplifies the deployment of dApps and smart contracts but also opens doors to scalable, cross-platform applications. As meme coins continue to captivate the crypto community, BlockDAG is positioning itself at the forefront of this trend for 2025. The platform is also attracting significant attention from large buyers. During its 27th crypto presale, BlockDAG has already attracted over $180.5 million, with 17.8 billion coins snapped up by eager buyers. Thanks to its focus on low fees, quick transaction confirmations, and a developer-friendly ecosystem, BlockDAG is drawing both individual and institutional interest. The platform is buzzing with new token creations, games, and decentralized applications tailored for the meme coin market. Now is a pivotal time for traders. The ongoing Batch 27 presale presents a unique chance to get in on the action before prices take off. Currently priced at $0.0248, BlockDAG has delivered an impressive 2380% return since its first batch, positioning it as a must-buy for those looking to capitalize on early gains. With growing excitement within the community and continued assets from whales, the potential for significant returns is clearer than ever. Why BlockDAG is the Prime Crypto Pick for 2025 The evolution of the crypto market in 2025 features significant developments with SUI’s market cap growth and Chainlink’s whale-driven price increase. However, BlockDAG sets itself apart with its unique EVM and WASM compatibility, enhancing developer flexibility and scalability. This positions BlockDAG as a leading platform for meme coin creation, attracting significant stakes and offering promising returns. As such, BlockDAG is poised as the top cryptocurrency to jump in for both seasoned and new buyers in 2025.

Remember when Dogecoin first took off? It wasn’t just a joke; it turned into a legit investment vehicle! The wild ride of meme coins has captured the imagination of millions, from Gen Z to seasoned investors. But with so many options out there, it’s tough to know where to place your bets. If you missed the Pepe Coin wealth train, don’t worry— BTFD Coin is here, and it’s primed to shake things up in the meme coin arena. What makes BTFD Coin stand out in this crowded market? For starters, it’s not just another meme coin riding the coattails of internet humor. BTFD Coin is introducing features that elevate its status: a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , an enticing referral program, and eye-popping staking rewards with a 90% Annual Percentage Yield (APY). Seriously, who wouldn’t want to be part of a project that’s not only fun but also financially rewarding? As the presale heats up, analysts are buzzing about BTFD Coin’s potential to be one of the top new meme coins to invest in now. So, if you’re looking to dive into the crypto world, this could be your golden ticket. Let’s break down what makes BTFD Coin the talk of the town and how it compares to its predecessor, Pepe Coin. BTFD Coin: The Next Big Thing in Meme Coins Let’s kick things off with what BTFD Coin brings to the table. Currently, in its 13th presale stage, BTFD is priced at $0.000142, a jump from its initial presale price of just $0.000004. With over $5.2 million raised and over 64 billion $BTFD coins sold, the enthusiasm is palpable. But it’s not just about numbers; it’s about community and engagement. One of the standout features is the recently launched Play-to-Earn game , which went live on January 1, 2025. Imagine diving into a gaming experience where you can earn tokens while having a blast. It’s not just about holding coins anymore; it’s about actively participating in a fun ecosystem that rewards you for your time. This game isn’t just a gimmick; it’s a real way for users to earn and engage, making it one of the top new meme coins to invest in now. Then there’s the staking program, which kicked off on December 2, offering an astonishing 90% APY. That’s right—90%! This is a game-changer for anyone looking to grow their investment without lifting a finger. Just lock up your coins, sit back, and watch your wealth accumulate. And let’s not overlook the referral program, which incentivizes users to spread the word and earn even more. The more you share, the more you earn—it’s a win-win!

If you invest $10,000 now, you could see significant returns when the coin lists at $0.0006. That’s a potential profit of over $15,000! Who wouldn’t want to jump on that train? Pepe Coin: The Meme Coin Classic Now, let’s take a look at Pepe Coin, which has been a staple in the meme coin universe. Launched to capitalize on the beloved internet meme of the green frog, Pepe Coin quickly gained traction. It captured the hearts of many, much like Dogecoin did, and it became a darling of social media. Its rise was fueled by an enthusiastic community that rallied around the meme culture, but as we know, the crypto landscape is notoriously volatile. While Pepe Coin still has a loyal following, the question remains: has it peaked? Many investors are beginning to wonder if it can sustain its momentum in a market that’s constantly changing. Analysts have mixed feelings. Some believe Pepe Coin will continue to have a place in the meme coin arena, while others suggest that newer coins like BTFD are better bets for the future. Community engagement has been a strong point for Pepe Coin, driven by social media buzz and meme creation. However, as newer coins introduce innovative features, investors may find themselves looking for fresh opportunities. The initial excitement around Pepe Coin was undeniable, but will it be enough to keep investors interested? It’s a gamble, and one that’s led many to explore alternatives like BTFD Coin. In the end, while Pepe Coin has laid the groundwork for meme coins, it’s becoming increasingly clear that the market is shifting. Investors are hungry for new opportunities, and with BTFD Coin’s robust features and active community, it’s hard not to see why many are calling it one of the top new meme coins to invest in now. Conclusion: Seize the Opportunity with BTFD Coin In a world where meme coins continue to rise and fall, BTFD Coin is carving its niche as a compelling investment opportunity. With its innovative features, strong community support, and the buzz surrounding its presale, it’s quickly becoming one of the top new meme coins to invest in now. If you missed the Pepe Coin wealth train, don’t fret; BTFD Coin is ready to take you on a new ride. So, what are you waiting for? Dive into the BTFD Coin presale and make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity. Get involved, spread the word, and watch your investment grow.

The case, originally filed in December 2020, centers on whether Ripple’s sales of XRP to retail investors constitute unregistered securities transactions. US SEC Disagrees with Lower Court’s Ruling on Retail XRP Sales In its appeal brief filed on Wednesday evening, the US SEC stated that the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York made a mistake in the ruling issued in July 2023. The district court had held that Ripple’s programmatic sales of XRP to retail investors through cryptocurrency exchanges did not violate federal securities laws. The SEC claims that every XRP sale, no matter which particular seller has conducted the sale or how the sale was made, constitutes an “investment contract” in terms of the Howey Test. The agency argues that Ripple’s promotion activities gave a perception that investors, including retail buyers, were likely to make profit out of the XRP. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP @Ripple The @SECGov has filed its opening brief. https://t.co/v0YTjHGxzV — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) January 15, 2025 “The district court’s decision that retail buyers could not have reasonably expected gains from Ripple’s efforts because they purchased XRP anonymously through crypto platforms was in error,” the US SEC stated in its brief. It also noted that, representations made by Ripple for promotion of XRP were equally as much available to institutional and retail investors. Ripple Faces Allegations of Boosting XRP Demand In the SEC filing, the agency alleges that Ripple used the sales of XRP to inflate its demand and value in the market. The SEC alleged that Ripple published information regarding the token, on its website, social media, and in the media, with the aim of generating buy orders and, thus, profit expectations among investors. The agency claims that these actions made both institutional and retail investors treat XRP as a security that relies on Ripple’s growth. Further, the SEC also disputed the court’s ruling to exclude XRP received in non-cash transactions including in employee compensation and business incentives from securities laws. Nevertheless, Ripple continues to argue that XRP is a digital currency and not a security, and therefore, the sales of XRP cannot be considered as an investment contract under the law. Amid the ongoing case, defense attorney James K. Filan ealier noted that both Ripple and the SEC had submitted a stipulation regarding the ongoing cross-appeals process. According to Filan, both parties have agreed to file a deferred appendix 21 days after the appellee’s opening brief is served. Ripple CLO Dismisses SEC Arguments Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, called the SEC’s appeal “a rehash of already failed arguments.” In an X post, Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty suggested that the case would likely lose momentum under the next SEC administration as Chair Gary Gensler prepares to step down on January 20, 2025. Moreover, President Trump has nominated Paul Atkins, known for his crypto-friendly stance, to lead the agency. Ripple has argued throughout the case that XRP should not be classified as a security under U.S. law. The company points to the district court’s partial ruling, which stated that programmatic sales of XRP did not meet the Howey Test criteria. The legal battle began in 2020 when the SEC accused Ripple of raising $1.3 billion through unregistered XRP sales. In July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s direct sales to institutional investors violated securities laws but found that programmatic sales and distributions did not. Despite the ongoing Ripple case, XRP’s price has surged recently, reaching $3, for the first time since 2018 amid projections of a rally to $6. This price increase reflects optimism about potential regulatory changes under the incoming SEC leadership.

ETH is rising and facing hurdles near the $3,480 zone. Ethereum started a minor recovery wave above the $3,240 zone. The price is trading above $3,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a short-term contracting triangle with resistance at $3,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it clears the $3,480 resistance level. Ethereum Price Gains Over 5% Ethereum price started a recovery wave above the $3,150 level like Bitcoin . ETH was able to clear the $3,180 and $3,240 resistance levels to move into a short-term positive zone. Besides, there was a break above a short-term contracting triangle with resistance at $3,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair even surged above the $3,350 and $3,400 levels. Finally, it tested the $3,480 zone. A high was formed at $3,473 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,186 swing low to the $3,473 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,450 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,480 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,500. A clear move above the $3,500 resistance might send the price toward the $3,550 resistance. An upside break above the $3,550 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,650 resistance zone or even $3,720 in the near term. Downside Correction In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,480 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,350 level. The first major support sits near the $3,280 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,186 swing low to the $3,473 high. A clear move below the $3,280 support might push the price toward the $3,240 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,120 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,050. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

AVAX’s volume profile range (VPVR), for example, highlights a significant trading cluster between $40 and $42, a critical resistance area where considerable buy and sell orders have historically taken place. On the other hand, the Binance coin has highlighted a series of higher and lower highs. While this trend has found support at the $641 level, the bears have little firepower. Meanwhile, Lunex Network (LNEX) continues to witness massive growth as investors anticipate more rallies in the coming weeks. Designed to enable seamless buying, selling, and swapping of cryptocurrencies across blockchains, the LNEX token has been projected to outshine existing crypto giants in this bull cycle. Lunex Network (LNEX): Transforming Crypto Trading Lunex Network is a next-gen Web3 DeFi crypto exchange designed to enable seamless trading and swapping of cryptos across multiple blockchains at the lowest costs. Unlike conventional exchanges with rigorous KYC requirements, Lunex has eliminated these processes, including third-party DeFi wallet connectivity, like Meta Mask and Trust Wallet, minimizing data breaches and barriers to entry. As the first community-backed crypto exchange, Lunex enables businesses to accept crypto as a form of payment and convert it instantly to fiat through its B2B payment gateway API. This move has solved the inherent cross-border payment issues that most traders face. Its standout mobile exchange will enable users to spot trade over 50K crypto pairs across multiple blockchains. Moreover, traders can use Lunex’s portfolio tracker to track digital assets like bonds, stocks, and cryptos. The platform stands out for its simplicity as users will only have a unique DeFi crypto wallet that allows them to buy, sell, and cryptos all from one account. Like BNB, LNEX crypto holds massive potential. At the ongoing presale, the LNEX tokens are going for only $0.0056, with early investors already making 360% in profit. With close tor $6.4 million raised in crypto ICO funding, the LNEX price is expected to jump to $1 in 2025 Avalanche Oversold or More Room for Declines? Despite attempting a breakout in December, the AVAX token has struggled to peak above its significant barrier, reinforcing bearish sentiment. Avalanche VPVR has identified the $27 region as a potential support level. This area aligns with its previous accumulation area, indicating potential buying interest. If the AVAX token can breach this support level, the altcoin could see further declines towards the $25 range. Recent data have demonstrated a decline in Open Interest (OI), which aligns with AVAX’s inability to sustain bullish momentum above $55 in November. A declining OI typically highlights waning speculative interest as AVAX traders hold their positions amid uncertainty. This further reflects diminishing confidence in a short-term recovery. AVAX crypto must rally above the $40 and $42 resistance levels with a rising OI to shift this sentiment. Notably, AVAX’s relative Strength Index (RSI) has been hovering below the neutral zone at 50, reflecting the ongoing bearish momentum. This further aligns with the token’s lower highs and lower lows pattern. If the RSI continues to decline, it could enter an oversold condition, potentially attracting bargain hunters and driving a short-term recovery. Without a decisive jump above 45, bearish momentum would likely remain dominant. For AVAX bulls to take control of the market, RSI must surpass the 50 mark, highlighting a breakout above its $42 resistance level. BNB Price Analysis Amid the current market turbulence, BNB crypto has closed below its 50-day simple moving average at $691 on January 7, but the bears are struggling to sustain these lower levels. BNB bulls have been trying to push its value above the moving averages. If they become successful, the price of BNB could rally to challenge the overhead resistance at the $745 level. A breakout above this level could set the stage for a rally toward $794. Notably, the bears will try to defend the level with all their might. However, if the bulls prevail, the next target would be at the $935 level. On the flip side, if the price of BNB fails to close above the 20-day exponential moving average , it could signal that the bears have taken charge. This could drop BNB’s price toward its downside support level of $635. The recent downtrend can be attributed to broader market turbulence. Its open interest is increasing, suggesting investor confidence. Per CoinGlass data , derivative open interest for the BNB ecosystem has increased, demonstrating its potential to attract leveraged traders. The uptick comes as the BNB token recorded more price downturns in the past few days. Best Token To Buy: AVAX, BNB, and LNEX While AVAX and BNB bulls aim to reverse their current trajectory, Lunex Network could become a strong contender in the market. Based on its growth potential and innovative cross-chain capabilities, Lunex is emerging as the go-to platform for high returns and reliability in the DeFi market.

If Thielen’s crystal ball is correct, the digital asset might potentially experience significant price swings on January 29, 2025, once it breaks out of its so-called “symmetrical triangle” formation. Related Reading: Solana Tops The Charts As Artificial Intelligence Go-To Blockchain Platform —Research However, the path to this breakout is fraught with variables that could sway Bitcoin’s trajectory in any direction. Breaking Down The Technicals Bitcoin has been trading in a symmetrical triangular pattern for quite some time. These patterns typically signify consolidation, implying that the market is gearing up for a major move. Thielen sees this as a possibility for a breakout, which might push Bitcoin over its resistance levels. However, he adds that there is no assurance. The breakout may happen either way. Inflation And Fed Decisions Affect Bitcoin A breakout may not be fully based on technical analysis. Thielen notes that inflation data and Federal Reserve interest rate decisions will have a significant impact on Bitcoin’s future price behavior. If inflation remains high and the Fed continues to raise interest rates, the market’s risk appetite may decline, impeding Bitcoin’s growth. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, Bitcoin may skyrocket. Timeline For Breakout Thielen speculates that Bitcoin will break out on January 29, 2025. If this schedule is accurate, we could witness a huge movement in the market. However, time, like all predictions, is subject to uncertainty. Thielen, meanwhile, alluded to a bullish break and the ensuing Bitcoin surge. Growing anticipation of increased Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers served as the foundation for the market expert’s claim. The market may take longer to break through or face unexpected volatility, which alters the present trend. Investors should be cautious because the breakout could happen sooner or later than planned based on market conditions. The Uncertainty Factor While many analysts have a bright outlook, Thielen warns on prudence. Bitcoin’s price is famously volatile, with the possibility of huge volatility remaining. Investors should be aware that Bitcoin can encounter obstacles that restrict its breakout potential even with the positive technical patterns. Navigating this unpredictable terrain will depend much on risk management. Related Reading: Analyst Declares XRP A Bullish Favorite – Rally Imminent?

Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Saves California on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Saves California by entering its contract address – 2mtzeaYqDPLtCemX5jNPuuq8jw65cbgNUXuT3fBra2M2 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCALI.

In a brief submitted on Wednesday, the SEC disagreed with the earlier ruling by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District, which stated that certain XRP sales to retail investors did not violate securities laws. The appeal basically challenges the district court’s distinction between institutional and retail investors. The SEC said, “The district court reasoned that institutional investors reasonably expected profits from the efforts of others because Ripple represented that its efforts would increase the price of XRP.” #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP @Ripple The @SECGov has filed its opening brief. https://t.co/v0YTjHGxzV — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) January 15, 2025 Disagreement with Court’s Ruling The SEC argued that the district court’s distinction between the expectations of institutional and retail investors is inconsistent with the objective investor standard outlined in the Howey test. They also claimed it goes against a fundamental principle of federal securities laws, which asserts that less sophisticated investors are just as deserving of protection as more sophisticated investors. “But the district court erroneously found that retail investors did not have that same expectation because they purchased XRP through crypto asset trading platforms and thus did not know if the seller was Ripple, a Ripple affiliate, or someone else,” the agency added. The SEC wants to reverse the court’s ruling in favor of Ripple and argue that all XRP sales are unregistered securities. If they win, the case will go back to the district court. Possible Shift in Crypto Regulation Amid this legal chaos, rumors are circulating that the Trump administration’s SEC could revamp its stance on crypto regulation. Reports suggest a potential pause on enforcement actions, which could lead to quicker settlements and a shift away from “regulation by enforcement.” With the current sec chair Gary Gensler set to step down next week, the new administration is expected to bring more clarity and support for the crypto industry.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-16 03:34:31

Insights on FET Ecosystem & CoinRank Partnership,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-investors-snap-up-200m-web3bays-3bay-tokens-insights-on-fet-ecosystem-coinrank-partnership/,"In a significant development for the decentralized sector, the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance has enhanced the FET ecosystem by conducting its first token reduction, aiming to limit supply and raise value. Additionally, CoinRank has partnered with CyberCharge to improve Web3 interaction with smarter, advanced tools. On the other side, Web3Bay (3BAY) distinguishes itself with a decentralized e-commerce model. At the heart of its ecosystem, the 3BAY token offers unique benefits like price cuts and the right to make decisions. So far, Web3Bay has sold over 200 million 3BAY tokens, collecting over $700,000, confirming its crucial role in changing how we buy and sell digital assets. FET Ecosystem Announces Initial Token Reduction The newly formed Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, combining FET, OCEAN, and AGIX tokens, has declared its first major token reduction set for January 10, removing five million FET tokens from circulation. This strategy, intended to create scarcity, aims to possibly lift its long-term value. Although this move has not yet triggered a large market reaction, FET has seen a 14% price rise in the past week, showing some optimistic sentiment, despite being 57% below its highest price of $3.47. This upcoming token reduction could solidify the FET Ecosystem’s reputation, although recovering its peak value remains a challenge amid fluctuating market conditions in a quickly changing sector. CoinRank & CyberCharge Collaboration Enhances Web3 Interaction CoinRank, known for cryptocurrency analytics, has partnered with CyberCharge to improve user interaction with blockchain technology. This partnership introduces advanced tools to the table. By integrating CyberCharge’s cutting-edge solutions, CoinRank aims to facilitate smoother transactions, improve decentralized finance (DeFi) operations, and offer an easier interface for crypto portfolio management. With a focus on refining innovation, CoinRank and CyberCharge are setting the stage for a future where Web3 interaction is more seamless and secure. The success of these updates in simplifying crypto management will rely on the effective implementation and user adoption of these features. Web3Bay Raises $700K & Promises 6430% ROI Web3Bay (3BAY) is a decentralized e-commerce platform that seeks to revolutionize the way people buy and sell digital assets. The 3BAY token, central to its operations, facilitates seamless transactions on the platform. Additionally, the token provides utility, governance, and exclusive benefits to its holders. Users purchasing with the 3BAY token receive a 5% discount, promoting adoption and improving user experience. Governance features also enable token holders to actively participate in platform decisions, fostering a truly community-driven environment. The 3BAY token presale has already attracted substantial interest, with over 200 million tokens sold, raising a total of $700,000 so far. At the current presale stage 3 price of $0.0039675, the 3BAY token presents an attractive opportunity to shape and benefit from a blockchain-powered e-commerce platform that’s busy revolutionizing the online buying and selling of digital assets. With the growing demand, Web3Bay’s ongoing presale offers a distinct chance to acquire tokens early before presale batches sell out and prices significantly increase. Time is of the essence, and the chance to partake in Web3Bay’s transformative venture at this early stage should not be overlooked. Final Thoughts The FET ecosystem continues to grow with new initiatives like token reductions, potentially enhancing its long-term value. Simultaneously, CoinRank is facilitating easier Web3 interaction by teaming up with CyberCharge. However, the 3BAY token represents a distinct opportunity for those looking to buy and sell digital assets beyond the limits of traditional centralized platforms. As a pillar of the Web3Bay ecosystem, the 3BAY token offers a direct stake in the future of decentralized e-commerce . Focusing on user-oriented features such as discounts and community governance, the 3BAY token provides a strong appeal for those wanting to be part of the web3 revolution ahead of the global curve. Currently, in its third presale stage, buyers are quickly securing 3BAY tokens at the ongoing rate of $0.0039675 before anticipated demand hikes and price increases.

The SEC aims to classify all XRP sales as unregistered securities offerings. Reacting to the news, Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty took to X (formerly Twitter) and wrote, “As expected, the SEC’s appeal brief is a rehash of already failed arguments –and likely to be abandoned by the next administration. We’ll respond formally in due time. For now, know this: the SEC’s lawsuit is just noise. A new era of pro-innovation regulation is coming, and Ripple is thriving.” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also expressed disappointment and said, “One definition of insanity….Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Gensler’s SEC really took this to heart.” XRP Price Touches $3: Despite the legal chaos, Ripple’s XRP saw a 14% increase, reaching a yearly high above $3 on Wednesday morning, showing renewed investor interest. XRP, along with Dogecoin, is leading the gains in the cryptocurrency market, outperforming Bitcoin. Bitcoin has touched $100,000 once more and is currently trading just above that level.

XRP’s chart is looking strong, with analysts predicting possible future price gains. Some analysts believe XRP could reach $4 or even higher, thanks to a long period of accumulation.

This project plans to launch an autonomous agent to spot market trends before they take off. And with $1 million in presale funding raised in its first 24 hours alone, it’s clear that investor interest is exploding. MIND of Pepe Presale Takes Off with Huge First-Day Raise Crypto presales offer a unique opportunity: early access to tokens at the lowest possible price before they launch on exchanges. That’s the setup with MIND of Pepe. This AI-focused project is already getting attention, raising far more than the developers had expected in its first 24 hours of going live. MIND of Pepe’s rapid fundraising suggests retail investors are eager to get involved as early as possible. Currently, MIND tokens are available for $0.0031144 each, but this price will increase in just one day. That’s because the presale incorporates automatic price adjustments at each new stage. It means early investors get the lowest possible entry point. Joining the MIND token presale is simple. The developers accept various payment methods, including ETH, USDT, BNB, and credit cards. This ease of access, combined with Mind of Pepe’s innovative use case, has led to bullish social media discussions. The project’s Twitter page already has more than 2,600 followers. MIND of Pepe’s Telegram channel is also multiplying, with investors worldwide piling in to learn more about the development team’s plans. Behind the AI – How MIND of Pepe Spots Explosive Crypto Opportunities MIND of Pepe is like a digital crypto analyst, using advanced AI tech to sift through vast amounts of data – conversations, emerging trends, and market signals – across social media platforms like Twitter. Unlike simple trading bots that execute pre-programmed commands, this AI agent actively participates in the crypto community and develops its own insights. Here’s how it works: Imagine waking up to discover that MIND of Pepe has identified a promising new token overnight. It might have analyzed thousands of social media posts and blockchain interactions to find this token. MIND holders get exclusive access to insights like this through private community channels. These insights provide a clear advantage – especially for market newcomers. MIND of Pepe’s AI agent can even create and launch its own tokens, offering MIND holders first access. YouTuber Jacob Bury believes this feature could be revolutionary. He released a video discussing the MIND of Pepe project – and predicted it could offer a simple way to flip $1,000 into $10,000. Inside MIND of Pepe’s Tokenomics & High-Yield Staking App MIND of Pepe’s tokenomics structure showcases the development team’s ambition. A 25% share of the supply is allocated to the AI agent itself, ensuring it can expand its reach and influence over time. A further 30% is dedicated to ongoing development, showing the team’s commitment to staying ahead of the curve. MIND of Pepe’s team has also launched a staking platform while the presale is ongoing. This platform allows early investors to begin earning rewards immediately. Current yields are estimated at 1,750% per year – although that figure will decrease as more people stake. Although these huge yields are enticing, the real selling point for investors is how MIND of Pepe could permanently change the meme coin space. Most meme coins are all about hype and going viral. But MIND of Pepe takes a different approach, mixing that hype with genuine utility. It also taps into the AI crypto trend – which even big players like Franklin Templeton are bullish on . So, while it’s still in its early days, MIND of Pepe seems to have a bright future ahead.

However, Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty termed the case as noise and believes the case will be dismissed in the next administration. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed its opening brief to escalate its legal battle against blockchain-based digital payment network Ripple with only a few hours before the deadline elapsed. In October last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered that the U.S. SEC vs. Ripple and its executive brief be filed on or before January 15, 2025 failure to which the appeal would be dismissed. Court filings show the U.S. SEC is challenging Judge Analisa Torres’ July 13, 2023 ruling The court documents reveal that the regulator seeks to challenge part of the July 13, 2023 ruling by New York Judge Analisa Torres that categorized XRP tokens differently when dispensed to retail and institutional investors. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP @Ripple The @SECGov has filed its opening brief. https://t.co/v0YTjHGxzV — James K. Filan 🇺🇸🇮🇪 (@FilanLaw) January 15, 2025 The financial watchdog explained that Torres’ conclusion that profits can’t be expected unless investors knowingly buy from the issuer is against both applicable law and the “undisputed facts.” The SEC emphasized that the court’s ruling is against fundamental securities laws and builds an unsustainable contradiction between investor expectations. The SEC argues that the ruling contradicts the Howey Test which is used to establish whether an asset is a security or not. The document showed that the regulator continued to accuse Ripple, its co-founder Christian Larsen, and the company’s Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse of breaking the securities regulations when selling XRP tokens to retail and institutional investors. The commission also criticized the ruling for distinguishing institutional investors from retail ones, saying that Ripple’s extensive marketing aimed at boosting XRP’s price. Ripple’s executives respond to U.S. SEC’s last-minute filing Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty wrote on X that the last-minute move by the regulator was expected. The legal expert said the new court filing is a reconstitution of the initial arguments that failed in previous court proceedings. Alderoty termed the legal action by the financial watchdog as “noise” and expressed his beliefs that the new administration under President-elect Donald Trump will abandon the years-long case in due time. The legal expert also highlighted that a new era of regulations supporting the crypto industry is about to begin and Ripple will thrive. “As expected, the SEC’s appeal brief is a rehash of already failed arguments –and likely to be abandoned by the next administration. We’ll respond formally in due time. For now, know this: the SEC’s lawsuit is just noise.” – Stuart Alderoty Ripple’s Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse also commented on the SEC’s legal action, calling it insanity. He bashed the regulator for doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results. XRP soars despite the legal dispute The Ripple community has previously accused the U.S. SEC of trying to delay the conclusion of its legal battle with Ripple. Users claim that the regulator was intentionally filing at the last minute to frustrate the defendants and the entire crypto community. Despite the legal entanglement, investors are optimistic about the possible outlook of XRP and the general crypto market this year. XRP has emerged as the top-performing asset among the top ten largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. According to data from crypto data aggregator CoinMarketCap, XRP is up about 8% in the last 24 hours, fueling its seven-day gain to 28.77%. The digital asset retails at $3.02 with a market cap of 173.7 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $22.7 billion. The cryptocurrency now ranks third among the largest digital assets by market capitalization behind Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Bonk is one of the most successful crypto projects in 2024. The dog-themed Solana-based coin has become one of the most recognized meme coins, with its market capitalization reaching $2.4 billion in May. Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 93 trillion. It is important to note that 66 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem.

Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain triggered a huge surge in SOL’s price, attributed to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has many side projects that contribute to its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will reach $0.00025, which is approximately 7.9 times its current price, making it a good investment to consider. Why is Bonk down? Bonk lost a good portion of its value over the last 24 hours. In the last few hours, its value decreased by $0.000002847. Today’s decreasing pressure triggered a notable descent in the coin’s value. Will Bonk Recover? Bonk is currently trading within its established price range. A recent price decline tested the $0.00002618 support level, which proved strong. A successful defense of this support level is considered crucial for the current recovery. Will Bonk reach $0.000055? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.000035. However, just a few days ago, Bonk saw some price action above this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.000055 by the end of 2026. Will Bonk reach $0.000100? Bonk price prediction suggests that the coin can reach $0.000100 and surpass it by 2027. When Bonk reaches this price level, its market capitalization will increase 4.5-fold. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. According to The Cryptopolitan’s review of the cryptocurrency, it is expected that Bonk will reach a maximum value of $0.00025 by the end of 2031, which is quite a bit above its current price.

Bonk historic price sentiment Bonk price history In December 2022, Bonk was launched with a price of $0.0000001487 and made history by making a surge of more than 30% in SOL tokens. Bonk cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 100 by market cap, reaching $0.0000034 per coin on January 5, 2023, according to crypto market records. However, by March 2023, the price of the Bonk token had fallen from $0.0000004134, losing substantial value.

Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas made this prediction after Canary Capital filed an amended S-1 registration form in relation to its Litecoin ETF proposal. Amended Litecoin ETF S-1 Filing Suggests SEC Engagement Canary Capital had submitted the S-1 registration form for the Litecoin ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in October 2024. On Wednesday, the company filed an amended version of this form. According to the filing, U.S. Bancorp Fund Services would act as the administrator of the ETF, while Coinbase Custody Trust and BitGo would act as the custodians for the Litecoin of the fund. NEW: @CanaryFunds just filed an amended S-1 for their Litecoin ETF filing. No guarantees — but this might be indicative of SEC engagement on the filing. Still no 19b-4 filing yet though (A 19b-4 would actually start the potential approval/denial clock) h/t @isabelletanlee pic.twitter.com/wFtNOmbmYx — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 15, 2025 Some of the industry watchers including the Bloomberg analysts have suggested that that the modification of the filing could be an indication of SEC’s interest. Another Bloomberg ETF analyst, James Seyffart pointed out that the amendment could mean the SEC has offered comments on the application. However, there has been no 19b-4 filing made, which is a formal application for rule change that initiates the approval process. “We had heard chatter that the Litecoin S-1 had gotten comments back from [the] SEC,” said Balchunas in a post on X (formerly Twitter). He also said that this is in line with his earlier claim that Litecoin is ‘most likely’ to be the next cryptocurrency ETF in the United States. New SEC Leadership Adds Uncertainty The timing of the Litecoin ETF’s approval process could depend on upcoming changes in SEC leadership. Gary Gensler , the current SEC chair, is set to step down on Monday. Former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins, who has expressed support for the cryptocurrency sector in the past, has been nominated to lead the agency. However, the Senate has yet to confirm Atkins’ appointment, and the exact timeline remains uncertain. Balchunas emphasized that the leadership transition is a “huge variable” in the approval process for the Litecoin ETF. Growing Interest in Spot Crypto ETFs Created in 2011 as a more efficient version of Bitcoin, Litecoin is one of the oldest and most stable blockchains. Following the announcement, the price of Litecoin spiked by more than 18% to trade at $119.46 at the time of writing. Analysts believe that the current bullish rally may break through the $130 barrier, with the LTC price prediction standing at $170. In addition, open interest increased by 29.58% to $575.39 million within the last 24 hours while the trading volume jumped significantly by 277.25% to $1.65 billion. This excitement comes in the wake of the recent approval of U.S. spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in recent months. These products outperformed the market, which led to the growth of interest among issuers in the creation of ETFs for altcoins like Solana and XRP. A recent JPMorgan and Hashkey research note suggested that new Solana and XRP ETFs could pull in $13.6bn of new funds if they are approved within six to 12 months. The introduction of altcoin ETFs such as Litecoin may also contribute to increased institutional investments in the cryptocurrency space. Next Steps for Litecoin ETF Approval Even though the amended S-1 filing marks a progress, there is no certainty as to when the approval of the Litecoin ETF will be completed. The submission of a 19b-4 application would formally kick off the SEC’s decision process but Canary Capital has not given any indication of when this would happen. The original filing of Canary identified Litecoin as a blockchain that has had “100% uptime since its inception” noting its security and stability as strengths. Industry participants are now focused on the next steps, such as the SEC’s response and the possible 19b-4 filing, as the momentum for the approval of the Litecoin ETF picks up.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains a staple, but altcoins are showing unparalleled potential. From the dependable Ethereum (ETH) to the rising BigBossInu, these digital assets are ready to deliver game-changing returns.

The rally is fueled by Meta’s launch of Polygon-powered NFTs on Instagram, which has increased investor interest, along with bullish chart patterns suggesting a potential long-term uptrend. Bitcoin (BTC) : Bitcoin has been leading the current market rally, pushing many altcoins, including MATIC, higher. The excitement around the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has also contributed to Bitcoin’s momentum, and analysts expect this could continue driving gains across the crypto market in the short term​. Polkadot (DOT) : DOT’s price is nearing the breakout level of $6.90, a crucial resistance point. If bulls manage to push the price higher, it could trigger a move to $10.

Aptos (APT) : APT has shown gains recently, riding the momentum of the broader market rally led by Bitcoin.

Anderson said that the decision comes after the firm has completed its “pipeline of ideas,” and there are no personal or health-related reasons behind the closure. “The intensity and focus has come at the cost of missing a lot of the rest of the world and the people I care about. I now view Hindenburg as a chapter in my life, not a central thing that defines me,’ the founder said. Hindenburg gained widespread attention for its reports on companies like the Adani Group, Nikola and Carvana, sparking major controversies, especially in India. The firm’s research accused Adani of corporate malpractice, leading to major financial losses and political turmoil. The firm was known for publishing research that was sold to hedge funds and investors while simultaneously releasing the findings to the public, benefiting from market shorts. On January 15, Anderson said, “The plan has been to wind up after we finished the pipeline of ideas we were working on. And as of the last Ponzi cases we just completed and are sharing with regulators, that day is today.” A Personal Note From Our Founder https://t.co/OOMtimC0gV — Hindenburg Research (@HindenburgRes) January 15, 2025 The firm’s closure comes amidst heightened regulatory scrutiny, particularly from the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, and India’s SEBI. Hindenburg faced allegations of violating regulations by using offshore instruments to short Indian markets, with SEBI issuing a show-cause notice to the firm. The Adani case remains unresolved, and Adani Enterprises, saw a strong increase in its share price at the start of today’s trading. The shares opened at Rs 2,500, up from the previous day’s Rs 2,388.15. Other companies in the Adani Group, such as Adani Power, also experienced major gains. It remains to be seen what actions will follow, particularly with the change in leadership in the U.S. “There are others on our team who are now free agents — so feel free to reach out to me if you have a need for anyone who is brilliant, focused, and easy to work with, as they all are,” he added.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-16 04:47:32
39037562,https://timestabloid.com/?p=54688,1737002990,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top Exchange Predicts SHIB to Hit $1,https://timestabloid.com/top-exchange-predicts-shib-to-hit-1/,"Leading cryptocurrency exchange CoinW recently generated widespread discussion by projecting that Shiba Inu could surge by over 4,584,900% to reach the elusive $1 mark. The ambitious prediction was shared via a poll conducted on X, sparking renewed interest in the token’s potential value. Comparative Market Predictions In the poll, CoinW invited users to speculate on which milestone might be achieved first: Shiba Inu climbing to $1, Ethereum reaching $10,000, BNB hitting $1,000, or Dogecoin touching $1. Other featured cryptocurrencies included Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), XRP, and Avalanche (AVAX). The asset’s potential growth to $1 emerged as the most extreme prediction due to the significant increase needed to reach the target. For context, the token is currently valued at $0.00002181. Achieving $1 would require the token to increase by over 4.58 million percent, effectively removing all decimal places from its current price. At this rate, a $100 investment in SHIB could theoretically yield over $4.2 million. Contextualizing the Prediction CoinW further fueled the debate by asking whether such a milestone for the asset could happen before Bitcoin reaches $100,000 or Ethereum crosses $10,000. Bitcoin currently trades at $99,000, requiring only a 6% rise. Ethereum requires a 206% increase from its current value of approximately $3,270 to hit its target. While predictions of massive gains are not unprecedented for Shiba inu, the feasibility of achieving a $1 valuation is widely questioned. For the token to hit this price point, its market capitalization would need to exceed $589 trillion—an astronomical figure far beyond the size of the global economy. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Historic Price Performance and Future Possibilities Despite skepticism, the asset has already demonstrated extraordinary growth in the past. From its all-time low to its peak, the token saw an astonishing increase of over 150,000,000%. Early investors witnessed staggering gains, including one case where an $8,000 investment grew into more than $5.7 billion. However, replicating such a meteoric rise in today’s market environment appears unlikely. Industry experts and platforms like Telegaon predict that while the token could eventually reach $1, achieving this target may take several decades. According to Telegaon, sustained growth and widespread adoption over time could make the price point feasible by 2050. CoinW’s bold prediction has reignited discussions about Shiba Inu’s long-term potential and the broader possibilities within the cryptocurrency market. Although the odds remain low, the community continues to rally around the project. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Trump’s Crypto Law (TRUMPLAW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPLAW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Crypto Law can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Crypto Law could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Crypto Law launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Crypto Law on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Crypto Law by entering its contract address – 7mYansF38wyaSvnj7C1Gr536FdMbGA4ufqY7PwzC7CxM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPLAW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|REGULATION|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-16 04:55:00

Key Insights Into The Latest Recovery,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-bitcoin-upward-cycle-back-key-insights-into-the-latest-recovery/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has rebounded to trade above $99,000 following its significant dip earlier this week. While the latest US Consumer Price Index (CPI) news appears to have contributed to this quick recovery, it has also drawn attention from analysts, who are closely monitoring key metrics to understand the market’s next move. A CryptoQuant contributor known as Crypto Dan recently provided insights into Bitcoin’s current market behavior. Highlighting the Short-Term Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), Dan observed that the metric has shown a recurring pattern during correction phases. This pattern, he noted, typically dampens market optimism before a subsequent rebound. Despite the recent correction, signs point to the potential resumption of an upward cycle in the near future. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharp Rebound Above $95K: Stop Hunting or Trend Reversal? Short-Term SOPR Analysis And What It Currently Suggests For BTC The SOPR metric measures the profitability of spent outputs relative to their realized value, providing insights into market participants’ behavior during price corrections. According to Crypto Dan, during corrections, the SOPR oscillates between red and green zones. The red zone signals increased profit-taking, often driven by whale activity, which can extend correction periods. Conversely, the green zone indicates reduced selling pressure, setting the stage for potential rebounds. Dan reveals that the SOPR currently shows a smaller volume of profit-taking compared to previous correction periods, such as the seven-month correction earlier in the year. This trend suggests that the recent correction, which has lasted over a month, may be shorter in duration. Dan speculates that Bitcoin could resume its upward trend within the first quarter of 2025. However, he cautioned that short-term volatility remains a risk, with the possibility of further sharp drops before a sustained reversal. The analyst wrote: However, in the short term, there may still be one or two sharp drops that push SOPR below the yellow dotted line, potentially crushing market participants’ hope for a rally before the market reverses upward. As such, aggressive short-term trades should be approached with caution. Bitcoin Market Performance And Outlook Meanwhile, Bitcoin appears to now be making its way back above the $100,000 mark as the asset currently trades at a price of $99,494, at the time of writing marking a 2.7% increase in the past day. This increase in Bitcoin’s price aside from being attributed to the underlying positive metrics on the BTC network can also be linked to the latest update on the US CPI. According to the latest reports, the US CPI rose by 0.4% in December—this news has resulted in the US Dollar seeing a notable plunge while other financial assets saw the opposite trend recording an uptick.

SOL was able to climb above the $180 and $185 resistance levels. The bulls pushed it above the $188 resistance and then $200. A high was formed at $206 and the price is now consolidating gains near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $186 swing high to the $206 low. Solana is now trading above $195 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $196 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $205 level. The next major resistance is near the $212 level. The main resistance could be $220. A successful close above the $220 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $232. Any more gains might send the price toward the $245 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $205 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $196 zone and the trend line. The first major support is near the $190 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $186 swing high to the $206 low. A break below the $190 level might send the price toward the $185 zone. If there is a close below the $185 support, the price could decline toward the $172 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level.

Recently, Fox Journalist Eleanor Terrett revealed that Solana ETFs faced a rejection, but Litecoin’s chances are soaring. It might just be the first altcoin to get approval in 2025! Solana ETFs Face Setback According to Fox’s Eleanor Terrett, Solana ETFs had been getting attention from the SEC staff, but they faced a setback when their 19b4s were rejected. This happened a few weeks ago when Gary Gensler was still heading the SEC. Solana ETFs were also getting engagement from staff but the 19b4s were then rejected. Granted, that was a few weeks ago with the @SECGov still under @GaryGensler who’s out in 3 business days.

It will be a waiting game to see how the new leadership handles the approval process for these highly anticipated assets. Litecoin Poised for ETF Approval First! Meanwhile, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas shared that the SEC had given comments back on the Litecoin S-1 filing. However, this is a greater sign of Litecoin’s approval sooner. Although, Balchunas previously predicted that Litecoin might be the next coin to get an ETF approval, and now it seems that prediction is becoming more likely. However, the start of the new SEC chair’s term is still a big factor that could influence the final decision. Balchunas statement comes after Canary Capital filed an updated S-1 form on Wednesday, marking the initial step in registering its Litecoin ETF with the SEC. What’s Next for XRP and Solana? As for XRP and Solana, both have faced delays, but there’s hope for their ETFs. The shift in leadership at the SEC might lead to a fresh perspective on these applications. If these ETFs are approved, it could bring more institutional interest and boost the overall cryptocurrency market.

Severino, a Chartered Market Technician and seasoned trader with over 15 years of experience, highlighted the potential for the asset to surge to $13.4 if a developing bull flag pattern materializes on the daily chart. XRP Bull Flag Formation Observed Severino’s observations stem from recent price movements of the token. The digital asset valued at $0.4956 on November 4, surged dramatically to reach a seven-year high of $2.9 by December 3, marking a 485% increase within a month. This sharp upward movement formed the flagpole portion of the suspected bull flag pattern. Following this surge, XRP faced a pullback from the $2.9 peak and consolidated within the $2 range. Severino interprets this consolidation phase as potentially forming the bull flag portion of the pattern, signaling that the asset may be building momentum for another upward breakout. However, he acknowledged the possibility that this pattern might instead represent a descending channel rather than a bullish structure. If this is a valid bull flag in XRP, the target is $13 This is significantly beyond my top targets, but not impossible pic.twitter.com/bacmrcNyOD — Tony ""The Bull"" Severino, CMT (@tonythebullBTC) January 1, 2025 XRP Potential Price Surge to $13.4 Bull flag formations are typically characterized by an initial price surge followed by a consolidation period, eventually leading to a continuation of the upward trend. If this pattern holds for the token, the price could experience a breakout matching the length of the previous rally. Given the 485% increase in November and December, a similar rise from current levels would push XRP to approximately $13.4, according to Severino’s projections. While he admitted that this price target surpasses even his most optimistic expectations, Severino emphasized that such outcomes, although ambitious, are not entirely unrealistic. If the token reaches this value, its market capitalization will exceed $769 billion, surpassing Ethereum’s current valuation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additional Bullish Indicators for XRP In addition to the potential bull flag pattern, other technical indicators support Severino’s positive outlook. Notably, XRP’s quarterly Relative Strength Index (RSI) has climbed above 70. The last occurrence of this indicator level was in January 2018, coinciding with the token’s previous all-time high of $3.31. Furthermore, XRP recently closed a yearly candle above the $2 mark for the first time in its history and surpassed $3 for the first time since 2018, reinforcing its current bullish momentum. The asset is currently trading at $3.07, maintaining its position as a market leader while Bitcoin remains under $100,000. Although Severino’s predictions point to significant potential gains for XRP , market dynamics remain unpredictable. The realization of such price targets would depend on sustained demand, market sentiment, and broader industry trends. Nonetheless, the possibility of a continued rally keeps the token firmly in the spotlight as traders closely monitor price developments and chart patterns.

From Oklahoma's proposed legislation to incorporate Bitcoin into state pension funds to forecasts of the cryptocurrency reaching up to $250,000 by 2025, the narrative around Bitcoin is increasingly centered on its utility as a hedge against inflation and its appeal to institutional and governmental entities. Oklahoma Introduces Bill to Establish Bitcoin as Strategic Reserve Asset On Jan. 15, 2025, a new bill aiming to establish Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset was introduced to the Oklahoma House of Representatives. Spearheaded by state Representative Cody Maynard, House Bill 1203—known as the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act—seeks to position Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation by allowing state pension funds and savings accounts to allocate a portion of their assets to the leading cryptocurrency. The proposed legislation is part of a growing trend of US states exploring the potential of Bitcoin as a safeguard against economic uncertainties. Representative Maynard, championing the bill, articulated the rationale behind this move, stating, “Bitcoin represents freedom from bureaucrats printing away our purchasing power. As a decentralized form of money, Bitcoin cannot be manipulated or created by government entities. It is the ultimate store of value for those who believe in financial freedom and sound money principles.” If passed, Oklahoma would join the ranks of a handful of US states advancing similar legislation, demonstrating Bitcoin’s emergence as a mainstream financial instrument. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act in Oklahoma is not an isolated initiative. A growing number of states, including Pennsylvania, Texas, North Dakota, and New Hampshire, have introduced bills aimed at incorporating Bitcoin into their financial strategies. Pennsylvania: In November 2024, lawmakers proposed allowing the state Treasury to allocate up to 10% of its assets to Bitcoin. State Representative Mike Cabell emphasized Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation and a tool to mitigate macroeconomic risks. Cabell likened the approach to strategies employed by asset management giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, who have adopted Bitcoin as part of their diversified portfolios. Texas: The Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, introduced by lawmaker Giovanni Capriglione in December 2024, proposed a five-year minimum holding period for Bitcoin as a reserve asset. North Dakota: On Jan. 10, 2025, North Dakota introduced its own Bitcoin reserve bill, backed by a bipartisan coalition of 11 co-sponsors, according to Dennis Porter, co-founder and CEO of the Bitcoin advocacy group Satoshi Action Fund. New Hampshire: On the same day, New Hampshire unveiled a broader initiative that extends beyond Bitcoin, categorizing investments under the umbrella term “digital assets.” This broader scope hints at potential diversification into other cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based technologies. The introduction of Bitcoin reserve bills aligns with increasing concerns over inflation and economic instability. As fiat currencies lose value due to inflationary pressures, Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins makes it an attractive alternative for safeguarding purchasing power. State legislators advocating for Bitcoin adoption argue that its decentralized nature and finite supply provide a level of security and autonomy unavailable in traditional fiat systems. By allocating a portion of state reserves to Bitcoin, governments can potentially reduce exposure to inflationary risks while fostering innovation in the blockchain sector. The growing interest in Bitcoin among US states mirrors its rising institutional adoption globally. As governments and private entities alike explore Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value, the cryptocurrency continues to solidify its role as an essential component of diversified financial strategies. However, the move is not without its critics. Opponents of Bitcoin reserve bills cite concerns over its volatility and lack of regulatory clarity. Despite these challenges, the momentum behind Bitcoin adoption suggests that states like Oklahoma are willing to embrace its potential benefits while navigating its risks. What’s Next for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act? As House Bill 1203 advances through the legislative process, it remains to be seen how other states and policymakers will respond. If Oklahoma successfully establishes Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, it could set a precedent for other states and even federal institutions to follow suit. The ongoing wave of Bitcoin -related legislation is a pivotal moment in the evolution of financial systems. Whether as a hedge against inflation, a tool for diversification, or a statement of financial independence, Bitcoin is increasingly becoming a cornerstone of modern financial strategies. Bitcoin Set to Surge: Analysts Predict Prices Up to $250,000 by 2025 as Half a Trillion Dollars Flow In Bitcoin (BTC) could skyrocket to unprecedented highs of $250,000 in 2025, according to new projections from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant. In its latest weekly report released on Jan. 14, the firm highlighted favorable economic conditions, regulatory clarity, and increased institutional adoption as key drivers for the potential influx of $520 billion in new capital to the cryptocurrency. CryptoQuant’s research suggests Bitcoin is poised to see significant price growth in 2025, with a base case target of $145,000 and a potential high of $249,000. The report attributes this bullish outlook to a confluence of factors, including the anticipated impact of a new US presidential administration and an increasingly crypto-friendly regulatory environment. ”About $520 billion of fresh capital could flow into Bitcoin in 2025,” CryptoQuant researchers calculated. ”In the context of favorable regulatory, monetary, and cyclical conditions, it’s reasonable to expect capital to continue flowing into Bitcoin.” The report further notes that the expansion in Bitcoin’s realized capitalization—defined as the total value of Bitcoin supply based on the price at which each unit last moved on-chain—has a magnified effect on its market value and price. Historical patterns show that substantial capital inflows into Bitcoin lead to exponential price growth. Accompanying CryptoQuant’s findings is an analysis of Bitcoin’s realized market cap since 2015. The data reveals that during previous bull cycles, realized capitalization growth correlated with dramatic price increases. If similar conditions prevail, the anticipated $520 billion in capital inflows could propel Bitcoin to new all-time highs, with analysts envisioning a price range of $145,000 to $249,000 by 2025. ”The expansion in the total capital invested in Bitcoin (realized capitalization) has a more-than-proportional effect on Bitcoin’s market value and price,” the report states. CryptoQuant’s forecast is one of several optimistic predictions for Bitcoin’s future. Samson Mow, CEO of Bitcoin adoption firm JAN3, has been vocal about his belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Last year, Mow outlined the possibility of Bitcoin reaching $1 million per coin, driven by what he described as ”omega candles”—daily price increases of $100,000 or more. “You’ll start to go up by $10,000 a day or drop by $10,000 a day. And this is the God candle. After that, we’ll start to see Omega candles, which are $100,000 increments daily,” Mow said. While such a dramatic rise may seem implausible to some, Mow continues to champion the $1 million price target, sharing his predictions on social media. Despite recent price fluctuations, Bitcoin analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Bitcoin experienced two-month lows earlier this week, prompting speculation about the impact of broader macroeconomic factors. Filbfilb, co-founder of trading suite DecenTrader, compared Bitcoin’s current market position to a ”beach ball under water,” suggesting that pressure from legacy markets is temporarily suppressing its growth potential. “Standard stuff... my feeling is that BTC is currently a bit of a beach ball under water with the legacy markets sitting on it for now,” Filbfilb told subscribers of his Telegram channel. Meanwhile, Rekt Capital, a popular crypto trader and analyst, highlighted Bitcoin’s resilience, describing its ability to rebound quickly after market dips. “On daily timeframes, BTC/USD is going from threatening a downside deviation to strongly rebounding and developing a new Higher Low,” Rekt Capital noted. “Lots can change within 24 hours for Bitcoin.” Political and Regulatory Tailwinds for Bitcoin The upcoming inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 20 has added a layer of intrigue to Bitcoin’s near-term outlook. Rumors of potential pro-crypto policies and first-day announcements are fueling speculation about the trajectory of the next crypto bull market. If favorable conditions materialize, Bitcoin could see accelerated adoption among institutions and retail investors alike. CryptoQuant’s $250,000 projection for Bitcoin signals growing confidence in its role as a store of value and hedge against macroeconomic risks. With $520 billion in fresh capital potentially entering the market, Bitcoin stands to benefit from increased regulatory clarity, mainstream adoption, and economic uncertainty driving demand for alternative assets. While short-term volatility remains a concern, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains overwhelmingly bullish. As analysts and industry leaders continue to tout unprecedented price targets, 2025 could mark a watershed moment for the world’s leading cryptocurrency.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-16 05:30:00

On Wednesday, net inflows into BTC ETF skyrocketed to $755 million with Fidelity’s FBTC leading the charge with $463 million in inflows. The BTC price also surged past the $100K level following a strong run-up in the S&P 500. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Resume Again After four consecutive trading sessions of outflows, the spot Bitcoin ETF witnessed strong inflows on Wednesday led by Fidelity. These Bitcoin investment products scooped more than 7,548 Bitcoins from the market against the daily BTC production of 450 BTC. Source: HODL15Capital As shown above, Fidelity’s FBTC saw inflows totaling to $463 million, leading the pack, while Ark Invest’s ARKB came second clocking $138 million of inflows. Although BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw only $31 million in inflows, it clocked a massive $2.35 billion in trading volumes. On the other hand, Fidelity’s FBTC clocked $284 million in trading volumes. Asset managers are working to expand its Bitcoin offerings to other global markets as well. Earlier this week, BlackRock launched a Bitcoin ETF variant on CBOE Canada. Apart from the US, the demand for Bitcoin ETFs continues to remain strong. Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise Invest stated that they have continued to receive inquiries from other nation-states as well. He said: “We just provided some information for a nation state asking about Bitcoin ETFs. Considering moving some exposure from foreign currency govt bonds into BTC. Bitcoin is entering a new chapter”. Core CPI Drop Fuels Market Optimism The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for December rose by 2.9%, aligning with market expectations. Meanwhile, Core CPI inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, dropped to 3.2%, slightly below the anticipated 3.3%. This was enough to send global equities and crypto market soaring high on Wednesday. The S&P 500 closed with a gain of more than 100 points in yesterday’s trading session, fueled by an unexpected drop in core CPI inflation. The index added an impressive $900 billion in market capitalization during the trading session. Will Bitcoin Price Sustain Above $100K to Hit New ATH? On-chain data shows that the current BTC rally is backed by strong fundamentals. According to blockchain analytics firm Santiment, the accumulation of wallets holding more than 10 BTC has resumed once again after stagnating during the second half of December and early January. Source: Santiment Similarly, the number of non-empty wallets has been declining over the past six weeks, as many small retail traders are cashing out profits and attempting to time the market peak. The data supports further rise in BTC in thew coming days. Along with strong inflows into Bitcoin ETF, the BTC price also swiftly moved above $100K before retracing back under that crucial support. As of press time, the Bitcoin price is trading 2.34% up at $99,597 with daily trading volumes up by 5.38% to $58 billion. As per the Coinglass data , the 24-hour liquidations have shot to more than $83 million of which $58 million is in short liquidations.

One Of These Is Predicted To Make Early Investors A 25x By The End Of July",https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-amp-or-remittix-one-of-these-is-predicted-to-make-early/,"January started on a bullish note, but the tune quickly changed as a barrage of sell-offs plunged the market into a mini-bear season. Bitcoin (BTC) and Amp (AMP) have both breached through critical support levels and are currently treading water, with their price structures breaking down as the correction deepened. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a safe haven, prompting investors to rotate funds into the viral presale of its native $RTX token. Let’s explore what this newcomer brings to the table and why analysts are tipping it as the next 25x gem. Remittix Is Revolutionizing A $150 Trillion Market Cross-border payments were valued at $150 trillion in 2017 and are expected to reach $250 trillion by 2027.

This is an application designed exclusively for the needs of companies, allowing them to manage payroll with cryptocurrencies and expand their payment options. Experts are already praising this initiative, as it gives businesses the tools they need to stay ahead of the curve and retain a competitive edge in an increasingly crypto-focused world. At the center of the Remittix ecosystem is the $RTX token, which plays a crucial role in key features such as staking and governance. Users can stake their $RTX and reap recurring rewards for up to 8% APY, while those who want a premium experience can join Remittix’s VIP Program. This is a membership program that consists of three levels, with Tier-3 investors earning up to 18% APY and enjoying special privileges, such as enhanced governance rights, and a dedicated account manager. Bitcoin Finds New Support, MicroStrategy Steps In Bitcoin starts off the week in the red as it recorded a 3.5% intraday decline and is currently selling for $91,838. Bitcoin’s cumulative monthly losses now amount to 9% after it failed to sustain the $100k level. This resulted in BTC entering a descending channel, and dragging the entire market into a steep downtrend. However, as the saying goes, “In a bull run, dips are for buying” and Michael Saylor and company have wasted no time buying the blood. Just a few hours ago, he announced that MicroStrategy acquired 2,530 Bitcoin, valued at around $243 million. This timely intervention reignited optimism within the Bitcoin community, as Bitcoin had reached its lowest price since November. Amp Slips 10%, The Bottom Seems To Be In Amp (AMP) formed a local top at $0.011 in early December. However, after a harsh rejection, its price spiraled, resulting in a significant 38% monthly decline. At the time of writing, Amp sells for $0.006 following a 10% intraday decrease. Meanwhile, 24-hour volume shows a 26% increase, with over $23 million worth of AMP traded across exchanges. Amp is also a project that focuses on digital payments, but it proposes an interesting twist. Amp acts as a digital collateral token designed to enhance the security and speed of transactions. It works by providing collateral to guarantee the successful completion of transactions, locking up a small amount of value until the transfer is confirmed. Once the transaction is finalized, the collateral is released, ensuring seamless and secure transfers across different platforms. This framework has already piqued the interest of investors, however, with its broader approach and integration of both crypto and fiat, Remittix presents a more versatile and convenient solution. Join The Remittix Presale Hundreds of investors are rushing to secure their $RTX allocation and over $3 million has been raised in record time. The $RTX presale is now live and tokens are on sale for just $0.207. However, this discount window will close very soon, as experts anticipate an 800% surge by the end of the presale phase. Once listings on major exchanges are finalized and $RTX hits the markets, early adopters could be in for a 25x moonshot. The best time to get involved? Now!

The brief was shared with the XRP community on X by James K. Filan, a well-respected attorney in the crypto space, and it has garnered significant attention. Jeremy Hogan, another prominent attorney and XRP supporter, provided an insightful analysis of the filing. According to Hogan, the appeal focuses solely on the district court’s decision that XRP sales to retail investors did not constitute securities transactions. Hogan also stated that the SEC did not argue about harm to investors , noting that proving investors were harmed will be difficult now that XRP has surpassed $3. This SEC brief was hard to work thru because, IMO, the case won't be ruled on. But I've come this far so, dangit, here we go! My thoughts on the initial Ripple v. SEC appeal brief… We aren't holding back tonight. https://t.co/l8Tcqdfuxc pic.twitter.com/bIWnJC1y3N — Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) January 16, 2025 The SEC’s Opening Brief According to Hogan, the SEC’s primary argument is that it does not need to prove that XRP purchasers were aware of Ripple’s statements about efforts to increase XRP’s value. Instead, the SEC relies on precedent to argue that it is sufficient to show the existence of such promotional statements. Hogan criticized this approach, stating, “The problem the SEC has is that, from my reading of the first two cases, they say no such thing.” He also noted that distinguishing between the concepts of “reliance” and “knowledge” is pivotal, with the trial court emphasizing the latter in its ruling. The SEC’s reliance on prior cases, particularly Aqua-Sonic, appears tenuous. Hogan observed that the SEC had to combine sentences from multiple sections of the Aqua-Sonic decision to construct its argument. He also expects Ripple to counter this by highlighting key differences between both cases, such as the lack of evidence that XRP retail investors were aware of Ripple’s promises. Another significant point of contention is the SEC’s failure to challenge the substantial evidence submitted by attorney John Deaton on behalf of XRP holders. Deaton had gathered thousands of affidavits from XRP investors refuting claims of reliance on Ripple’s statements. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Hogan expressed surprise that the SEC did not attempt to counter this evidence during the initial proceedings, noting that this oversight could prove detrimental to its appeal. Implications of the SEC’s Appeal Hogan highlighted the broader impact of the SEC’s appeal, noting that if the appellate court upholds the district court’s decision , the SEC could face a new precedent requiring proof of investor awareness of promotional statements. This could complicate enforcement, leading to longer, more expensive litigation. Ripple might also revive its argument that investment contracts require contractual obligations, further weakening the SEC’s position. Hogan concluded by questioning the SEC’s rationale for pursuing the appeal, highlighting the risks of adverse legal precedents. Ripple, meanwhile, could use the appeal to strengthen its position and challenge the SEC’s approach. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

On Wednesday, the firm submitted an amended S-1 filing to the commission, effecting the proposed amendments made by the regulator. ETF analyst James Seyffart believes the amended S-1 filing signals the SEC’s engagement with the filing. However, he claimed that a 19b-4 filing would be the ideal hint that the regulator will approve the LTC ETF. Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, expects the Litecoin ETF to be the next SEC’s approved fund. He said: “We had heard chatter that the Litecoin S-1 had gotten comments back from the SEC.

Canary Capital had also filed for a Solana ETF in October In October, Canary Capital also filed for approval of its Solana ETF . According to its Solana ETF filing, the trust emphasized that it aimed to provide exposure to the price of Solana.

Meanwhile, Burwick Law is preparing legal action against Solana-based launchpad Pump.fun for enabling scams and harmful activities on the platform, which led to serious financial losses for investors. Meanwhile, BitMEX and its parent company HDR Global Trading were fined $100 million for Bank Secrecy Act violations, bringing an end to years of legal battles with US authorities. Tether and Swan Bitcoin Clash Tether, the issuer of the popular USDT stablecoin, filed a lawsuit against Swan Bitcoin, and accused the Bitcoin financial services company of breaches in their agreements. In a joint statement with 2040 Energy, Tether confirmed the legal action, and stated that Swan’s reckless actions violated their contractual obligations. This case was filed in the High Court of England and Wales, and is the latest escalation in the legal battle between the two firms. The dispute started from a partnership that was established in 2022, where Tether and Swan co-founded 2040 Energy, a Bitcoin mining venture. Tether provided funding while Swan managed operations. However, Swan alleged that former employees of its mining division stole proprietary information , including software code and business strategies, to establish a rival company, Proton Management. According to Swan, these employees executed a deliberate scheme, which is called ”rain and hellfire,” and is aimed at undermining its role in the venture. Some of the key figures in this alleged plan included Michael Holmes, Swan’s former head of business development, and Raphael Zagury, its ex-chief investment officer and mining head, who now serves as Proton’s CEO. Swan claimed that Proton used its trade secrets to become a direct competitor, severely damaging Swan’s market position. The firm also accused Proton of convincing Tether to sever ties with Swan and support Proton in the mining venture. By August of 2024, Swan CEO Cory Klippsten was removed as CEO of 2040 Energy, and Proton officially assumed control of the mining operations. Swan also alleged that Tether facilitated the ”hostile takeover” of its mining business, but Tether denies this claim. Adding to Swan’s legal troubles, the company sued its own law firm, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, in November of 2024 for malpractice. Swan alleged that the firm abandoned its case against Proton after taking on Tether as a client. As a result, the law firm violated ethics rules prohibiting such conflicts of interest. Swan CEO Cory Klippsten described this move as a betrayal that caused serious harm to Swan’s business. Burwick Law Targets Pump.fun Over Investor Losses Burwick Law, a US-based crypto law firm, also recently announced its intention to pursue legal action on behalf of investors who suffered losses due to the meme coin launchpad Pump.fun. In a post on X from Jan. 15, the firm stated that it spent months working with people who lost large amounts of money to meme coins, rug pulls, and unfulfilled promises that were facilitated through platforms like Pump.fun. The firm described the situation as emblematic of exploitation in the crypto ecosystem, and blamed anonymous creators and other corrupt entities for taking advantage of everyday people. According to Burwick , Pump.fun generated hundreds of millions of dollars in fees while allowing harmful and antisocial behaviors, including displays of illicit drug use, racism, and violent acts, to occur on its platform. Pump.fun is a Solana-based meme coin launchpad that allows users to create and launch their own meme coins without needing technical expertise. It attracted millions of users, but still faced criticism for its alleged role in scams and unethical activities. In fact, data from Dune analyst Adam Tehc reveals that only 0.4% of the 14 million crypto wallets interacting with Pump.fun actually achieved profits of more than $10,000. Pump.fun previously allowed live streaming for token promotion but suspended the feature after it was misused for dangerous stunts. The platform also faced regulatory scrutiny after the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority banned access to Pump.fun in December to try and mitigate crypto-related scams. The law firm called for affected investors to join its investigation, and suggested that the potential class-action group could be in the millions. In addition to its fight against Pump.fun, Burwick Law is pursuing separate legal actions involving other crypto-related projects. These include cases against Moonbirds and Proof Collective NFTs, as well as the Full Send Metacard NFTs promoted by the Nelk Boys, which the firm alleges misled investors with unrealistic promises of benefits. Judge Fines BitMEX $100M Over BSA Violations A federal judge sentenced HDR Global Trading Limited, the parent company of crypto exchange BitMEX, to two years of unsupervised probation and a $100 million fine. The ruling was delivered on Jan. 15 in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York by Judge John Koeltl, approximately six months after BitMEX pleaded guilty to violating the US Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) by failing to implement an adequate Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program. The charges stemmed from BitMEX’s alleged lack of compliance with BSA requirements, as the platform allowed users to sign up with only an email address. This allowed people to bypass proper Know Your Customer standards. The US government claimed that BitMEX gained $155 million unlawfully from US sources between 2015 and 2020 and asked for a $417 million fine. However, the court dismissed all open counts against the firm as part of the sentencing and imposed a much smaller financial penalty. BitMEX statement to its users BitMEX called the charges “old news” in a statement to its users , and shared that it is very disappointed at the additional fine, even though it is far less than what the Department of Justice initially sought over the years. The firm and its executives previously settled separate regulatory cases, including a $100 million consent payment to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in 2021. BitMEX co-founders Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, Samuel Reed, and employee Gregory Dwyer already faced sentencing in 2022, and received probation for their roles in violating the BSA. In addition, Hayes, Delo, and Reed were ordered to pay $30 million in penalties as part of a civil settlement with the CFTC. The recent judgment appears to bring an end to the lengthy criminal and civil cases against BitMEX and its executives, which have lasted almost four years.

This team up will bring web3 services to over 450 million Jio users. What exactly is cooking between Reliance Jio and Polygon, let’s try to uncover. What This Means for Jio (and You) So, why does this matter? Jio Platforms, the company behind India’s biggest telecom network, has over 450 million users. That’s huge. By working with Polygon, they’re planning to make apps and services more advanced using blockchain tech. Kiran Thomas, CEO of Jio Platforms, said this is part of their push for “digital excellence.” But don’t let the fancy phrase throw you off—it’s basically about making things better and smarter. Sandeep Nailwal, Polygon’s co-founder, called it a big step for Web3 adoption in India. Source : X.com What kind of changes are we talking about? Well, details are still hush-hush, but Aishwary Gupta from Polygon hinted at some cool blockchain-based apps in the works. They might include NFT-based platforms, better payment systems, or even new ways to create online communities. This partnership will help both Reliance Jio and Polygon in getting more exposure to users and technology. Why Web3 Is a Big Deal Web3 has become a huge deal in the past few years. This is not something fancy but just a newer version of the internet. Why is it getting so famous? Because now you can own your online identity and everything you do on the internet. Think of it as a space where you have more control over your data, and everything is more secure. Blockchain is at the heart of it, powering everything from cryptocurrencies to NFT marketplaces. In India, Web3 is more than just a tech trend. It could fill gaps in the financial system, help small businesses, and even make e-commerce more fun with digital vouchers. Polygon is already leading this charge, working with big brands like Flipkart to bring Web3 to the mainstream. What’s Next This partnership between Reliance Jio and Polygon could change how millions of Indians use the internet. With Jio’s reach and Polygon’s expertise, Web3 might soon be something everyone can use, not just tech geeks. It’s still early, but the possibilities are endless. One thing is clear: the internet in India is about to get a serious upgrade.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MATIC|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-16 05:59:05

Hunter Horsley’s tweet suggests a nation might adopt Bitcoin ETFs for reserves. On Jan. 16, Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, revealed on Twitter that at least one national government has begun investigating the possibility of investing in Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded funds. We just provided some information for a nation state asking about Bitcoin ETFs. Considering moving some exposure from foreign currency govt bonds into BTC. Bitcoin is entering a new chapter — — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) January 15, 2025 According to Horsley, the unnamed nation is considering shifting a portion of its foreign exchange reserves—traditionally held in foreign government bonds—into BTC. Typically, countries hold reserves in stable assets such as U.S. Treasuries, euros, or other highly liquid foreign bonds. Shifting even a fraction of those reserves into Bitcoin would mark a stark departure from traditional reserve management. Although not specifically related to ETFs, El Salvador’s move to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021 was a landmark moment for sovereign-level crypto adoption. The latest development echoes the recent comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell , who described BTC more as a competitor to gold than a currency, highlighting the growing recognition of BTC as a viable asset class.

According to the latest data from Coinglass as of Jan. 16, the total assets under management for Bitcoin ETFs have reached nearly $113.45 billion, reflecting a steady inflow of investors. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) leads the market with an AUM of $53.46 billion, followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), each managing over $20 billion. The rising interest in BTC ETFs also aligns with legislative efforts at the state level to integrate BTC into everyday financial systems. In Oklahoma , State Senator Dusty Deevers recently introduced the “Bitcoin Freedom Act” (SB325), which would allow employees to receive salaries in BTC and enable businesses to accept BTC payments. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market has seen major growth ahead of Donald Trump’s Jan. 20, inauguration. Since Trump’s re-election, BTC’s price has climbed from $69,000 to over $100,000, buoyed by optimism surrounding his pro-business policies and the possibility of regulatory easing under his administration.

The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF saw record inflows and rapid asset accumulation in its inaugural year, driven largely by direct retail investor interest. The ETF also benefited from Bitcoin’s historic rally above $100,000 late last year, although enthusiasm may wane in the early months of 2025. Mitchnick acknowledged the recent outflows from ETFs but praised the product’s broader success. “We’re focused on being a valuable resource and educational partner for our clients,” he says, adding that adoption in the institutional and wealth advisory segments is an untapped opportunity. Related News: US Consumers Sue the Most Talked About Cryptocurrency Platform of Recent Days for Losing Money While individual investors were the primary driver of IBIT’s early success, the firm is now turning its attention to attracting institutional clients and wealth advisors, Mitchnick said. These segments face greater hurdles due to rigorous research and approval processes, but represent significant growth opportunities, he said. “We are still in the early days of adoption in the asset advisory and institutional segments,” Mitchnick explained. “There is great momentum among firms working to accelerate approvals that will allow advisors to incorporate Bitcoin into their client portfolios.” Mitchnick also highlighted the surge in institutional interest last quarter, as well as progress in wealth advisory channels, which he sees as a larger, longer-term opportunity. “Both segments are very important, but asset advisory may hold the most promise due to the increasing momentum in approvals,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

The cryptocurrency's price has surged 50% to seven-year highs above $3 this month, extending the past quarter's 240% rally, according to data source CoinDesk . Prices have gained 30% in the past seven days alone, lifting the market capitalization to $176.75 billion, the third-highest ahead of stablecoin tether. XRP is witnessing the fastest observed rally since the altcoin boom of January 2018, according to a popular market analysis tool called the relative strength index (RSI). The measure oscillates between 0 and 100, measuring the speed and change of price movement over specific periods, typically 14 days or 12 months. XRP's 14-month RSI has risen to 92, the highest level since October 2017, indicating that the momentum observed over the past 12 months is the strongest over seven years. Rookie traders would quickly point out that RSI readings above 70 indicate overbought conditions and potential for a bull breather or correction. However, that's not necessarily the case, as RSI merely measures the speed of price changes over a specific period. Indicators can continue to flash the so-called overbought reading longer than bears can stay solvent. As the law of motion states: an object in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by an outside force. ""Crypto continues its recovery from Monday’s drop, with BTC pushing towards the $100k mark. The broader market is rebounding, with altcoins like XRP and XLM standing out. XRP has reclaimed the 3rd spot among cryptocurrencies and surpassed BlackRock’s market cap,"" Diego Cardenas, OTC trader at digital asset platform Abra, said in a note to CoinDesk. ""This surge is driven by a growing number of partnerships, the launch of Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD, and speculation about a potential spot XRP ETF,"" Cardenas added. Currently, XRP-specific factors combined with broader crypto market dynamics support the ongoing bullish momentum. Take trading volumes for example. The spot market tally has tripled to over $23 billion in the past 24 hours, validating the price surge. Meanwhile, volumes in derivatives have more than doubled to $34 billion, according to data source Coingecko and Coinglass . XRP's perpetual futures open interest has surged to a record high of 2.34 billion XRP, with funding rates representing the cost of holding leveraged bets hovering around 13%. That's well below the overheated 100% in early December, which signaled excess bullish leverage. In other words, the XRP market is much healthier and supports continued price gains. Meanwhile, crypto market leader bitcoin has risen past $100,000, cheering the slowdown in the U.S. core inflation.

At the same time, analysts have turned highly bullish, with predictions of up to $10 per token during the ongoing cycle. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView Recall that the asset’s price stood at a mere $2.1 at the start of the year two weeks ago. Since then, it has been on a spectacular run that even the Monday crash couldn’t contain. The past few days alone have been nothing short of astonishing for the third-largest cryptocurrency, as it went from $2.3 on Monday to $3.2 earlier this morning. This represented a nearly 40% surge in about 72 hours and put its price at a seven-year peak. Despite retracing to under $3.1 now, XRP is still 9% up on the day and more than 30% higher than this time last week. This impressive rally came after the US CPI data was announced yesterday, which pushed many crypto assets north. However, XRP’s case is particularly impressive. It all started last week after reports that XRP whales had spent more than $2 billion to accumulate approximately a billion tokens within the span of just 48 hours. The positive developments have only intensified since then, including growing usage of the XRP network for massive transactions. Even the SEC’s late appeal in the legal case between the agency and Ripple couldn’t shake XRP’s gains. At the same time, popular analyst Ali Martinez outlined a massive price target for the asset of up to $10. After outlining the aforementioned whale accumulation, he added that the token has broken out of a bull pennant, which typically indicates the continuation of a substantial rally to the upside. He concluded that if the buying pressure continues in such a manner, it could send XRP’s price higher by more than 3x. $XRP is going to $10! pic.twitter.com/EAIhqpj4V4 — Ali (@ali_charts) January 15, 2025 The post Ripple (XRP) Surges to $3.2 With $10 Price Target in Sight This Cycle appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-01-16 06:49:51

According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $755.01 million in net inflows on Wednesday, breaking a four-day outflow streak during which over $1.2 billion exited the funds. Interestingly, the majority of the inflows on the day came from Fidelity’s FBTC, which attracted $463.08 million — its highest net positive flow since March 7 of last year, when it recorded an inflow of $473.4 million. ARK and 21Shares’ ARKB followed with an inflow of $138.81 million a huge jump from the modest inflow of $2.89 million recorded the previous day.

Among the notable altcoins to consider buying, Rexas Finance (RXS), Dogecoin (DOGE), Chainlink (LINK), and Sui (SUI) emerge as solid candidates for transforming a small $600 investment into $12,000. Here is why. 4 Altcoins to Consider Buying to Transform $600 into $12,000 in 2025 Transforming an investment of as low as $600 to $12,000 could be achievable, when considering altcoins to buy including Rexas Finance Dogecoin, Chain Link and Sui stand out as altcoins to buy. 1. Dogecoin (DOGE): Altcoin to Buy with High ROI Potential Dogecoin’s enduring popularity and strong community backing make it a favorite for high returns in 2025. Priced at $0.3769, DOGE recently gained 18% in one day, showcasing its bullish momentum. It has maintained its position as one of the most popular meme coins to buy , ranking as the 7th largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $55.52 billion, and, according to CoinMarketcap . Market Trends : Breaching the $0.35-$0.30 range, DOGE is now trading above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). Price Targets : Analysts including @JohncyCrypto anticipate a rise to $0.48, with the potential for further gains to $0.65 and beyond. Dogecoin has formed a bullish pennant pattern on the daily chart. Why Invest: Dogecoin’s loyal community and consistent market presence make it a gateway for transforming small investments into substantial profits. Source @JohncyCrypto (X.com) 2. Rexas Finance (RXS): Transforming Asset Investment on Blockchain Rexas Finance (RXS) has a big impact on real-world asset tokenization making it one of the most promising altcoins of 2025. RXS works at the forefront of blockchain innovation allowing smooth and clear investment in assets like real estate, art, and commodities. Presale success: RXS tokens cost $0.175 each, and the project has raised over $36 million, with 93.76% of tokens sold.

Over the past few years, we’ve witnessed meme coins like Floki Inu (FLOKI) and Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE) rocket in value after being listed on major exchanges like Binance, making early investors very happy. In fact, these coins have transformed the financial landscape for many, turning casual investors into crypto legends. Now, there’s a new name on the horizon that has been making waves— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . Word on the street is that BTFD Coin is gearing up for a potential Binance listing. So, should you jump in early and capitalize on this buzzworthy meme coin? Let’s dive into the best new meme coins to invest in this week, featuring BTFD Coin, Floki Inu, and Baby Doge Coin. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The New Meme Coin on the Block BTFD Coin (BTFD) is quickly becoming one of the best new meme coins to invest in this week. It’s no surprise that rumors are swirling about the potential Binance listing for BTFD, especially considering its impressive presale performance . Within just the first month of its presale launch, BTFD Coin raised over $2 million, signaling strong demand for this meme coin. BTFD has a unique focus on combining meme culture with real utility. The coin’s presale success, combined with its potential for explosive ROI, is only the beginning. BTFD offers staking rewards, Play2Earn (P2E) gaming, and a highly engaged community that calls itself the “Bulls Squad.” This focus on community-driven engagement has helped BTFD rise above its competitors. Presale performance has been nothing short of spectacular, with BTFD raising over $5.2 million so far. The coin is currently in Stage 13 of its presale, with a price of $0.000142 per coin. But here’s the kicker—when the presale ends, BTFD will be listed at $0.0006. This represents a 4000% ROI potential, which is massive for early investors. Analysts are already predicting that BTFD could se e significant price movements once it hits major exchanges. If BTFD gets listed on Binance, there’s a real chance of seeing explosive gains. Floki Inu (FLOKI): A Community-Driven Force Floki Inu (FLOKI) has captured the imagination of meme coin enthusiasts ever since it was launched. Named after Elon Musk’s dog, Floki has gained a passionate community of supporters who believe it can make a real impact in the crypto market. Why did FLOKI get listed on Binance? It’s simple: community strength, solid tokenomics, and continuous innovation. FLOKI isn’t just a meme coin—it’s a whole ecosystem, combining decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and even its own metaverse project. This diverse offering has helped FLOKI differentiate itself from the competition and prove that meme coins can be more than just jokes. Floki’s journey to Binance was no accident. The coin has captured the imagination of investors due to its strong social media presence, continued partnerships, and active engagement with its community. By focusing on real-world utility, such as its Floki University and NFT marketplace, FLOKI established itself as more than a meme—it’s now a platform that investors trust. Plus, FLOKI’s aggressive marketing strategy, including partnerships with influencers and campaigns like “Floki Everywhere,” certainly didn’t hurt its visibility. The coin’s rise has inspired many to wonder if it’s the future of meme coins, especially as its price soared post-Binance listing. But here’s the thing: FLOKI isn’t the only meme coin that’s causing a stir. Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE) is right behind, gaining traction and attracting attention. Let’s take a look at what makes Baby Doge Coin tick and why it’s also one of the best new meme coins to invest in this week. Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE): The Memetic King of Crypto If you’ve been anywhere near crypto Twitter, you’ve likely seen Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE) being mentioned in the same breath as major players like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. But why did Baby Doge Coin manage to secure a listing on Binance? The secret sauce lies in its hyperactive community, its tokenomics, and the love it has received from the meme-loving crowd. Baby Doge Coin capitalized on the meme coin craze with a simple yet effective marketing strategy. The coin became a fan favorite by creating its own charitable foundation and developing partnerships with organizations that benefit from the token’s success. Baby Doge’s high transaction volume, aggressive marketing campaigns, and celebrity endorsements boosted its legitimacy, earning it a spot on Binance’s listing. Since then, it’s gone from strength to strength, with its vibrant online community constantly pumping new energy into the project. Baby Doge is also a high-yield meme coin, offering rewards for holding tokens. Its deflationary tokenomics mean that tokens are burned with each transaction, which could drive scarcity and increase the value over time. Additionally, Baby Doge’s staking options and continuous roadmap updates have kept the community excited, ensuring that its popularity won’t fade anytime soon. Now, let’s talk about the rising star in the meme coin world—BTFD Coin. Here’s why BTFD is making waves and why you should keep your eye on it this week. Hurry Up Before the Next Big Meme Coin Hits the Market Here’s the deal: If you’re looking to invest in one of the best new meme coins to invest in this week, BTFD Coin is your chance to get in early.

Let’s break down an investment scenar io: If you put in $35,000 at the current presale price of $0.000142 per BTFD Coin, you’d get around 246 million coins. When BTFD hits the listing price of $0.0006, your investment could skyrocket to $147,600. That’s a massive potential return, all for acting now. This is not just a “get-rich-quick” scheme—it’s an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of the next big thing in meme coins.

On Thursday, Morgan rebuked the regulatory body’s claims in the opening brief, calling out on its lack of understanding of how the crypto market works. This saga, amid XRP price hitting $3, has gained significant traction across the crypto market globally. Pro-Ripple Lawyer Slams SEC As It Files New Opening Brief In XRP Lawsuit The U.S. SEC filed opening brief in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, sparking market discussions globally. The opening brief alleges that Ripple breached securities laws through its XRP sales, as also seen under the ‘Howey Test.’ Notably, “the American blockchain company’s actions and representations to investors (about increasing the value of their native coin) created a common expectation of profits,” the opening brief added. In an X post on January 16, attorney Bill Morgan criticized most of the claims made in this opening brief, stating, “This is absolute garbage and shows an appalling lack of knowledge by the SEC of how crypto markets work and price rises.” Morgan primarily points towards the market’s movement as a whole, saying rising tides and prices occur at a much broader level and not due to the promotions of an issuer.” All boats rise when the market rises and this usually conforms to Bitcoin rises,” he added. New Opening Brief Follows Stipulation Filing In XRP Lawsuit Meanwhile, it’s noteworthy that the opening brief follows both parties’ mutual decision to file a stipulation in the ongoing XRP lawsuit. CoinGape reported yesterday that the U.S. regulator and company agreed on a timeline to file a deferred appendix regarding cross-appeals in the Ripple vs. SEC case . Simultaneously, massive whale movements amid these legal maneuvers have also sparked noteworthy market intrigue. CoinGape revealed that XRP whales moved roughly 130M tokens amid recent legal developments, adding to speculations. XRP Price Gains Unprecedentedly Moreover, the American blockchain company’s native coin price has gained to unprecedented levels amid a broader crypto market recovery despite the increase in U.S. CPI inflation data . As a result, the abovementioned chronicle has further echoed a market frenzy. At press time, XRP price witnessed an 8% uptick in value and is currently trading at $3.07. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $2.72 and $3.18, respectively. The rising movement amid broader legal developments has sparked quite the investor enthusiasm. Moreover, despite legal uncertainty clouding the coin’s future run, market sentiments remain bullish concerning long-term prospects. CoinGape Media spotlighted that Ripple’s coin is among the leading cryptos that showcase the potential for long-term gains. Additionally, with the rising odds of an XRP ETF, per JP Morgan analysts, traders and investors continue to eye the crypto asset optimistically. In conclusion, the crypto has emerged as the talk of the digital assets sector, riding the back of legal developments and phenomenal price gains.

Much like the explosive growth these sectors experienced in 2021, the increasing integration of blockchain technology with gaming is expected to drive significant interest, perhaps rivalling the sheer lucrative hype-potential of meme coins as the bull run progresses. Rollblock has emerged as a trailblazer in the iGaming sector, offering a cutting-edge play-to-earn platform that merges traditional and blockchain-based gaming into one seamless experience. Appealing to investors and gamers in equal stead, here’s why Rollblock could become the next 100x iGaming opportunity during its tentative presale phase. Extensive Gaming Options Set Rollblock Apart In A Saturated Industry Rollblock’s success can partially be attributed to its diverse and expansive gaming catalog, designed to appeal to a broad user base irrespective of gaming experience. The platform features over 7,000 games, ranging from classic favorites like poker and blackjack to exclusive blockchain-exclusive titles that can’t be found elsewhere. Partnering with top gaming providers, Rollblock continues to expand its offerings with plans to add over 100 new games in 2025. This relentless innovation positions the platform to become the most comprehensive gaming destination in the budding blockchain iGaming sector. Adding to its already-immense appeal on the surface, Rollblock recently added sports betting services into its ambit. This strategic expansion aligns with the platform’s mission to become the ultimate one-stop GameFi and betting hub, enabling Rollblock’s user base various ways to have fun and make a profit. Innovative Revenue Sharing And Tokenomics Make Rollblock A Standout Investment Rollblock’s groundbreaking revenue-sharing model is a major draw for investors. The platform allocates 30% of its profits to buy back RBLK tokens, with half permanently burned to reduce supply and the other half distributed as staking rewards. This deflationary mechanism increases token scarcity and incentivizes long-term holding, stabilizing the ecosystem and fostering sustainable growth for the RBLK token in a volatile marketplace. As a play-to-earn platform, Rollblock also rewards active engagement, encouraging users to participate in games regularly. This ingenious approach has helped build a strong and loyal community while reducing price volatility, with Rollblock’s user base now totalling 30,000+ members in counting. Audits And State-Of-The-Art Encryption Set Rollblock Apart In The $465 Billion iGaming Market Rollblock sets the standard for security in the iGaming space, utilizing advanced AI-powered systems to ensure the safety of all transactions and bets alongside state-of-the-art encryption. This robust security infrastructure guarantees protection over potential hacks or breaches that are unfortunately all too common with alternative iGaming and GambleFi providers. In addition to Rollblock’s steadfast dedication to protecting user funds and data, Rollblock is licensed by Gaming Anjouan and has undergone rigorous audits conducted by renowned security firms such as SolidProof. This ensures that the Rollblock platform is free from vulnerabilities and fully compliant with industry standards, validating the integrity of Rollblock’s smart contracts and preventing the chance for erroneous insider sell-offs that haunt other presale prospects. Why Rollblock Offers One Of The Best Opportunities For 100x Returns In Q2-Q4 The GameFi sector is poised for a significant resurgence in 2025. If this sector repeats even a modicum of what it achieved in 2021, gaming cryptocurrencies could amass anywhere from 25-1000x gains later this year, though the window to accumulate is shortening daily. Currently priced at just $0.045 during its ninth presale stage, RBLK tokens offer an incredible opportunity for early investors to secure potential 50-100x returns in a tantalizing iGaming gem.

The daily trading volume has also skyrocketed by a massive 301% to $1.68 billion suggesting strong bullish momentum moving ahead. This comes amid strong LTC whale accumulation along with the growing optimism for Litecoin ETF approval. What’s Behind the Litecoin Price Rally? After forming a strong base at $100, the Litecoin price has gained 18% in the last 24 hours supported by a strong boost in the daily trading volumes. As per the Coinglass data , the LTC open interest has shot up by 30% to $582 million while the 24-hour liquidations have surged to $1.60 million with $1.28 million in short liquidations. As per blockchain analytics firm Santiment, the Litecoin price surge comes due to increased activity from large investors, specifically whales and sharks holding at least 10,000 LTC. These entities have collectively accumulated 250,000 LTC since January 9, signaling strong institutional and large-scale investor interest. Source: Santiment This pattern mirrors similar activity observed in early December. Thus, this reinforces the notion that big players are showing much interest in LTC with the expectations of further price gains. LTC Rally to $200 And Beyond Very Soon? As LTC has bounced back from the support of $100 with strong trading volumes, analysts are bullish regarding its next leg of the rally to $200 and beyond. Popular crypto analyst Solberg Invest stated that LTC has completed a “retest” phase following its breakout from a long-term downward trendline. This development, combined with the appearance of a triple-bottom pattern on the chart, signals that Litecoin may be set for a significant upward move, potentially gaining $200 in value. Source: Solberg Invest XBT Liquidators has highlighted a bullish setup in Litecoin’s chart that has largely gone unnoticed. The analysis points to the role of Gann angles, which, once broken, can act as strong support or resistance levels. With Litecoin price holding above the Gann angle without retracing, the analysts suggest this is a highly bullish signal. They predict that a move to $250 in the next upward leg is a “no-brainer. On the other, other market analysts have shared an LTC price prediction of $500 by mid-2025. No one talking about this $LTC chart. Remember, gann angles, once broken, can act like support/resistance. Since LTC price didn’t dump back below the gann angle, this is very bullish. $250 on the next leg up is a no-brainer. pic.twitter.com/OzMAYKNily — XBT Liquidators (@Cryptard3000) January 15, 2025 Optimism Around Litecoin ETF Grows On Wednesday, Canary Capital submitted the S-1 application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot Litecoin ETF. Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, has hinted at progress in Litecoin ETF approval . Balchunas noted that reports suggest the Litecoin S-1 filing has received comments from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), signaling a step forward. “This development supports our prediction that Litecoin is the most likely candidate for the next ETF approval,” Balchunas stated. As of press time, the LTC price is trading 17.31% up at $119.31.

This impressive performance stands in stark contrast to the broader cryptocurrency market, where major players like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have struggled to maintain upward momentum. Analyst Highlights ‘Massive Bullish Breakout’ For The XRP Price Analysts are now predicting that the XRP price and its upward trajectory may continue, driven by strong buying pressure and positive market sentiment seen during the past month. Notably, market expert and technical analyst Ali Martinez recently identified in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter) what he describes as a “massive bullish breakout” for the XRP price. Related Reading: BREAKING: BitMEX Fined $100 Million For US Money-Laundering Violations According to Martinez’s analysis, on-chain data indicates a significant accumulation of XRP coins, with over 1.10 billion tokens purchased in the past week alone.This aggressive buying activity has created a sense of momentum, further supported by technical indicators. Martinez further highlights that the XRP price has broken out of a bull pennant formation—a classic bullish pattern that suggests further price increases could be on the horizon. The analyst posits that if the current buying trend persists, the XRP price could potentially reach new all-time highs of $10, significantly exceeding its current record of $3.40 reached in 2018. However, not all indicators are pointing toward unmitigated success. Martinez also highlighted that the TD Sequential indicator, a popular tool among traders, has flashed a sell signal on the 4-hour chart for the XRP price, suggesting that a price correction in the short-term could be imminent. The Crucial Hurdle For XRP’s Continued Bullish Momentum Adding to the optimism for XRP holders, another analyst known as Dom has drawn comparisons between the current price action and that of the XRP price in 2017. Dom’s analysis shows a striking fractal pattern, where XRP spent 25 days in a consolidation phase before experiencing a significant rally. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Gearing Up To Fly After Lows, Here’s The Target Currently, XRP has been consolidating for about 30 days, leading Dom to predict a similar bullish breakout could follow, potentially leading to new all-time highs. As of the latest trading, XRP has retraced slightly to around $2.93, attempting to establish this level as support for future gains. However, the $3 mark remains a formidable resistance level, representing a barrier that has not been surpassed in over seven years. Overcoming this threshold will be critical for XRP to maintain its bullish momentum and for traders to gain confidence in the altcoin’s long-term trajectory.

The breakout of the “flag and pole” pattern further fuels the bullish outlook, indicating that the price could continue its upward trajectory. XRP Price Hits $3, Fueled by “Bull Flag” Pattern, Eyes $10, $15, and $20 The chart highlights a strong upward trend for XRP, featuring a classic “bull flag” pattern, a common indicator of a continuation in price movement. This outlook is shared by the crypto market due to Bitcoin’s recent rally . After breaking out of the consolidation phase, XRP has identified $5 as the first psychological target. The next key milestone is $10, which aligns with the projected move based on the flagpole’s measurement. With sustained bullish momentum and growing investor confidence, XRP price could climb to $15. Ultimately, the psychological level of $20 stands as a major target, representing a significant gain from its current price.

This month alone, its price skyrocketed by 50%, smashing through a seven-year high above $3. If that isn’t impressive enough, the cryptocurrency has surged 240% over the past quarter. It’s now the third-largest crypto, outranking Tether with a staggering $176.75 billion market cap. What’s driving this explosive growth, and could this momentum last? The Fastest Rally Since 2018 XRP’s current surge isn’t just significant—it’s historic. This is the fastest price rally since January 2018, a time many crypto enthusiasts remember as the golden age of altcoins. One technical indicator, the 14-month Relative Strength Index (RSI), has reached a striking 84.80. That’s the highest since December 2017, when it reached 94.57. Source : Tradingview Now, here’s an interesting thing. Usually, an RSI over 70 signals that an asset might be “overbought.” But in strong bull markets like this one, these readings don’t always mean a correction is near. In fact, they can stick around while prices keep climbing. Market Trends and XRP’s Rising Popularity Trading activity has gone through the roof. Spot trading volumes have surged by 84.72% to $22.85 billion in just 24 hours. Derivatives trading isn’t lagging behind either, with volumes more than doubling to $34 billion. Perpetual futures open interest? A record-breaking 2.34 billion XRP. Healthy funding rates, currently sitting at 13%, hint at sustained market enthusiasm without the risk of overheating. Source : Coinglass But it’s not just the numbers driving XRP’s rally. Ripple’s new stablecoin, RLUSD, and growing speculation about a potential spot XRP ETF are adding fuel to the fire. Partnerships supporting XRP adoption are also creating a buzz. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s rise past $100,000, helped by optimism over slowing U.S. inflation , is boosting the overall crypto market. Ripple effects (pun intended) are benefiting other altcoins like XRP and XLM. What to Expect Next XRP’s rise looks more than just a hype in the market. Its reclaimed third spot in the crypto rankings, surpassing even BlackRock in market cap, points to a shift in market sentiment. Add to that strong funding rates and strategic developments, and XRP might just have more room to grow. As XRP continues its winning streak, all eyes are on whether this momentum can sustain or if we’re in for a reality check.

Speculation also grows around Trump-linked crypto moves, adding intrigue to Solana’s upward trajectory amidst market-wide optimism. Solana (SOL) Price Gains as Trump Turns Away From ETH – Time to Buy? Recent blockchain data reveals that World Liberty Financial, linked to Trump, has executed substantial BTC to ETH trades.

Such strategic moves from high-profile entities suggest renewed confidence in Ethereum’s long-term prospects, sparking conversations about its broader market impact. This activity could also influence other altcoins like Solana price, which remains a top choice for scalability and innovation. With Ethereum drawing institutional attention, Solana might benefit from the market’s growing appetite for alternatives. Investors are now eyeing SOL as it holds steady amid fluctuating market conditions. Source: X SOL Price Eyes $220 as TD Sequential Flashes Buy Signal Solana price has displayed a bullish signal on the daily chart, according to the TD Sequential indicator. This technical indicator suggests the possibility of a rebound that could propel Solana toward the $220 mark. The TD Sequential is a popular tool used by traders to identify potential price reversals in the market. On the Solana chart, the indicator highlighted a buy signal, aligning with market sentiment for a recovery. Currently, Solana price is trading near critical support levels, which might provide the foundation for an upward trajectory. If the rebound materializes, the top altcoin price is expected to test resistance zones and aim for the $220 target. This projection aligns with key Fibonacci retracement levels, adding to the optimism surrounding Solana’s performance. Source: Tweet SOL Price Analysis Solana demonstrates resilience after a sharp 22% drop in early Jan, retaining its top blockchain position. Notably, Solana surpassed Ethereum in decentralized exchange (DEX) trade volume, solidifying its dominance. Reports suggest a Solana ETF could further boost the platform’s growth trajectory. At the time of writing, the SOL price is $202.76, with a 10% daily increase. The cryptocurrency has seen a steady climb within an ascending channel on the 24-hour chart. Buyers are pushing the asset closer to a key resistance level at $210. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 66, signaling a bullish sentiment while approaching the overbought zone. If the Solana price prediction manages to break above $210, the next target would likely be the $220 resistance zone. Conversely, a decline below $200 might push the price back to the critical support at $190. Key levels to watch include support zones at $200 and $190, along with resistance levels at $210 and $220.

He added that the politically driven lawsuit was just noise and merely a rehash of already failed arguments. The Ripple CLO said a new era of pro-innovation regulation was coming, and Ripple was thriving. He congratulated attorney Paul Grewal and Coinbase for their win against the U.S. SEC on January 3rd, stating that Gensler’s anti-crypto crusade would end on January 20th. U.S. attorney Hogan said the U.S. SEC was only appealing the ruling that what the XRP sold to retail investors on exchanges were not sales of securities, not that the investors were harmed. He added that he was a little shocked that the U.S. SEC had failed to get any reasonable evidence into the record that actual XRP retail buyers knew about Ripple and its ‘promises’ to them. James Filan, defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor, said the parties had filed a stipulation stating they would file a deferred appendix for the cross-appeals 21 days after the appellee’s brief was served. Attorney says the U.S. SEC’s opening brief is ‘lacklustre’ at best 2. I honestly found the brief lackluster – almost as though the drafter knew he was wasting his time. For example, almost half the brief was spent just reiterating what the trial court ruled. That part of the brief was almost as long as the trial court ruling itself! It's kind… — Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) January 16, 2025 Hogan asserted that the U.S. SEC’s brief was hard to work through because it lacked conviction, almost as though the drafter knew they were wasting time. Almost half the initial Ripple v. SEC appeal brief – nearly as long as the trial court ruling itself – was spent reiterating what the trial court ruled. Hogan said it was kind of like trying to talk a girl into going out with you and spending half the time telling her back the reasons she said ‘no’ previously. At heart, what the U.S. SEC wanted the appellate court to say was that it did not have to prove that XRP buyers were aware of Ripple’s statements that it would work to increase XRP’s price, said the attorney. According to Hogan, the U.S. SEC relied primarily on three cases for that proposition. He, however, claimed the problem with the U.S. SEC – from his reading of the first two cases – was that they said no such thing. Hogan added that not needing to show ‘reliance’, which the U.S. SEC argued, was completely different from not needing to even show knowledge – which the trial court ruled was missing in the Ripple case. “Expect Ripple to destroy this in its reply, if we get there.” – Jeremy Hogan Hogan believes the U.S. SEC’s best bet is to ‘Frankenstein’ together a case that helped them. He, however, pointed out that reading the case revealed that the investors knew exactly who the seller was and what the promises were. Expect Ripple to distinguish this case to shreds as well, said Hogan. Trump’s incoming administration increases hope for Ripple’s win Alderoty was certain that Gensler’s war on crypto at the U.S. SEC would end on January 20th, immediately after Trump’s inauguration. He pointed out that Ripple was confident in its position on the appeal, and it looked forward to working with the new U.S. SEC leadership to resolve most of its pending complaints. According to Alderoty, a federal appeals court had laid bare what the industry had repeated for years: Gensler’s selective enforcement of securities laws was a (not so) hidden attempt to ban the crypto industry. The Ripple CLO urged the incoming government to cleanse the agency of lingering stains, saying that there was much more to do to repair the damage. Alderoty said Ripple planned to expose the U.S. SEC’s lawless tactics. A court disclosed that the U.S. SEC was adopting its litigation positions to further its desired goals, not out of faithful allegiance to the law. Alderoty said the question was not whether the U.S. SEC under Gensler, it was. Vivek Ramaswamy claimed the worst part about the U.S. SEC was that it regularly lost cases in federal court because they ‘contorted’ their rules in illegal and unconstitutional ways.

Despite broader market pullbacks, XRP demonstrated a 10% rally last weekend, only to face a modest retracement. As the market recovered, the asset has led the pack, showing a notable 16.82% gain in the past week. Understanding the XRP Megaphone Pattern This analysis focuses on a broadening price pattern known as the “megaphone pattern,” formed on XRP’s 1-month chart. This pattern is characterized by higher highs and higher lows, indicating that bulls are in control, despite the increased volatility. According to EGRAG , the megaphone structure has a 70% win ratio and can be more reliable on longer timeframes. The pattern was first identified by EGRAG in March 2023 when the token was priced at $0.3895. At that time, the analyst noted that the megaphone pattern had formed, representing potential future price increases. The structure’s distinctive feature is its three major bottoming phases and three major price upswings. #XRP – Megaphone Pattern (UPDATE): Recall: Who remembers the Megaphone Pattern from March 2023? If it doesn’t ring a bell, here’s a recap from our post on March 9, 2023: https://t.co/1f3zkgpPGP Price Target: I’m reluctant to mention the top price target of the MEGAPHONE… https://t.co/pAlQu06cvh pic.twitter.com/YTQJyCTHwO — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) January 13, 2025 XRP Historical Price Movements and Current Rebound EGRAG highlights the asset’s past price movements to understand the significance of the megaphone pattern. The first bottoming phase occurred in September 2014, when the token reached a floor price of $0.00058. After this low, the cryptocurrency rebounded, reaching a peak of $0.0306 by December 2014. A subsequent correction led to a second bottom of $0.003 in January 2017, followed by another price rally, with XRP reaching an all-time high of $3.5 in January 2018. This represented the second major upswing. Afterward, the token underwent a significant pullback, lasting for seven years. This correction ended in July 2024 when the price bottomed at $0.3899. With the current rebound, the analyst believes the digital asset is now experiencing the third upswing, which could push the cryptocurrency toward higher price levels. Price Targets and Market Expectations EGRAG’s latest analysis outlines three key price targets for XRP as it moves through this third upswing. Based on Fibonacci retracement levels, the first target is $8.15, corresponding to the Fib. 1.272 mark. If the token surpasses this level, the next target would be $13.3, which aligns with Fibonacci’s 1.414 level. According to EGRAG , the final target is $27.05, corresponding to Fibonacci 1.618, representing a nearly 10-fold increase from its current price of $2.54. EGRAG also notes that for the token to confirm the validity of this megaphone pattern, traders should monitor both price action and volume indicators. An increase in trading volume and consistently trading above key breakout points confirm that the pattern is unfolding as expected. Although EGRAG previously suggested more ambitious targets in earlier analyses, he has opted not to set overly optimistic price projections this time. He emphasized that while the potential for significant price movement exists, especially given the recent rebound, he aims to avoid misleading new traders by overestimating potential gains. In conclusion, while the megaphone pattern on XRP’s chart suggests the possibility of significant price increases, traders should carefully monitor the asset’s price movements and volume to confirm the trend. If the pattern holds, the token could be set for a major rally toward the $27 mark. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Saves California on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Saves California by entering its contract address – 2mtzeaYqDPLtCemX5jNPuuq8jw65cbgNUXuT3fBra2M2 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCALI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-16 07:50:00

This has triggered a massive $755.1 million in Bitcoin ETF inflows, with Fidelity’s FBTC leading at $463 million. Bitcoin ETF Recorded an Inflow Of $750 Million According Farside report Bitcoin ETF recorded a net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs soared to $755 million, as institutional investors eagerly seized the opportunity to purchase Bitcoin at a dip. This surge in ETF investments marks a sharp reversal after four consecutive trading sessions of outflows. Over 7,500 Bitcoins were scooped up from the market by these investment products, outpacing the daily Bitcoin production of only 450 BTC. Leading this inflow charge was Fidelity FBTC with an impressive $463.1 million in inflows, but Ark Invest’s ARKB also saw notable inflows of $138.8 million.

What Fueling This Surge? The surge in Bitcoin ETF inflows can be traced back to the recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. For December, the CPI rose by 0.4% , bringing the annual inflation rate to 3.2% after a 0.3% increase in November. This higher inflation reading sparked speculation about future interest rate cuts, with the CME FedWatch tool suggesting a 30% chance of a rate cut during the Federal Reserve’s meeting in March. Along with this, the S&P 500 experienced a jump of over 100 points, adding $900 billion in market value.

This legislation comes amid growing tensions about national security and the environmental impact of crypto mining, fueling arguments about how to balance technological innovation with public safety and community well-being. Reasons behind the SB 60 Bill The bill is inspired by recent events in Cabot, Arkansas, where Florida-based real estate investment firm Interstate Holdings began building a cryptocurrency mining plant near the Little Rock Air Force Base. The crypto mining plant is located less than five miles from the airbase, which has concerned local leaders and citizens. National security is a major concern, as Senator Hill asked: “Why did they pick this facility that’s less than five miles away from our air base?” Hill added, “This is a national security concern”. Cabot Mayor Ken Kincade added to the argument by mentioning the negative impact of noise pollution and environmental degradation caused by cryptocurrency mining operations. “These centres cause loud noise disturbances and pollution that negatively affect our people, pets, wild animals, nature, and overall well-being”. The law proposes an exemption for existing cryptocurrency mining operations that were fully constructed and operational before Dec. 31, 2024. This ensures that existing firms are not forced to close their operations by regulations. The rise of crypto mining regulation in the US Arkansas is hardly the only state fighting the repercussions of crypto mining. The Biden administration previously prohibited a Chinese-linked cryptocurrency mining company from utilizing territory near the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Similarly, banking Senator Elizabeth Warren has expressed concerns about foreign-owned crypto mining operations, describing them as a threat to national security. “They’re loud, they’re hot, and they suck up a ton of electricity, which can crash the power grid,” Warren said in July of 2024. Not everyone supports the bill. Dustin Curtis, Vice President of Interstate Holdings, has attacked the proposed legislation, claiming it unfairly targets cryptocurrency mining businesses. According to the local news outlet Arkansas Money and Politics: “This bill would make Arkansas the only state in America with anything like this. No one from the governor’s or attorney general’s office asked for this.” Curtis further defended the company’s operations, claiming that the facility conforms with all state and federal noise, environmental impact, and security standards. He says the Cabot site has lower noise levels than the surrounding state highway.

The XRP price rose by 50% in January, reaching a seven-year high above $3. With this rise, XRP continued its 240% rise in the last quarter of 2024, moving into third place, surpassing stablecoin giant Tether. While it was stated that the XRP rise was due to whale accumulation and the expectation for an increasing XRP ETF, another reason for the rise was the ATH in XRP's futures open interest. Analysts said that the XRP price has made its fastest rise in recent years, amid record activity in XRP-related derivatives. At this point, XRP perpetual futures open interest reached an all-time high of 2.34 billion XRP. This is well below the overheated 100% in early December, which signaled excessive bull leverage, analysts said, making the XRP market much healthier and supportive of continued price gains. Diego Cardenas, an OTC trader at digital asset platform Abra, said that XRP-specific factors, combined with broader crypto market dynamics, are supporting the ongoing bullish momentum. “Cryptocurrencies continue to recover from Monday’s decline, with Bitcoin breaking past the $100,000 level. The broader market is also recovering, with altcoins like XRP and XLM leading the way. XRP reclaims 3rd place among cryptocurrencies and surpasses BlackRock's market cap. “This increase is being driven by a growing number of partnerships, the launch of Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD, and speculation about a potential spot XRP ETF.” XRP continues to trade at $3.11, up 8.5% in the last 24 hours. *This is not investment advice.

The secure crypto wallet 1FUEL is being tipped as the best cryptocurrency to buy now after winning over analysts and traders alike with its unique take on cross-chain crypto transactions, advanced privacy features and military-grade cold storage. Read on to find out why this game changing new entrant is expected to deliver early returns above 500% to investors switching from Avalanche and Binance Coin. There’s More Than A Bear Pattern Pulling Investor Attention From Avalanche to 1FUEL The bears have recently taken control of Avalanche, with price losses erasing almost all of the progress made over the last few weeks. Avalanche is currently trading at $36.28, which represents a loss of 29.34% in the last month. This level is just a hair’s breadth from Avalanche’s critical resistance level of $35 . If that price is breached, analysts believe AVAX could drop as low as $27 . Another downside for Avalanche is that there are signs investor interest is waning with a drop in Open Interest and reduced market participation. With its technically-advanced proposition and completely groundbreaking one-click, cross-chain crypto transactions, 1FUEL is a dynamic and innovative Avalanche alternative. Binance Coin Investors Are Also Looking To 1FUEL As Price Pressure Continues Any period of price pressure makes a compelling argument for considering portfolio diversification and that could be exactly what’s happening right now for Binance Coin investors. So far this week, Binance Coin has fallen below moving average lines, and a low of around $660 could be upcoming if the backwards slide continues. A good way to describe Binance Coin’s most recent price action would be ‘changeable’. Its price trajectory continues to move from one range to the other, with a sharp drop on Monday followed by a climb to recovery. Binance Coin could be feeling the fall out from expectations that the Federal Reserve will pause its program of rate cuts, a suggestion which has also caused Bitcoin a few headaches. For Binance Coin investors, now is an optimal moment to consider an entirely different value proposition. The secure crypto wallet 1FUEL is attracting both Binance Coin and Avalanche whales by virtue of its technical credentials, privacy features and its exponential potential. Thanks to a pioneering approach to cross-chain transactions, 1FUEL has higher levels of utility and accessibility than its rivals and an unlimited scope to transform digital asset management at every level. 1FUEL’s advanced technology handles the complexities of cross-chain transactions on behalf of its users, empowering everyone, regardless of crypto expertise, to chain across blockchains. This unlocks DeFi access to millions of users currently locked out from the industry entirely, meaning 1FUEL’s potential is limitless. Join The Presale The 1FUEL presale is happening now. Don’t miss your chance to be in line for early returns which are expected to exceed 500%, projected 100x returns on public launch and up to 30% APR staking rewards.

In a new analysis , the chief investment officer of the crypto asset management firm Bitwise predicts that hundreds of companies will add BTC to their corporate treasuries in the next 12–18 months, which he thinks will cause the Bitcoin market to surge. Hougan notes the trend is already a lot bigger than MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of BTC. “MicroStrategy gets all the press, but it’s hardly alone. Today, 70 publicly traded companies own Bitcoin on their balance sheets, and many private companies do as well (including Bitwise, by the way). The public-company list includes well-known crypto companies like Coinbase and Marathon Digital, as well as non-crypto companies like Block, Tesla, Semlar Scientific, and Mercado Libre. Together, these companies—excluding MicroStrategy—own 141,302 BTC. Private companies aren’t required to report their holdings, but the ones who have done so voluntarily (SpaceX, Block.one, etc.) own at least another 368,043 BTC, according to BitcoinTreasuries.com . That’s significant. It means that, even today, MicroStrategy is less than 50% of the corporate BTC market. I suspect it’ll be a small fraction of it eventually.” The Bitwise CIO argues that the reputational risk of buying Bitcoin is diminishing, especially with the incoming Trump Administration’s embrace of crypto. Hougan also notes that a change in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) surrounding Bitcoin will impact the number of companies that choose to invest in the top crypto asset. “Starting in December, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) — which governs how publicly traded companies report financials—implemented a new rule called ASU 2023-08 that changes how bitcoin is accounted for in GAAP reporting. Prior to the start of this year, bitcoin was treated under GAAP as an “intangible asset” subject to “impairment testing.” That meant companies that bought Bitcoin had to mark its value on their books upon purchase and then write down the value if the price fell. But if the price rose, they were not allowed to mark the value back up. I know that sounds crazy, but it’s true. Under ASU 2023-08, however, that changes. Now, if Bitcoin’s price goes up, companies can mark the value to market and book a profit.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Since the start of 2025, the Bitcoin market has seen a growth of 6.65%. With a growth of 2.9%, in the last 24 hours, the market has outperformed the overall crypto sector. What are the prime factors that have supported the market to achieve this growth? Let’s discuss the factors deeply. Ready? Bitcoin’s $100K Rebound Sparks Hope It was on December 5, 2024, that the BTC market achieved the milestone of $100K. On December 17, the market reached an all-time-high of $108,369.05 . On the last day of 2024, the market was at $93,552.66 – nearly 13.67% below the ATH. In the first six days of 2025, the market witnessed a sharp growth of 9.30%, pushing the price once again above the $100K range. However, between January 7 and 9, the market experienced a correction of 9.4%. Even though the market has not yet completely recovered from the correction, between January 14 and 15, it recorded an impressive growth of 6.30%. It was that sharp upward momentum which helped the market to rebound to the $100K level. Right now, the BTC price stands at $99,784.47. Key Factors Influencing the Market Trump’s Inauguration and SEC Policies Donald Trump, who promised to bring policies to support the growth of the crypto sector, will take oath as the president of the United States of America on January 20, 2025. Crypto enthusiasts strongly believe that he will introduce several regulatory changes to create a conducive environment for the futuristic industry. US Federal Reserve’s Stance In December, the US core inflation rate dropped from 3.3% to 3.2%. During the previous FOMC meeting , the authority expressed a hawkish stance on the matter of interest rates. The data is expected to encourage the US Fed to rethink its stance on interest rates. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market is Up Today?

BTC On-Chain Metrics Reflects Positive Trends Reports say that the Bitcoin market has witnessed a sharp rise in the number of wallets holding 10+ BTC. What this indicates is strong confidence among BTC whales. Reports add that the market has also experienced a fall in the number of small wallets. However, experts say that shrinking aligns with historical patterns of market rallies. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s rise above $100K marks a promising start to January, with macro events and on-chain signals aligning positively. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin again attempted to rise above the crucial resistance at $100K but failed to sustain. Meanwhile, the bulls prevented excessive price drain as the markets flipped the prevailing bearish price action. The main reason for the growing certainty over the markets is the rising XRP price , as it remained passive for quite a long time. Now that the levels have marked a 7-year high, the probability of a new ATH above $4 seems inevitable. Recent reports suggest that the ongoing Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit is approaching its destiny. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer believes the ongoing lawsuit will be scrapped soon after Trump assumes his office as the new President of the U.S. This has made the market participants optimistic about the token and the rising search volume for XRP surpassing Bitcoin substantiates the claim. With the rise in the search volume, there is also an increase in trading activity. Active address count, which displays the traffic over the platform, has rebounded from the interim lows, suggesting a massive increase in trading activity. It indicates a steep rise in the number of addresses contacting the platform to perform a trade, regardless of whether it is a buy, sell, or swap trade. The active address count has been surging since the November 2024 breakout but has been consistently rising since the start of the month. The addresses have surged from the range of around 63K to levels above 97K in the past couple of days. While the trading activity is on the run, there has been a constant drop in the new traders as the active supply maintains a steep descending trend. This suggests the whales have been actively trading on the platform and as a result, their wallet count has been increasing dramatically. The address count with more than 1 million XRP tokens has surged from levels around 2200 to as high as 2600, hinting towards a massive whale accumulation. With this, the XRP price has secured levels not seen since January 2018. Now that the XRP price has broken the upper resistance of a bearish pattern, a continued ascending trend could be imminent. This suggests XRP could be a sleeping giant, as the price now appears to be primed to mark a new ATH in a short while from now.",Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-16 08:13:05

While VeChain and Hedera are battling bearish forces, Remittix recently reached a new ATH (all time high), rewarding early backers with gains reaching 30% . The continued interest in the Remittix presale and its potential 800% surge make $RTX a must-buy this January. Remittix (RTX): Transforming Global Payments with the Power of PayFi The $190 trillion global remittance business is facing long-standing challenges. Expensive fees, avoidable delays, and limited flexibility make cross-border payments tough for people and companies. Standard systems fail to close the gap between digital currencies and fiat, rendering users disappointed and underserved. To address these problems, Remittix (RTX) launched its PayFi protocol , which links conventional banking with decentralized finance. This protocol lets users send and receive over 50 crypto pairs and immediately convert them to thirty-plus fiat currencies. By integrating local banking networks, Remittix ensures smooth global transfers without the hidden fees or lengthy processing times typical of traditional systems. One of the biggest barriers in the payment industry is transparency, especially with exchange rates and hidden charges. Remittix eliminates these concerns with its flat-fee structure, guaranteeing users get exactly what they send. Unlike competitors like Stripe, Wise, or Coinbase, Remittix uniquely enables crypto-to-fiat transfers directly to bank accounts, providing unmatched convenience. The benefits are transformative for businesses. With the Remittix Pay API, companies can accept cryptocurrency payments and settle them in fiat, offering flexibility in managing funds. Businesses can also create merchant accounts, giving them full control over cash-outs and enabling conversions between multiple currencies. Security remains a cornerstone of the platform. Transactions on Remittix are immutable and tamper-proof, reducing chargebacks and fraud. Certifications from BlockSAFU and SolidProof further enhance trust, while locked liquidity pools ensure price stability for RTX tokens. Currently priced below at $0.0207, RTX tokens offer immense potential, with projections suggesting they could reach $1 by year-end. Remittix is not just solving payment problems; it’s paving the way for a more efficient and inclusive global economy. VeChain’s Path to Recovery: Potential Gains Amid Market Challenges VeChain (VET) is currently trading at $0.04513, marking a small 0.5% gain in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, the cryptocurrency has bounced back from a 18% fall, slipping from $0.05 to its current value. However, daily trading activity has surged, with $86.5 million worth of VET exchanged in just one day which is an impressive 56% increase. Looking ahead, VeChain’s partnerships with Walmart and BMW are paving the way for growth in 2025. The anticipated “VeChain Renaissance” upgrade is also expected to drive adoption and innovation within the ecosystem. Analysts predict the possibility of VET reaching $0.1, comparing the current cycle to a previous phase where the coin surged 6,538%, gaining $0.19888 in value. With rising collaborations and upgrades, VeChain could be positioned for significant gains in the near future. Hedera’s Vision For 2025: Innovations and Strategic Growth Hedera (HBAR) is trading around $0.30, reflecting a 5% increase in the last 24 hours. Despite the fluctuations, the Hedera network is gearing up for a transformative year ahead. One key highlight is the upcoming launch of “UP,” a Layer-2 blockchain by Karate Combat, set to debut in early 2025. UP aims to revolutionize sports and esports through Web3 integration. Under the guidance of CEO Charles Atkins, Hedera is merging AI and DeFi to advance its blockchain capabilities, tackling challenges like compliance and trust. A noteworthy collaboration with Nvidia and Intel on a Verifiable Compute framework is also in progress.

The company explains that Aurora Cloud Console is a no-code platform that enables everyone to spin up and launch their very own EVM-friendly blockchain at zero cost and with minimal effort or expertise. It’s aimed at memecoins and dApps that would rather enjoy the benefits of having their very own network, as opposed to deploying on the super-congested Ethereum chain or another blockchain. One of the major benefits of having your own chain, of course, is that you don’t have to share it with anyone else. That means you’ll benefit from blazing-fast transactions as there are no other tokens and services you’ll need to compete with. The Aurora blockchains are built on solid infrastructure provided by NEAR Protocol , and inherit that network’s solid security and scalability, ensuring they can meet the needs of even the most popular projects. Aurora Labs explains that its goal with the new console is to make launching a fully-customizable blockchain as simple as the process of building an online store on a platform such as Shopify. In other words, even the biggest moron should be able to get one up and running. When creating a blockchain on the Aurora Cloud Console, what you’re actually getting is an Aurora Virtual Chain, which is somewhat similar to having your very own “Layer-2 network” such as Polygon or Arbitrum. So instead of deploying your dApp on memecoin on Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche etc., you can spin up its very own infrastructure, while maintaining full compatibility with chains like Ethereum and NEAR to tap into their liquidity and ecosystems. Alex Shevchenko, the CEO of Aurora Labs, said the launch of the Aurora Cloud Console makes blockchain creation “completely accessible” to anyone who has a reason to do so. He’s pitching it as a “gateway to Web3”. “In just days, you can have a fully customizable chain powered by NEAR’s robust network,” he promised. “We’ve removed the complexity, so builders can focus on creating great products while tapping into a thriving ecosystem of liquidity, tools, and users.” The Aurora Cloud Console provides dozens of features that combine to remove all of the headaches that would arise from the nightmarish task of trying to create your own blockchain. For one thing it’s entirely free to use, and there’s a guided onboarding process that walks new users through each step, showing them how to set different parameters like permissions, the base token for the network, the gas fees, any integrations required and anything else that matters. You won’t need to type a single line of code. It also provides tools for blockchain creators to monitor transactions on their new networks in real-time, as well as the ability to keep track of things as they go about deploying their blockchain. One of the most notable crypto projects to create its very own network using Aurora’s tools is the TURBO memecoin . An early access user, it announced the official launch of its TurboChain platform last month, complete with its own decentralized swap service TurboSwap . Aurora Labs stressed that Aurora Cloud Console is the “cornerstone” of its mission to make Web3 and blockchain technology accessible to everyone through plug-and-play solutions. With its official launch, crypto projects of all sizes now have a simple and reliable way to create their own network, tailored for the needs of their products.

According to the company, the Aurora Cloud Console is a no-code platform that allows anyone to create and launch their own EVM-compatible blockchain without spending a dime or needing much technical knowledge. This service is particularly appealing to memecoins and dApps, providing them their own network instead of relying on the heavily trafficked Ethereum chain or other blockchains. One key advantage of having your own blockchain is exclusivity—transactions can occur rapidly because there are no other tokens or services to contend with. Aurora's blockchains are built on the robust infrastructure of the NEAR Protocol , inheriting its strong security and scalability to support even the busiest projects. Aurora Labs aims to make the process of launching a fully customizable blockchain as straightforward as creating an online store on platforms like Shopify.

When you establish a blockchain with the Aurora Cloud Console, you're essentially getting an Aurora Virtual Chain, akin to having your own ""Layer-2 network"" similar to Polygon or Arbitrum.

Alex Shevchenko, CEO of Aurora Labs, stated that the introduction of the Aurora Cloud Console makes blockchain creation ""completely accessible"" for anyone with a purpose to do so. He describes it as a ""gateway to Web3."" ""In just a few days, you can have a fully customizable chain powered by NEAR’s reliable network,"" he assured.

Here are five cryptos to keep on your radar: Doge Uprising , XRP, Cardano, Hedera, and Near Protocol. These projects are affordable yet pack massive potential. Doge Uprising: The Meme Coin with a Mission Doge Uprising, a newcomer to the crypto space, is shaking things up. Unlike traditional meme coins, it integrates staking rewards, NFT gaming, and a narrative-driven ecosystem inspired by a dystopian 2045 storyline. The Doge Uprising presale offers early investors access to tokens at the lowest prices, giving them a head start.

Beyond its presale, Doge Uprising’s roadmap is packed with features like the introduction of Doge Mecha NFTs, which are ultra-rare and hold both collectible and functional value in the project’s ecosystem. Additionally, the rebellion-themed gaming aspects create an interactive layer that could attract a global audience, further boosting the token’s demand. XRP: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments Ripple’s XRP has long been a contender in the crypto market. It specializes in fast, low-cost international transactions. With partnerships in banking and a focus on transforming the financial industry, XRP remains a strong bet for 2025. As regulatory clarity improves, XRP’s adoption rate could skyrocket, pushing its value beyond expectations. Moreover, XRP’s focus on interoperability with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) positions it as a critical player in the future of digital finance. This unique use case gives XRP an edge, even among well-established competitors. Cardano: Sustainability and Scalability Cardano stands out for its commitment to sustainability and a peer-reviewed approach to development. At under $5, it offers a robust blockchain ecosystem with applications spanning DeFi, NFTs, and more. Cardano’s focus on scalability makes it an excellent long-term investment, especially as the market matures. Cardano’s unique Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism makes it environmentally friendly, which resonates with eco-conscious investors. Additionally, its partnerships with educational and agricultural projects worldwide highlight its real-world utility. Hedera: Enterprise-Grade Blockchain Hedera Hashgraph is a unique blockchain platform designed for enterprise applications. It’s fast, secure, and energy-efficient, with real-world applications in supply chain management, advertising, and healthcare. Hedera’s native token, HBAR, is priced attractively for investors looking for an enterprise-grade solution with significant growth potential. Hedera’s governance model, which includes big names like Google and IBM, further enhances its credibility and positions it as a leading enterprise solution in the blockchain space. Near Protocol: The Developer’s Choice Near Protocol simplifies blockchain development with its user-friendly platform. Its focus on scalability and ease of use makes it a favorite among developers. Near’s emphasis on practical applications, such as gaming and decentralized finance, ensures its relevance in a rapidly evolving market. Priced under $5, it offers enormous upside. Near Protocol also stands out with its Nightshade technology, which boosts scalability by breaking blockchain data into smaller chunks called shards. This innovative approach enables Near to handle a higher transaction volume efficiently. Why Invest in These Cryptos? Investing in affordable cryptocurrencies with real-world utility is a smart strategy for maximizing gains. These projects combine innovation, strong communities, and practical applications, making them ideal picks for investors aiming for substantial returns. While the market is volatile, a well-researched portfolio featuring these five coins could pave the way for significant success in 2025.

The new offer applies to both hot and cold wallet storage without extra costs, the bank revealed in a press release shared with crypto.news. The bank also announced plans to add EURC, Circle ‘s euro-backed stablecoin, to the program soon. Clients holding USDC will receive quarterly rewards directly from the bank, the press release reads.

He suggested that regulatory clarity could pave the way for the U.S. to introduce bank-issued stablecoins by year-end. Still, the Dragonfly Capital managing partner anticipates no major disruptions for established issuers like Tether, which he believes will retain their dominance “especially with [Howard] Lutnick as Secretary of Commerce.” Read more: Circle partners with Bison Digital Assets for MiCA-compliant stablecoins",News|Banking|Circle|Stablecoin|USDC,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|SPONSORED|TRADING|USDC,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-16 09:25:17

Canary Capital had filed the S-1 registration form for the Litecoin ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in October 2024. However, Canary Capital has now filed a corrected S-1 form for the Litecoin ETF. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart said this is likely an indication that the company is in dialogue with the SEC. Seyffart noted that while a formal 19b-4 filing has not yet been made to start the approval timeline, a 19b-4 filing would be a real signal for possible approval. Apart from Seffart, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas also made an assessment of the Litecoin ETF. Stating that the latest development increases optimism for Litecoin's potential ETF approval, Eric Balchunas claimed that the Litecoin ETF could be the next cryptocurrency ETF to be approved in the US. “We had heard rumors that the Litecoin S-1 had received feedback from the SEC. This bodes well for our prediction that Litecoin has the highest probability of being the next cryptocurrency to be approved.” Finally, Balchunas said there remains a “big variable” for ETFs, which the analyst noted is the appointment of a new SEC chairman after Gary Gensler leaves next Monday. “As one of the longest-running blockchains with 100% uptime since inception, Litecoin has a proven track record of security and reliability with significant enterprise-level use cases,” Canary Capital said when it filed for the Litecoin ETF. Apart from Litecoin, Canary Capital has also applied for ETFs for XRP, Solana (SOL), and Hedera (HBAR). Related News: Second Application for XRP in the US!

The price of bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, has risen 11% from Monday's lows under $90,000. It has jumped nearly 3% in the past 24 hours, topping $100,000 at one point, CoinDesk data show. The move into the six figures that spurred risk-taking in the broader market followed a softer-than-expected core CPI report, which alleviated hawkish Fed fears that had driven prices lower. Instead, markets are focusing on Trump's swearing-in and a potential pro-crypto announcement on the first day of the office. ""The removal of inflation fears clears the way for bitcoin to break through the strong $100,000 resistance level before Trump’s inauguration,"" said Matt Mena, a crypto research strategist at 21Shares, in an email. ""Such a milestone would not only be psychologically significant but also technical, setting up bitcoin to surpass its $108,000 all-time high and establish new record levels as market optimism builds."" 21Shares is one of the world’s largest crypto-native issuers of exchange-traded products (ETPs). ""Trump’s well-documented support for pro-growth policies and his track record of favoring asset price appreciation further reinforces the bullish outlook for bitcoin and risk assets more broadly,"" Mena wrote. The bullish forecast is consistent with a rally in traditional assets, especially the Nasdaq 100, which surged over 2% Wednesday. BTC has recently strengthened its positive correlation with the tech-heavy index to a two-year high. Meanwhile, the rally in the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, has stalled, offering a lifeline to risk assets, and the S&P 500 has neared the key level of 6,000. According to Mena, a break above 6,000 ""could set the stage for the next leg of the global asset bull market."" Once a skeptic of digital assets, Trump courted the crypto community in months leading up to the November election, pledging to create a national strategic bitcoin stockpile. His victory helped propel BTC to over $108,000 from $70,000 to over $108,000. ""If Trump indicates on day one that he will be creating the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, even if he doesn’t sign it on day one, expect price discovery to be asymmetric,"" said Nathan Cox, the chief investment officer at Two Prime, in an email. ""Once through the previous highs of $108,000, there is no limit to how fast it could expand given the unparalleled demand a bitcoin reserve strategy could have globally."" Two Prime is an SEC-regulated registered investment adviser specializing in digital asset derivatives. Volatility likely Paul Howard, a senior director at crypto market-making firm Wincent, said expected announcements related to regulating the digital assets industry, banking rules and creation of the strategic bitcoin reserve are not fully priced in yet. ""We are positioned for a volatile week ahead with the change of administration in the U.S. expect to see some +/-10% moves across the majors such as BTC, SOL, ETH, and XRP. Pricing will reflect outcomes of announcements by the incoming President, so opportunities, likely not everything, are baked into the current price,"" Howard said.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Donald Trump,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-16 09:27:57

According to the regulator, District Court Judge Analisa Torres was “factually and legally” wrong when she concluded that offers and sales of XRP to the public via crypto trading platforms and the company’s offers of the token as employee compensation and in business deals did not constitute investment contracts. Details of the Appeal In the brief filed late on January 15, the SEC requested the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to overturn Judge Torres’ decision and order a summary judgment in its favor regarding Ripple’s offers and sales of XRP to retail investors and for those instances it was exchanged for non-cash considerations. This long-running case goes back to 2020 when the regulator sued Ripple, claiming the crypto company had raised at least $1.3 billion from the sale of XRP, which it deemed an unregistered security. Three years later, Judge Torres ruled on the matter, concluding that while institutional sales of the token violated U.S. securities laws, programmatic ones did not due to their blind-bid nature. While the financial watchdog filed an appeal against the verdict in October last year, this latest move marks a more formal step in the process. The agency is outlining its reasoning for challenging the decision made by the district court. Once again, it bolstered its argument using the Howey Test, claiming that XRP buyers would have expected to profit from Ripple’s promotion of the token, making it an investment contract. The SEC also argued that the anticipation of profit from the efforts of others is not determined by the identity of the person or entity offering an investment but by what they say and do. For that reason, those buying XRP from exchanges still expected to gain, contrary to Judge Torres’ determination. Ripple Executives React Shortly after the filing, Ripple’s chief attorney, Stuart Alderoty, took to social media to lambast the SEC’s move, calling it “a rehash of already failed arguments.” The lawyer also noted that Ripple will make a formal response of its own in due time. However, he expressed optimism that the incoming Trump administration will likely abandon the litigation. “For now, know this: the SEC’s lawsuit is just noise. A new era of pro-innovation regulation is coming, and Ripple is thriving,” he remarked. On his part, CEO Brad Garlinghouse described the filing as “insanity.” He called out the agency for doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting different results. The executive also accused Chair Gary Gensler, who is set to step down in a few days, for taking the matter personally.

Pump.fun, according to Burwick, allegedly frames “exit liquidity” as a game—making light of the very real financial losses inflicted on late entrants. Pump.fun is a decentralized platform on the Solana ( SOL ) blockchain that simplifies the process of creating and trading meme coins, aiming to make participation in the crypto market accessible to non-technical users. Burwick didn’t hold back in taking shots at the platform, saying they were the antithesis of blockchain innovation. He says platforms like Pump.fun don’t embody the fundamental principles of transparency, fairness, and empowerment that crypto was originally built on. Burwick reiterated that meme coins aren’t innovative in and of themselves but prey on addiction and youth. His comments come as Burwick Law picks up the gauntlet in a legal case involving Pump.fun, demanding accountability in company conduct within the crypto ecosystem.

As of Jan. 15, the platform’s total revenue surpassed $422 million, with nearly $25 million generated in the last seven days alone, according to Dune Analytics. Burwick Law contends that the meme coin launchpad offers little actual support for its users and instead facilitates rug pulls, where developers walk away with investor funds after raising capital. “As the system grows, early adopters cash out by dumping their holdings on later participants, effectively stealing from them,” Burwick remarked. In November 2024, the platform suffered major backlash due to its live streaming feature. A user threatened to harm himself to promote their meme coin during a live broadcast, causing panic in the entire crypto community. While Pump.fun did acknowledge the damage done and changed its moderation policies, there were no talks about losses that investors suffered. According to an analysis by Pump.fun wallet examiner Adam Tehc, only 0.4% of the 14 million wallets interacting with Pump.fun reported profits exceeding $10,000—highlighting the extent to which most users have suffered losses. Max Burwick is not the only one who has a strong stance against the platform.

TD Sequential May Suggest So",https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-bitcoin-short-lived-td-sequential-suggest-so/,"An analyst has revealed how XRP and Bitcoin are among the cryptocurrencies seeing a sell signal on the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential after the market recovery. XRP & Bitcoin Among Coins Seeing TD Sequential Sell Signal In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about the TD Sequential pattern that four top assets in the sector have formed recently. The “TD Sequential” refers to an indicator from technical analysis (TA) that’s used for locating probable points of reversal in any asset’s price. The indicator involves two phases: the setup and countdown. During the first of these, candles of the same color in the cryptocurrency’s chart are counted up to nine. These candles don’t have to be one after the other. Related Reading: Social Media Turns Bullish On Dogecoin, Solana As Market Rebounds Once the candles are in, the coin may be considered to have arrived at a spot of reversal. Naturally, this would suggest a shift to a downtrend if green candles completed the setup and that to the upside in case of red ones. As soon as the setup is done, the second phase, the countdown, begins. There isn’t anything different about how the countdown works, except for the fact that here thirteen candles are counted, not nine. This phase’s finish, too, can be assumed to coincide with a likely turnaround in the asset. Four cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), and Solana (SOL) have completed a TD Sequential phase of the former type on their 4-hour prices recently. Here are the charts shared by the analyst that shows the trend leading up to this signal: As is visible in the above graphs, all of these assets have just finished a TD Sequential setup with nine green candles. These candles have corresponded to the recovery that the coins have enjoyed during the last couple of days. Considering what such a TD Sequential setup implies, though, this uptrend may not be here to stay for the cryptocurrency market. So far, XRP, Bitcoin, and the others have continued to rise despite this signal, but it remains to be seen how long the trend would last. In some other news, whale activity on the XRP network has witnessed an increase recently, as Martinez has pointed out in another X post. The chart shows the data for the “Whale Transaction Count” metric from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment. This indicator keeps track of the total amount of transfers taking place on the XRP network that are carrying a value of more than $1 million. The metric has seen a jump during the last couple of days and has hit a value of 341. This implies the whales are making a high number of moves on the blockchain right now. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $2.95, up more than 15% over the last 24 hours.

Despite bullish momentum, the RSI crossing above 70 signals a potential correction. Analysts predict XRP could reach $4-$10, with the Ripple-SEC lawsuit and upcoming SEC leadership change being critical factors for future price movements. The Bearish Factor Ripple’s XRP has been crypto’s rockstar lately, with its price reaching multi-year peaks. Several hours ago, the valuation skyrocketed to $3.20, representing the highest level observed since the beginning of 2018. In the following hours, XRP lost some steam and is currently trading at around $3.05 (per CoinGecko’s data). XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite the bullish landscape and the overall expectations of a further pump, one indicator suggests an incoming correction. This is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures the speed and change of price movements. It varies from 0 to 100, helping traders identify potential price reversals. Readings above 70 typically signal that the asset is overbought and could be due for a pullback. On the contrary, anything below 30 might be considered a buying opportunity. The RSI has been hovering above 40 since the beginning of the week but most recently crossed the bearish zone of 70. XRP Price Predictions As mentioned above, multiple analysts expect XRP’s value to keep climbing after exceeding the $3 level. The popular X user CRYPTOWZRD believes the asset could hit $4 in the short term, while Ali Martinez was even more optimistic, setting a target of $10. One major factor that could affect XRP’s future price fluctuations is the development of the lawsuit between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The agency recently filed its first opening brief as part of its appeal against a court ruling concerning the XRP sold to retail investors on exchanges years ago. It also insisted (once again) that Ripple’s native token should be classified as a security. The SEC has been quite hostile toward the company (and many other crypto businesses) over the past few years. However, the upcoming shift in its leadership may end that approach. The current Chairman, Gary Gensler (considered a huge enemy of the digital asset industry), will resign on January 20 and be succeeded by the pro-crypto Paul Atkins. The XRP Army expects the new leader to push the case against Ripple to a favorable resolution soon. However, considering the complexity of the entire legal process, they should have somewhat realistic hopes.

Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? The TIA price has faced resistance around $5, resulting in minor selling pressure. However, buyers are strongly defending further decline. Will TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers’ interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. Recent news/opinions on TIA Celestia has unveiled Shwap, a Data Availability (DA) upgrade that enhances its DA network. The upgrade introduces a new storage system and messaging protocol, boosting data retrieval efficiency and reducing storage demands. Celestia price prediction January 2025 Celestia’s price triggered intense bullish pressure following Bitcoin’s surge toward the $100K mark. As a result, we expect the TIA price to record a minimum of $4 and a maximum of $7, with an average of $5.5. Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction January 2025 $4 $5.5 $7 Celestia price prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn’t felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward. This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $17.84, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.

In response, Hoskinson, who once had disagreements with the XRP community , tweeted, “Peter’s coming around to XRP Nation.” Peter's coming around to XRP Nation https://t.co/9A6zFYNFEq — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) January 12, 2025 Peter Brandt’s Message to the XRP Community Peter Brandt, known for his extensive experience in commodities trading, addressed the XRP community in a recent social media post , reflecting on his past criticisms of XRP and its supporters. Brandt acknowledged taking “some hard shots” at XRP and its community over the years. Brandt conceded that some of the backlash he received from the XRP community was warranted, while other responses were “outright uncivil” or even “funny and creative.” He elaborated on the reasoning behind his critiques, emphasizing that they stemmed from his perspective as a professional trader focused on preserving capital. Criticism Rooted in Trading Philosophy In his post, Brandt explained his long-standing reservations about XRP’s performance relative to Bitcoin, which he called the “store of wealth” standard. He highlighted XRP’s history of steep declines, noting repeated losses of 80%, 90%, and even 97% in value against Bitcoin. From Brandt’s perspective, holding onto a speculative asset that consistently underperforms compared to a more stable option, such as Bitcoin, is irrational. He described this approach as “the definition of insanity,” particularly when investors continue to hold the asset despite repeated poor performance, expecting a different outcome. Focus on the Community’s Attitude Brandt clarified that his criticisms were not aimed at XRP supporters as individuals but rather at their attitude during significant losses. He specifically called out what he described as a “dogmatic, obnoxious, often unintelligible defense” of XRP during its downturns. While Brandt acknowledged that his critiques might have appeared harsh, he reiterated that his focus was on what he saw as the imprudent financial behavior of defending substantial losses, rather than the community’s broader commitment to improving their financial circumstances.

He emphasized that he would never criticize their achievements, only how they defended losses in the past. In his words, “I would never disparage your success, only your attitude of defending 90% declines against an asset with more stability.” He also declared that this would be his final public commentary on XRP. Hoskinson’s Response Highlights a Shift Charles Hoskinson’s lighthearted response to Brandt’s post suggests that he views the trader’s remarks as a potential shift between XRP supporters and their critics. Although Hoskinson has had disagreements with the XRP community, he shared new perspectives last year on potential opportunities for collaboration between the Cardano and XRP ecosystems. This interaction between prominent figures in the crypto industry underscores the ongoing discussions around XRP, its performance, and the passionate community that supports it.

However, his latest forecast for the cryptocurrency is slightly more conservative than earlier predictions for 2025. Kiyosaki’s $250,000 Target As Bitcoin surged past the $100,500 milestone, Kiyosaki took to social media to express his optimism . “Bitcoin over $100,000,” he tweeted, followed by a new projection that the leading cryptocurrency would hit $250,000 this year. Furthermore, he confirmed that he continues buying more Bitcoin, signaling unwavering confidence in its potential. This prediction has garnered support from several commentators who believe Bitcoin’s price could skyrocket if the incoming U.S. administration follows through on its campaign promise to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Some experts have speculated that such a move could propel Bitcoin’s value beyond $350,000. In late 2024, Kiyosaki admired MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy, spearheaded by Michael Saylor. He echoed Saylor’s long-term view that Bitcoin could reach $12 million per coin over the next decade as it increasingly replaces gold in investment portfolios. A Change in Kiyosaki’s Bitcoin Strategy Interestingly, Kiyosaki’s current approach contrasts with his earlier stance. Just a few months ago, he stated that he would cease purchasing Bitcoin once its price surpassed $100,000, emphasizing the importance of avoiding greed. Yet, following Bitcoin’s recent rally, he has continued accumulating, demonstrating his enduring faith in its value as a long-term asset. In December 2024, Kiyosaki made several predictions about Bitcoin’s trajectory. While one estimate suggested the cryptocurrency could reach $175,000 in 2025, another more optimistic forecast pegged it at $350,000 by year-end. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Kiyosaki Criticizes BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Strategy Kiyosaki has also been vocal in his criticism of BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Following significant outflows from BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF in December 2024, Kiyosaki accused the firm of deliberately suppressing Bitcoin’s price to enable large investors, or “whales,” to accumulate more. Known for his passion for alternative investments, Kiyosaki has consistently championed Bitcoin, gold, and silver as safe-haven assets. His commitment to these assets reflects his belief in their ability to preserve wealth in an unpredictable financial landscape. Looking Ahead As Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory, Robert Kiyosaki’s revised prediction highlights his unwavering confidence in Bitcoin’s potential. With market dynamics shifting and institutional interest growing, Bitcoin’s journey toward Kiyosaki’s $250,000 target will be a focal point for investors and enthusiasts alike.

MARA’s unique approach includes issuing convertible bonds to raise capital for BTC accumulation, aiming to increase BTC yield and shareholder value. Despite its higher debt and risk profile, MARA’s compressed mNAV and operational similarities to MSTR suggest significant upside potential in a Bitcoin bull market. Market is undervaluing or heavily discounting MARA's mining operations. Simple comparison with RIOT demonstrates this. MARA Holdings ( MARA ) is positioning itself as a unique Bitcoin (BTC-USD) focused company, reminiscent of MicroStrategy (MSTR). While MSTR remains the world’s premier Bitcoin treasury company holding 450,000 BTC, MARA brings additional innovations to the table and boasts the second-largest Bitcoin treasury among publicly traded companies at 44,893 BTC. With the MARA share price at pretty low levels—especially compared to MSTR’s valuation and that of other pure-play Bitcoin miners—MARA could offer a “revenge trade” opportunity for investors who feel they missed out on MSTR’s historic rally. I believe MARA is trading in deep value territory at under $18 per share. MARA’s Parallels to MSTR I’ve written about how MSTR is like Bitcoin’s only investment bank . The company issues various kinds of securities (predominantly convertible bonds, but recently also entering preferred stock) to raise capital and funnel that capital into BTC. This structure redistributes BTC’s volatility and returns across different investor classes, effectively letting MSTR package BTC exposure as a variety of financial products. MARA appears to be following a similar model on a smaller scale. By issuing convertible bonds at low or zero interest rates, MARA raises capital efficiently and uses the proceeds to accumulate BTC. Convertible bond offerings benefit from the company’s relatively high implied volatility, making them attractive for those who wish to hedge or speculate via options. Once that debt is converted into shares—typically after the stock price surpasses the conversion price—MARA is left holding more BTC per assumed diluted share than before. This is called “BTC Yield,” a term pioneered by MSTR. Both MSTR and MARA demonstrate a willingness to accept dilution if it translates BTC Yield (i.e. is accretive to shareholders). MSTR’s massive gains over 2024 highlight how powerful this dynamic can be, and MARA appears poised to replicate it—seeing that it is the second-largest BTC treasury and the largest BTC miner. Importantly, MARA’s share price has not enjoyed the same parabolic move that characterized MSTR’s run, suggesting there may be considerable upside if this current Bitcoin bull market accelerates. Why MARA Could Be the Next MSTR “Revenge Trade” I strongly believe that investors who feel like they missed the boat on MSTR might bet on MARA as a bit of a “revenge trade.” MARA has not seen meaningful appreciation. Yet, it resembles MSTR in many extremely important and glaring ways. With 44,893 BTC, MARA’s BTC treasury is far larger than other companies. Only MSTR holds more. The third-place treasury, [[RIOT]], is at 17,722 BTC—much lower than MARA’s total. This wide gap suggests MARA is the logical runner-up if investors want another “pure-play” bet on Bitcoin treasury companies. But there's more to this because MARA offers a few things that MSTR does not. First, MARA is actually the largest Bitcoin miner by hashrate. MARA generates a large portion of revenue in BTC, part of which can be added to BTC Yield. Second, MARA has also been lending out its BTC. It lent 7377 BTC in 2024 . MSTR has neither of these. In short, MARA’s fundamentals and operational decisions strongly parallel MSTR’s playbook. It’s BTC treasury size makes it the clear #2— effectively the next in line for a Bitcoin treasury company pure play bet. And because MARA’s stock has yet to enjoy the sort of growth MSTR saw, it presents a potential opportunity for those who believe that the next MSTR might still have room to grow. I think MARA’s “mini-MSTR” status could help it attract a wave of new investors seeking such exposure. When we look at the numbers of mNAV (multiple of market cap to BTC NAV), we see that MARA has by far the lowest mNAV of all the top Bitcoin treasury companies with US tickers. MARA currently trades at 1.349X the value of its BTC. MSTR trades at 1.926X its BTC. Bitcoin Treasuries ( bitcointreasuries.net ) MARA also owns the world's largest publicly traded mining operation, and it also has products like 2PIC, which I have covered in my previous MARA articles . An adjustment to the same mNAV as some of the other miners (like HUT) would mean a 67% gain from current levels, at least. [[CLSK]]’s mNAV is over twice as high as MARA’s. Even adjusting to the mNAV of MSTR would mean a 40% gain from current levels. At the same time, MARA’s risk profile is higher. It has more debt compared to its equity value. Here is the debt as of their 10-Q from November . There are 2 series of notes. Convertibles (MARA) Then in November, they completed a $1 billion convertible bonds offering . And in December, they completed a $850 million convertible bonds offering . You can see the full lineup of all four notes here in the 19 December 2024 8-K . This table outlines the shares that the notes are convertible too, which is needed for the BTC Yield calculation. Convertibles (MARA) Altogether, MARA has about $2.48 billion of debt. Their market cap is under $6 billion, so they are levered about 2.4X. In contrast, MSTR’s BTC value (which is half of MSTR’s market cap) is about 5X more than MSTR’s outstanding debt (which is also all convertible bonds). So MARA is definitely in a much riskier position. This could justify a lower mNAV. But the main point is that all of these things have made MARA look a lot like a mini MSTR, which has not yet taken off. The compressed mNAV and the fact that it is the largest miner with the largest BTC holdings adds to this view. Also, it isn't wrong to say that because MARA is more leveraged, it should outperform in a true bull market rally of BTC due to a higher equity beta. That said, the price action of the stock and the leverage in the capital structure don't always translate to one another. But in this case, I think the odds are good since the asset being leveraged has a 24/7 market price and is 74% of the market cap. Risks MARA, like MSTR, is highly sensitive to Bitcoin’s price volatility. If BTC endures a prolonged downturn, the burden of repaying debt could force the company to sell its BTC or other assets or dilute. By contrast, a surging BTC price could magnify the company’s upside, particularly if it continues adding to its treasury. Because MARA is so highly leveraged, I think it is possible that it would outperform MSTR in a BTC rally, although this dynamic is quickly changing as MSTR is expected to unload much of the fixed income portion of their 21-21 plan in Q1. MARA has, in my view, another big risk in executing on multiple initiatives at once— large-scale mining across a few continents, 2PIC, Slipstream, Anduro, mining Kaspa, lending BTC, MARAFW, and selling heat from mining. Having all these ventures evidently has not made the market enthusiastic, or you’d expect the BTC treasury to not occupy 74% of the market value. Here’s a good example. The market currently values RIOT’s mining operations as more valuable than MARA’s. RIOT’s market cap minus its BTC NAV is $2.48 billion. MARA’s market cap minus its BTC NAV is $1.52 billion. This is shocking when you see that RIOT has 31.5 EH/s as of December 2024, but MARA has 53.2 EH/s as of December 2024. In other words, RIOT’s 40% smaller mining operation is worth 60% more, according to the market. Based on these numbers, long MARA, short RIOT could be a great pair trade. We must also remember that RIOT doesn't have the auxiliary things that MARA has like 2PIC and BTC lending. But another interpretation is that MARA’s mining operation—and adjacent ventures—appear to be undervalued or even penalized by the market, treating them more like liabilities than assets. I believe MARA should consider divesting parts of its mining operation—reducing expansion CAPEX and redirecting resources to cutting deals to divest machines and sites to other miners like CLSK and RIOT. MARA should take the proceeds from divestitures and purchase BTC, doubling down on becoming a mini MSTR. For now, I don't believe it is possible to conclusively know why the market is assigning such a valuation to MARA. The risk is that this harsh assessment could continue, and the stock can continue lagging BTC and other mining peers. Conclusion MARA mirrors MicroStrategy’s core model—leveraging convertible debt to accumulate BTC—yet reaches beyond that playbook by adding a list of other capabilities. It seems that the market is assigning higher risk to these capabilities, but they can also open the door for larger rewards. With a more moderate valuation and the 2nd largest BTC treasury among publicly traded firms, MARA may be a compelling option for investors seeking “the next MSTR”. This is why I recently opened a small position in OTM MARA calls, expiring in 2027. I think the stock is currently in deep value territory and a revision in sentiment can send it much, much higher.",BTC-USD|CLSK|MSTR|RIOT|MARA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-16 09:40:31

Especially as the president-elect seems dead set on fixing his friendship with Russia’s president Vlad Putin. Now Biden has rolled out a massive package targeting over 250 entities, aiming squarely at Russia’s already battered economy, its military-industrial backbone, and a sneaky sanctions evasion network involving China. The Treasury calls it “fresh restrictions.” Sanctions experts call it “Trump-proof.” Either way, it’s a parting gift from Biden designed to make reversing these penalties a bureaucratic nightmare for Trump—or anyone else, for that matter. The sanctions hit nearly 100 Russian entities that were already under previous restrictions. The Treasury says this new layer is about tightening the noose, creating risks for anyone bold—or foolish—enough to do business with these sanctioned players. Russian energy companies, financial institutions, and a few Chinese actors facilitating illegal payment channels are the primary targets. And for those wondering, yes, Congress now has to get involved before any of this can be undone. The Democrats are turning out to be some really bitter losers. Energy, banks, and the shadow network Russian banks, already paralyzed by sanctions, have just had the screws tightened even more. The Treasury’s list includes financial institutions deeply embedded in Moscow’s economy, making their operations even riskier for anyone still willing to work with them. Companies in Russia’s energy sector, a key part of its GDP, also got hit again, increasing their headaches in navigating international markets. China didn’t escape this crackdown. The U.S. focused on a cross-border payment scheme between Russian and Chinese actors that facilitated transactions for restricted goods. Regional clearinghouses in both countries were involved, making this a transnational headache. Several Russian banks played a starring role in the scheme, which the Treasury claims enabled trade in sensitive items. Then there’s Keremet Bank, based in Kyrgyzstan, a relatively small player accused of helping Russian officials dodge sanctions. The U.S. labeled it as a facilitator of illicit financial activity tied to a Russian-designated bank. The message? Even minor players won’t be overlooked in this sanctions regime. The Biden administration also turned its gaze to Ukraine, slapping sanctions on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Captured by Russian forces in 2022, it remains Europe’s largest nuclear facility. While the sanctions won’t disrupt the plant’s operations, they serve as a clear warning about Moscow’s occupation and control. Russian officials, unsurprisingly, shrugged off the move, claiming it wouldn’t affect the plant. Oil markets and Russia’s struggling economy The International Energy Agency (IEA) chimed in, saying the sanctions could eventually disrupt Russian oil supply chains, although the global market might not feel the pinch immediately. Russia’s oil exports, which prop up its economy, have already taken a hit since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and these new restrictions could tighten the screws further. Global benchmark Brent crude prices have responded. On Monday, oil was trading at $81 a barrel, up 8% since the start of 2025. The IEA, however, remains cautious, revising earlier predictions of catastrophic declines in Russian supply. In 2022, they estimated a loss of 3 million barrels per day, but reality fell short. This time, they’re playing it safe, waiting to see how Russia adapts. Meanwhile, Moscow’s economy is taking blow after blow. Inflation in Russia officially hit 9.5% in 2024, but many citizens claim the real figure feels closer to 20%. Prices for basic goods have skyrocketed. Food, in particular, has seen prices jump as much as 90%, leaving ordinary Russians scrambling to make ends meet. It’s not just inflation. The government is pouring money into military spending, leaving civilian sectors in the dust. Nearly 40% of Russia’s 2025 budget—an eye-watering 41.47 trillion rubles—is going straight to defense. At the same time, Moscow faces a $142 billion funding gap for its war efforts. How do they plan to cover it? Borrowing and, most likely, printing money, which could make the inflation problem even worse. Russia’s economy is on the brink Russia’s economy, already limping, is now on even shakier ground. Inflation hit 9.5% in 2024, with unofficial estimates pushing that number closer to 20%. Every day, Russians are feeling the squeeze. Grocery bills have ballooned, with some food prices skyrocketing by as much as 90%. Public frustration is boiling over as wages remain stagnant while costs spiral out of control. Meanwhile, the Kremlin is throwing money into its war machine. Military spending is set to account for 40% of the 2025 federal budget, which totals a record 41.47 trillion rubles—roughly $400 billion. That’s leaving little for civilians. Social programs are underfunded, and public sector wages can’t keep up with inflation. The Russian government also faces a staggering $142 billion funding gap for its Ukraine war effort this year. Analysts say Moscow will likely resort to borrowing or printing more money, which could trigger another wave of inflation. This vicious cycle is hitting businesses hard. High interest rates, now sitting at 21%, are forcing many companies into bankruptcy.

33767162,[object Object],1737020813,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,CEX Trading Peaks at $11.3T in December. What Crypto to Buy Now?,https://bitcoinist.com/cex-trading-hits-11-3t-what-crypto-to-buy-now/,"CCData reports that the centralized exchange (CEX) trading volume hit $11.3T in December, setting a new record with a 7.58% increase from November. Binance accounted for the largest share of trading activity with $946B. Bybit ranked second with a $247B trading volume and an 18.8% monthly growth. Meanwhile, $BTC climbed to $101K for the first time since January 7. Most of the top 100 tokens followed suit, with $VIRTUALS (+28.91%), $FARTCOIN (+22.58%), and $XDC (+21.72%) being top gainers. Record-breaking trading volumes mean two things: high liquidity and strong investor confidence. Given this, now is the perfect time to gear up for the upcoming rally. We’ve picked four cryptos to buy now for max gains. Solaxy ($SOLX): Layer-2 Network to Resolve Solana Congestion The trading volume of Solana ecosystem tokens rose by 20.34% and the market cap by 141.1% last month. The main reason is the hype around AI agent tokens, most of which run on Base or Solana. Noteworthy, Solana hosts two of the leading AI agents, $AI16Z and $ZEREBRO. However, increased usage worsens Solana’s congestion, leading to long processing times, high fees, and failed transactions. Solaxy ($SOLX) addresses this with its hybrid Layer-2 solution. When the Solaxy chain launches, it will offload transactions from the mainnet to enhance its performance and scalability. Currently on presale, Solaxy’s native token, $SOLX, costs $0.001602 and presents an affordable entry point into this promising ecosystem. The project raised $10.6M so far, and early adopters have staked over 3.4B $SOLX at a 331% APY. GAME by Virtuals ($GAME): The ‘Shovel’ of the AI Agent Gold Rush Virtuals Protocol is now the leading AI agent launchpad, so we see several tokens created on Virtuals among top gainers. $GAME launched in October 2024 but only gained traction now, with a 143% monthly and 37% 24-hour increase. Essentially, $GAME is a framework that helps developers create and deploy AI agents for transactional environments, such as trading and gaming. You’ve read it right; it’s an AI agent launchpad built on an AI agent launchpad. As they say, during the Gold Rush, sell shovels. As the ecosystem grows, so does the demand for its native token, so $GAME is likely to see more upside in the future. MIND of Pepe ($MIND): Exclusive Insights & Token Launches for Early Adopters Riding on the back of the AI trend, MIND of Pepe ($MIND) presents a new AI agent that sifts through data on X to share exclusive insights with its token holders. MIND of Pepe can also engage in discussions to gauge community sentiment and launch its own tokens only available to early adopters. This AI agent’s growth is fully autonomous, which means there’s no human emotion to cloud its judgment. Theoretically, this means MIND of Pepe’s trading advice must be more effective because it doesn’t feel FUD, FOMO, or anchoring bias. The $MIND token presale kicked off two days ago and already hit $1.4M. One $MIND now costs $0.0031259, but the price will increase tomorrow, so there will be no better time to join the project than now. Alchemist AI ($ALCH): No-Code Revolution on Solana Alchemist AI introduces a no-code applications development platform on Solana. You describe your idea, and it turns it into an actual working app. Apart from writing code, Alchemist AI integrates with many popular web frameworks and automatically tests and optimizes apps for user experience and performance. Is it powerful enough to replace human developers? Only time will tell. But the $ALCH token has already grown by 82% since December and 38.80% in the last 24 hours, so the project’s future looks bright. DYOR, Diversify, and HODL The bull run is only getting started, so now is the time to build your portfolio, HODL, and watch it (hopefully) grow. However, remember that the crypto market is volatile. DYOR, diversify, and only invest as much as you can afford to potentially lose.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|MNT|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ZK|WLD|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-16 09:46:53

The SEC’s response suggests a potential Litecoin ETF could be on the way. History shows the SEC’s response does not guarantee an ETF approval for Litecoin. Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst, Eric Balchunas, observed that the SEC has responded to Litecoin’s S-1, signaling the possibility of approving the cryptocurrency’s ETF application. Balchunas believes this response makes it more likely that Litecoin will be the next coin to have its ETF application approved.

This surge seems to be driven by heavy whale accumulation and growing excitement about the potential approval of Litecoin ETF. Litecoin Price Surges Amid Optimism Over ETF Approval Hopes As per James Seyffart tweet on X, @CanaryFunds has just filed an amended S-1 for their Litecoin ETF, which could signal some engagement with the SEC on the filing. While there are no guarantees yet, this move suggests progress in the approval process. However, it’s important to note that the 19b-4 filing, which is crucial for final approval, has not been submitted yet. This development adds to growing anticipation around the potential approval of a Litecoin ETF. Canary Litecoin ETF Accordign to Santiment , Litecoin has decoupled from other altcoins, soring by 16.1% in market cap within the last 11 hours. Similar to the trend seen in early December, the main factor behind this surge appears to be whales and sharks holding 10K+ LTC. Since January 9th, they have accumulated 250K coins, fuelign the price increase. Santiment According to Javon Marks on X, Litecoin (LTC) is showing signs of significant strength and could be gearing up for a strong rally, with the first target near $354.36. This move could signal a potential upside of over 207%, and might just be the beginning. Litecoin Weekly Chart What Next For LTC? On the daily chart, After forming a low of $50 near august 2024, Litecoin price started its upward journey and 5th Dec it made a high of $147 and the price retracted almost 40% from high to $90 and form double bottom. After taking support near 0.382 Fibonacci level, LTC is hovering near the neckline of double bottom pattern as well as near 0.786 Fibonacci level. If the upside trend continues and breaches these levels, then the next target might be the $150 psychological barrier. LTC/USDT Daily Chart However, Litecoin is expected to keep rising as bulls eye the next major resistance at $150, driven by hopes of an ETF approval and whale buying activity. This target is roughly 27% higher than the current price. If the price falls below the crucial support level at $100, the bullish outlook will be invalidated.

Instead of slumping once again as it did at the start of the business week, BTC’s price headed north and tapped a weekly high before it was stopped. Briefly Exceeding $100K The aforementioned start of the current business week was violent for the primary cryptocurrency as it plummeted from $96,000 to under $90,000 in hours. In fact, its bottom came at $89,250 (on Bitstamp), which became its lowest price position since November. As the community started to question the bull run’s validity, BTC bounced off and soared to $97,000 by Tuesday. It calmed there for a bit in anticipation of the Wednesday announcement for the CPI numbers, but it shot up once they came out. Within mere minutes, the asset went from under $97,000 to $98,500 and kept climbing to just shy of $101,000. After charting this weekly high, though, it started to lose some momentum and now sits about two grand lower.

Table of Contents Binance Coin, XRP: Established leaders Lightchain AI: Rising star with huge potential Potential for Lightchain AI in the next bull market As the cryptocurrency market braces for its next bull run, seasoned tokens like Binance Coin (BNB) and Ripple (XRP) are expected to attract investor attention. However, a new contender, Lightchain AI, is emerging as a project that could outperform these established players. Currently priced at $0.00525 during its presale and with over $10.6 million raised, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a top-tier blockchain project. Its smart approach to scalability and real-world utility makes it a standout choice for those seeking the next breakout opportunity in the crypto market. Binance Coin, XRP: Established leaders Binance Coin is a token of the Binance system and is seen as one, of the most important platforms in crypto world. BNB’s use includes lowering costs for trades, putting aside funds to earn rewards, and being part ͏of Binance’s wide network that has a trading platform and a place for digital collectibles. Even though its solid basics keep it important, the chance for growth is fading. Ripple is an important part of sending money across borders. It has great links with banks and other money groups all over the world. XRP helps make quick, cheap international payments, which has helped it stay strong in the blockchain world. But, Ripple’s fight with the SEC keeps making things unclear, which holds back its chance to see big price changes even though it is very useful.

VIRTUAL beispielsweise, der Token von Virtuals Protocol, konnte 2024 35.000 Prozent zulegen – und Branchenbeobachter halten den Markt noch lange nicht für gesättigt. Sprich: Entsprechende Kurs-Explosionen werden sich womöglich wiederholen. Schon jetzt explodieren die AI Agents auf coinmarketcap.com. Top-Performer der letzten 24 Stunden: CYI by Virtuals (CYI) mit einem Anstieg von unglaublichen 354,57 Prozent. Zudem Nikita (NIKITA, +111,08 Prozent) und OnlyCalls by Virtuals (CALLS, +79,28 Prozent). Die pumpenden Preise sorgen für entsprechende FOMO bei Investoren. Viele Anleger suchen aktuell nach seriösen, vielversprechenden Projekten, bevor es erneut zu einer Flut von halbgaren, schnell auf den Markt geworfenen Groschengräbern kommt. Diesbezüglich für Furore sorgt beispielsweise ein neuer AI Agent namens Mind of Pepe (MIND) – und manche Prognose spekuliert bereits, ob damit womöglich der beste KI Agent Coin 2025 ins Haus steht. Hintergrund: MIND of Pepe (MIND) ist ein hoch entwickelter, selbständiger AI Agent – mit allem, was einen potenziellen Marktführer auszeichnet!

Investoren kaufen MIND, der AI Agent erledigt den Rest. Und das nicht zu knapp: MIND of Pepe (MIND) hat im Gegensatz zu anderen, eingeschränkten KIs umfänglichen Zugriff auf die Blockchain und seinen eigenen Wallet – der potenziell beste AI Agent 2025 kann auch mit dApps interagieren und dadurch Anlage-Strategien für MIND-Inhaber entwickeln! Immer im Hinterkopf: das Wohl der Anleger. MIND wird nur tun, was seinen Inhabern zugutekommt. Kann Mind of Pepe 100x? Könnte sich der Einstieg lohnen? Sowohl Prognosen als auch Krypto-Influencer und -Analysten halten das Konzept für innovativ – und im Vergleich zu anderen AI Agents zudem unterhaltsam. Packt MIND ein 100x, wie diese Mind of Pepe Prognose in Aussicht stellt?

Mind of Pepe (MIND) hingegen punktet mit einer Phalanx an Funktionen – und rabattierten Presale-Konditionen. Denn: Noch gilt Mind of Pepe (MIND) als Geheimtipp. Das Projekt ist nicht auf dem freien Markt erhältlich, sondern exklusiv nur über die Homepage der Entwickler. Dennoch explodiert die Nachfrage.

The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF is outdated and underperforming due to its reliance on futures contracts. New Bitcoin ETFs launched in 2024 offer superior returns and lower expenses, making them preferable for buy-and-hold investors. The launch of IBIT options in November 2024 removes BITO's last unique attraction, leading to a ""sell"" rating for BITO. Bitcoin is consolidating the post-election rally. This is a necessary step in building the next phase of the rally - without a rest, markets get too stretched and vulnerable to large drops. The good news is that the positive drivers that drove the 2024 gains are still present, and there is scope for further gains and good news in 2025 as Donald Trump assembles his crypto-friendly administration. There are various ways to gain exposure to bitcoin. Some are better than others, but there is one fund that sticks out for all the wrong reasons. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) is an outdated and underperforming way to gain bitcoin exposure. This article explains why it has outlived its usefulness. Why BITO? Once upon a time, the only way to own bitcoin was to buy it directly on a crypto exchange. This was a risky business as wallets were often hacked and exchanges went bankrupt. The high-profile collapse of FTX in 2022 was a particularly painful episode for all concerned. Bitcoin futures were introduced by CBOE and CME in December 2017. The launch of the CME contract just happened to be on the day of the top before an -85% decline. Futures made it possible to short Bitcoin for the first time. Even though futures made it easier to trade bitcoin, derivatives contracts are largely an arena of institutional investors, and retail traders with a standard brokerage account were still excluded. BITO changed that in 2021. As the fund page states : First U.S. bitcoin-linked ETF. Familiarity, liquidity and transparency of an ETF. Available through a brokerage account-no need for a cryptocurrency exchange account or wallet. The attraction was clear, and with no alternatives (apart from the OTC-traded Grayscale Trust) until early 2024, the downsides associated with the fund's structure and methodology could be overlooked. The Downsides Due to regulatory limitations which were only overcome in 2024, BITO could not hold bitcoin directly. It therefore bought futures contracts, but this introduced a variety of problems. As the fund page states: There is no guarantee the fund will closely track bitcoin returns. Or to put it another way, BITO is almost certain to underperform Bitcoin. Data by YCharts There are several reasons for this. BITO buys front-month futures contracts and continually rolls them to the next month. As the fact sheet highlights , this can have a negative impact. This ETF is actively managed. The costs associated with rolling (buying and selling) futures and the impact of margin requirements, collateral requirements and other limits may have a negative impact on performance and prevent the Fund from achieving its objective. 2. To make matters worse, bitcoin is almost always in contango. This is more pronounced with further-out contracts, but even rolling to the next month can be detrimental. As the prospectus explains: In order to maintain its exposure to bitcoin futures contracts, the Fund must sell its futures contracts as they near expiration and replace them with new futures contracts with a later expiration date. This is often referred to as ""rolling"" a futures contract. Futures contracts with a longer term to expiration may be priced higher than futures contracts with a shorter term to expiration, a relationship called ""contango."" When rolling futures contracts that are in contango, the Fund will sell the expiring contract at a relatively lower price and buy a longer-dated contract at a relatively higher price. BITO also enters swap agreements. As the prospectus explains, this may be due to liquidity constraints. After all, maintaining a plus $2B position in futures may be challenging. In certain circumstances, for example, if the Fund is unable to obtain the desired exposure to bitcoin futures contracts, the Fund may enter into swap agreements that provide exposure to bitcoin or bitcoin futures. Here's how the holdings look - ProShares The short-term US Treasury Bills are a cash-substitute and serve as collateral on the futures and swap positions. The Bills yield the going rate, currently around 4.5%, which is useful, but only serves to narrow the underperformance. 3. The fund is actively managed, and the expense ratio is high at 0.95%. Other Bitcoin ETFs such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF have expense ratios as low as 0.12%. 4. BITO's ""distributions"" are seen as an attraction by some investors. Certainly, the current 61.7% yield is impressive, but it is simply a distribution of income to lower taxes for the fund. As ProShares explains: All 1940 Act registered mutual funds and ETFs are required to distribute nearly all of their taxable income by the end of each calendar year to avoid excise taxes. This effectively shifts the tax burden onto BITO holders: ""Generally, the Fund's dividend distributions will be taxed as ordinary dividends, not qualified dividend income. "" The distributions are monthly due to the contract rolls and are then adjusted towards the end of the year. All the profits are distributed, and when there is no profit, like in 2022 and some months in 2023, there is no distribution. Seeking Alpha This is a different methodology to the popular income-based ETFs launched in recent years. For example, the Simplify Bitcoin Strategy PLUS Income ETF ( MAXI ) provides exposure to bitcoin while simultaneously generating income by selling short-dated put and/or call spreads. Don't mix BITO's strategy with this option overlay strategy; it has no positive effect. The Alternatives The Bitcoin ETFs launched in early 2024 are far superior products to BITO, especially if your tactic is to buy and hold. Their popularity has led to a decline in BITO's AUM. Data by YCharts The total return in the new ETFs is considerably higher and the expense ratios considerably lower as the funds don't have to get involved with futures contracts and swaps. Seeking Alpha As they buy considerable amounts of bitcoin and keep it in custody, there is a risk of hacking, but these funds have gone to great lengths to secure their holdings. Nothing is 100%, but I have no concerns. The Option Angle The volatility of bitcoin means options are attractive and suitable for various strategies. Perhaps one of the last advantages for BITO was that it was the only fund with options available. However, that has recently changed. IBIT options started trading in November and their launch caused a lot of excitement with $1.9B in volume on their first day. Saxo enthused: The debut of options trading on Bitcoin ETFs, starting with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), isn't just another headline for crypto enthusiasts-it's a game-changer for investors everywhere. IBIT options already have open interest of around $11 billion, or 2.3m contracts. Meanwhile, the open interest of BITO options has fallen slightly to 1.1m contracts and is below the 52-week average of 1.2m. This may be the start of a switch to IBIT options and the final nail in the coffin for BITO. Conclusions BITO had an important role to play as the first bitcoin ETF. To take this position, it had to employ a complex strategy trading futures contracts, which negatively affected its total return and introduced other problems. It made sense when there was no alternative, but the introduction of new ETFs in 2024 provided much better options for buy-and-hold investors. The last attraction for BITO was that it was the only ETF to have options available. That changed in November with the launch of IBIT options, and BITO has no longer any unique attraction. I may be bullish on bitcoin, but I rate BITO a ""sell.""

SEC Uses Its Last Trump Card for XRP!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/new-development-in-ripple-sec-case-sec-uses-its-last-trump-card-for-xrp/,"There has been a new development in the Ripple-SEC case, with the SEC filing an appeal against the district court’s decision regarding Ripple’s XRP sales. The SEC argued that all transactions involving XRP purchased by retail investors through cryptocurrency platforms were securities under the Howey Test. On this point, the SEC argued that the district court's decision was erroneous, disagreeing with its previous decision that XRP sales to retail investors under the Howey test did not violate securities laws, and appealed to the court of appeals to overturn that decision. The SEC also accused Ripple of increasing demand for and the price of XRP through public statements. The SEC argued that Ripple’s promotional activities created the perception that investors, including retail buyers, were likely to profit from XRP. The SEC also stated that the first instance court made the wrong decision regarding retail XRP sales and included the following statements in its petition: “The court ruled that sales to institutional investors were securities, but erroneously determined that sales to retail investors were not securities. Because retail investors purchased XRP through crypto asset trading platforms, they had no idea whether the seller was Ripple, a Ripple affiliate, or someone else.” Ripple chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty called the SEC's lawsuit “just noise” and said, “As expected, the SEC's objection reiterates arguments that have already failed and will likely be rejected by the next administration. We will respond formally in due time.” What Happened? In 2020, the SEC accused Ripple of selling XRP, which it claimed was an unregistered security, and raising $1.3 billion through those sales. In the long-running case, in 2023, U.S. District Court Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York ruled that Ripple’s so-called retail sales of XRP did not violate securities laws. However, she ruled that other direct sales of tokens to institutional investors were securities. Judge Torres also ordered Ripple to pay a $125 million fine. *This is not investment advice.

Just days before his departure, President Joe Biden’s administration announced a slew of trade restrictions. On Wednesday, the US Department of Commerce included the startup in its entity list, barring US suppliers from selling to the company without a license as part of a last-minute initiative by the outgoing administration. The measure coincided with new regulations designed to prevent advanced chips, including AI accelerators, from reaching China. Tencent Holdings Ltd. backed startup is considered one of China’s “AI Tigers” Zhipu is among a small group of promising AI developers in China that have attracted funding at high valuations. The firm originated from research at Tsinghua University and is backed by Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Zhipu focuses on large language models similar to those from OpenAI. The firm is one of China’s four “AI Tigers”, representing its best hope of narrowing its technological gap with the US. The unicorn, valued at 20 billion yuan (US$2.7 billion) last September, counts Alibaba Group Holding, Tencent Holdings, and HongShan Capital Group as investors. The Chinese start-up said it “strongly disagrees” with a US decision to add the company and its subsidiaries to an export blacklist. Zhipu responded by stating that the US decision “lacked factual basis.” According to a WeChat post on Wednesday, Zhipu said: Being included in the Entity List will not have a substantial impact on the company’s business. – Zhipu Existing export restrictions on advanced AI chips from US companies like Nvidia Corp. to China have already limited Zhipu’s access to cutting-edge AI development hardware. The company, which raised around $410 million in its latest funding round in December, claims to have tens of millions of users in China. US export restrictions target Zhipu and other Chinese tech firms Zhipu is among many Chinese firms recently targeted by US government blacklists. A week prior, Tencent was added to a Defense Department list of companies linked to the Chinese military, alongside Tesla Inc. battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. Also included in the updated list is Sophgo, a Chinese chip designer that came under scrutiny last year after a chip it ordered from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) was found to be identical to one used in a Huawei Technologies processor. Huawei has been on the Entity List since 2019. Several industry advocacy groups and companies have expressed their opposition to the restrictions. The US-based Semiconductor Industry Association stated that policies to curb China’s AI development might backfire and “undercut US leadership and competitiveness” in the chip and AI sectors.

Recent market trends have fueled a recovery, pushing SUI higher amid broader crypto momentum. Meanwhile, BTC is slightly below the $100k mark. Sui’s focus on scalability and continuous development underscores its growing market presence and potential, capturing the attention of crypto investors. PriceApproaches ATH as SUI Development Activity Spikes Sui price is hovering near its ATH as development activity reaches its highest level in a month. On-chain data shows developers are actively working on upgrades, signaling continued growth and innovation within the ecosystem. This increase in development efforts often indicates strong project fundamentals, potentially attracting more users and investors. Higher development activity typically boosts confidence in a blockchain’s future, suggesting ongoing improvements and new features. With Sui’s network upgrades gaining momentum, the project could see greater adoption and usability. As the crypto market watches these developments, investors remain optimistic about the best altcoin potential to sustain its upward trajectory. $SUI Development Activity Hits 1-Month High Why Does This Matter? more development activity = greater the chances a product will grow = greater chances of user adoption pic.twitter.com/6IBRtCCEfK — MAXPAIN (@Mangyek0) January 16, 2025 SUI Price Eyes Breakout as Bulls Rally Analysts highlight that SUI price continues to trade just below its previous all-time high, signaling a potential breakout. Market dynamics show SUI price approaching AVAX’s market cap, reinforcing its growing significance in the crypto space. Additionally, reports reveal that Eric Trump holds SUI prices, alongside BTC, ETH, and SOL, increasing interest from prominent figures. Institutional support is also evident, as Grayscale has allocated 8% of one of its funds to Sui price, marking a milestone for the asset. The SUI weekly chart presents a bullish structure, with the price currently hovering around $4.86. A retest of previous resistance-turned support indicates strength, suggesting the potential for another leg upward. If the current trajectory holds, analysts project a 41.78% rally toward the $5.50–$6 range in the coming weeks. Source: X Key Levels To Watch For Sui Price As of the reporting time, the SUI price hovered around $4.59, reflecting a 1% surge within the past few hours. The asset remains in a consolidation phase, trading between key support at $4.5 and resistance at $5.30. If this level holds, a bullish reversal could target the $5.35 resistance (ATH), marking a potential 15.72% gain. A breakout above $5.35 could propel the price toward the next psychological barrier at $6.00. On the downside, failure to sustain current levels may lead to a retest of $4.50, and a breakdown below this support could trigger further selling pressure, potentially driving Sui price prediction towards $4.20.

Amidst a broader market anticipation for an altcoin surge, as echoed by @CryptooELITES who predict altcoins could skyrocket 50X soon, here’s a closer look at the cryptos JAVONMARKS has his eye on: 5 Crypto Coins to Watch for 200% Gains in 2025 XRP, Minotaurus (XRP), Immutable (IMX), Onyxcoin (XCN), and Litecoin (LTC) are altcoins to watch for potential 200% in 2025. 1. XRP (Ripple) JAVONMARKS has been vocal about XRP’s potential, noting its multiple attempts at a bullish breakout since late July 2024. With signals suggesting a sustained breakout above the $2-3 range, he predicts that XRP price could “rip higher” at any moment. This optimism is supported by XRP’s historical performance where, after reaching new all-time highs (ATH), significant further gains have followed. Source: @JavonTM1 The recent touch of $3 on January 15, 2025, the highest since 2018, aligns with this bullish forecast. Analysts are now eyeing $6 as a key level, spurred by regulatory optimism under the Trump administration and increasing demand. 2. Minotaurus (MTAUR) The Minotaurus (MTAUR) presale has captured significant attention, particularly among gamers and crypto enthusiasts, by raising over 247,000 USDT. Priced at 0.00006001 USDT during the presale, MTAUR offers an attractive entry point when compared to its projected listing price of 0.00020 USDT. Early buyers who bought the gaming token at 0.000040 USDT have seen their investment double, underscoring the token’s promising future. Minotaurus stands out with its gaming-centric approach, providing players with customizable avatars, in-game upgrades, and exclusive premium content access. As the casual gaming market grows, this early-stage cryptocurrency is strategically positioned to leverage this trend. Security is a priority, with audits from SolidProof and Coinsult ensuring platform integrity. Moreover, a 100,000 USDT giveaway, referral programs, and vesting schemes are fostering a vibrant community. The presale is easily accessible through Minotaurus’s official site, making it an opportune moment to participate before the price increases. 2. Immutable (IMX) Immutable (IMX) is also among altcoins to watch, having caught JAVONMARKS’s attention due to its post-breakout performance. He predicts IMX could surpass the $4.91 resistance level, potentially leading to a 255% increase, with further room for growth up to $9.4049, adding another 90% upside. This analysis follows Immutable’s price 378% climb towards the $4.91 target earlier in 2024, suggesting a robust foundation for continued growth in 2025. Immutable’s role as a layer-two scaling solution for NFTs on Ethereum, providing zero gas fees and enhanced scalability, underpins this bullish outlook. 3. Onyxcoin (XCN) JAVONMARKS recently noted that Onyxcoin (XCN) prices are moving significantly towards a targeted level of $0.00441, with a confirmed bull pattern suggesting another potential +27% upside to reach this target. This observation adds to the optimism around XCN, which has already shown a 20.88% increase in price within the last day, with trading volume jumping by 271.89% to $18.07M. Onyxcoin’s emphasis on node operation incentives and its ecosystem development might contribute to its potential for high returns, as one of the best cryptos to buy. 4. Litecoin (LTC) As another crypto coin to watch, JAVONMARKS sees Litecoin climbing back with signs of major strength, targeting $354.36, which would represent an over 207% upside. This prediction aligns with recent market activity where Litecoin has gained 18% in a day, reaching $120 levels amidst strong whale accumulation and optimism surrounding a potential Litecoin ETF approval . The surge in trading volume by 301% further supports the bullish case for LTC. Final Thoughts: Crypto Coins to Watch for Massive Gains The broader crypto market sentiment adds fuel to the bullish outlook for these coins. Influencers like @CryptoELITES have hinted at an altcoin surge, potentially delivering 50X gains. Javon Marks’ predictions align with this enthusiasm, offering a roadmap for investors eager to capitalize on the next big trends. Will 2025 be the year of unprecedented crypto gains? These five coins—XRP, MTAUR, IMX, XCN, and LTC—are certainly positioned to lead the charge. However, as always, investors should conduct their own research and consider market risks before diving in.
