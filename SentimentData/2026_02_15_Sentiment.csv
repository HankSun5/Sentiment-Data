Sentiment—the collective mood and engagement of the community—has become a key indicator of potential momentum. Social media chatter, discussion forums, and ranking metrics can reveal investor confidence and excitement, sometimes even before the market reacts. Recently, XRP has demonstrated a surge in attention that signals renewed interest and engagement across the crypto space. In a recent X post, X Finance Bull highlighted that XRP leads cryptocurrency sentiment rankings with a score of 12.9 million on Cookie.fun. This outpaces Bitcoin, which scored 7.6 million, and Chainlink at 6.9 million, signaling that XRP currently dominates online discussions. The post emphasized that, despite claims that “nobody talks about XRP anymore,” the conversation around the asset is louder than ever. This surge demonstrates that community engagement is strong, with both retail investors and broader audiences actively participating in discussions. BOOM $XRP #1 IN SENTIMENT Above Bitcoin. Above Chainlink. 12.9 million sentiment score. They said nobody talks about XRP anymore. This sentiment rankings say otherwise. The conversation is louder than ever. I wouldn’t be bearish here. I’m buying the dip. https://t.co/n4zhnlYz15 pic.twitter.com/evY2mnH7gD — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) February 13, 2026 The Crypto Sentiment Metrics Sentiment rankings aggregate social mentions, reactions, and discussions across platforms to provide a real-time measure of market attention. XRP’s top position suggests that the community is actively monitoring developments within the XRP Ledger ecosystem, from technical upgrades to institutional adoption. Rising sentiment often correlates with increased buying interest, as more participants engage with the asset, creating potential momentum that could influence price trends. Implications for Investors Strong sentiment can shape market behavior. According to X Finance Bull, XRP’s high ranking indicates a favorable environment for those considering accumulation, particularly during short-term dips. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Investors often use sentiment as a guide for timing entries, with elevated engagement signaling confidence in the asset’s prospects. The post underscores the potential for sentiment-driven activity to amplify price movements as new participants enter the market. Community Engagement and Market Dynamics XRP’s leading sentiment reflects both active participation and growing visibility. The asset benefits from developments such as partnerships, XRP Ledger ecosystem expansion, and broader adoption by financial institutions. As discussions proliferate online, visibility increases, attracting further attention and creating a feedback loop where community engagement fuels more activity. This dynamic strengthens XRP’s positioning and reinforces investor confidence. Looking Ahead Topping sentiment rankings ahead of Bitcoin and Chainlink demonstrates XRP’s continued relevance in the cryptocurrency conversation. For investors and observers, these metrics offer insights into market psychology, community enthusiasm, and potential momentum. X Finance Bull’s analysis reinforces that high sentiment, combined with structural and adoption developments, can serve as a key indicator for future market performance. XRP’s dominance in sentiment rankings underscores that the asset remains a central focus for the crypto community, signaling excitement, engagement, and confidence that could translate into meaningful market activity in the months ahead.

The token gained over 4.5% in 24 hours and hovered near $1.50 during the session. The move came as the broader crypto market rose nearly 1.8% to a total capitalization of $2.4 trillion. Despite the rebound, the XRP price remains down about 35% over the past month. The asset had moved sideways for several days before bulls pushed prices toward the $1.50 level. Market participants are now watching whether the recovery can extend beyond immediate resistance. Binance XRP Reserves Fall to Multi Month Lows On-chain data showed a decline in XRP reserves held on Binance, especially after RLUSD went live on the crypto exchange. According to analyst CryptoOnchain, balances fell to roughly 2.5 billion coins. He noted this was the lowest level recorded since early 2024. Back in November 2024, Binance held more than 3.2 billion XRP. This means nearly 700 million coins have left the exchange over the past 15 months. CryptoOnchain wrote that falling reserves reflect reduced sell-side liquidity. Source: X He stated that declining exchange balances are often seen as a sign of accumulation. Investors may be moving assets into self-custody rather than preparing to sell. Lower supply on exchanges can tighten available liquidity if demand increases. Liquidations and Market Momentum Support Price The latest price jump coincided with broader short liquidations across crypto markets. Data from Kalshi Traders showed that $150 million worth of crypto shorts were liquidated in 24 hours. Forced buying from short closures can contribute to upward price movement. XRP also benefited from improved sentiment after Bitcoin traded above $70,000 and Ethereum surpassed $2,000. As larger assets stabilized, traders rotated into altcoins, including XRP. The token tested the $1.50 resistance zone during the rally. As of press time, the XRP price remains below its recent monthly highs but has posted a strong daily candle. A sustained move above $1.55 may open the path toward higher resistance near $1.80. However, a failure to hold above $1.45 could lead to a retest of lower support levels. XRP Institutional Activity and Treasury Developments Institutional interest has also drawn attention. According to a report by Evernorth, Goldman Sachs has disclosed holding $152 million worth of XRP ETFs as of the end of Q4 2025. According to Evernorth, that amount represented nearly 14% of net XRP ETF inflows over the past year. Evernorth CEO Asheesh Birla discussed the company’s focus on XRP and the XRP Ledger. During a livestream, he described XRP as infrastructure built for real-world financial operations. He said the company plans to deploy its XRP treasury across settlement flows and tokenized assets. The broader macro environment also remains uncertain, with discussions around a potential U.S. government shutdown having created caution in financial markets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|XRP|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-02-14 20:23:26

By 2029, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $477.67. In 2032, AAVE will range between $658.59 to $776.19. Aave is a decentralized lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain . It is known for its innovative financial solutions, such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow instantly without collateral, and dynamic interest rates that adapt to market conditions. Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2026? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $129.25 Market cap $1.96B Trading volume (24-h) $329.04M Circulating supply 15.19M AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $118.07 24-hour high $130.41 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 16.43% (High) 50-day SMA $149.13 14-Day RSI 41.65 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 9 (Extreme Fear) Green days 11/30 (37%) 200-Day SMA $218.54 Aave 1-day price analysis Key takeaways : AAVE is up +9.24% today at $129.87 after a 29% rebound from $100. Major resistance sits at $130–$138, and the breakout target is $148. AAVE is overbought on the 4-hour chart and vulnerable to a pullback. Aave 1-day price chart AAVE is currently trading at $129.87, up +9.24% on the day, after bouncing aggressively from the $100–$104 demand zone. The move from the recent swing low near $100 to today’s high at $130.72 marks roughly a 29% recovery, showing strong reactive buying after the breakdown below $118.50 earlier this month. Reclaiming $118.50 is technically significant, as that level previously acted as structural support before the selloff accelerated. AAVEUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView AAVE is now pressing into a dense resistance cluster between $130.90 and $138.57, with a higher ceiling at $148.12. This zone represents prior breakdown structure and supply, meaning bulls must push cleanly above $130.90 to open continuation toward $148. A rejection here increases the probability of a pullback toward $118.50; losing that level would re-expose $104.64 and potentially $92.22, which remains the broader macro floor. The MACD has crossed upward, and the histogram flipped positive, indicating momentum has shifted bullish, but structurally, the daily trend remains fragile unless $148 is reclaimed to invalidate the lower-high sequence. Aave 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour timeframe, AAVE is in a clear short-term uptrend, printing higher highs and higher lows while holding above the Alligator averages clustered between $116.62 and $122.30. The price at $129.83 is above this moving average base, confirming bullish control. AAVEUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI sits at 75.94, firmly in overbought territory, reflecting strong momentum but increasing the likelihood of short-term cooling. The rally from approximately $106 to $130 represents about a 22% expansion, so consolidation between $124 and $130 would be technically healthy. As long as $122–$118 holds on retracements, the bullish structure remains intact; a break below $116 would weaken the continuation setup. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $132.99 SELL SMA 5 $120.38 BUY SMA 10 $114.22 BUY SMA 21 $130.86 SELL SMA 50 $149.13 SELL SMA 100 $168.15 SELL SMA 200 $218.54 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $133.66 SELL EMA 5 $142.98 SELL EMA 10 $151.30 SELL EMA 21 $158.15 SELL EMA 50 $172.42 SELL EMA 100 $195.34 SELL EMA 200 $217.69 SELL AAVE price analysis conclusion Momentum has flipped bullish short term, but AAVE is testing a decisive resistance band at $130–$138. A confirmed breakout above $138–$148 would signal a broader reversal, while rejection likely results in consolidation or a pullback toward $118–$120. Is AAVE a good investment? Aave provides the essential infrastructure for lending and borrowing within DeFi, expanding beyond traditional applications into gaming, NFTs, and dApps. AAVE token plays a vital role in powering the platform, making it a strong choice for investors due to its proven market success and continuous development. Where to buy AAVE?

In late 2025, the Fe d su ggested customized “payment accounts” at the request of Fed Governor Christopher Waller. By allowing qualified non-bank companies to process payments directly through government platforms like FedNow and Fedwire, these streamlined accounts would do away with the need for full banking licenses. Banks push back against proposed rules Under the proposal, companies would face several limits designed to protect the financial system. Account holders could not earn interest, have no access to emergency lending facilities, and must keep overnight balances below either $500 million or 10 percent of their total assets, whichever is smaller. The Fed asked for public input on the plan in December 2025, sparking a heated debate between banking groups and technology companies. In February 2026, major banks retaliated by requiring a 12-month waiting time before they would accept any new applicants. In a joint letter, the Financial Services Forum, the Bank Policy Institute, and the Clearing House Association called for a risk to the financial system. They are concerned that granting payment access to less-regulated businesses may expose the whole financial system to new vulnerabilities, particularly for cryptocurrency companies that issue dollar-backed digital tokens. Governor Waller has pointed out the stark divide between internet businesses favoring less regulation and banks calling for stricter guidelines. He describes the new framework as a compromise approach and intends to complete it by the end of 2026 in spite of the opposition. Coinbase leads support for direct access Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, has become a vocal supporter of the plan, arguing that direct Fed access is essential for updating America’s payment infrastructure. The exchange said direct Fed access would let crypto and fintech firms tap into the backbone of the global financial system without needing full bank licenses. Right now, most digital asset companies must work through partner banks, adding costs, delays, and extra risks to their operations. “By reducing reliance upon FDIC-insured partner banks as intermediaries for core payment functions, the Payment Account would allow account-holding institutions to offer safe and efficient services to U.S. consumers and businesses and, at the same time, reduce costs and ensure the ability of emerging payment providers to scale with growing demand,” Coinbase wrote. Faryar Shirzad , se nior policy officer at Coinbase, mentioned similar efforts now in progress in the UK, Brazil, India, and the EU. By boosting competition, reducing settlement risks, and enhancing payment efficiency, these technologies have assisted those countries in maintaining their competitiveness in the global financial system. But the Fed’s current plan was also challenged by Coinbase as being overly restricted. The exchange warned that the requirements may render the accounts unusable for large-scale activities, so rendering the framework possibly “dead on arrival.” The exchange specifically criticized low overnight balance limitations and the prohibition on generating interest. According to Coinbase, processing payments mostly entails operational risks, not credit or market risks, which need capital buffers based on firm size. Coinbase also asked regulators to allow “omnibus” customer accounts, which would let firms combine user funds for more efficient settlement processes. Coinbase’s advocacy drew the attention of financial markets. Following the release of its letter and impressive quarterly financial results, the company’s shares surged by 15%. For cryptocurrency platforms, investors see the possibility of large cost reductions and improved growth prospects. Despite concerns about money laundering and other illicit activities, industry analysts predict that direct Fed access may reduce transaction costs for digital asset services by 20 to 30 percent. The Fed’s comment period closed on February 6, 2026. The final verdict will shape US payment systems as regulators balance financial stability and innovation.

The mission, known as “Operation Resolve,” took place in early January 2026 and resulted in the arrest of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, in the heart of Caracas. According to The Wall Street Journal and Fox News, Claude was integrated into the mission through Anthropic’s partnership with the data analytics firm Palantir Technologies . The U.S. Department of War, led by Secretary Pete Hegseth, has increasingly used commercial AI models to modernize its combat operations . Details on what specific tasks Claude performed are classified, but the AI is known to be used for summarizing massive amounts of intelligence data, analyzing satellite imagery, and possibly providing decision support for complex troop movements. The raid occurred in the early hours of January 3, 2026, when U.S. Special Operations Forces, including Delta Force commandos, successfully breached Maduro’s fortified palace. President Donald Trump later described that Maduro was “bum-rushed” before he could reach a steel-reinforced safe room. Venezuelan air defenses were suppressed, and several military sites were bombed during the mission. Maduro was transported to a U.S. warship and then to New York City, where he currently faces federal charges of narco-terrorism and cocaine importation. Did the operation violate Anthropic’s anti-violence rules? Claude is designed with a constitutional focus on safety, so how was it used in a lethal military operation? Anthropic’s public usage guidelines prohibit Claude from being used for violence, weapon development, or surveillance. Anthropic has stated that it monitors all usage of its tools and ensures they comply with its policies. However, the partnership with Palantir allows the military to use Claude in classified environments. Sources familiar with the matter suggest that the AI may have been used for non-lethal support tasks, such as translating communications or processing logistics. Nevertheless, the Department of War is currently pushing for AI companies to remove many of their standard restrictions for military use. Reports indicate that the Trump administration is considering canceling a $200 million contract with Anthropic because the company has raised concerns about its AI being used for autonomous drones or surveillance. Secretary Pete Hegseth has stated that “the future of American warfare is spelled AI” and has made it clear that the Pentagon will not work with companies that limit military capabilities.

With $57 now acting as the immediate barrier, a decisive breakout and sustained hold above this zone could open the door for the next leg higher, potentially accelerating upside toward the mid-$60s. Bullish Daily Close Signals Early Strength Providing a daily technical outlook on Litecoin, crypto analyst CryptoWzrd noted that LTC closed the session with a bullish daily candle, largely mirroring Bitcoin’s upward movement. The positive close signals improving short-term momentum, but the expert cautioned that broader continuation will require confirmation from additional market factors, particularly the LTCBTC pair. Related Reading: Litecoin Structure Intact, But $63 Remains The Line Bulls Must Defend Although Litecoin printed a constructive candle, LTCBTC closed indecisively, reflecting hesitation in Litecoin’s relative strength against Bitcoin. Sustained upside for LTC will likely depend on a shift toward clear bullish sentiment in LTCBTC, as that would confirm capital rotation and stronger underlying demand. From a structural perspective, CrytoWzrd emphasized that one more strong bullish daily candle from the current level is needed to validate a breakout above the daily lower-high trendline. If such confirmation occurs, Litecoin could transition into a more established bullish phase, with the $68 resistance level emerging as the next key upside target above the $56 zone. A stable and sustained move beyond resistance would further strengthen the case for trend continuation. Until that higher-timeframe breakout is confirmed, the analyst plans to focus on lower-timeframe setups, particularly over the weekend. His approach remains tactical, looking for quick scalp opportunities while waiting for a more mature chart structure before engaging in larger directional trades. $57: Litecoin Intraday Decision Zone The analyst went on to explain that Litecoin’s intraday structure is currently pressing against the key $57 resistance zone, a level that now acts as a short-term decision point for price. A clean and sustained hold above this area would signal strength and open the path toward $64, with the potential for further extension if momentum accelerates. Related Reading: Litecoin 2M Bollinger Band Width Hits New Lows, CMT-Certified Analyst Reveals What It Means He emphasized that simply wicking above resistance will not be enough. What’s needed is a stable bullish structure, ideally supported by rising volume and constructive follow-through, before considering a long position. Such confirmation would indicate that buyers are in control rather than the move being a temporary liquidity sweep. At the same time, he noted that Bitcoin’s direction will likely dictate whether this breakout gains traction. Litecoin continues to follow broader market sentiment, meaning BTC’s strength could act as a catalyst for further gains. Until a mature and well-defined intraday structure forms, patience remains essential before engaging the next trade.

While no official statements have been released, the idea that leaders from the world’s dominant interbank messaging network and one of blockchain’s most established payments firms may have met discreetly has captured the market’s attention. Could Institutional Adoption Of XRP Be Accelerating? Reports suggest that executives from SWIFT and Ripple may have held a private lunch in Miami, reigniting speculation that SWIFT could be preparing to move forward with XRP. An analyst known as Skipper noted on X that the discussion gains additional context from comments last year by Brad Garlinghouse, who stated that the XRP Ledger could capture roughly 14% of the transaction volume currently processed by SWIFT within five years. Tokenization is no longer a dream; it is becoming a new reality. The ability to unlock and move trillions of dollars in real-world assets onto blockchain rails is accelerating. At the same time, RealFi is reportedly finalizing an agreement with a global Tier-2 exchange processing roughly $580 billion in annual volume to list the REAL Token, signaling that institutional-scale markets are preparing to migrate onto XRPL-based rails. The next wave of blockchain innovation is quietly taking shape in Sydney. According to Wave Of Innovation on X, on February 28 and March 1, serious builders will converge for a 24-hour sprint at XRP Australia 2026, an event designed for real construction, not surface-level experimentation. Participants will have direct access to work with core protocol developers and architects, enabling deep technical guidance, real-time problem-solving, and the opportunity to build alongside those actively shaping the XRPL stack. The objective is to deliver working functional MVPs that can live beyond the event. Builders are encouraged to develop across a wide range of verticals, including RLUSD-powered applications, DeFi protocols, developer tooling, infrastructure , and real-world utility use cases, all natively on the Ledger. Beyond the prize pool, the sprint represents a gateway to the ecosystem. Exceptional teams may be considered for future XRPL funding programs, making this a potential launchpad for builders who are seriously focused on adoption. How The Altcoin Is Preparing For The Next Directional Move A bullish scenario is beginning to take shape for the token. Crypto investor and trader Xaif Crypto has highlighted that a breakout in the volume Z-Score above +2 could ignite the next expansion. Currently, Binance volume Z-Score is hovering near zero, indicating a state of pure equilibrium. However, with the price trading around $1.37 and volume closely aligned with its 30-day average, the data is signaling consolidation rather than exhaustion. Historically, the altcoin’s most powerful moves have followed sharp volume Z-Score expansions. These calm phases often precede strong directional moves.",XRP|binance|real|ripple|RLUSD|Skipper|SWIFT|Wave Of Innovation|Xaif Crypto|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL Ecosystem|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-02-14 21:00:55

His current stance slightly differs from what it was last year, when he claimed it was “healthier” to participate in them than regular markets. In his post , Buterin expressed concern about the state of prediction markets in their current form. He admitted they had achieved a certain level of success, but that they also “seem to be over-converging to an unhealthy product market fit. Buterin claims this is happening because they embrace short-term cryptocurrency price bets, sports betting, and other similar things that have dopamine value without any kind of long-term fulfillment or societal information value. “My guess is that teams feel motivated to capitulate to these things because they bring in large revenue during a bear market where people are desperate – an understandable motive, but one that leads to corposlop,” Buterin wrote. Buterin’s warning about prediction markets Buterin believes the space would be better off pushed into a totally different use case: “hedging, in a very generalized sense,” he wrote. As far as he is concerned, the dopamine-driven bets that seem to be taking center stage now are an unhealthy product-market fit. He believes these bets now dominate substantive uses, putting the space at risk of being captured by uninformed speculation rather than genuine information aggregation. In the future, he advocates steering prediction markets towards risk hedging applications, for example, tools that can help reduce real-world risks to assets or expenditures. He had a different opinion last December While Vitalik Buterin’s thoughts on prediction markets have not changed radically, they are a bit different from how he felt about them as of December last year. At the time, he was clearly positive and defensive about them. In fact, just before Christmas, Cryptopolitan reported that the Ethereum co-founder claimed on Farcaster that prediction markets are “healthier to participate in than regular markets.” After all, he claimed they’re bounded between 0-1, reducing pump-and-dump risks. He also co-trusted them favorably with social media, positioning them as better tools for truth-seeking and measuring uncertainty with economic accountability. He continued to defend them in December, even in the face of critics concerned about risks to sports and election integrity, arguing a similar level of manipulation already exists in stock markets. What changed? Buterin’s stance on prediction markets has been altered due to various potential reasons. One is the direction of the sector’s evolution. While platforms like Polymarket have exploded in volume, much of that growth comes from gambling-related, short-horizon bets rather than deeper uses like hedging. This has become more apparent with the current bearish conditions pushing platforms towards shipping more addictive high-frequency features for retention. Buterin has not given up on prediction markets yet, and his recent post is proof that he still sees massive potential in them. He hopes platforms push towards more generalized hedging use cases, as it would be better to rescue them from the present rut than scrap the concept entirely. Polymarket’s 15-minute markets part of the problem Talk about how platforms are leaning towards ultra-short-term markets comes weeks after Polymarket, a popular prediction market platform, launched its 15-minute crypto prediction markets in January. Source: @Kunallegendd via X/Twitter 15-minute Up or Down market contracts have reportedly gone from 5% of crypto volume to roughly 60% in early 2026, while hourly markets account for 20%. According to an X article by Kunal Doshi, a researcher with Blockworks, these short-duration contracts are a core driver in crypto volume. However, the data has shown that those markets are dominated by systematic traders rather than directional bettors. These traders are not interested in the prices and are more focused on arbitrage opportunities. They reportedly contribute up to 70% of the 15-minute market’s volumes. As these markets increasingly become the powerhouse of crypto prediction markets, Buterin is calling for a reorientation, convinced that this is not a tangent that prediction markets need to focus on.

This substantial creation of the world’s second-largest stablecoin immediately captured analyst attention, sparking discussions about liquidity flows and potential strategic deployments within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service, first reported the transaction, highlighting its scale against typical daily minting activity. USDC Minted: Decoding the Treasury’s Massive Transaction The act of minting 250 million USDC represents a direct expansion of the stablecoin’s circulating supply. Consequently, Circle, the principal entity behind USDC, initiates this process by depositing an equivalent amount of U.S. dollar reserves. These reserves then receive verification from regulated financial institutions. Following this verification, the corresponding digital tokens are created on the blockchain. This mechanism ensures that every USDC token remains fully backed by liquid cash and cash equivalents. Therefore, such a sizable mint often precedes anticipated demand from institutional clients, cryptocurrency exchanges, or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Historically, large-scale mints correlate with strategic movements. For instance, exchanges frequently request bulk stablecoin minting to replenish liquidity pools ahead of major trading volumes. Similarly, institutional investors might secure large USDC positions to execute sizable trades without causing excessive market slippage. This recent 250 million mint follows a pattern observed in previous bull and bear market cycles, where treasury activity signals shifting capital allocation. Stablecoin Creation and Its Role in Crypto Liquidity Stablecoins like USDC serve as the essential lifeblood of the cryptocurrency economy. They provide a stable medium of exchange and a store of value, bridging traditional finance with digital asset markets. The process of creating these digital dollars directly influences market liquidity and trading dynamics. When the treasury mints new tokens, it essentially injects digital dollar liquidity into the ecosystem. This liquidity then facilitates smoother trading, lending, and borrowing activities across countless platforms. Expert Analysis on Treasury Movements Market analysts consistently monitor treasury minting and burning events for clues about broader trends. “Large mints are not random; they are demand signals,” notes a report from blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock. The firm’s data indicates that previous mints of similar scale, particularly those exceeding 100 million USDC, have often preceded periods of increased trading volume or capital rotation into other digital assets. Furthermore, the transparency of the Ethereum blockchain allows anyone to verify the transaction and track the initial movement of these new funds. The table below contrasts recent notable USDC minting events for context: Date Amount Minted Notable Market Context March 21, 2025 250 million USDC Reported by Whale Alert; context under analysis. January 15, 2025 180 million USDC Preceded a weekly options expiry on major exchanges. November 30, 2024 300 million USDC Coordinated with a large institutional onboarding announcement. Key reasons for substantial stablecoin creation include: Exchange Liquidity Provision: Major trading platforms require deep stablecoin pools to handle user deposits and withdrawals efficiently. Institutional Entry: Traditional finance entities often convert fiat to USDC as their first on-chain transaction. DeFi Protocol Funding: New or expanding decentralized finance applications may secure large stablecoin allocations for their treasuries or liquidity mining programs. Market Making: Professional market makers need stablecoin inventory to facilitate trades across multiple asset pairs. Broader Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market The injection of 250 million new USDC units carries several potential implications for market structure. Firstly, it increases the total supply of readily deployable capital within the crypto space. This capital can reduce volatility by providing more counter-party liquidity for large trades. Secondly, it reflects confidence from regulated entities like Circle in the underlying demand for digital dollar tokens. Importantly, the mint does not directly cause inflation in the traditional sense, as each token is reserve-backed. However, it does expand the digital representation of those reserves on-chain. Market participants will now closely watch the subsequent flow of these funds. Tracking the initial receiving address and its subsequent transactions can reveal the mint’s ultimate purpose. Often, funds move to an intermediary address before distribution to end destinations like exchange hot wallets or smart contracts. This movement pattern provides tangible evidence of where new liquidity enters the trading ecosystem. Evidence-Based Market Impact Historical data provides a framework for understanding potential outcomes. Analysis from CoinMetrics shows that in 2023 and 2024, over 70% of USDC mints larger than 200 million were followed by a measurable increase in total stablecoin trading volume across top exchanges within a 7-day period. This trend suggests that new supply typically meets immediate utility. Furthermore, the stability of USDC’s peg to the U.S. dollar during and after such events demonstrates the robustness of its reserve-backed model, even under significant supply changes. Conclusion The event of 250 million USDC minted by the official treasury is a significant data point in the cryptocurrency market. It underscores the growing infrastructure and demand within the digital asset space. While the immediate purpose of this specific liquidity injection will unfold on the public blockchain, its occurrence highlights the critical role stablecoins play in facilitating modern finance. This transaction reinforces the importance of transparent, reserve-backed assets like USDC in providing the liquidity necessary for a mature and functioning market. Observers will continue to monitor the flow of these funds for deeper insights into institutional and market-maker strategies. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when USDC is “minted”? Minting USDC is the process of creating new tokens. Circle deposits U.S. dollar reserves with regulated banks, and after verification, an equivalent amount of USDC tokens are issued on the blockchain, increasing the circulating supply. Q2: Who reported the 250 million USDC mint? The blockchain tracking and analytics service Whale Alert reported the transaction. This service monitors large transactions across multiple blockchains and publicly reports them. Q3: Does minting new USDC cause inflation? No, it does not cause monetary inflation. Each newly minted USDC is backed 1:1 by U.S. dollar reserves or cash equivalents held in regulated financial institutions. The mint expands the digital supply but not the underlying reserve base. Q4: Why would the USDC Treasury mint such a large amount? Large mints typically signal anticipated demand from major market participants. Common reasons include replenishing exchange liquidity, fulfilling requests from institutional clients, funding DeFi protocols, or providing inventory for market makers. Q5: How can I track where these newly minted USDC go? You can use a blockchain explorer like Etherscan. By searching for the transaction hash reported by Whale Alert, you can see the receiving address and then monitor its subsequent transactions to trace the fund flow.

Cathie Wood spoke with Anthony Pompliano at Bitcoin Investor Week to discuss a myriad of different economic topics. The focal point of their conversation, however, was centered around what she believes is a massive incoming economic disruption that will be caused by technological advancements. Wood believes that traditional financial systems are woefully underprepared for what she called a “productivity shock” that will be brought about by advancements in AI and other technology. These technological breakthroughs will boost output and, in turn, slash costs for businesses, leading to lower prices for consumers. While this may sound good, Wood stated that this productivity shock will create deflationary chaos, as rapid price drops will upend traditional business models. Her solution to this problem is none other than Bitcoin (BTC) . Wood believes it is a hedge against inflation and deflation due to its decentralized nature and fixed supply. This, among other variables, allows it to be shielded from the fragility of traditional financial structures. Why rapid deflation driven by AI productivity gains is bad for the economy In this current era of inflation and price increases, the idea of deflation may sound like a good thing at first. After all, the idea of lower prices in today’s world, where things only seem to be getting progressively more expensive, sounds very beneficial to the average consumer. However, when deflation occurs at a rapid rate, which Wood suggests will happen due to productivity gains from artificial intelligence, it creates a problem for a debt-heavy economy like the United States. The issue is that debt is fixed in nominal dollars. This means that, however much money one owes on their credit card balance, mortgage, or other loans, it does not adjust for inflation or deflation. This also applies to business and government (i.e., U.S. national debt ), since both exist in the same U.S. financial system. When deflation occurs, asset prices fall, salary amounts typically decrease, and business and government revenue decline. This makes it much harder for businesses, governments, and individuals to pay back their debt. For this reason, rapid, unforeseen productivity-driven deflation from AI advancements can destabilize the economy, especially in current circumstances where debt and leverage are high. Various factors like spending cutbacks, layoffs, and defaults can ensue as a result of rapid deflation, leading to economic chaos. Bitcoin as the solution to a rapid deflationary environment Wood argues that Bitcoin is uniquely positioned for this AI-driven deflationary crisis she forecasts. For starters, Bitcoin is decentralized, meaning it is a non-sovereign asset that exists outside of traditional financial systems. It also has a scarce, capped supply. This means that, unlike fiat currencies, it can’t be printed infinitely. The issue with printing more money to solve deflationary conditions is that it’s essentially putting a bandaid on the issue. It can relieve tensions temporarily, but it is not a sustainable solution as it creates additional issues like central bank dependency, along with policy and credit risks. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is not controlled by any central entity. This means it is hypothetically protected from economic policy changes in response to deflationary chaos. It also has a mathematically capped supply, which cannot be infinitely expanded to manage short-term currency instability at the cost of long-term stability. The real point that Wood is trying to make is not that Bitcoin should be used by the government, central banks, or corporations to directly fight deflation. Instead, she believes it can be used as a hedge against it to protect capital from the economic instability that will arise from rapid deflationary conditions AI productivity gains may cause.

The sentence follows Paxful’s admission that it conspired to promote illegal prostitution, violated the Bank Secrecy Act, and knowingly transmitted funds derived from criminal activity. Illicit Crypto Flows The penalty was determined based on the company’s ability to pay. Federal authorities said Paxful profited from facilitating transactions for criminals while promoting its lack of anti-money laundering (AML) controls and failing to comply with applicable money laundering laws, despite knowing that users on its platform were engaged in crimes including fraud, extortion, prostitution, commercial sex trafficking, romance scams, and human trafficking. Court documents revealed that Paxful operated an online virtual currency platform and money transmitting business where users traded cryptocurrency for cash, prepaid cards, gift cards, and other items. From January 1, 2017, to September 2, 2019, Paxful facilitated more than 26.7 million trades worth nearly $3 billion in total value and generated more than $29.7 million in revenue. Authorities said Paxful knew that a portion of these transactions involved funds derived from criminal offenses, including fraud schemes and illegal prostitution. The company also deliberately transferred virtual currency on behalf of Backpage, an online advertising platform that later admitted in criminal proceedings that it advertised and profited from illegal prostitution, including content involving minors. According to the Justice Department, Paxful’s founders referred internally to the “Backpage Effect,” which they credited with helping the platform grow. Between December 2015 and December 2022, Paxful’s dealings with Backpage and a similar website resulted in nearly $17 million worth of Bitcoin being transferred from Paxful wallets to those sites. From this, Paxful earned at least $2.7 million in profits. The plea agreement states that from July 2015 to June 2019, Paxful marketed itself as a platform that did not require know-your-customer (KYC) information. It not only allowed users to trade without collecting sufficient KYC data but also provided third parties with AML policies that were not implemented or enforced, and failed to file suspicious activity reports despite clear indicators of criminal conduct. DOJ Cuts Penalty Paxful pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the Travel Act by promoting illegal prostitution through interstate commerce, conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, and conspiring to violate the Bank Secrecy Act’s AML requirements. Although the parties agreed that the appropriate criminal penalty was $112.5 million, the department concluded Paxful could only pay $4 million as part of the resolution. Paxful’s guilty plea was part of a coordinated resolution with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and in July 2024, the company’s co-founder and former CTO, Artur Schaback, also pleaded guilty to related AML violations.

According to multiple former employees who spoke with The Verge, Musk is actively working to make the Grok chatbot “more unhinged,” viewing traditional safety measures as a form of censorship. This development follows SpaceX’s acquisition of xAI and comes amid global scrutiny after Grok reportedly facilitated the creation of over one million sexualized images, including deepfakes of real women and minors. xAI Safety Concerns Trigger Major Employee Departures This week witnessed at least 11 engineers and two co-founders announcing their departure from xAI. While some cited entrepreneurial ambitions and Musk suggested organizational restructuring, two sources revealed deeper concerns. These individuals, including one who left before the current wave, described growing disillusionment with the company’s safety priorities. Consequently, one source bluntly stated, “Safety is a dead org at xAI.” The other source claimed Musk deliberately seeks a more unrestrained model, equating safety with unwanted censorship. This internal conflict highlights a fundamental philosophical rift within one of the world’s most watched AI companies. The Grok Controversy and Global Scrutiny The employee concerns emerge against a backdrop of serious real-world incidents involving Grok. Recently, the chatbot’s capabilities were exploited to generate a massive volume of non-consensual intimate imagery. This event triggered investigations by regulatory bodies in multiple jurisdictions and sparked intense debate among AI ethicists. Dr. Anya Sharma, a leading AI safety researcher at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI, commented on the situation. “When foundational models lack robust safety guardrails, they become powerful tools for amplification harm,” she explained. “The scale mentioned—over one million images—demonstrates not just theoretical risk but active, widespread misuse.” Competitive Pressure and Strategic Direction Beyond safety, departing employees reportedly expressed frustration with xAI’s strategic direction. One source felt the company remained “stuck in the catch-up phase” compared to rivals like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind. This sentiment suggests internal pressure to accelerate development, potentially at the expense of thorough safety testing. The AI competitive landscape has intensified dramatically since 2023, with companies racing to deploy increasingly capable models. This race often creates tension between rapid innovation and responsible development, a balance xAI appears to be publicly navigating. Historical Context of AI Safety Debates The current situation at xAI reflects a long-standing tension in the tech industry between libertarian-leaning innovation and precautionary governance. Musk himself has publicly voiced concerns about existential AI risk, yet his operational approach at xAI suggests a different priority on proximate, measurable harms. This dichotomy is not new. Similar debates surrounded social media platform governance, where free speech ideals often clashed with content moderation needs. The AI industry now faces a more complex version of this challenge, as the systems themselves can generate harmful content autonomously. Key phases in recent AI safety development include: 2023-2024: Voluntary safety commitments from major AI labs following White House and global summits. 2025: The first binding EU AI Act provisions taking effect, classifying certain AI applications as “high-risk.” 2026 (Present): Increased enforcement actions and the rise of “red-teaming” as a standard industry practice. Comparing AI Safety Approaches (2026) Company Public Safety Stance Key Mechanisms Recent Challenges OpenAI Precautionary, layered safety Constitutional AI, external audits Balance between capability and control Anthropic Safety-first via Constitutional AI Transparency reports, harm monitoring Slower deployment schedule xAI (Reported) Minimalist, anti-censorship Post-deployment monitoring (alleged) Misuse for deepfakes, employee attrition Industry Impact and Regulatory Implications The revelations about xAI arrive at a critical regulatory moment. Legislators in the United States and European Union are crafting comprehensive AI governance frameworks. Incidents involving high-profile models like Grok often serve as catalysts for stricter legislation. “High-profile safety failures provide concrete examples that shape policy,” noted Michael Chen, a technology policy analyst. “When a model from a major figure like Musk is implicated in harm, it undermines arguments for purely self-regulatory approaches.” Consequently, the industry faces potential new compliance requirements for model testing, output filtering, and incident reporting. The Human Element: Talent Migration in AI The departure of safety-conscious engineers from xAI represents a significant talent redistribution within the AI ecosystem. Historically, specialized AI safety researchers are a scarce resource. Their movement from one company to another—or to academia and nonprofits—directly influences the safety posture of the entire field. This talent flow often signals underlying values conflicts, as seen in earlier departures from other tech giants over ethical concerns. The xAI exodus may therefore strengthen safety teams at competing firms or accelerate the growth of independent AI safety institutes. Conclusion The reported xAI safety concerns underscore a pivotal moment for artificial intelligence governance. The alleged push for a less restrained Grok chatbot, coupled with significant employee departures, reveals fundamental tensions between innovation velocity and responsible development. As the industry matures, the balance between creating powerful AI tools and implementing robust safeguards will define public trust and regulatory landscapes. The situation at xAI serves as a potent case study, demonstrating that internal culture and leadership priorities are as critical as technical specifications in determining an AI model’s real-world impact. FAQs Q1: What exactly are the safety concerns at xAI? Former employees report that safety protocols are being deprioritized, with leadership allegedly seeking to make the Grok AI “more unhinged.” This follows incidents where Grok was used to generate harmful deepfake content. Q2: How many people have left xAI recently? At least 11 engineers and two co-founders announced departures this week. Sources indicate that concerns over safety and strategic direction contributed to this exodus. Q3: What did Elon Musk say about these departures? Musk suggested the departures were part of an effort to organize xAI more effectively. He has not publicly addressed the specific safety allegations made by former employees. Q4: What was the Grok chatbot used for that caused scrutiny? Grok was reportedly used to create over one million sexualized images, including non-consensual deepfakes of real women and minors, leading to global regulatory and ethical scrutiny. Q5: How does this affect the broader AI industry? The situation intensifies debates about AI ethics, influences upcoming regulations, and may lead to talent migration toward companies with stronger safety commitments, potentially reshaping competitive dynamics.

Narratives create momentum. In the digital asset space, attention often flows toward tokens that capture imagination rather than simply offering technical upgrades for million dollar narrative coins . From Apecoin, Pudgy Penguins, Floki, Dogwifhat, Spx6900, Fartcoin, Baby Doge Coin, Brett, Official Trump and BullZilla to Apeing, the diversity of meme-driven ecosystems has never looked more dynamic. Each project carries its own identity, community energy, and speculative appeal. Among these evolving narratives, APEMARS has steadily built a presence that feels less like noise and more like structured momentum. Rather than leaning on hype cycles alone, the project’s messaging, branding, and ecosystem design present a calculated approach. The growing visibility of $APRZ reflects that shift. 1. APEMARS – The Million Dollar Narrative Coin Accelerating Fast APEMARS is not simply another meme-themed token competing for attention. It positions itself directly within the million dollar narrative coin category by blending scarcity mechanics, incentive structures, and community expansion strategies. The presale stage is officially live, and participation continues to surge as allocation windows tighten. The project currently operates in Stage 8 (ZERO NAP) with a token price of 0.00006651. The projected listing price of 0.0055 represents an estimated ROI of 8,169% from this stage alone. The holder count has already crossed 960, tokens sold exceed 11B, and the raise has surpassed 200k. These metrics matter because presale stages do not wait. If allocations sell out early, the system automatically advances, immediately adjusting pricing dynamics. Beyond pricing mechanics, APEMARS reinforces engagement through carefully structured token burns and referral rewards. Burn events progressively reduce supply pressure, strengthening scarcity narratives while reinforcing long-term positioning. Referral incentives encourage organic network expansion, allowing participants to unlock bonus allocations without introducing complex barriers. This combination supports the broader million dollar narrative coin framework while aligning directly with the utility logic behind $APRZ. Commit Once, Capture Structure: $4,100 Ahead of Market Repricing Stage 7 offers something rarely found in open trading environments: clarity before turbulence. A $4,100 position aligns with a projected listing value near $339,929 under the 8,169% ROI scenario. Early participation eliminates the noise of constant market monitoring and emotional decision cycles. Rather than reacting to volatility later, investors anchor their exposure while conditions remain rational. This phase prioritizes disciplined execution over speculative timing. Capital positioned early benefits from structural growth mechanics still operating efficiently. How to Buy APEMARS Joining APEMARS follows a streamlined process designed for simplicity and speed. Users begin by connecting a compatible wallet through the official platform interface. Once connected, participants select their preferred cryptocurrency for the transaction. 2. ApeCoin – Brand Driven Momentum ApeCoin continues to benefit from strong brand recognition and ecosystem visibility. Its association with established NFT culture and community identity keeps engagement levels consistent. Market participants often view it as a gateway asset connecting meme culture with broader digital asset narratives. Despite periodic volatility, ApeCoin retains attention due to its integrated ecosystem positioning. Traders frequently monitor pullbacks for tactical entries, particularly during market consolidation phases. Narrative stability remains its strongest advantage. 3. BullZilla – High ROI Presale Opportunity BullZilla is capturing massive attention as one of the fastest-moving meme coin presales of 2026. With the project currently in Stage 21, only three stages remain before listing, meaning early participants can secure extraordinary upside. Investors entering now could see over 800% ROI in less than one month, making this stage an unmissable opportunity for those seeking high growth in a short timeframe. The community engagement is skyrocketing, and every stage sells out rapidly, creating immense FOMO. BullZilla’s ecosystem isn’t just about quick profits. The token’s design focuses on sustainability, community rewards, and strategic partnerships that reinforce its momentum. Early participants can benefit from referral incentives and strong liquidity visibility. 4. Apeing – Rapid Presale Momentum Apeing is emerging as a high-potential meme coin with strong community-driven growth and sales momentum. Its presale is moving fast, attracting early participants eager to secure the lowest possible entry price. Social buzz around Apeing continues to build, and as allocations sell out, price increases begin automatically, creating instant FOMO for anyone delaying participation. Timing here is critical because the early-stage pricing offers the best ROI opportunities. With the combination of low entry pricing, active social engagement, and scarcity-driven dynamics, Apeing presents a compelling opportunity for traders seeking fast-moving meme coin presales in 2026. 5. Pudgy Penguins – Community Powered Identity Pudgy Penguins demonstrates how community alignment can sustain token relevance. The project’s visual identity and cultural resonance reinforce loyalty, helping maintain visibility even during slower market cycles. Engagement strategies emphasize inclusivity and brand familiarity. Speculative interest often resurfaces when ecosystem developments or partnerships emerge. This cyclical attention pattern makes Pudgy Penguins attractive for traders seeking sentiment-driven opportunities rather than purely technical catalysts. 6. Floki – Utility Focused Expansion Floki differentiates itself through utility-oriented messaging layered onto meme foundations. Educational platforms, ecosystem tools, and community incentives support its narrative evolution. This hybrid identity appeals to both speculative and utility-focused audiences. Market participants frequently highlight Floki’s expansion efforts as a stabilizing factor. During uncertain conditions, assets with visible development pathways often attract renewed consideration from cautious traders. 7. Dogwifhat – Cultural Virality Engine Dogwifhat thrives on viral energy and meme adaptability. Its rapid visibility growth illustrates how humor-centric tokens can capture widespread engagement. Community amplification mechanisms remain central to its momentum. Short-term traders often favor Dogwifhat during sentiment-heavy cycles. The token’s strength lies in its ability to generate attention spikes that translate into sharp liquidity movements. 8. SPX6900 – Narrative Speculation Play SPX6900 occupies a distinctive niche within meme-driven speculation. Its identity leverages humor, irony, and market symbolism, creating a narrative framework that resonates with digitally native communities. Volatility remains a defining characteristic. Opportunistic traders typically approach SPX6900 with tactical strategies, emphasizing timing precision and sentiment monitoring over long-term holding assumptions. 9. Fartcoin – Attention Economics Experiment Fartcoin exemplifies the unpredictable nature of meme token dynamics. Its appeal centers on novelty, humor, and shock value, attracting bursts of attention that periodically reshape liquidity patterns. While unconventional, tokens driven by pure virality sometimes generate rapid engagement cycles. Traders willing to embrace narrative-centric assets often observe these movements closely. 10. Baby Doge Coin – Familiar Meme Continuity Baby Doge Coin benefits from lineage recognition and meme familiarity. According to the best crypto to buy now , its branding echoes earlier meme successes while cultivating its own community narrative. Accessibility remains a core attraction. Speculative interest frequently reappears when social momentum strengthens. For many participants, familiarity reduces psychological entry barriers, supporting recurring attention cycles. 11. Brett – Emerging Meme Recognition Brett represents the rise of newer meme identities competing for visibility. Early-stage narratives and community enthusiasm drive its positioning. Momentum often correlates with social amplification. Market watchers typically assess Brett through sentiment indicators and liquidity behavior. Emerging tokens can produce asymmetric moves when engagement accelerates unexpectedly. 12. Official Trump – Political Narrative Volatility Official Trump illustrates how political themes intersect with digital assets. Narrative intensity, media exposure, and cultural polarization shape its price dynamics. Attention fluctuations remain pronounced. Traders frequently treat politically themed tokens as high-volatility instruments. Sentiment shifts and news cycles often dictate short-term movements more than traditional metrics. Final Words – Narrative Strength Meets Strategic Positioning The meme token ecosystem continues expanding, with projects like Apecoin, Pudgy Penguins, Floki, Dogwifhat, Spx6900, Fartcoin, Baby Doge Coin, Brett, Official Trump, BullZilla, Apeing each reflecting different engagement models. Narratives evolve quickly, and attention rotates constantly. Within this landscape, APEMARS distinguishes itself through structured scarcity mechanics, stage-based pricing logic, and ecosystem incentives designed for momentum continuity. The alignment between narrative appeal and strategic design reinforces its identity as a million dollar narrative coin. As visibility around $APRZ grows, the project’s early-stage dynamics position it as one of the most compelling presale opportunities this year.

While Bitcoin is presently stabilizing around $68,000, the digital asset remains about 46% off its all-time high ($126,100) recorded in late 2025. Bull Or Bear? Decoding Bitcoin’s SSR Liquidity Signals In a QuickTake post on the CryptoQuant platform, a pseudonymous analyst, MorenoDV, explained how the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) acts as a liquidity signal for Bitcoin and why the current level around 9.5–9.6 is important. SSR measures Bitcoin’s market cap relative to stablecoin supply. In other words, it reflects how much “dry powder“ (buying power) exists in the market. High SSR shows that Bitcoin’s market cap is large relative to stablecoins – less sidelined buying power, while Low SSR indicates stablecoin supply relatively strong to Bitcoin — more potential buying power available. According to analyst MorenoDV, the SSR is not a straightforward bullish or bearish indicator; its significance depends on the direction of the market’s approach to the 9.5 level. When the SSR falls towards 9.5 from higher levels, it typically signals strengthening stablecoin liquidity, which has often led to Bitcoin finding support or reversing upward in past cycles. Conversely, if the SSR rises toward 9.5 from lower levels, it suggests fading liquidity, historically preceding local tops and short-term corrections. Analyst MorenoDV describes the 9.5 level as a liquidity equilibrium zone due to its ability to act as support or resistance based on the market approach. As the SSR navigates this critical zone, market traders will closely observe if stablecoin inflows are maintained at a constant level, or if there is an impending liquidity exhaustion, which would be indicated by a rejection at this equilibrium zone. Bitcoin Price Overview As of writing, Bitcoin’s price stands at ~$68,840, reflecting a 3.97% increase over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, its daily trading volume is down by 15.3% and valued at $37.33 billion. According to data from Coincodex, the Fear and Greed index stands at 9, indicating extreme levels of caution among investors. However, Coincodex analysts and investors will gradually adopt a more bullish stance, as their projections hint at a $73,769 target in five days and $77,687 in a month. Meanwhile, a three-month target of $72,480, suggest some levels retracement following the initial surge, in line with a classic ascending pattern.

The attack resulted in the loss of almost $500,000 worth of USDC market, drained in a single transaction. According to reports from Blockchain security platforms, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in the deflationary sellOCA() logic, giving them access to manipulate the pool’s reserves. The final amount the attacker got away with was reportedly approximately $422,000. The exploit involved the use of flash loans and flash swaps combined with repeated calls to OCA’s swapHelper function. This removed OCA tokens directly from the liquidity pool during swaps, artificially inflating the on-pair price of OCA and enabling the drainage of USDC How did the OCA/USDC exploit happen? The attack was reportedly executed via three transactions. The first to carry out the exploit, and the following two to serve as additional builder bribes. “In total, 43 BNB plus 69 BNB were paid to 48club-puissant-builder, leaving an estimated final profit of $340K,” Blocksec Phalcon wrote on X about the incident, adding that another transaction in the same block also failed at position 52, likely because it was frontrun by the attacker. Flash loans on PancakeSwap allow users to borrow significant amounts of crypto assets without collateral; however, the borrowed amount plus fees must be repaid within the same transaction block. They are primarily used in arbitrage and liquidation strategies on the Binance Smart Chain, and the loans are usually facilitated by PancakeSwap V3’s flash swap function. Another flash loan attack was detected weeks ago In December 2025, an exploit allowed an attacker to withdraw approximately 138.6 WBNB from the PancakeSwap liquidity pool for the DMi/WBNB pair, netting approximately $120,000. That attack demonstrated how a combination of flash loans and manipulation of the AMM pair’s internal reserves via sync() and callback functions is capable of being used to completely deplete the pool. The attacker first created the exploit contract and called the f0ded652() function, a specialized entry point into the contract, after which the contract then calls flashLoan from the Moolah protocol, requesting approximately 102,693 WBNB. Upon receiving the flash loan, the contract initiates the onMoolahFlashLoan(…) callback. The first thing the callback does is find out the DMi token balance in the PancakeSwap pool in order to prepare for the pair’s reserve manipulation. It should be noted that the vulnerability is not in the flash loan, but in the PancakeSwap contract, allowing manipulation of reserves via a combination of flash swap and sync() without protection against malicious callbacks.

Only 12 of xAI’s original cofounders remain employed at the company after several of them left for various reasons, including to start their own companies and complaints of creative stagnation. Is xAI sacrificing safety to compete with OpenAI? One source who spoke to The Verge claimed that xAI’s safety team has been effectively dissolved, saying “Safety is a dead org at xAI.” According to reports, there’s been a push for “unfiltered” content, leading to a focus on NSFW (Not Safe For Work) capabilities for the Grok AI . Former staffers allege that Musk views safety measures as a form of “censorship.” They claim that engineers are encouraged to “push to production” immediately, sometimes bypassing traditional testing phases. This culture has reportedly led to internal friction between leadership, causing them to clash often over product priorities in large group chats on the X platform. Musk argued on X that “everyone’s job is safety.” Using Tesla and SpaceX as examples, he said that neither company has a massive, independent safety department, yet they produce the safest cars and rockets in the world. To Musk, separate safety departments are often “fake” and exist only to “assuage the concerns of outsiders” without having any real power to improve the product. In Musk’s ongoing legal battle with OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, he has frequently criticized OpenAI for becoming a closed-source for-profit company that prioritizes profit over safety, but he is being accused of doing the same by removing the internal checks and balances that prevent AI from generating harmful or biased content. Frequent hiring at xAI Following the recent announcement of a merger between xAI and SpaceX that led to an internal valuation of approximately $1.25 trillion, the company has seen a wave of high-profile departures causing people to question the company’s internal culture, its technical direction, and its approach to AI safety. Former employees describe the company as a “dead” safety organization. Two of the company’s most prominent co-founders, Yuhuai (Tony) Wu and Jimmy Ba, recently announced they were leaving. Wu stated it was “time for his next chapter,” while Ba noted he needed to “recalibrate his gradient on the big picture.” Only half of the original 12 co-founders who launched xAI remain at the company. Several other engineers and staffers have also resigned, with many stating they intend to start their own AI firms. One group of former employees has already launched “Nuraline,” a startup focused on AI infrastructure. Some departing employees like Vahid Kazemi, suggested that the industry has become stagnant, writing on X that “all AI labs are building the exact same thing.” Others suggested that xAI is stuck in a “catch-up phase,” merely trying to replicate what OpenAI and Anthropic achieved a year ago rather than innovating. In an internal all-hands meeting, Musk explained that xAI would now be divided into four primary sectors namely Grok Main and Voice, Coding, and Data Macrohard. xAI’s Colossus supercluster in Memphis, Tennessee currently houses 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, and is currently being expanded to 200,000 GPUs. This hardware is essential for training “Grok 3,” which Musk believes will surpass all other AI models currently on the market. Get 8% CASHBACK when you spend crypto with COCA Visa card.

Pepe and Buttcoin Set the Stage, but APEMARS Steals the Spotlight as the Top Meme Coin Presale 2026 After Raising $200K+",https://timestabloid.com/chasing-the-next-hidden-gem-pepe-and-buttcoin-set-the-stage/,"The crypto market has a memory problem. Every cycle, traders swear they will spot the next hidden gem early. Every cycle, most enter after the breakout. Charts explode, headlines multiply, and liquidity floods in only after the first wave has already passed. By the time social feeds fill with rocket emojis, the asymmetric opportunity is already shrinking. Pepe proved how fast a meme can turn into a multi-billion-dollar narrative. Buttcoin showed that irony itself can attract speculative capital in waves. Yet both followed a familiar path. Viral attention surged. Volume spiked. Late buyers rushed in. Volatility expanded. Then the cycle cooled. The real question is not whether meme cycles will repeat. They will. The real question is whether a project can appear before the viral phase and still carry a structure strong enough to survive beyond it. That is where APEMARS enters the conversation, not as noise, but as a presale built around progression, scarcity, and controlled exposure. In a market that keeps rewarding early positioning, the definition of the next hidden gem may be evolving. It may no longer be the loudest meme. It may be the meme that builds differently from the start. APEMARS: Engineering the Next Hidden Gem Through Structure, Not Noise In its latest phase, Stage 8 Presale, MISSION LOG 08 – ZERO NAP, APEMARS reports 949 participants and over $200,000 in funds raised, reflecting steady presale adoption. The token is currently priced at $0.00006651 in Stage 8, with a planned listing price of $0.0055. Because presales increase in price as stages advance, earlier tiers carry wider pricing gaps. This structure reframes what a top meme coin presale 2026 can look like. More than $200k has already been raised, with over 900 holders participating before exchange discovery. Each presale phase increases the entry price in a predictable ladder. That design rewards earlier positioning while controlling supply expansion. In a market that keeps asking where the next hidden gem will emerge, structured scarcity and transparent progression introduce a different variable. APEMARS is positioning itself as a meme coin that evolves beyond pump cycles. Post presale plans include ecosystem expansion, partnerships, and a sales tax mechanism intended to support development and liquidity stability rather than rapid extraction. That approach attempts to blend cultural energy with disciplined execution. When $20,000 Meets Stage 8 Timing At the current Stage 8 price of $0.00006651, a $20,000 allocation would equal roughly 300,706,661 $APRZ tokens. Using the planned listing level of $0.0055, that amount would correspond to about $1,653,886.63 at listing valuation if that price is reached. This illustrates how early-stage timing affects token quantity in a presale structure and is provided for informational context only, not financial advice. Pepe: The Viral Blueprint That Redefined Meme Liquidity Pepe did not need a utility to command attention. It needed momentum. The token became a symbol of how quickly narrative can convert into liquidity. Social traction turned into exchange listings. Exchange listings turned into volume surges. That momentum cycle fed itself. Technically, Pepe’s rise demonstrated how speculative capital clusters around recognizable cultural signals. On chain metrics showed explosive wallet growth during its breakout phase. Liquidity pools deepened rapidly as traders rotated out of slower assets and into high velocity plays. Yet the Pepe cycle also revealed something important. Entry timing defined outcomes more than fundamentals. Those who entered before the exchange expansion saw exponential moves. Those who chased later phases faced compression. The lesson was clear. Viral exposure is powerful, but early structure determines real asymmetry. Pepe became a case study in how meme coins can achieve scale without traditional infrastructure. But it also reinforced a truth the market keeps relearning. Timing is everything. Buttcoin: Chaos, Irony, and the Liquidity Experiment Buttcoin followed a different emotional path. It thrived on satire and counter culture sentiment. It tapped into frustration narratives and converted that sentiment into speculative energy. The project did not rely on technical sophistication. It relied on narrative magnetism. Liquidity moved quickly during its peak phases. Traders viewed it as a high beta instrument tied more to mood than metrics. Price action reflected bursts of enthusiasm rather than structured growth. In many ways, Buttcoin embodied the chaotic side of meme speculation. However, chaos is difficult to sustain. Without staged tokenomics or presale discipline, supply dynamics often depend on open market demand alone. That model can produce rapid spikes. It can also produce sharp drawdowns. Meme Evolution: From Reaction to Design Pepe showed how fast liquidity can mobilize. Buttcoin demonstrated how narrative tension can spark volatility. APEMARS is attempting to combine those lessons with structural discipline. Instead of launching directly into speculative chaos, it is sequencing distribution. Instead of relying solely on viral traction, it is defining entry progression. Instead of unlimited supply expansion, it is actively reducing tokens to tighten long term dynamics. The meme world is changing. Investors are no longer chasing jokes alone. They are evaluating tokenomics, stage transparency, and roadmap clarity. Projects that survive beyond initial hype tend to blend narrative with infrastructure. APEMARS frames itself as part of that transition. It aims to become a meme coin built with infrastructure logic. Conclusion: The Cycle Repeats, But Structure Changes the Outcome The market has already seen what viral momentum can do through Pepe. It has already witnessed how irony can convert into capital through Buttcoin. Each cycle taught the same lesson. Entry timing matters more than noise, which is why keeping up with the insights from the Best Crypto To Buy Now is a must. The next hidden gem may not be the loudest project. It may be the one that builds quietly before exchange discovery. APEMARS , currently positioned as a top meme coin presale 2026, represents that structured approach through Stage 8 progression, controlled supply, and defined pricing architecture.

APEMARS is live in Stage 8 of its presale. This stage is priced at 0.00006651 per token and progresses automatically as allocations fill. What is the intended listing price for $APRZ? Project documentation outlines an intended listing price of $0.0055. Final market pricing will depend on exchange conditions. How does APEMARS differ from Pepe and Buttcoin? Pepe and Buttcoin relied heavily on viral momentum. APEMARS introduces stage-based pricing, supply reduction, and defined post presale planning. Summary Meme cycles continue to repeat, but structure increasingly defines outcomes. Pepe demonstrated viral liquidity power. Buttcoin illustrated narrative driven volatility. APEMARS introduces staged distribution, scarcity engineering, and presale architecture before exchange discovery. In a market searching for the next hidden gem, structured early access may prove more significant than noise alone. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

Bitcoin price jumped to $70,000, while the market capitalization of all coins rose to over $2.4 trillion. This article provides a forecast for some popular tokens like Pi Network (PI), Pepe Coin (PEPE), and Dogecoin (DOGE). Pi Network price prediction: Technical analysis Pi Coin price has rebounded in the past few days, moving from a low of $0.1280 last week to the current $0.20, its highest level since January 19. It has jumped by 50% from its lowest level this year, making it one of the top coins in the crypto industry. Pi Network price rebounded as the developers pointed towards an upcoming network upgrade that will happen today, February 15, and others that will happen soon. The token has also rebounded after it was added to Kraken’s listing page, meaning that it may be added this year. Such a move would be a major one as Kraken is one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the industry. READ MORE: Pi Network Price Prediction After the $17 billion wipeout Pi Network price has also rebounded as it nears the first-year anniversary of its mainnet launch. It has now moved above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has jumped to 65. The Average Directional Index (ADX) has risen to 62, a sign that the bullish momentum is accelerating. It is also nearing the important resistance level at $0.200. Therefore, the most likely Pi Network price prediction is bullish, with the next key target level to watch being at $0.2170, its highest level in December last year. Pi Coin price chart |Source: TradingView Pepe Coin price prediction Pepe, the top meme coin on the Ethereum network, has staged a strong rebound in the past few weeks, moving from a low of $0.0000031 on February 6 to the current $0.0000050 today. It has moved to the highest level since January 28. The coin rebounded after forming a double-bottom pattern at $0.0000036 and a neckline at $0.0000072, its highest level in January this year. It rebounded after forming a falling wedge pattern, which is made up of two descending and converging trendlines. The Relative Strength Index and the Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) have continued rising, with the lines forming a bullish crossover pattern. Therefore, the token will likely continue rising as bulls target the next key resistance level at $0.0000072, its highest level in January, which is about 45% above the current level. A drop below the key support level at $0.00000036 will invalidate the bullish outlook. Pepe Coin price chart | Source: TradingView Dogecoin price prediction Dogecoin price has rebounded in the past few weeks, moving from a low of $0.07963 in February to the current $0.1145, its highest level in January this year. The token has formed a descending channel and is now trading at the 50-day Exponential Moving Average. Also, the two lines of the PPO indicator have made a bullish crossover pattern, while the Relative Strength Index has moved above the neutral point at 50. DOGE price chart | Source: TradingView More gains will be confirmed if the Dogecoin price bounces back above the upper side of the descending channel. Such a move will lead to more gains, potentially to the key resistance level at $0.1545.

The sustained withdrawals reflect cautious institutional sentiment amid Bitcoin’s recent price struggles, as the premier cryptocurrency is presently down by 30% on its monthly chart. Grayscale’s BTC Shines With $110M Amid Market Struggles According to data from SoSoValue , Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded total net outflows of $359.91 million in February’s second week, driven primarily by mid-week capital withdrawals. The week began on a bullish note, with investors making a combined net deposit of $311.56 million between Monday and Tuesday. However, the optimism proved short-lived as the ETF market registered $686.87 million in net withdrawals between Wednesday and Thursday. Friday closed the week with a modest $15.20 million inflow, suggesting slight stabilization in investor sentiment. In analyzing individual fund performance, there was mixed performance across the market. The largest outflows came from market leader BlackRock’s IBIT, which saw $234.65 million in net withdrawals, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC, recording $124.73 million in outflows. Grayscale GBTC also experienced notable aggregate redemptions totaling $77.03 million, though its secondary product, Grayscale BTC, attracted $110.08 million in net inflows, partially offsetting losses. Ark Invest/21Shares’ CBOE and Bitwise’s BITB posted net outflows of $19.44 million and $29.81 million, respectively, while VanEck’s HODL each recorded modest inflows of $4.03 million. Meanwhile, Franklin Templeton’s EZBC attracted $2.35 million, while WisdomTree’s BTCW recorded a stronger inflow of $14.06 million. Similarly, Invesco’s BTCO lost $6.84 million, and Valkyrie BRRR saw small inflows of $2.08 million, while Hashdex’s DEFI registered no notable movement during the period. Bitcoin Spot ETFs Outlook The recent weekly losses contribute to a broader trend of declining ETF flows in 2026. So far, February has recorded total net outflows of $677.86 million, with aggregate 2026 withdrawals now at $2.28 billion, reflecting persistent institutional caution. The sustained redemptions appear closely tied to Bitcoin’s recent price volatility, which appears to dampen risk appetite among institutional investors. Nevertheless, the ETF ecosystem remains strong, with total net assets across all Bitcoin spot ETFs currently at approximately $87 billion. Additionally, cumulative net inflows since the launch in January 2024 remain robust at $54.33 billion, suggesting that long-term institutional adoption remains intact even amid short-term capital rotation. At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade at $69,479, reflecting a minor 0.99% gain in the last day.",ETF|Bitcoin Spot ETFs|BlackRock|Fidelity|Sosovalue|Total net outtflows|wisdomtree,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-02-15 05:00:00

Despite the late price relief seen last week, the altcoin remains about 70% off its all-time high, reflecting the dominant selling activity of recent months. Notably, funding rates data suggest traders are yet to see an imminent end to this turmoil, as open interest positioning reflects strong conviction toward further downside. Related Reading: Solana Reclaims $80 Amid Friday Market Bounce – Analysts Set Next Targets Solana Bearish Funding Stretch Sets New Low In 2.5 Years Funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between traders in perpetual futures markets to keep the futures price aligned with the spot price of an asset. Funding rates show which side of the market is more crowded, buyers (longs) or sellers (shorts), and thus a good sentiment indicator. Negative funding rates suggest that short traders are dominant, with a higher percentage of market participants presently betting on a price fall. According to market analyst Ted Pillows, the Solana market has recorded a negative funding rate for 17 consecutive days, indicating that traders have been aggressively positioned on SOL for over two weeks. The market analyst explains that the bearish sentiment around Solana hasn’t touched these extremes in over 2.5 years. Therefore, this development is indicative of a sustained directional conviction and not regular market noise. However, there are two likely scenarios to develop from this concerning situation. Firstly, Solana may continue to bleed downward as spot buying pressure remains weak, combined with the sustained decline in macro risk appetite. On the other hand, the market might also experience a short squeeze marked by rapid upward price movement. This can be due to an exhaustion of selling pressure, after an overwhelming market majority opens short positions. In conclusion, while Solana traders and investors remain strongly bearish, there is still potential for reverse price moves to catch these overcrowded trades off guard. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Data Indicates High Volatility Ahead Following Post-CPI Reaction Solana Price Outlook At the time of writing, Solana trades at $88.01, reflecting a 3.81% gain in the last day. Meanwhile, the daily trading volume is down by 24.9% and valued at $2.89 billion. According to a renowned market analyst, Ali Martinez, data from the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) metric highlights key Solana price levels. While $85.55 was previously identified as a resistance zone, Solana’s move toward the $88 level suggests this region may now be flipping into a support area, reinforcing its importance as a short-term demand zone.

Crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) shared two potential long-term scenarios for the asset, using monthly charts to highlight key price levels and market structure. The charts present distinct paths for XRP’s price, each reflecting different market conditions and outcomes. #XRP – Chart 1 or Chart 2? This isn’t opinion. It’s math, structure, and market behavior. Markets don’t reward comfort. They reward conviction under pressure. Choose your pain or pain will choose you. Chart 1: Bottom: $0.60 Top: $11 Deeper drawdown Fear… pic.twitter.com/7KxtTwcd2A — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) February 13, 2026 Chart 1 Shows Maximum Expansion Potential Chart 1 positions XRP with a bottom at $0.60 and a potential top at $11. The structure shows multiple points of support along the ascending trendline, indicating that these levels have historically held under selling pressure. According to EGRAG CRYPTO, this scenario represents a deeper drawdown and a market environment that tests investor conviction. The Fibonacci extension on this chart points to 1.618 at $11.12. This suggests a substantial upside if the $0.60 support holds. Chart 1 requires investors to tolerate short-term volatility and larger losses. EGRAG CRYPTO notes that this path may initially feel challenging but can lead to higher long-term returns. The trendline support in Chart 1 has been tested several times since 2016. The most recent came in late 2024, leading to a 500% surge . Each retest has reinforced the ascending slope, establishing a structural foundation for the projected move to $11. Historically, XRP’s price has respected these levels, suggesting that the lower boundary could act as a reliable entry point for investors prepared for volatility. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Chart 2 Suggests a Moderate Growth Scenario Chart 2 presents a higher floor at $0.90 and a top at $8.64. The structure shows less drawdown and reduced volatility compared to Chart 1. EGRAG CRYPTO points out that this path offers more comfort and a less stressful market experience. The 1.618 Fibonacci extension is at $8.64, lower than in Chart 1, indicating a smaller but still meaningful potential gain . The ascending trendline continues to provide support at multiple historical points, also marked on the chart. Price compression is visible before the potential move upward. Chart 2 represents a scenario where investors face reduced downside risk but accept a more crowded market and a lower upside ceiling. EGRAG CRYPTO explains that this scenario could attract more participation due to the perceived safety, but the reward potential is limited relative to Chart 1. The price action here implies steadier accumulation rather than a sharp rebound, which may appeal to investors who prioritize stability over maximum growth.

Crypto analyst Bird (@Bird_XRPL) stated, “I think we see an XRP move in the next 48 hours,” alongside a chart that shows a clear technical setup now nearing resolution. The current formation reflects a market that has stabilized after volatility and is preparing for its next direction. XRP’s Recent Performance At the time of Bird’s projection, XRP was trading at $1.56, with some stability in several sessions. The recent price action shows lower highs and relatively stable lows, which is characteristic of the descending wedge observed on the chart. This suggests that selling pressure has weakened, while buyers remain interested around the $1.35 level. XRP previously experienced a sharp drop , followed by a strong recovery to the current range. This recent consolidation appears to be setting the stage for a decisive move. I think we see an XRP move in the next 48 hours. pic.twitter.com/HI7crlnpUU — Bird (@Bird_XRPL) February 13, 2026 Chart Analysis The chart shows two converging white trendlines forming a falling wedge . The upper trendline connects XRP’s lower highs, while the lower trendline links recent lows. The asset’s price is now near the apex of the wedge. Bird’s chart includes a green arrow projecting a potential upward move once XRP breaks above the wedge. The breakout point sits just above $1.6, which would mark a critical level for bulls. Falling wedges are generally considered bullish patterns. The narrowing range indicates reduced volatility, which often precedes a decisive directional move . If XRP breaks above the upper trendline, it could trigger renewed buying interest. If XRP can cross $1.6, it could gain renewed interest from buyers and climb even higher. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Short-Term Outlook XRP’s immediate support sits around $1.35, which has held through multiple tests. A sustained move below this level could delay upward momentum, though the chart currently suggests stability. On the upside, surpassing $1.4 and breaking above the wedge would open the door for further gains. Bird’s analysis reinforces the notion that a significant move may occur within the next 48 hours, making this period crucial for market participants. Smart investors see XRP at $1.36 as a major buying opportunity . Once the upward move begins, those who failed to get in early could miss out on potential gains. Market watchers will closely follow the wedge and the behavior of XRP as it approaches the breakout level. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Key Takeaways: X plans to launch Smart Cashtags allowing users to trade stocks and cryptocurrencies directly in posts. The feature advances Musk’s vision of turning X into an all-in-one financial and social platform. It will roll out alongside X Money, a peer-to-peer payments system currently in beta testing. Nikita Bier, X’s head of product, said the company plans to introduce “Smart Cashtags,” a tool that will allow users to buy and sell stocks and cryptocurrencies directly from their timelines. The feature is expected to arrive within weeks, according to a post published Saturday. X To Roll Out Smart Cashtags Enabling Stock And Crypto Trades From Posts “We are launching a number of features in a couple of weeks, including Smart Cashtags that will enable you to trade stocks and crypto directly from the timeline,” Bier wrote. Bier had previously hinted at the feature in January, sharing an image showing trading functionality embedded in posts, but the company had not confirmed the details at the time. X previously experimented with financial features. In 2022, it added a basic Cashtag system that displayed price charts and market data for major assets such as Bitcoin and Ether. Users could view market movements inside posts, though the feature only tracked prices and did not enable transactions. The earlier system was later discontinued. The planned trading capability would mark a major shift for the platform, which already hosts a large share of online crypto conversation. Allowing direct transactions would move X beyond information sharing and into financial services. I genuinely want crypto to proliferate on X, but applications that create incentives to spam, raid, and harass random users is not the way. It meaningfully degrades the experience for millions of people — only to enrich a few people. And yes, we are launching a number of… — Nikita Bier (@nikitabier) February 14, 2026 The development aligns with Musk’s long-standing plan to turn X into an “everything app,” comparable to China’s WeChat, where messaging, payments and services operate in one place. The trading feature comes alongside X Money, a peer-to-peer payments system. Speaking during a presentation at his artificial intelligence company xAI , Musk said the payment tool is currently in limited beta testing and could expand globally after the trial period. “This is intended to be the place where all money is — the central source of monetary transactions,” Musk said. According to Musk, the platform reaches roughly 600 million monthly users. X Cracks Down on Crypto-Linked Engagement Apps As reported, X has recently come under scrutiny after restricting API access for so-called InfoFi and engagement-reward projects, many of which were tied to crypto incentives. The company said it would no longer allow apps that reward users for posting or interacting on X, citing concerns over AI-generated spam and manipulation. Beyond crypto, X’s broader AI strategy has drawn regulatory attention, particularly in Europe, where authorities have raised concerns about Grok’s image-generation features. The platform has since limited certain capabilities and introduced safeguards after investigations were launched. X’s decision to clamp down on so-called InfoFi applications sent fresh shockwaves through the crypto market, dragging several tokens sharply lower and forcing a rethink across a niche that had grown tightly intertwined with the social media platform. The immediate market reaction was led by KAITO, the token linked to the Kaito platform, which slid roughly 20% in a single day as investors digested what many saw as a structural threat rather than a short-term policy tweak.

With a 52-week range of $2.22–$35.30 and a 1.85% expense ratio, SOLT is unsuitable for long-term holding due to volatility drag and compounding effects. Short interest has been significant, peaking at $60 million, amplifying trading volume and price swings; current short interest is 14.41% of float. SOLT is best suited for disciplined swing traders seeking to capitalize on multi-day volatility, not for day trading or buy-and-hold investors. There was a lot of anticipation concerning the introduction of SOL ETFs in the recent past, but the crypto correction has crushed these ETFs, and more so when considering SOLT 2x Solana ETF ( SOLT ), which has the aggressive goal of delivering two times the daily performance of Solana ( SOL-USD ). From its inception in March 2025, it started off well, jumping from approximately $8.00 per share on April 7, 2025, after a brief decline after it started trading. From there it soared to its abovementioned 52-week high on 9-18-2025, before plummeting to its 52-week low in early February. The extremely volatile ETF has a 52-week range of $2.22 to $35.30. SOLT has fund AUM of $134 million as of 2-12-2026 and class AUM of $246.5 million. Trading volume stands at 1.75 million. Interestingly, it pays a small dividend of $0.09, which is paid out monthly, for a 3.71% yield (TTM). It also has a hefty expense ratio of 1.85%. In this article we'll look at what the future looks like for SOLT and the type of investor it's set up for. Seeking Alpha What SOLT is As I opened the article with, SOLT is an actively managed ETF that is designed to generate 2× the daily return of Solana. The ETF doesn't hold any of the underlying but utilizes cash‑settled Solana futures contracts and swaps in an attempt to achieve its 2x goal. Included in the fixed income part of the fund is cash, cash‑like instruments, or high‑quality securities for Being a non-diversified fund means almost all of its performance will be determined by its exposure to Solana futures. How the fund works is every day of trading it resets its exposure to SOL in order to retain its 2x SOL multiplier. This is, of course, a two-edged sword. If SOL manages to climb 5% on any given trading day, SOLT has the goal of climbing 10%. On the other hand, if SOL drops 5%, SOLT could drop as much as 10%. Another factor if you are considering trading SOLT is that there is also the compounding factor if holding over several days or more. Under that scenario, the 2x multiplier can get skewed because of the compounding effect on its performance. Those shorting SOLT Shorts have had a big impact on trading volume for SOLT since its inception. It especially took off in October 2025, when it had $39 million in short interest. It jumped to its all-time high of $60 million in November 2025. For three out of the next four months, it had short interest of $36 million, with an exception in January 2026, when it jumped back up to $45 million. The increase in short interest corresponded with a surge in trading volume, which was in a range of approximately 45 million to 71 million. It stayed close to that range until it dropped to about 23 million right before Christmas. After the New Year it started trading at high levels once again, jumping to about 118 million in the first week of February 2026. MarketBeat As of January 30, 2026, SOLT had a short interest of 6.59 million shares shorted, reflecting 14.41% of public float. Days to cover was 0.5, according to MarketBeat. With the combination of the crypto correction, number of shorts, and the purpose of the ETF itself, it has resulted in a significant underperformance, which won't be solved until SOL and other cryptos return to an upward growth trajectory. ETFs that are leveraged, like SOLT, experience what is called volatility drag or decay. That means there can be huge swings in the price from one extreme to the other, even if, in this case, SOL trades flat. Seeking Alpha For these reasons, SOLT isn't the type of holding that should be held for the long term. What is SOLT good for? The nature of the 2x ETF is that it can be traded on both sides of the play. Money can be made going long or going short. Day traders or swing traders are the obvious target of the fund. There is no scenario I can think of that would warrant taking a long-term position in SOLT. Even when you look at the chart showing a nice upward move in the early days of the holding, the volatility is extreme, and there's simply no way of knowing whether or not that would be sustainable. There is also the psychological effect, where most traders would be more apt to sell in response to a big downward swing in the price. This could easily result in a big loss of capital. On the other hand, as the chart shows, there is some very significant volatility on both sides of the play, and taking a short or long position has the potential to generate some solid gains for those that don't mind taking some risk associated with volatility. The ETF has a lot of volume on a daily basis, and it has provided some excellent opportunities to take advantage of that. My thought is this is probably a better swing trade than anything else, based upon the price swings over a number of days. From the time of its inception to its all-time high, it has several moves that doubled or tripled over a period of four to five weeks. Now that the fund is trading at about its 52-week low, it is worth putting on a watch list for when cryptos reverse direction. One positive is now that it's trading at $2.20 as I write, there is little concern about a rush of shorts into the fund, at least not in the way they have when it was trading much higher with more room to fall. When looking at the charts, there have been a few days when it had a decent jump, but the bulk of the movement has historically happened over several days to a month or so. The lower it trades when crypto and SOL recover, the more a trader will get out of the holding. Conclusion SOLT is designed for a very specific, narrow investment group, one which targets short-term price movements on either side of the volatility. It can be a potentially lucrative investment for those with the discipline and patience to wait for a favorable entry point - whether it's short or long. Based upon the price movement on a daily basis, it isn't the most attractive investment for day traders, as the swing in price isn't usually enough to justify the risk. It's definitely a negative for anyone thinking in terms of holding it for the long term. It's too volatile and unpredictable to do so. The risk significantly increases for those thinking in those terms, even when the temptation comes when it starts to soar again. Without a doubt, this is a holding for swing traders looking to 2x or 3x their money over a period of a week to a month. There has been a predictable move in that regard, and the volatility is potentially profitable for shorts and longs. For the average retail investor maybe wanting to dip their feet into SOLT, small position sizes are best when considering risk. There's no hurry. Taking a small position offers a chance to watch how the fund performs when there is skin in the game. I know there can be regret when engaging in mitigating risk, especially if there is only a small amount of money in play. The tendency under those conditions is to get more aggressive when the next opportunity arises in order to get money thought to be lost because of being too conservative. Based upon the volatility of SOLT, swing traders looking to 2x their money will probably do well when an attractive price point is at hand. Again, investors need to be aware that this is a great way to play it short and long, with the opportunity to produce meaningful gains when the ETF price is running or grinding to a halt.",SOLT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-02-15 07:45:57

Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as seen in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2026 to 2032. It is expected that SNX will reach $2.03 by 2030. Why is SNX up? The cryptocurrency market is in a bullish mode today, and SNX is following suit. From a larger perspective, the token is getting positive sentiment as the SNX price increased to $0.309, gaining 4.02% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $0.631193 for the current year, which is still quite higher than the current Synthetix price. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach a maximum of $2.74 by 2032. However, this is not investment advice, and anyone willing to purchase SNX tokens should seek independent professional consultation. Will SNX reach $1? Considering the future price movements, SNX will reach the $1 level by 2028. The last time SNX was seen at the $1 level was in November 2025. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like a distant target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don’t expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years, considering the long term Synthetix price forecast. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $2.74, which it will achieve in 2032. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $2.74 by the end of 2032, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment. However, one’s own research is advised.

The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019.

In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September.

In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The highest price of the SNX token was 2.27 in January, but it corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price declined to $0.89, and in April it further descended to the $0.77 range. In May 2025, it saw some recovery to $0.926, improving its market capitalization, and in July, the token peaked at $0.781, showing significant growth. From August to September, SNX’s average price remained around $0.65 to $0.67, and in October 2025, SNX was trading above $1, finally peaking at $2.58 on the 13th of the month.

This allocation shows the firm is taking a significant position across multiple digital assets. Crypto commentator Xaif highlighted the importance of this portfolio in a recent post. He noted the focus is not on indifference toward XRP but on attention. “Assets that don’t matter get ignored. Infrastructure that threatens the system gets attacked,” he said. Xaif emphasizes that XRP’s growing utility and liquidity make it more than a minor player in the market. The hate toward $XRP ? Look at it closely. It’s not indifference it’s attention.

While smaller than Bitcoin or Ethereum, it represents a meaningful stake for a top-tier institutional investor. In the video shared by Xaif, the speakers discussed the allocation. One commented, “I don’t hate it. I hate 6% of it. I don’t really care for the XRP, but I don’t know, if I’m Goldman Sachs, then maybe I’m into it.” Xaif’s post emphasized that the criticism of XRP reflects its significance in the crypto ecosystem. He argued that indifference characterizes assets without impact, while attention and even disdain arise only for those that challenge the status quo. In the video, one speaker explicitly noted discomfort with XRP, despite holding it as part of Goldman Sachs’ $2.36 billion crypto portfolio.

The very criticism it faces signals its influence and the threat it poses to traditional systems . This validates its strategic importance in both institutional and broader markets. Xaif explained that when utility scales and liquidity deepens, large price adjustments follow. He suggested that XRP could undergo a major repricing event, potentially reaching $1,000 if adoption continues and infrastructure use increases. The discussion highlights how institutional positions can validate a digital asset. Unlike assets with little adoption, XRP’s inclusion in a prominent portfolio signals recognition of its operational significance. Even a small percentage of XRP in a major portfolio signals interest.

Perhaps the most evident reason behind this rally could be, once again, Elon Musk. This time, though, he hasn’t made a specific DOGE-focused statement as in the past, but rather a broader promise for the entire crypto industry. In a recent video, the owner of X said the social media platform will allow users to trade stocks and digital assets directly from their timelines. They will be able to interact with ticker symbols in posts and complete trades within the app. The beta platform is expected to launch within a month or two from X Money, the company’s in-house payments system. Nikita Bier, the firm’s head of product, explained that the goal is to turn the social media behemoth into an “everything app” that allows users to invest, send money, post, and message others. Given Musk’s history with Dogecoin, it’s no wonder that the OG meme coin has gone on a tear ever since the announcement went live. The asset has consistently risen for the past few days, going from $0.095 to a two-week peak of over $0.115. DOGEUSD Feb 15. Source: TradingView It’s worth noting, though, that the billionaire has been quite silent on the Dogecoin endorsement front in the past year or so after some controversial claims that led to lawsuits against him. Other meme coins have also benefited from the recent market resurgance. PEPE has skyrocketed by 30% daily, while PIPPIN has solidified its spot in the top 100 alts after another 16% surge. Moreover, the asset has rocketed by 270% in the past week.

Ripple’s cross-border token has emerged as one of the top gainers, having surged by 16% daily to its highest price levels since February 1 at over $1.65. CryptoWZRD weighed in on XRP’s performance during the weekend, indicating that both charts, against the USD and BTC, closed bullish. The analyst added that “further upside from XRPBTC is very likely.” Cobb, one of the most vocal XRP bulls on X who made some bold price predictions yesterday with double-digit targets, noted that the cross-border asset might have started to decouple from other larger-cap cryptocurrencies. This claim has merit at least in the past day. Aside from DOGE, which has soared by over 20% since Saturday, XRP is the only other double-digit gainer from the top 20 alts. ERGAG CRYPTO indicated that the current two-week candle, which is set to close later today, is “shaping into either a Hammer or a Dragonfly Doji.” The analyst explained that both options are classic reversal candles that appear after a severe downtrend. XRP has indeed been in a downtrend for the past month and a half. The asset peaked at $2.40 on January 6 but was quickly halted there and pushed south to just over $1.10 on February 6. Nevertheless, it responded well to this calamity and now trades at $1.65, representing a near 50% surge from the local lows. Consequently, ERGAG CRYPTO advised their followers to ignore the noise and focus on XRP’s structure, which “remains a bullish setup, until the market proves otherwise.” #XRP – Descending Broadening Wedge (Update): On the 2-week timeframe, the current candle (closing in ~16 hours) is shaping into either a Hammer or a Dragonfly Doji.

The asset was charting severe losses for several consecutive weeks, but the past few days have been a lot more positive. This resurgance comes after the team issued an important reminder about a deadline for today. PI Rockets As mentioned above, PI was consistently one of the worst performers in the cryptocurrency markets ever since the last correction began in mid-January. The asset marked consecutive all-time lows, with the latest being at $0.1312 on February 11. As the community was lashing out against the project behind it and there were calls for further decline, the trend reversed in the past few days. PI’s price went on a wild run, gaining more than 30% in the past day alone, and over 55% since its all-time low seen just a few days ago. As such, it now trades above $0.20, which has prompted many Pioneers to celebrate the move and call for further gains. Pi Token Price on February 15. Source: CoinGecko “Huge congratulations to all Pioneers who recently DCA’d at the bottom around $0.13 – that decision is paying off nicely right now. A special shoutout and big thanks to PiBridge – a project that truly listens to the community and delivered one of the most useful features yet: USDT loans collateralized by PI. Thanks to this, anyone who urgently needed cash but didn’t want to sell their PI at the painful $0.13-$0.14 levels can now avoid massive regret,” commented Cryptoleakvn. It’s worth noting that today’s surge comes just a day after a popular crypto analyst, Captain Faibik, said they added PI to their portfolio and predicted a massive 500% surge. Deadline Approaches Separately, but perhaps somehow related to the recent pump, is the deadline ending today that concerns Pi Network’s “4th role” – Pi Nodes. As reported earlier this week, the Pi Mainnet blockchain protocol is undergoing a series of upgrades, and the deadline for the first one is February 15. It requires all Mainnet nodes to complete this important step to remain connected to the network.

This surprising trend emerges despite a 2% increase in overall national college enrollment, according to January data from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. Students appear to be abandoning traditional computer science degrees in favor of more specialized artificial intelligence programs, creating what educators describe as a fundamental transformation in higher education priorities. Computer Science Enrollment Decline Signals Major Shift The San Francisco Chronicle recently reported these enrollment figures, revealing a pattern that extends beyond California. According to a survey by the Computing Research Association in October, 62% of computing programs nationwide experienced undergraduate enrollment declines this fall. This represents a dramatic reversal from the previous decade’s explosive growth in computer science programs. Meanwhile, AI-focused programs are experiencing unprecedented demand, with institutions across the country scrambling to meet student interest. Several factors contribute to this enrollment shift. First, employment concerns play a significant role. Recent graduates face a challenging job market, with fewer computer science graduates securing immediate employment. Second, technological evolution has accelerated, making specialized AI knowledge increasingly valuable. Third, international competition, particularly from China, has highlighted the strategic importance of AI education. Finally, student perceptions about future-proof careers have shifted dramatically toward AI specialization. AI Degree Programs Experience Explosive Growth While traditional computer science programs decline, AI-specific programs are expanding rapidly. The University of California system provides a telling example. UC San Diego, which introduced a dedicated AI major this fall, represents the only UC campus where computer science enrollment increased. This exception proves the rule: students want AI-focused education. Nationally, dozens of universities have launched AI-specific programs in the last two years, with enrollment numbers exceeding all expectations. Institutional Responses to Changing Demand Major universities are implementing comprehensive strategies to address this shift. MIT reports that its “AI and decision-making” major has become the second-largest on campus. The University of South Florida enrolled more than 3,000 students in its new AI and cybersecurity college during the fall semester. Similarly, the University at Buffalo launched an “AI and Society” department offering seven specialized undergraduate programs, receiving over 200 applicants before officially opening. These institutions recognize that AI education represents more than just another major—it’s becoming essential infrastructure for modern education. The transition hasn’t been universally smooth. Faculty resistance presents a significant challenge at some institutions. UNC Chapel Hill Chancellor Lee Roberts described a spectrum of faculty attitudes in October, with some “leaning forward” with AI integration while others have “their heads in the sand.” Roberts, who arrived from outside academia, has pushed aggressively for AI integration despite faculty resistance. UNC recently announced plans to merge two schools to create an AI-focused entity, a decision that generated substantial faculty pushback. Roberts also appointed a vice provost specifically for AI initiatives. International Comparison: China’s Aggressive AI Education Strategy China’s approach to AI education provides a stark contrast to the United States. According to MIT Technology Review’s July report, Chinese universities treat AI not as a threat but as essential infrastructure. Nearly 60% of Chinese students and faculty use AI tools multiple times daily. Leading institutions like Zhejiang University have made AI coursework mandatory, while top universities like Tsinghua have created entirely new interdisciplinary AI colleges. In China, AI fluency has become table stakes rather than optional knowledge. This international comparison highlights the strategic importance of AI education. Chinese universities have embraced AI literacy as a national priority, integrating it across disciplines rather than treating it as a specialized field. This comprehensive approach contrasts with the more fragmented adoption in many American institutions. The difference in educational philosophy may have significant implications for global technological leadership in coming decades. Parental Influence and Career Concerns Parents play a crucial role in this educational transition. David Reynaldo, who runs the admissions consultancy College Zoom, told the Chronicle that parents who once pushed children toward computer science now steer them toward majors perceived as more resistant to AI automation. Mechanical and electrical engineering have gained popularity among these concerned parents. This parental guidance reflects broader societal anxieties about AI’s impact on traditional technology careers. However, enrollment numbers suggest students are making independent decisions based on career prospects and educational relevance. The rapid growth of AI programs indicates that students recognize the shifting technological landscape. They understand that AI knowledge provides competitive advantages in multiple industries, from healthcare to finance to manufacturing. This student-led movement toward AI education represents a pragmatic response to evolving job market demands. Faculty Resistance and Institutional Challenges Faculty attitudes present significant barriers to AI integration at many institutions. Chancellor Roberts of UNC Chapel Hill highlighted this challenge, noting that some faculty members effectively tell students not to use AI, despite its inevitable role in professional environments. “No one’s going to say to students after they graduate, ‘Do the best job you can, but if you use AI, you’ll be in trouble,'” Roberts explained. “Yet we have faculty members effectively saying that right now.” This resistance stems from multiple sources. Some faculty members worry about academic integrity, while others question AI’s educational value. Additionally, many professors lack training in AI technologies, creating knowledge gaps that hinder effective integration. Institutions must address these challenges through faculty development programs, curriculum redesign, and strategic hiring to build AI expertise within their academic communities. The Future of Technology Education It remains unclear whether this enrollment shift represents a permanent transformation or temporary adjustment. However, several indicators suggest lasting change. First, technological advancement continues to accelerate, making AI increasingly central to multiple industries. Second, employer demand for AI skills grows steadily across sectors. Third, international competition ensures that AI education will remain strategically important. Finally, student preferences have shifted decisively toward practical, career-relevant education. American universities face a critical challenge: adapting quickly enough to meet changing student demands and employer needs. The debate over whether to ban ChatGPT in classrooms has become largely irrelevant. The pressing question now involves how effectively institutions can integrate AI across their curricula and create specialized programs that prepare students for an AI-driven world. Conclusion The computer science enrollment decline represents more than a statistical anomaly—it signals a fundamental shift in higher education priorities. Students are voting with their feet, choosing AI-focused programs over traditional computer science degrees. This transition reflects broader technological, economic, and educational trends that will shape the future workforce. Universities must respond strategically, balancing faculty concerns with student demands and employer needs. The institutions that adapt most effectively will likely emerge as leaders in the next phase of technological education, preparing students for careers in an increasingly AI-integrated world. The computer science enrollment decline thus serves as both warning and opportunity for higher education institutions nationwide. FAQs Q1: How significant is the computer science enrollment decline? The decline represents a 6% drop across University of California campuses this year, following a 3% decrease in 2024. Nationally, 62% of computing programs reported undergraduate enrollment declines this fall, according to the Computing Research Association. Q2: Why are students shifting from computer science to AI programs? Students perceive AI degrees as more relevant to current job market demands, offering specialized knowledge that employers increasingly value. Employment concerns, technological evolution, and career prospects all contribute to this shift. Q3: How are universities responding to this enrollment shift? Universities are launching new AI-specific programs, creating interdisciplinary AI departments, and integrating AI across existing curricula. Some institutions face faculty resistance, while others are moving aggressively to meet student demand. Q4: How does China’s approach to AI education differ from the United States? Chinese universities treat AI as essential infrastructure rather than a specialized field, with nearly 60% of students and faculty using AI tools daily. Leading institutions have made AI coursework mandatory and created dedicated AI colleges. Q5: Will traditional computer science degrees become obsolete? Computer science fundamentals remain valuable, but programs must evolve to include substantial AI components. The most successful programs will likely integrate AI knowledge with traditional computer science foundations, creating hybrid approaches that meet both educational and employer needs.

However, the popular altcoin still reflects a broader bearish structure. Interestingly, a recent on-chain evaluation has surfaced, which paints a dark picture for Ethereum’s mid-term future, as opposed to imagined sustained relief. Taker Buy Sell Ratio Plummets To November 2025 Lows In a recent post on QuickTake , market analyst CryptoOnchain reveals that Ethereum derivatives traders are currently being dominated by aggressive sellers as indicated by the Ethereum: Taker Buy Sell Ratio on Binance, smoothed over with the 30-day moving average. For context, this metric measures whether aggressive market buyers or aggressive sellers are dominating the ETH futures market, and specifically on Binance (the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume). When the Taker Buy Sell ratio drops below the 1.00 threshold, it is a sign that taker sell volume is more than the taker buy volume. Basically, this means that there are more aggressive sellers than there are buyers. On the other hand, sustained readings above 1.00 signal that the futures market is currently being dominated by aggressive buyers. CryptoOnchain points out in his post that the metric’s readings currently sit around the 0.97 level, indicating that Ethereum’s current price action is being driven more by aggressive selling pressure. The 0.97 zone, interestingly, is the lowest since November, 2025. CryptoOnchain explains that this reveals a bigger sentiment shift among Ethereum futures traders over the past month, rather than being a temporary reaction to price action. What It Means For ETH Price The decline of the Taker Buy Sell ratio to 0.97 does not guarantee an immediate sell-off; more accurately, it shows that the bears are more likely to profit from Ethereum in the short-term. In the event that this bearish pressure is absorbed by spot demand, a sell-off would not ensue. On the other hand, if demand at key support levels fails to buffer Ethereum’s fall, the second-largest cryptocurrency could fall further. In addition, if there is a sudden injection of demand, the futures market simultaneously retains its extremely bearish sentiment; the Ethereum market could see a short squeeze, where the leveraged short positions are wiped out, thereby pushing prices to the upside with momentum. Hence, the Ethereum market is still in a very unstable phase, as prices could go in either direction, and with high momentum, depending on what happens first. As such, market participants are advised to tread the charts with caution. As of this writing, Ethereum holds a valuation of $2,085, reflecting a slight 1.7% gain since the past day, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

This represents a 2,000% gain in the latest monthly chart shared by crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto). The chart shows XRP moving from a period of consolidation to a sharp upward surge in 2026, signaling strong market activity and liquidity. Record Monthly Gain for XRP The Rial itself has been under pressure in recent days. Market reports indicate the currency continues to weaken against major global currencies, with the dollar trading above 1.4 million Rials in unofficial markets. High inflation, limited foreign reserves, ongoing international sanctions, and rising demand for hard currency have all contributed to the rial’s depreciation. These conditions have amplified XRP’s apparent gains when measured in IRR, allowing the digital asset to set another monthly record .

XRP broke prior levels and achieved record monthly closes . XRP also hit an all-time high in mid-2025, but entered a consolidation phase in the second half of the year. This period set the stage for the sharp move in 2026. The latest candle dominates the chart, showing rapid adoption and strong trading interest against the Iranian Rial. Steph Is Crypto noted the scale of the growth. The chart shows XRP’s ability to respond decisively to demand, particularly in markets with fiat instability. Traders viewing this chart may see confirmation of significant momentum and broader regional engagement. Will XRP Continue this Performance The pairing with IRR provides insight into how XRP functions in markets where local currency stability is limited. The rapid 2,000% rise demonstrates the asset’s liquidity and ability to capture value under specific economic conditions. This surge also suggests XRP can serve as a reliable store of value for traders in emerging markets facing ongoing currency depreciation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Looking forward, the chart indicates the potential for continued strength if trading activity remains robust. While short-term corrections are possible, XRP’s trajectory against the Rial remains strongly positive. Investors can monitor how the asset maintains its gains amid the ongoing weakening of the local currency. The recent IRR depreciation has amplified XRP’s growth in local terms, but the underlying trend in the crypto market is driven by adoption, liquidity, and consistent demand. Each consolidation followed by a breakout suggests XRP responds efficiently to changing market conditions. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Many altcoins have produced even more notable gains, including XRP and DOGE, both of which have skyrocketed by double digits. PEPE and PI joined that club. BTC Taps $70K It was just over a week ago – February 6, when the primary cryptocurrency’s crash culminated in a nosedive to $60,000. This became its lowest price tag in well over a year after a $30,000 drop in the span of approximately 10 days. The bulls finally woke up at this point and didn’t allow another decline to the sub-$60,000 levels. Just the opposite, BTC exploded by $12,000 within a day and surged to $72,000, which turned out to be too strong a resistance. The following few days were sluggish, with bitcoin trading between $68,000 and $72,000. The mid-week rejection at the upper boundary resulted in more pain, as the asset fell to $66,000 on Friday. However, it rebounded strongly in the following days, climbed to $69,000 on Saturday and to $70,800 on Sunday. It faced some resistance there, but still trades above $70,000 as of press time.

Key Takeaways: Vitalik Buterin warns prediction markets are drifting toward short-term speculation and betting. He proposes using onchain markets and AI to hedge everyday expenses and inflation risk. Supporters say platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi can also serve as decentralized market intelligence. In a recent post on X , Buterin said many platforms are “over-converging” into products centered on rapid price wagers and speculative trading rather than practical applications. He warned that the trend risks turning prediction markets into little more than gambling venues instead of systems that support real-world economic planning. Buterin Says Prediction Markets Should Shift From Betting To Hedging Rather than focusing on event betting or short-term financial outcomes, Buterin suggested prediction markets should evolve into hedging mechanisms designed to protect consumers and businesses from price volatility. He outlined a model in which onchain prediction markets work alongside large language models (LLMs). The system would track price indices across categories of goods and services, such as food, housing or transportation, separated by region. A user’s personal AI assistant would analyze spending patterns and construct a tailored portfolio of prediction-market positions representing expected future expenses. The idea is to help households and companies offset rising costs. Individuals could hold traditional investments for growth while maintaining a basket of prediction-market shares tied to living expenses, creating a buffer against inflation in fiat currencies. Supporters of prediction markets say the technology already has broader value beyond speculation. These platforms crowdsource expectations about events, financial trends and economic conditions, producing signals some researchers argue can rival polling data.

Advocates say they provide a decentralized source of intelligence that is harder to shape by centralized narratives. State Opposition to Prediction Markets Builds Over Consumer Concerns State opposition to prediction markets has been building for months. In 2025, the SWC urged the CFTC to prohibit sports event contracts, arguing that such products bypass state safeguards such as age verification, responsible gaming rules and anti-money laundering requirements. As reported, a new legislation to limit the interactions between government officials and the prediction markets is being supported by more than 30 Democrats in the US House of Representatives, including former Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The lure behind new restrictions is a controversial Polymarket bet, which started as a bet of $32,000 but eventually became more than $400,000 shortly before the unexpected detention of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The bill proposed by the New York Representative Ritchie Torres is the Public Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026. Last month, Kalshi opened a new office in Washington, D.C., as it ramps up efforts to shape federal and state policy amid growing scrutiny of its products across the United States. The company also hired veteran political strategist John Bivona as its first head of federal government relations.

The Binance coin price prediction for 2028 projects a maximum price of $2,929.75 and a minimum price of $2,467.16. By 2032, BNB’s price could surge to $6,013.70 with broader acceptance in mainstream finance. After notable changes in its executive team, Binance has shown resilience and prospects for recovery. The departure of Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, who was also embroiled in legal challenges, initially caused a decline in the value of Binance coin (BNB). Despite this initial setback, the cryptocurrency has shown a positive trend. In September 2020, Binance introduced BNB Smart Chain, which was initially designed for trading and transferring tokens and runs parallel to Binance Chain and supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) within the BNB Chain ecosystem. What’s next for BNB in the remainder of 2026 and beyond? What can be the future price movements? Let’s get into the BNB price prediction and technical analysis.

The altcoin gained 3.23% of its value. BNB faces resistance around $696. As of February 15, 2026, Binance Coin is showing an uptrend as buying momentum continues. The price analysis reveals the coin is slowly gaining buying demand after finding support at $607. BNB is trading at $639.09, and this bullish trend has resulted in a gain of 3.23% in value in the last 24 hours. BNB/USD price analysis on the daily timeframe The one-day chart for Binance Coin (BNB) confirms a bullish trend. The coin has experienced a further recovery, with the price moving toward the $639.09 mark as buying interest reignites. The recent downtrend was relatively significant, but bulls are now trying to take the lead. The presence of green candlesticks on the chart clearly signifies bullish dominance. The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the intensity of volatility. This distance is increasing, leading to high volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, suggesting resistance, has shifted to $913, whereas its lower limit, indicating a broken support, has moved to $506. BNB/USD Price Chart.

This increase confirms a rising buying activity in the market. BNB price analysis on a 4-hour chart The four-hour chart analysis of Binance Coin also shows positive sentiment for the altcoin. The BNB/USD pair increased to $639.09 over the past few hours. The price is still trending above the moving average value, which is at $629. The Bollinger Bands have converged, resulting in low volatility levels. The low volatility signifies a lower chance of an upcoming reversal or further price decrease.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bullish prediction as the current market sentiment turns positive. The coin’s price also increased to $639.09 as buying momentum continues today. If traders continue buying, the BNB price might see a further increase and break above $696. On the other hand, a failure in attracting buying demand might result in a correction. In such a case, the price of BNB might head toward the immediate support at $607. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $6,013.70 in 2032. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support, and the price moved toward $639.09, as bulls target $696. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 3.23 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? The BNB price has already crossed $1000 in 2025, and buyers are holding it above $700. BNB can cross the $1000 again in 2026 anytime. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction , BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on futures trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 by the end of 2029, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $6,013.70 by 2032. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. On September 21, BNB reached the $1,079.07 mark. In October, it hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $1,369.99 and is trading near the $1,100 mark in November. By the end of November, the price of BNB declined below $800. In early December, BNB price triggered a strong bull run toward $900. At the start of 2026, BNB was trending near the $870 level, but after a month, in February, BNB had decreased to $770.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-02-15 09:50:00

Investors are moving away from tokens with limited functionality and focusing on projects that address financial use cases, particularly in decentralized lending and borrowing. One new crypto protocol has begun attracting analyst attention for its structured on-chain model and early-stage pricing. Currently trading well under one dollar, it remains in a pre-launch phase, but expectations are building as development milestones advance. Some analysts are modeling upside scenarios of up to 600% if adoption accelerates alongside its broader rollout. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the projects gaining traction in this new phase of decentralized finance. It is developing a structured, non-custodial lending and borrowing protocol on the Ethereum network, designed to combine on-chain transparency with global accessibility. Since the first quarter of 2025, Mutuum Finance has expanded from an early community base into a network of more than 19,000 holders, raising over $20 million through its structured distribution phases. The steady price progression across phases reflects growing participation as development milestones are reached. The protocol is designed around two complementary market models : Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C framework, users supply tokens into shared liquidity pools and receive mtTokens representing their deposit positions, with yield generated from borrower activity. The planned P2P layer is intended to facilitate more direct lending arrangements under predefined Loan-to-Value ratios and liquidation thresholds. Together, these models aim to create a scalable decentralized lending infrastructure rather than a single-pool yield product. New Technical Milestone The technical development of the project has reached a major milestone. The team has officially launched the V1 protocol on the Sepolia testnet. This is a very important step for any blockchain project. It proves that the technology is functional and ready for public testing. The V1 launch includes several key features that make the platform unique. Users can interact with liquidity pools to earn yield on their assets. They can also test the borrowing mechanism using various types of collateral. To make sure everything is safe, the team completed a full manual audit with Halborn Security. This firm is one of the most respected names in the industry. They have checked the smart contracts to ensure there are no hidden risks for users. Developing Mechanism & Price Prediction Mutuum Finance’s official roadmap describes a smart economic mechanism called the buy-and-distribute mechanism. This system is designed to reward the people who support the protocol. A portion of the fees generated by the platform is used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens are then given back to the community members who stake their assets. This creates a healthy cycle of demand and rewards. Along with this, the team has revealed plans for a native stablecoin. This stablecoin would be backed by the interest-bearing assets within the protocol. It will give users a safe way to borrow value without worrying about price swings. Because of these features, analysts have issued a very strong price prediction. They believe the token could reach $0.42 to $0.60 shortly after it hits the mainnet launch. Looking Forward Q2 2026 Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a top competitor in the decentralized space. It combines high-end security with a working product that people actually need. The project is currently in the final stages of its early distribution phase. This is the last window for investors to secure the token at a 50% discount compared to the launch price. This opportunity is crucial because it allows early participants to maximize their potential growth. Once the project moves to the mainnet, the early pricing will be gone forever. The high trust score from CertiK and the successful testnet launch have created a lot of urgency. People are rushing to join before the confirmed launch price of $0.06 takes effect.

In a TradingView post on February 12, the analyst observed that Bitcoin approached the 200-week MA at around $56,000 before extending its pullback. Historically, the 200-week moving average has marked key bear market turning points, and a decisive break below it could signal a deeper correction. Bitcoin price analysis. Source: TradingView Last week’s low also neared the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement from the prior bear market bottom to the latest high. Similar past confluences between the 1-week MA200 and the 0.382 level have preceded extended bottoming phases. The area now also aligns with the 2.0 Fibonacci extension from the first leg of the 2022 bear cycle, reinforcing its technical significance. Bitcoin key levels to watch Based on this confluence, TradingShot pointed to the region between roughly $51,000 and $45,000 as the bear cycle “sweet spot.” The upper boundary sits near the 2.0 extension around $51,000, while the lower boundary aligns with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement near $45,000. From a cyclical perspective, this range represents a historically favorable area for long-term investors to begin rebuilding positions. The analysis further outlined the 350-week MA as a deeper downside scenario that would mirror the structure of the 2022 bear market bottom, when price ultimately found support at the 350-week moving average before initiating a sustained recovery. This outlook comes as Bitcoin posts a modest rebound, reclaiming the $70,000 level after a steep sell-off pushed the price near $60,000. The bounce was sparked by cooler-than-expected January U.S. CPI data (2.4% YoY versus 2.5% forecast), fueling hopes for earlier Federal Reserve rate cuts and reviving risk appetite across equities and crypto. However, analysts view the move as a relief bounce amid deleveraging rather than strong new buying conviction. Persistent institutional caution and prevailing cycle patterns suggest possible further downside tests before any sustained uptrend. Bitcoin price analysis At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $70,664, up more than 2% in the past 24 hours and 1.5% on the weekly chart. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold As it stands, Bitcoin remains well below both its 50-day SMA ($84,961) and 200-day SMA ($100,963). This positioning signals a clear bearish trend in both the medium and long term. When price remains under these key moving averages, it typically reflects sustained selling pressure and weak bullish momentum. The wide gap between the current price and the 200-day SMA further underscores the strength of the broader downtrend. The 14-day RSI stands at 38.69, placing it in neutral territory but leaning toward the oversold threshold of 30. This suggests bearish momentum is present, though not yet extreme.

The chart spans from 2014 to 2026 and shows price action within a clear ascending channel. According to the chart, XRP’s structure points to a potential price target of $50. This outlook is based on the simple observation that the asset has followed consistent support and resistance levels over the past decade. All we need are 3 lines to tell us that #XRP will hit $50. pic.twitter.com/LcUSWL2E88 — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) February 13, 2026 Channel Analysis Shows Consistent Support The chart presents three key lines within this ascending channel . The lower line represents long-term support, which has repeatedly held during market corrections. Each time XRP approached this line, it rebounded sharply. The upper line acts as a long-term resistance boundary. Between these two lines, the middle line serves as a midpoint indicator for price movement. CryptoBull summarized the chart in straightforward terms, stating, “All we need are 3 lines to tell us that XRP will hit $50.” The lower boundary currently aligns closely with recent price levels in early 2026. Historically, whenever XRP has tested this support, it has triggered upward movement. This pattern reinforces the potential for renewed bullish momentum . Historical Price Action Supports Future Targets From 2014 to 2016, XRP remained in a prolonged accumulation phase. The chart shows modest price movement followed by a breakout into 2017 and early 2018. After the surge, the price settled near the middle line for several years. A similar sequence appears in the 2020-2024 period, where the price experienced extended consolidation before the 500% surge in late 2024 pushed it toward the midpoint. These patterns suggest that XRP respects its long-term trend channels. When the price approaches the lower boundary, buying pressure historically increases. This creates a foundation for higher targets without requiring external catalysts. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Projected Trajectory Toward $50 The chart indicates that XRP remains above the lower boundary. The upward arrow suggests that the next significant move could carry the price toward the upper channel, which corresponds to roughly $50 . If this channel holds, the structure implies a continuation of the long-term trend that has governed XRP for over a decade. CryptoBull’s post emphasizes the simplicity of this approach. By monitoring these three lines, analysts and traders can anticipate potential price movement. XRP’s charted channel presents a clear long-term bullish trajectory. This clarity reduces reliance on complex indicators or speculative narratives. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The recovery has pushed Bitcoin’s market capitalization back above roughly $1.4 trillion, with daily spot and derivatives volume hovering near $43 billion as volatility stays elevated. Price action and liquidations The latest move caps a volatile two‑week stretch in which Bitcoin broke below the 70k psychological support, slid into the mid‑60k area, and briefly traded near 60k before dip buyers stepped in. Market analysts at research firm K33 described the drop toward 60k as a potential “local bottom,” citing capitulation‑style signals in volume, funding rates, options positioning and ETF flows. Across the broader crypto market, derivatives data from Coinglass-linked reports show around $189 million in futures positions were liquidated over a recent 24‑hour window, with shorts accounting for the bulk of the wipe‑out as prices rebounded. This kind of forced deleveraging has helped reset excessive leverage built up during the prior rally, giving spot buyers cleaner entry levels. For now, intraday traders are watching the 68k–70k band as an immediate pivot zone, where failed breakouts could quickly invite another wave of profit‑taking and stop runs. ETF flows and positioning into mid‑February On the flows side, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have flipped back to net inflows, with products recording about $15.1 million of net new capital on February 14 after several days of outflows. Fidelity’s FBTC led with roughly $12 million of inflows, while VanEck’s HODL and WisdomTree’s BTCW added about $1.9 million and $3.6 million respectively, partially offsetting a $9.4 million outflow from BlackRock’s IBIT. The return of positive ETF flows, together with whale accumulation highlighted in recent market commentary, supports the view that institutional and large‑holder demand is re‑engaging as prices stabilize back above 70k. Strategists note that if daily ETF flows can consistently stay positive and move back into the nine‑figure range, it would significantly strengthen the case for a retest of the 75k–80k zone later in Q1, while a relapse into outflows could leave BTC vulnerable to another sweep of liquidity toward the mid‑60k region. Sentiment, whales and key levels to watch Beyond flows and derivatives, on‑chain data watchers point to renewed whale accumulation as a subtle but important signal that larger players are willing to add exposure on dips rather than aggressively distributing into strength. Over the past couple of weeks, wallets holding more than 1,000 BTC reportedly accumulated around 53,000 BTC, roughly $3.7-3.8 billion at current prices during the sell‑off, marking the largest whale buying wave since November. At the same time, total futures open interest has dropped to about $34 billion, down roughly 28% from a month ago and more than 45% below the October peak in notional leverage, after an estimated $5.2 billion in forced liquidations over the last two weeks. Sentiment remains fragile: Bitcoin’s fear and greed gauges briefly slid into “Extreme Fear” in early February, with recent readings hovering in the low‑to‑mid teens, levels that historically have coincided with local bottoms and later relief rallies. Structurally, traders now eye the $60,000-$61,000 band as major cycle support (overlapping the 200‑week moving average and realized price zones), while $65,000-$66,000 acts as initial downside support on any pullback. On the upside, derivatives desks and prediction markets highlight $75,000 as the next major target if spot can secure a convincing daily close above $72,000, with some bank research still keeping longer‑term projections as high as $150,000 for year‑end 2026.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-02-15 10:43:28

According to authorities, crypto scammers have kicked their activities up a notch, ditching their previous model of targeting hardware wallet users. According to reports, criminals are now sending users of these wallets physical letters delivered to their homes, pretending to be from Trezor and Ledger. This is done to trick them into submitting recovery phrases of their wallets, which are then used to carry out the theft. The letters claim recipients must undergo compulsory checks or transaction checks to avoid losing access to functionalities within the wallet. The scammers use this to create a sense of urgency to pressure their victims into scanning QR codes that lead to malicious websites. Ledger and Trezor users targeted in snail mail QR code crypto scam According to reports, users of the hardware wallets have confirmed receiving these letters printed on letterhead that impersonate official communications from the security and compliance teams of Ledger and Trezor. It is unclear how the users are being targeted, but both companies have suffered breaches in the past. These breaches have seen considerable user information being compromised. The most recent breach occurred at Ledger, where user data was stolen last month. In the letter received by Trezor users and checked by cybersecurity expert Dmitry Smilyanets, the criminals claimed that authentication checks will become a mandatory part of Trezor and urged users to complete the process by February 15 or risk losing certain functions on their devices. The letter claimed that users must scan the QR code contained in the letter and follow the instructions so they don’t lose access to the Trezor Suite. “Note: While you may have already received the notification on your Trezor device and enabled Authentication Check, completing this process is still required to fully activate the feature and ensure your device is synchronized with the full functionality of Authentication Check,” the Trezor letter read. Meanwhile, a similar letter addressed to Ledger users was shared on blogging platform X, claiming that users would be subjected to a mandatory transaction check with the same deadline. Hardware wallet firms issue warnings to users According to reports, scanning the QR code leads users to phishing sites created by scammers to impersonate Trezor and Ledger official domains. Currently, the Ledger phishing site is offline, while that of Trezor remains active. However, the Trezor website has been flagged as a phishing site. “Attackers on the site that you tried visiting might trick you into installing software or revealing information like your passwords, phone numbers, or credit card numbers. Chrome strongly recommends going back to safety,” the website said. Before the Trezor website was flagged, it displayed a warning saying that users needed to complete the authorization check by February 15 to be safe. However, it highlighted that users who purchased the Trezor Safe 7, Trezor Safe 3, Trezor Safe 1, and Trezor Safe 5 do not need to complete the checks as the wallets are already preconfigured. The landing page features a ‘Get Started’ button that leads to another warning about a failure to complete the authentication process. These warnings were designed to create further urgency so that victims continue to the next part of the process without having second thoughts. If victims proceed, the next page requires them to enter their recovery phrases with claims that this information is to enable them to authenticate and verify device ownership. However, once the recovery phrase is entered, it is transmitted to the scammers through a backend API endpoint. Hardware wallet recovery phrases are the representation of the private keys that control access to crypto wallets. This means that anyone with access to the phrases will be able to gain full control over the wallet and the funds in it. Hardware wallet manufacturers like Trezor and Ledger have always warned users not to share those phrases, as they will never ask for them under any condition. Recovery phrases should only be entered on the hardware wallet devices. Get 8% CASHBACK when you spend crypto with COCA Visa card.

By 2029, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $0.52. In 2032, FLOW will range between $0.58 to $0.85. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2026? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.0498 Market Cap $81.68M Trading Volume $17.08M Circulating Supply 1.641B FLOW All-time High $42.40 (April 05, 2021) All-time Low $0.07251 (Jan 25, 2026) 24-hour High $0.05187 24-hour Low $0.04543 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 27.44% (Extremely High) 50-Day SMA $0.08191 14-Day RSI 41.59 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 8 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.2474 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown FLOW is down ~49% from its recent peak but holding $0.035 support. Short-term structure is compressing around $0.044 with momentum stabilizing. A break above $0.049 would trigger upside, but if FLOW falls below $0.041, it might move towards $0.038. Flow coin 1-day price analysis On the 1D chart for February 15, FLOW is trading around $0.04424, down roughly 0.23% on the session, after a sustained decline from the $0.086–$0.088 region, marking an approximate 49% drop from peak to recent lows near $0.039–$0.040. The broader structure remains bearish as price continues to print lower highs and lower lows, but the recent candles show stabilization above the $0.03574 support, which has held firmly as the cycle low. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The price is currently compressed between $0.04919 resistance and $0.03574 support, with $0.05340 and $0.06682 acting as higher supply zones if momentum builds. The MACD is curling upward with the histogram flipping positive, suggesting bearish momentum is fading, though the signal lines remain below zero, meaning this is still a recovery attempt inside a larger downtrend. A daily close above $0.04919 would signal the first meaningful structure shift and open the path toward $0.05340 (+20% from current levels), while failure here increases the risk of revisiting $0.040 and potentially retesting $0.03574. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, price is consolidating tightly around $0.04429 after bouncing sharply from the $0.038 zone, a recovery of roughly 16% from the recent swing low. The Alligator lines have flattened and intertwined, indicating a transition from trend to range, and RSI sits near 50, reflecting equilibrium between buyers and sellers. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Structure-wise, $0.045–$0.046 is immediate resistance; a break above that level would likely accelerate momentum toward $0.049, aligning with daily resistance. On the downside, $0.041–$0.042 is the first support band, and losing it would weaken the short-term base and expose $0.038 again. Momentum has shifted from impulsive selling to compression, which typically precedes expansion. Direction will be decided by which side of $0.045 or $0.041 breaks first. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.05862 SELL SMA 5 $0.05464 SELL SMA 10 $0.05162 SELL SMA 21 $0.06201 SELL SMA 50 $0.08191 SELL SMA 100 $0.1540 SELL SMA 200 $0.2474 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.06024 SELL EMA 5 $0.06866 SELL EMA 10 $0.08191 SELL EMA 21 $0.1074 SELL EMA 50 $0.1578 SELL EMA 100 $0.2135 SELL EMA 200 $0.2836 SELL What to expect from Flow? FLOW is in a higher timeframe downtrend but building a short-term base; if $0.049 breaks, a relief rally toward $0.053–$0.066 becomes likely, while rejection keeps it trapped in consolidation with risk back to $0.040. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming years. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $1-$2 by 2032. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

Key Takeaways: Trump Media filed for two crypto ETFs tracking Bitcoin, Ether and the Cronos token. The Cronos fund would include staking rewards with Crypto.com providing custody and services. The move deepens ties between US politics and the growing crypto investment sector. Truth Social Funds, the ETF arm of the company behind the Truth Social platform, submitted applications Friday for the “Truth Social Bitcoin and Ether ETF” and the “Truth Social Cronos Yield Maximizer ETF.” The filings mark another step in the growing overlap between US politics and the crypto investment industry. Truth Social ETFs Target Bitcoin, Ether and CRO With Staking Rewards The proposed Bitcoin and Ether ETF would track the performance of the two largest cryptocurrencies, reportedly using an allocation weighted toward Bitcoin. The Cronos product, meanwhile, would provide exposure to CRO, the native token of the Crypto.com-linked Cronos blockchain, while also offering staking rewards to investors. Crypto.com is partnering with Trump Media on the products and is expected to provide custody, liquidity and staking services. CEO Kris Marszalek said the company supports the funds and plans to enable trading access once they launch. Let me clear up a bit: Truth Social today filed for ""Truth Social Cronos Yield Maximizer ETF"" and the ""Truth Social Bitcoin and Ether ETF""… this is IN ADDITION to the spot bitcoin ETF they filed for last June as well as a crypto blue chip basket ETFs, which I would think should… https://t.co/Sn6XUyqmq6 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) February 13, 2026 The new filings follow a previous agreement between the firms to introduce crypto investment products and continue a broader strategy by Trump Media to establish a presence in digital finance. The company had already sought approval for a standalone Bitcoin ETF and a multi-asset crypto fund that included several major tokens. The ETF market is increasingly competitive. Asset managers such as BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale already operate widely traded Bitcoin investment vehicles, giving investors indirect exposure to crypto without holding tokens directly. Trump Media has also signaled interest in integrating blockchain beyond ETFs. The company recently said it intends to distribute a new digital token to shareholders on the Cronos network and previously disclosed plans for a corporate crypto treasury involving CRO. The expansion has drawn political scrutiny, with critics arguing the president’s business ventures could create conflicts of interest, particularly as regulatory decisions affecting digital assets are debated in Washington. Last year, Trump Media also announced a partnership with Crypto.com to bring prediction markets to the social media platform, positioning it as the first publicly traded social media company to integrate such technology. Bitcoin Loses 25,000 Millionaire Addresses Under Trump As reported, Bitcoin has shed roughly 25,000 millionaire addresses in the year since Donald Trump returned to the White House, even as US policy shifted toward a more crypto-friendly stance. Blockchain data shows the number of addresses holding at least $1 million in BTC fell about 16% year over year, suggesting regulatory optimism has not translated into sustained on-chain wealth growth. The pullback was less severe among the largest holders. Addresses with more than $10 million in Bitcoin declined by about 12.5%, indicating that top-tier investors were better able to withstand price volatility, while wallets near the millionaire threshold were more exposed to market swings. Much of the increase in Bitcoin millionaire addresses occurred before Trump took office, driven by a late-2024 rally fueled by election-related optimism and expectations of deregulation.

A recent analysis predicted an impending short squeeze, as the funding rates plunged to new lows. According to the latest on-chain data, this short squeeze not only happened; it occurred at a rate not seen in years. $736M In Shorts Wiped Out Across All Exchanges In a recent Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, pseudonymous on-chain analyst Darkfost revealed that the Bitcoin market recently experienced the largest short liquidation event since September 2024. The relevant indicator here is the Short Liquidations USD metric, which tracks the total dollar value of short positions in Bitcoin that were forcibly closed (liquidated) by exchanges over a given period. Related Reading: Solana Funding Rates Hit 17-Day Negative Streak — What This Means For Price According to Darkfost, this liquidation event comes second when compared to the $773 million in positions forcefully closed on September 20, 2024. As was earlier mentioned, this event was preceded by a period where there were significantly high amounts of sell positions (reflected by the deeply negative funding rates) on Binance and other exchanges. Typically, when a disproportionate amount of short positions is forcefully closed, this offsets what is referred to as a short squeeze. During a short squeeze, sell-side liquidity is converted, by liquidation dynamics, to jet fuel for upward price movement. Darkfost further explained that the derivatives market is currently heavy with speculative positioning, while the spot market, on the other hand, continues to struggle with thin liquidity. This imbalance creates a fragile market environment, where aggressive shorts can amplify upside volatility if squeezed. However, it is worth noting that in the scenario where there is sustained scarcity of demand, the current upside rally sponsored by the short squeeze may also not be sustained. Hence, until the spot market starts to see a significant demand that aligns with the present conditions, Bitcoin is best described as being in an uncertain phase. Bitcoin Market Overview At the time of writing, the price of BTC sits at around $69,878, reflecting a 1.5% leap in the past day. On the weekly timeframe, the flagship cryptocurrency seems to have barely moved, recording a slight upward growth of about 0.7%. Meanwhile, the premier cryptocurrency continues to drift further away from its record-high of $126,080, now 45% deep in the red. Related Reading: When Will Bitcoin Bounce Back?

Nic Carter warned that if signs of a serious quantum threat are ignored, major investors could push for sweeping changes to how upgrades happen. Institutional Pressure And Protocol Risk Some large firms hold huge stacks of Bitcoin , which changes the politics of any perceived security gap. BlackRock owns a sizable amount of BTC, and that kind of exposure can force a boardroom-style view on what has long been a technical, community-driven process. If managers judge developers are moving too slowly, they may look for faster, more centralized fixes. That would shift power toward institutions that manage money for others and away from the volunteer contributors who have steered Bitcoin so far. In the Bits and Bips podcast episode that aired Thursday, Carter said he thinks the “big institutions that now exist in Bitcoin, they will get fed up, and they will fire the devs and put in new devs.” Quantum Threat And Timelines The technical issue at hand is simple to state and hard to time: powerful quantum computers could, eventually, break cryptographic schemes used to sign transactions. Austin Campbell suggested that big holders will demand answers if a structural weakness is found. Some people say there’s plenty of lead time to prepare; others worry the clock is closer than most assume. The gap between theoretical capability and an actual working attack makes judgments about urgency difficult.

Michael Saylor has argued that banks and governments face the same risks, so coordinated industry moves could buy time. Meanwhile, Adam Back warned that advanced machines might one day threaten signatures, but he also said migration to quantum-resistant options is doable with careful planning. Blockstream has worked on related research, and some community members have proposed staged upgrades to protect already-used keys and reduce exposure during any transition. Vitalik Buterin called for early research and thoughtful coordination, noting that slow, messy rollouts could do more harm than good. Market Context And Sentiment Reports note Bitcoin’s price has seen volatility in recent weeks. Coingecko data showed a meaningful pullback over 30 days, which some commentators linked to narrative shifts about technology risk. Price moves don’t prove a security problem exists, but they do change incentives. When money managers feel pressure from clients or trustees, technical debates can take on urgent political force. Corporate Takeover A Hypothesis? The idea that institutions could “fire” volunteer developers and install their own teams is a sharp one. It would require legal, technical, and social moves that are hard to pull off cleanly. Still, the possibility highlights a deeper point: as more fiduciary capital flows into crypto, the tolerance for unresolved technical risk shrinks. That may force a new kind of conversation between those who write code and those who hold large public money. For now, the prevailing view among many experts is that quantum computers are a future challenge rather than an immediate catastrophe. But with heavy stakes, quiet unease could become public pressure sooner than some expect.

According to reports, the recent market decline has forced users to sell off their assets, with most retail traders currently in the red as a result of the development. Over the last few years, Vietnam has approached digital assets cautiously, allowing blockchain technology to develop in a grey area, unlike its neighboring China, which chose an outright ban back in 2021. In Vietnam, digital assets have been barred from being used as a medium of exchange, while the government allows its citizens to speculate on the assets without restriction. The move allowed its young population to sit at the forefront of crypto adoption, with an estimated 17 million people holding digital assets. What happened to Vietnam’s crypto industry? In the past few months, Vietnam has been making progress in its crypto industry. In January, the country announced that it had begun accepting applications from firms looking to operate a licensed crypto exchange in the country. Under the licensing framework, applicants must have a minimum contributed charter capital of 10 trillion Vietnamese dong ($400 million) alongside other requirements. The licensing program was rolled out under the legislation passed by the National Assembly of Vietnam in June 2025. However, what looked like a boom in the crypto industry has now turned into a liability as investors are presently in the midst of a crypto winter. The price of Bitcoin has almost halved since hitting a new record high above $126,000 in October, with other digital assets sliding even further. In an interview carried out by AFP, a university student in Hanoi, Hong Le, claimed that he had lost all his digital holdings. He claimed that his holdings rose to $200,000, but crashed when Bitcoin and other digital assets slid. Discussing the current market situation, Tran Xuan Tien, the head of Ho Chi Minh City’s blockchain association, mentioned that many companies have shut down as a result of the crisis. He added that others have also been downsizing, as most of them are looking for capital to extend their runway. His words were echoed by Nguyen The Vinh, co-founder of blockchain firm Ninety Eight, who mentioned that his company just laid off about one-third of its staff since last year. Industry figures call for plans to help the sector Talking about the future, Vinh added that the company is expected to carry out more restructurings in the future due to the gloomy outlook of the industry. “The market will likely remain difficult for years, not just months, so we need backup plans.” Until recently, Vietnam’s crypto sector was a careful place to be, with ventures dealing in highly speculative assets and Ponzi schemes flourishing alongside firms offering legitimate products. At the time, the Vietnamese government warned about the dangers of crypto and went after the perpetrators of some huge scam operations, especially one where investors were swindled out of more than $400 million. Under its leader, To Lam, the country is now pursuing growth reform, as it seeks to embrace the blockchain industry and assert control over the $100 billion market. While the law recognizing digital assets came into effect last month, investors have questioned its implementation. According to Vinh, most of the firms are halting operations, downsizing, or moving elsewhere because of the increasing decline and the unclear legal framework in the industry. He also added that new firms are struggling to gain popularity as investors are now choosing to wait out the turbulence in the market. In the past, investors were enticed by the promises of making 400% returns, but are now discouraged when they hear that they might lose everything.

Here’s the Signal,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-is-set-rally-425-in-the-coming-weeks-heres-the-signal/,"Crypto analyst XRP CAPTAIN has issued a bold projection for XRP, asserting that the digital asset could rise by 425% in the coming weeks. In a recent post accompanied by a detailed weekly chart of XRP against the U.S. dollar on Bitstamp, the analyst addressed critics directly before presenting his forecast. He wrote, “XRP is a shit coin. XRP is a scam coin. But XRP is ready to go up by 425% in the coming weeks.” The chart attached to the post shows XRP trading within a long-term ascending channel on the one-week timeframe. According to the shared visual analysis, price action is near the lower boundary of the channel, suggesting a potential rebound scenario. The projection highlighted on the chart points to a move to around $5.75, which represents a gain of about 425.93% from the indicated level near $1.36 at the time of the screenshot. The analyst’s message contrasts prevailing skepticism surrounding XRP with a strong bullish outlook. By juxtaposing common criticisms with a confident price target, XRP CAPTAIN signaled that he views the current market sentiment as disconnected from what he believes the chart structure indicates. #XRP is shit coin #XRP is scam coin. But #XRP is ready to go up by 425% in the coming weeks pic.twitter.com/3N00syeZU9 — XRP CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) February 13, 2026 Technical Outlook Suggests Move Toward Upper Channel Resistance The weekly chart shared in the post outlines a steady upward channel extending into 2027. XRP previously advanced toward the upper boundary of this channel before retracing toward the lower trendline. The current positioning, as shown in the chart, places XRP near that lower support level. The projected arrow on the chart illustrates a sharp upward move targeting the upper boundary within 8 weeks. The price target of $5.75 is marked clearly on the chart, along with the calculated percentage increase of over 425%. The timeframe annotation indicates eight bars, equivalent to eight weeks, reinforcing the analyst’s expectation that the move could occur within a relatively short period. This projection implies a return to price levels not seen in years and would represent a significant expansion from current valuations. The chart does not provide additional indicators or oscillators, relying primarily on trendline structure and historical channel behavior.

A user identified as Mina_World expressed doubt about the immediacy of such a move, stating that it would not happen anytime soon and suggesting a maximum gain of 150% by the end of the year. Another commenter, Rui Ferreira, questioned the timeframe, noting that similar projections have circulated for more than ten weeks without materializing. In contrast, Adv Matiullah Afridi voiced long-term confidence. He stated that he has been holding XRP for one year and is not focused on short-term movements. He added that those who continue holding during difficult periods should ultimately be rewarded, expressing the belief that XRP could create significant wealth again in the future. XRP CAPTAIN’s projection presents a clear and measurable target supported by a defined technical structure. Whether the market will validate this outlook in the coming weeks remains to be seen, but the analyst has made his position unmistakably clear.

The investment firm led by Cathie Wood acquired 66,545 shares through the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), 16,832 shares via the Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), and 9,477 shares through the Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF), according to its latest daily trading disclosures. The move coincided with a sharp rally in Coinbase shares , which closed at $164.32, up 16.4% in a single session, before extending gains in after-hours trading. In total, the purchases amounted to approximately $15.2 million. In addition to Coinbase, ARK also increased its stake in Roblox Corporation, buying shares across the same three ETFs. Roblox closed near $63.17 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. ARK Reverses Course After $39 Million in Sales The buying spree comes shortly after ARK reduced its Coinbase exposure. On February 5, the firm sold about $17.4 million worth of shares – its first reduction this year and its first since August 2025. A day later, it offloaded another $22 million through multiple ETFs while increasing its position in digital asset platform Bullish. Coinbase was a key drag on performance for several ARK ETFs in Q4 2025 as broader crypto markets weakened. During the quarter, Coinbase shares declined more steeply than both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Coinbase Reports $667 Million Quarterly Loss The company posted a net loss of $667 million in the fourth quarter of 2025, snapping an eight-quarter streak of profitability. Earnings per share came in at 66 cents, missing analysts’ expectations of 92 cents, while net revenue fell 21.5% year-over-year to $1.78 billion. Transaction revenue dropped nearly 37% to $982.7 million. Subscription and services revenue, however, rose more than 13% to $727.4 million. Coinbase said it generated $420 million in transaction revenue at the start of the first quarter but expects subscription and services revenue to decline. A Pattern of Buying During Weakness ARK Invest’s latest move reflects a familiar strategy. The firm has historically added to high-conviction technology positions during periods of volatility, viewing short-term operational pressure as a long-term opportunity. The timing is notable. The purchases aligned not only with a strong one-day rally in Coinbase shares but also with signs of stabilization in crypto markets after January’s downturn. By spreading the purchases across three thematic ETFs, ARK may also be managing exposure while maintaining conviction in the sector. Whether this marks the start of a sustained rebuilding phase, or a tactical trade around volatility will likely depend on the direction of crypto markets in the coming weeks.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-02-15 11:06:02

Patrick Witt, executive director of the President’s Council of Advisors for Digital Assets, made the remarks in a Yahoo Finance interview while pushing lawmakers to finish a broad market structure bill known as the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act. Witt’s message landed as Congress and regulators face renewed pressure to define which federal agencies oversee different parts of the crypto market, a long running dispute that has shaped enforcement actions and compliance planning across the industry. CLARITY Act clock ticks toward the 2026 midterms Witt argued that the CLARITY Act is central to moving major firms off the sidelines because institutional investors often require stable rules on custody, disclosure, and supervision before deploying large allocations into new markets. He also warned that the legislative calendar narrows as the November 2026 midterm elections approach, a practical constraint that can freeze complex negotiations and reduce the time available for committee work and floor votes. The House has already advanced its approach to market structure, but negotiations have tightened around Senate language and the boundaries of SEC authority, creating a fresh chokepoint even as the White House tries to broker agreement between banks and crypto firms. Stablecoin yield fight blocks a deal The most immediate conflict centers on whether companies should be allowed to offer rewards tied to holding stablecoins, a feature banks say could pull deposits away from traditional accounts and reshape funding across the banking system. Crypto industry groups have pushed back, arguing that a blanket prohibition would weaken competition and that guardrails can address risk without eliminating incentives, a position outlined in competing “principles” documents circulating among negotiators. White House hosted meetings have been described by participants as constructive, but they have not produced a final compromise, leaving the broader CLARITY push exposed to delays even as Witt frames regulatory certainty as the trigger for institutional participation.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-02-15 11:11:43

This bank is making its emergency loan program available to central banks throughout the world. On February 14, 2026, the ECB’s senior decision-making committee announced adjustments to the EUREP, which provides euros to other central banks during times of financial market turbulence. Global access replaces limited regional program Before this change, only eight countries near Europe could use this program. These included Romania, Hungary, Albania, and Montenegro. Now, almost every central bank in the world can apply to join. The only banks excluded are those connected to money laundering, funding terrorists, or facing international penalties. Each bank that gets approved can borrow up to 50 billion euros. They need to put up good-quality euro bonds from European governments as security for the loans. The new rules start in July 2026, and banks will have full access by the third quarter. This is much more money than banks could borrow before. The ECB also dropped an old rule that required banks to lend the borrowed money to their own country’s banks. Now they can use the euros however they need to. The ECB said it will stop sharing details about how much each country borrows. Instead, it will only release combined weekly numbers to keep things private. Applications are submitted via a formal request letter from the central bank’s governor directly to the ECB president. ECB president cites geopolitical risks as driver At the Munich Security Conference that same day, Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, discussed these adjustments . She cited a globe rife with political unrest, disrupted supply lines, and fierce corporate competitiveness. According to her, the new program is faster, easier to use, and permanent. When financial market issues arise, this should increase public confidence in the euro. The setup is similar to what the U.S. Federal Reserve does with its FIMA program. That program gives foreign government institutions access to dollars backed by U.S. Treasury bonds to keep markets stable. The ECB wants to create the same kind of safety net for the euro. The euro still has a long way to go to catch up with the dollar. The euro makes up about 20 percent of global foreign exchange reserves held by central banks, while the dollar accounts for roughly 60 percent. But having a reliable backup source of euros could slowly change this balance. When central banks and investors know they can get euros quickly if needed, they might be more willing to hold euro assets. This could lead to more trade, lending, and investment using euros. Financial experts say these emergency programs usually sit unused during normal times. But just knowing they exist matters a lot. When market stress hits, they can make a real difference in keeping things stable. Europe has been working toward less dependence on other countries’ financial systems as the world economy becomes harder to predict .

58052303,https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-surges-ripple-ceo-cftc-role/,1771154400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/58052303.jpeg,XRP Price Surges as Ripple CEO Takes Role Influencing Crypto Regulation,https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-surges-ripple-ceo-cftc-role/,"XRP price just caught a serious bid. The token jumped more than 8% in 24 hours after news broke that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse secured a seat on the CFTC Innovation Advisory Committee. Traders are clearly betting that having Ripple closer to regulators could shift the narrative around XRP. Key Takeaways XRP rallied 8.09% to trade near $1.53 on news of the Ripple CEO’s federal appointment. The CFTC tapped Garlinghouse and other crypto leaders to advise on digital asset frameworks. Institutional flows are rising, with Goldman Sachs revealing a $152 million crypto ETF position. Garlinghouse Joins Expanded CFTC Committee This is a pretty big shift from Washington. The CFTC just expanded its Innovation Advisory Committee to 35 members, and Brad Garlinghouse is now officially part of it. Chairman Michael S. Selig says the goal is to future proof U.S. markets by working closer with the industry instead of fighting it. It is important to keep this in perspective. The CFTC mainly regulates derivatives markets, not spot crypto securities. XRP past legal fight was with the SEC, not the CFTC. Source: CFTC And Garlinghouse is not alone. The lineup includes Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, leaders from Chainlink, Solana Labs, and Uniswap, plus names from traditional finance like CME Group and Nasdaq. That is a serious mix of crypto and Wall Street in one room. The focus areas matter too. Tokenization. Perpetual contracts. Blockchain market structure. All directly tied to how XRP fits into the bigger picture. For XRP holders, this feels symbolic. Ripple went from battling regulators to sitting at the policy table. And with lawmakers pushing for clearer crypto rules, this could mark a new chapter in how the industry and Washington interact. XRP Price Bulls Eye $1.54 Breakout The market reacted fast. XRP is trading around $1.57609, up 10% on the day after bouncing from a low near $1.40731. That move pushed price cleanly out of its mid $1.40 consolidation range, backed by stronger volume and widening Bollinger Bands. Source: XRPUSD / TradingView Bulls are now testing the $1.60 session high. Short term moving averages are stacking underneath price around $1.47 and $1.48, creating a stair step style support zone. That gives the rally some structure. On the fundamental side, momentum is building too. Binance recently completed RLUSD integration on the XRP Ledger, a development many analysts see as a potential catalyst for a much larger move if momentum continues. Institutional Interest Deepens Beyond the CFTC news, bigger money is quietly getting into position for what could be a more crypto friendly 2026. Recent filings show Goldman Sachs holds around $152 million in crypto ETFs, a clear sign that Wall Street is not stepping away from digital assets. Garlinghouse has also doubled down on his vision, calling XRP the “North Star” of Ripple strategy and pointing to 2026 as a pivotal year. While the U.S. tone appears to be softening, the global picture is still mixed. Dutch lawmakers, for example, are pushing a 36% capital gains tax on crypto, showing how fragmented regulation remains worldwide. Broader market conditions also matter. XRP remains highly correlated with Bitcoin and overall crypto risk sentiment, meaning macro catalysts, including rate expectations and ETF flows, could amplify or cap this breakout attempt. With price now pressing against the $1.60 resistance zone, the next move could set the tone for where momentum heads from here.

At the same time, SOL tried to stabilize near $80 after breaking down from a long held trading range. Prolonged negative funding marks rare futures positioning Solana futures funding rates stayed negative for 16 consecutive days, according to an aggregated open interest weighted eight hour average shown on a Binance Futures daily chart dated Feb. 15. The metric printed near minus 0.0042, which signals that short positions paid longs to hold exposure. Meanwhile, SOL traded near $81 on the daily chart, after extending a multi week decline that began in late 2025. Solana U.S. Dollar Daily Chart. Source: TradingView / X Funding rates reflect the balance of long and short demand in perpetual futures. Therefore, sustained negative readings point to traders leaning short across venues. In this case, the streak reached a level that has appeared only twice in Solana’s trading history, based on prior cycles cited by market participants. Those earlier stretches occurred in November 2022, when SOL traded near $8 during a broad market selloff, and in September 2023, when price hovered near $20 amid weak sentiment. At the same time, price structure remained under pressure. SOL continued to post lower highs and lower lows on the daily timeframe, while rebounds stalled below former support that now acts as resistance. As a result, sellers kept control of the trend, and spot price held near the lower end of the recent range. The latest session showed a modest daily bounce, yet the broader structure stayed weak relative to prior months. However, extended negative funding can signal crowded short positioning. When shorts dominate for long periods, forced covering can occur during sharp rebounds, which can amplify short term moves. Still, funding alone does not define trend direction. Instead, it adds context to derivatives positioning as price tests lower levels. Price slips under former support while futures positioning stays cautious Solana hovered near the $80 level on the three day SOL/USDT chart from Binance dated Feb. 13, after a sharp breakdown from a long held range that had supported price through much of 2024 and 2025. The latest candles showed SOL trading near $81, following a steep selloff that pushed price below the green support band around the low $120s. As a result, the broader structure shifted lower after price failed to hold the prior consolidation zone. Solana TetherUS Three Day Chart. Source: TradingView (DaanCryptoTrades) The chart showed multiple failed rebounds from the former range before the breakdown accelerated into early 2026. After that move, price extended lower toward the high $70s, where buyers began to defend the area. Therefore, the $80 zone now sits near the lower boundary of the recent decline, with the next visible reference band marked around the high $60s on the chart. At the same time, volume expanded during the breakdown, which aligned with the strongest red candles in the sequence. That pattern reflected heavier sell pressure as price moved away from the prior range. However, recent candles printed longer lower wicks near $80, which showed buying interest at that level even as the broader trend stayed weak. So far, price has not reclaimed the former range. Instead, SOL remains below the broken support, which now acts as overhead resistance. Until price holds above that zone, the structure stays tilted to the downside on higher timeframes. Short term stabilization near $80 would mark the first pause after the drop, while failure to hold the area would expose the lower band highlighted on the chart.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-02-15 11:21:54

The democratic Senators issued a letter to that effect to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to look into the issue. According to the letter, the Senators want Bessent to evaluate whether the reported stake in the Trump-linked project warrants a national security review . The Senators, who are both members of the Senate Banking Committee, asked Bessent to determine whether the Committee of Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) should look into the deal, per the letter. CFIUS is an interagency panel overseen by the Treasury that looks into foreign investments for national security risks. Senators Warren and Kim want to review UAE stake in WLFI The deal was reported by the Wall Street Journal last month. The news outlet mentioned that G42, a company backed by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the national security adviser and manager of the largest sovereign wealth fund in the UAE, acquired a 49% stake in World Liberty Financial days before the second inauguration of Trump in January 2025. The deal was executed through an entity called Aryam Investment 1 and was signed by Eric Trump. The deal required an upfront payment of $250 million, with about $187 million of the entire figure directed towards Trump family entities and at least $31 million to firms affiliated with the family of Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East and a co-founder of World Liberty Financial, the report said. President Trump has denied knowledge of the investment. “My sons are handling that, my family is handling it … I have all I can handle right now with Iran and with Russia and Ukraine,” Trump said to reporters. In the letter , the Senators asked whether CFIUS had already reviewed the transaction and made any recommendations to the president about it. They noted that the CFIUS should have been mandated to review transactions that could give foreign governments access to sensitive technology or personal data. The letter pointed to the fact that World Liberty Financial says it collects personal information from users, questioning whether the UAE or China could gain access to the data. Probes trail UAE’s $500 million stake in WLFI The letter also mentioned that the deal would see WLFI give up two board seats to senior executives who hold key positions at G42. The Senators also cited longstanding United States intelligence warnings that G42 may have been involved in the provision of technology to assist China’s military. The company was accused of developing a surveillance app that was developed as a messaging app. In addition, G42 has faced scrutiny over its ties to Chinese firms, including Huawei and Beijing Genomics Institute. However, the company said it had divested from the Chinese companies since early 2024. The CFIUS request adds to a growing list of probes that have been sought since the deal was announced. Last week, Rep. Ro Khanna, ranking member of the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition with China, launched an investigation demanding documents and answers from WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff by March 1. In the letter, Khanna focused on whether the investment may have influenced US export policy on advanced AI chips after the Trump administration approved a plan to give the UAE access to 500,000 of the most advanced AI chips per year. Bessent has also been grilled over WLFI at a House Financial Services Committee hearing last week, where he was asked to pause a pending Banking charter application tied to the firm. Senators Warren and Kim have given Bessent until March to respond to their letter. Get 8% CASHBACK when you spend crypto with COCA Visa card.

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/luke-belmar-xrp-made-people-money-but-banks-wont-use-it-heres-why/,"A fresh debate over the future of blockchain-based banking infrastructure has emerged following comments circulated online from digital entrepreneur and crypto investor Luke Belmar. In a tweet, crypto analyst Brown Thunder highlighted Belmar’s remarks, asserting that while XRP has historically delivered profits for investors, its long-promoted vision of becoming the primary banking settlement chain may not materialize. Instead, Brown Thunder pointed to Keeta as a project building what he describes as a more complete institutional solution. In the attached video, Belmar reflected on his personal experience investing in XRP, stating that he began accumulating the asset at $0.13 and witnessed its rise to $3.50, followed by a sharp correction and subsequent recovery. He emphasized that XRP has generated returns for participants, making clear that profitability is not his concern. His focus, he explained, is on the long-term viability of XRP’s banking thesis. So this Luke Belmar clip has been going around this morning. Luke says XRP made people money, but banks probably won’t use older rails and points to newer tech like Keeta. Ty’s been saying the same thing. Keeta is building what XRP sold everyone on years ago… real settlement… pic.twitter.com/eCCcdZTHrd — Brown Thunder (@Brown_Thunder76) February 10, 2026 Competition to Replace Traditional Financial Rails Belmar directly challenged the narrative that XRP will ultimately become the dominant blockchain for banks. He argued that the financial sector is highly competitive and that multiple blockchains and businesses are pursuing the objective of replacing the traditional SWIFT network . According to him, newer technologies compliant, regulated, and traceable may have structural advantages over networks that have existed for more than a decade. When asked for an example of a blockchain positioned for institutional banking, Belmar named Keeta. He differentiated it from networks such as Ethereum , which he described as serving as a decentralized application layer rather than a banking-specific infrastructure. He also referenced the idea that different chains serve distinct purposes, citing examples, such as Bitcoin as a store of value and Solana as a capital markets-focused network. Keeta’s Full-Stack Infrastructure Claim Brown Thunder expanded on Belmar’s assertions by stating that Keeta is building what XRP previously marketed to investors years ago: settlement rails that institutions can actively deploy. He noted that development activity can be reviewed publicly on GitHub and encouraged independent research into the project. According to the tweet, Keeta is developing a full-stack system that includes built-in compliance, foreign exchange swaps, a native decentralized exchange, and an anchor system. Brown Thunder stated that the network is designed with speed, scalability, and low fees in mind, structured in a plug-and-play format that institutions can integrate without requiring extensive customization. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Narrow Settlement Role Versus Integrated Infrastructure In contrasting the two projects, Brown Thunder characterized XRP as primarily a bridge asset in settlement. He described this as a narrower scope compared to what he claims Keeta is constructing. Rather than focusing solely on facilitating transactions, Keeta is presented as assembling the entire operational infrastructure from inception. Belmar’s closing remarks in the video were direct. He stated that banking systems will not operate on the same networks predominantly used by retail traders. He concluded, “With banking, XRP is not gonna succeed. It’ll be KETA.

At the same time, ETH/BTC remains capped by a long-term downtrend, which keeps relative momentum weak. Staked ETH climbs past 30% while price stays near recent lows Ethereum's staking rate rose to a new high above 30.5% of total ETH supply, even as ether traded around $2,050, according to a CryptoQuant chart shared by analyst Leon Waidmann on X. The chart labeled “Ethereum: ETH 2.0 Staking Rate (%)” shows the staking share climbing in a steady uptrend since early 2023, while the price line moved through multiple rallies and selloffs over the same period. ETH 2.0 Staking Rate (%). Source: CryptoQuant / X The CryptoQuant data suggests the staking rate roughly doubled from about 15% in early 2023 to more than 30% by early 2026. Meanwhile, the price axis on the same chart shows ether near $1.9K at the latest point, well below prior peaks marked above $4,000 and near $4,500 during 2024 and 2025. Waidmann described the move as a divergence, arguing that staking continued to rise regardless of market direction. He also pointed to earlier periods when staking increased while price stayed flat or fell, and he said ether later climbed in subsequent months. Those references reflect his interpretation of past market behavior rather than a guaranteed outcome. Staking locks ETH into validator operations to help secure the network, and it can reduce the amount of ether immediately available to trade. At the same time, liquidity conditions also depend on where ETH sits across exchanges, custodians, and staking providers, as well as how easily holders can exit positions. ETH/BTC stays pinned under long-term downtrend as ratio hovers near multi-year lows The ETH/BTC trading pair remained below a descending trendline that has capped rallies for nearly eight years, according to a biweekly chart from Binance shared by X user TedPillows. The chart labeled “Ethereum / Bitcoin – 2W (Binance)” shows a long series of lower highs from 2017 through early 2026, with each rebound failing near the same falling resistance line. Ethereum / Bitcoin – 2W (Binance). Source: TradingView / X At the latest reading, the ratio traded near 0.0293 BTC per ETH, based on the chart’s right-side price marker. Over recent years, the pair posted repeated lower peaks during recovery attempts in 2018, 2021, and 2022. However, each move stalled under the same descending trendline, which continues to define the broader structure. As a result, the market has not confirmed a sustained shift in relative strength toward ether versus bitcoin. Price action since 2024 shows another bounce from the lower end of the range, followed by renewed pressure as the pair approached the long-term resistance. Therefore, the structure still reflects a broader downtrend on higher time frames. In turn, this signals that ether has continued to lag bitcoin in relative performance across multiple cycles. TedPillows said a decisive break above the trendline could mark a regime change for ETH/BTC and reshape relative momentum between the two assets. That view reflects the analyst’s interpretation of technical structure rather than a confirmed outcome. For now, the chart shows resistance holding, while the pair trades below the multi-year ceiling that has defined relative performance since 2017.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-02-15 12:05:36

Its market cap is neck-and-neck with BNB to rank number four by this metric. Its main use case is fast, low-fee cross-border payments, but the XRP Ledger is opening up an entirely new use case for XRP tokens—decentralized finance (DeFi). The February update from the official team at Ripple Labs signals a significant shift in the ecosystem’s fortunes. But real quick, before diving into the update: Here’s how XRP’s price reacted after Ripple released the update on these exciting new developments: on Friday, Feb. 13, XRP traded for a daily average price of $1.35 before it surged to over $1.65 on Sunday. “Institutional DeFi on XRPL” The Ripple Labs update teased “Institutional DeFi on XRPL,” in a headline that promised the network will scale real-world finance with XRP at the core. The key selling point for Ripple investors and developers in this announcement is that these updates make the XRP Ledger well-suited for institutional-grade players. Serious financial firms with big clients in New York City and London can rely on this technology to better meet the needs of their business. Or at the very least, that’s what the XRP team states. The note opened with a quick TLDR; summary highlighting XRP’s utility in liquidity and credit markets as well as for payments. This referred to On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) powered by Ripple. This platform feature allows large institutions or individuals moving large funds to send them via RippleNet using XRP tokens. But the exciting updates included: MPT (fungible Multi-Purpose Tokens for RWA tokenization) Permissioned Domains for access management Lending Protocol for native on-ledger XRP credit markets Confidential Transfers for institutional-grade privacy Ripple support for foreign exchange (FX) markets Meanwhile, sophisticated new tools such as Credentials, Token Escrow, and Batch Transactions will help enterprise-grade clients stay compliant with financial regulators and automate on-chain workflows. “The foundation for the next generation of blockchain-based financial infrastructure is being built, with XRP as the backbone,” Ripple Labs said. Fine-Tuning XRP Utility to Purpose In addition to the feature set for institutions, which forms the backbone of the next-generation XRP ecosystem on the ledger, Ripple also announced that XRPL now comes equipped with new developer tools to keep open development humming along. Livenet Explorer is a developer tool that enables institutions and blockchain developers to visualize real-time on-chain activity, balances, and token flows. Meanwhile, XRPL Devnet Tools will help blockchain developers test features such as MPTs, escrow contracts, batch transactions, and lending protocols before deploying Dapps to the mainnet. On the payments and FX side, permissioned domains will help build walled-off environments on the open blockchain with controlled credentials. Moreover, this can support KYC and AML tools for regulatory compliance. XRPL is also getting ready to unlock balance sheets by optimizing collateral and capital velocity. This will be possible through token escrow for conditional settlement programmed right into XRP smart contracts. One of Ripple’s big points in the February update is MPTs, or Multi-Purpose Tokens. Ripple says MPTs are the future of tokenization on XRPL. They can support sophisticated financial instruments such as bonds and funds while also handling metadata and parameters without requiring custom contracts. What It Means for XRP Prices For institutional and independent blockchain developers, here are some considerable developments. They may draw more participants and large financial firms into the XRP ecosystem. But what does it mean for cryptocurrency investors? During the week following the update announcement, XRP’s price outperformed the rest of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, indicating the market perceived the news positively. However, as CryptoPotato reported , the state of the industry is currently predominantly negative in terms of price action. As a matter of fact, the popular Fear and Greed Index tapped Extreme Fear territory with a score of just 5 a few days ago – the lowest in the last eight years. During times like these, good news does not move markets as much as it does in bull markets. While the update is undoubtedly sound and important, it is unlikely to cause any significant price change, at least in the short term.

In a direct response to the inaccurate claims, Kitao confirmed that SBI's position is not in XRP tokens but in Ripple Labs, the company behind the XRP ledger. SBI owns a significant 9% equity stake in Ripple Labs, which allows the firm to benefit from the company’s growth, rather than directly holding XRP itself. SBI Holdings Investment in Ripple Labs SBI CEO Kitao took to X to correct the financial misunderstanding after a user, @strivex_, claimed that SBI was a major XRP holder. The user had referred to SBI’s recent expansion into Singapore and suggested that SBI held $10 billion worth of XRP tokens. In a quoted response, Kitao emphasized that holding $10 billion in XRP would expose SBI to significant volatility, whereas owning equity in Ripple Labs gives the company a solid stake in Ripple's overall ecosystem without the risks associated with holding the token. SBI's stake in Ripple Labs means that the firm has a significant portion of the company’s equity, as Ripple continues to develop its blockchain technology and grow its network of institutional partnerships. This is a notable distinction, as it aligns SBI with Ripple's long-term business prospects rather than the daily price fluctuations of XRP itself. Ripple’s Ecosystem and Valuation Ripple’s ecosystem is seen as a key enabler of cross-border payments and decentralized finance (DeFi). Recent private market reports have suggested that Ripple’s valuation could exceed $50 billion, given the company’s growth potential and the increasing institutional adoption of XRP and its ledger. According to these valuations, SBI's 9% stake in Ripple Labs would be worth approximately $4.5 billion today. SBI Holdings CEO Yoshitaka Kitao also referred to Ripple’s overall ecosystem as a ”hidden asset” that is not fully reflected in the current book value of SBI. He suggested that the full value of Ripple's ecosystem, which includes its extensive partnerships and technology, would significantly boost Ripple's valuation in the future. The growth of Ripple as a fintech powerhouse positions SBI to benefit from any appreciation in Ripple's overall value. SBI's Strategic Role in Ripple’s Success SBI has been a staunch ally of Ripple since 2016, and this partnership continues to evolve as both companies push forward in the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors. Beyond holding an equity stake, SBI has been actively involved in advancing Ripple’s objectives globally. Recently, SBI announced its acquisition of a majority stake in Coinhako, a regulated cryptocurrency exchange based in Singapore. This acquisition is part of SBI’s broader strategy to create a digital asset corridor between Japan and Southeast Asia. SBI's deepening commitment to Ripple Labs is seen as part of the company's strategy to foster institutional adoption of XRP. The ongoing partnership with Ripple provides SBI with a front-row seat to the development of new use cases for XRP, including cross-border payments and real-time settlement solutions. Moreover, as the Coinpaper earlier reported, as part of its continued support for XRP, SBI has also participated in Ripple’s $1 billion treasury initiative through a partnership with Evernorth Holdings, a company that is focused on driving XRP's institutional adoption. Amid these clarifications, the Ripple token has seen a brief recovery after the recent crypto market crash. At press time, the XRP price was trading at $1.56, a 6.12% surge from the 24-hour low.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-02-15 12:22:44

According to local reports, the crackdown, which ran from February 7 to 13, targeted individuals carrying out different kinds of fraudulent activities, including investment fraud, loan app fraud, and part-time jobs scams. According to the statement released by the Indian police, the crackdown was carried out with the help of investigators after they made trails of several illegal funds across different states, including Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. The force also said it secured refunds worth about Rs. 16.9 lakh ($18,673) to victims through court orders. According to the police, the arrested individuals have been processed in court for bail hearings, while others are still being held in police custody pending the conclusion of investigations. Indian police apprehend six individuals in latest crackdown In the statement released by the Indian police, officers attached to the force travelled to Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh and arrested Gummadi Rambabu for acting as a mule account holder and facilitating the movement of illicit funds. The victim in this case said he was approached by one of the members of the network on Facebook. He claimed the person presented the crypto investment scheme and explained how it worked in detail. After days of discussion, he agreed to invest. The victim was added to a Facebook group titled AZ70 Market Radar Station, where he said administrators offered stock tips and investment training. Members of the group also plastered screenshots showing their profits from the crypto investments made in the group, another move to entice the new members added to the group. The victim claimed he was provided a bank account to transfer Rs. 5.20 lakh into, which was coincidentally an account owned by the accused. In another case, the Indian police said it arrested Santosh Chandra Kant Gaikaward in Mumbai for his role in a large-scale investment fraud that targeted victims locally. The victim claimed he was added to a WhatsApp group after the group initiated contact and was persuaded to invest through a trading application, which they falsely claimed had been duly registered with the appropriate federal agency. He was also shown a fabricated profit from crypto investments, a move that enticed him. Police urge residents to be cautious online In another separate investment fraud case linked to a WhatsApp group named Dream Chasers Together 371, three accused from Bhiwandi in Maharashtra were arrested for acting as mule accounts to transfer funds gotten from crypto investment scams. The individuals were identified as Momin Arham Rais Ahmed, Mohd Qais Mustaque Shaikh, and Momin Hina Imran Ahmed. The complainant was initially allowed to withdraw at first to build trust before being defrauded of over Rs. 65 lakh. Police also arrested Katravath Nithin from Mahabubnagar in connection with a loan fraud application. The victim was lured through Instagram by fraudsters posing as representatives of loan companies. He was asked to share personal and banking details before being asked to pay about Rs. 2 lakh under the pretext of security deposits and processing charges. Investigators discovered that the funds were moved through several accounts owned by the criminals before being transferred into crypto and sent out of the country. Meanwhile, officials of the Indian police have warned the public to exercise caution while trying to make money online. They urged residents to refrain from responding to unknown profiles or phone numbers, especially those acting overly friendly. In addition, the officials also warned residents to avoid sharing personal information and accessing crypto investment platforms through their official websites and to report suspected fraud immediately to the nearest police station.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $2.92 by the end of 2029. By 2032, WIF’s price may surge to $4.80. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.2483 Market cap $248.26M Trading volume $119.07M Circulating supply 998.92M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.2619 24-hour low $0.2263 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 19.63% (Very High) 50-day SMA $0.3158 14-Day RSI 47.80 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 8 (Extreme Fear) Green days 12/30 (33%) 200-Day SMA $0.5766 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Dogwifhat is down 3.28% on the daily time chart and stalling at $0.25 resistance. The 4-hour trend is still bullish above $0.24, but momentum is fading. If WIF drops below $0.23, traders can expect renewed downside toward $0.20. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart Dogwifhat is trading at $0.24653, down 3.28% on the day (February 15), rejecting right at the mid Bollinger Band around $0.24850 after briefly reclaiming it. The price remains in a broader downtrend structure, with the upper band near $0.31529 acting as dynamic resistance and the lower band around $0.18171 marking the recent volatility floor. From the late January swing high near $0.38 to the recent low around $0.20, the coin dropped roughly 47%, and although we’ve seen a bounce of about 23% from $0.20 to $0.246, it’s stalling below the mid-band and prior breakdown zone near $0.25–$0.26. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview The RSI sits at 44.20, recovering from oversold but still below the 50 mark, meaning bulls have not fully regained control. As long as daily closes remain under $0.25–$0.26, the structure favors continuation or consolidation rather than a confirmed reversal. A strong daily close above $0.26 would open the path toward $0.30; failure here risks a pullback toward $0.22 and potentially $0.20 again. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour timeframe, price is at $0.24342, down 1.94%, pulling back after a sharp rally from roughly $0.205 to $0.26, a near 27% impulse move. The Alligator lines are aligned bullishly, with price still above the key moving averages ($0.24045 green, $0.23449 red, $0.22951 blue), suggesting the trend hasn’t fully broken yet. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview The MACD remains positive, though histogram bars are shrinking, signaling weakening momentum rather than immediate reversal. The recent rejection near $0.26 forms short-term resistance; holding above $0.24 keeps the bullish structure intact. A clean loss of $0.234–$0.23 would likely shift control back to sellers and target $0.22. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3150 SELL SMA 5 $0.2655 SELL SMA 10 $0.2724 SELL SMA 21 $0.3168 SELL SMA 50 $0.3375 SELL SMA 100 $0.3821 SELL SMA 200 $0.6116 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3269 SELL EMA 5 $0.3433 SELL EMA 10 $0.3475 SELL EMA 21 $0.3461 SELL EMA 50 $0.3742 SELL EMA 100 $0.4586 SELL EMA 200 $0.6159 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? Dogwifhat is in a short-term recovery within a broader daily downtrend. The 4-hour chart shows constructive momentum, but the daily structure still caps upside below $0.26. Unless bulls reclaim and hold above $0.26–$0.30, this looks like a relief rally inside a bearish structure. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $100 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of approximately $2 by the end of 2026 and between $5 and $7 by 2032. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support. Dogwifhat price prediction February 2026 If the bulls back WIF, the token could reach as high as $0.35 in February. Traders can expect an average trading price of $0.24 and a minimum price of $0.18.

58054165,https://invezz.com/?p=3069526,1771160400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,LATAM crypto news: Argentina fintech faces setback; Brazil weighs Bitcoin reserve,https://invezz.com/news/2026/02/15/latam-crypto-news-argentina-fintech-faces-setback-brazil-weighs-bitcoin-reserve/,"The most noteworthy cryptocurrency developments in the region this week came from Argentina, Brazil, and El Salvador. El Salvador is planning a $100 million tokenised investment program for local SMEs, Brazil is considering a bill to eliminate crypto taxes and establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, and Argentina’s fintech industry suffered a blow when lawmakers revoked a proposal that would have permitted salaries to be paid into digital wallets. Together, these tales demonstrate how governments and businesses in Latin America are experimenting with new models for reserves, investments, and daily financial access, making the region a crucial arena for crypto policy and innovation. Fintech setback in Argentina’s salary deposit reform A proposed labour reform that would have enabled employees to receive their salaries directly in digital wallets for the first time was initially embraced by Argentina’s fintech industry. But ultimately, lawmakers eliminated the clause, which was generally interpreted as supporting traditional banks. Even if surveys indicate that a significant majority of Argentines prefer the right to choose where their paychecks are deposited, the party of President Javier Milei agreed to remove the clause during discussions to gain wider support for the law. Employees are required by law to receive their pay through conventional bank accounts. Nevertheless, the use of digital wallets has increased recently, in part because financial services are more difficult to use. Only 47% of Argentines have a bank account, according to a 2022 central bank survey. This indicates a long-standing mistrust of the institution following incidents like the 2001 “corralito,” ongoing inflation, and frequent limitations on accessing funds. Fintech platforms have thereby made financial access more widely available, with many users turning to apps like Mercado Pago, Modo, Ualá, and Lemon as their main gateway to official digital finance. Brazil considers a strategic Bitcoin reserve and crypto tax exemption A report presented to the Chamber of Deputies Economic Development Committee in Brazil has the potential to drastically alter the nation’s stance on Bitcoin. The plan calls for removing taxes on cryptocurrency gains and establishing a Sovereign Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (RESBit). The new language proposed by Congressman Luiz Gastão, rapporteur of Bill 4,501/2024, will modify the regulation of the cryptocurrency industry, including modifications to oversight and reporting guidelines. The plan would permit the federal government to buy Bitcoin over time, up to a maximum of 5% of the country’s foreign exchange holdings. The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank would work together to handle the assets, which would be kept in cold wallets for further security. Additionally, the law repeals an existing rule requiring brokers and investors to register all cryptocurrency transactions and permits the payment of federal taxes in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is positioned as a strategic reserve that might underpin Brazil’s digital currency, the Drex, and it also offers a complete income-tax exemption on gains from Bitcoin and other digital assets. Strategic alliance aims to tokenize $100 million for Salvadoran SMEs In order to direct $100 million in foreign direct investment into small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) in El Salvador by 2026, Corporación Infinito (COIN) and Stakiny formed a strategic alliance. Through an integrated infrastructure that blends financial structuring, regulatory compliance, and blockchain technology, the effort intends to employ regulated tokenised equity instruments to link local businesses with global finance. The project aims to draw in institutional investors and foreign money seeking to use digital investment methods to contribute to the expansion of Salvadoran firms, according to Antonio Arrué, vice president of COIN. Stakiny, a platform requesting permission from the National Commission of Digital Assets to tokenise equity in private enterprises, will supply the technological backbone. In order to provide real-time cap table management, dividend distribution, governance events, and secondary trading, the model will connect conventional shareholder agreements with digital tokens registered on-chain. To enable tokenised investing for both crypto-native and conventional investors, the platform is made to run on an EVM-compatible network and be accessed via a mobile wallet with biometric authentication.

Bier said: I genuinely want crypto to proliferate on X, but applications that create incentives to spam, raid, and harass random users is not the way. It meaningfully degrades the experience for millions of people — only to enrich a few people. Meanwhile, Christopher Park, director of X’s developer platform, said that all automation and spam through scraping and API will be flagged and eventually going forward. “No more bots/programs that do or incentivize large-scale platform manipulation, engagement farming, spam, & scraping,” Park said. X Begins Beta Testing For Payments Feature In another response, Bier clarified that X is not handling trade execution or acting as a brokerage platform, but rather just developing the financial data tools and links. Ultimately, this Smart Cashtags feature aligns with X’s financial services push and Elon Musk’s broader goal of making the platform an “everything app.” The social media platform looks set to launch X Money, a digital feature that enables peer-to-peer payment. Musk revealed earlier this month at an xAI presentation that X Money has completed internal employee testing and is in a limited beta testing phase over the next two months before a worldwide rollout.",Crypto News|crypto|crypto news|Crypto Trading|Cryptocurrency|Elon Musk|X,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-02-15 13:00:00

While the broader crypto market remains cautious, fresh comments from a European investment executive have added fuel to longer-term price discussions. Bold Forecasts From A German Investor During a recent segment on Der Aktionär TV, Michel Oliver, head of Tokentus Investment AG, said XRP could reach between $7 and $9 in a future bull cycle. Based on reports, he tied that projection to growing institutional use of the network and what he sees as its expanding role in global payments. He argued that the token could serve as a core settlement asset if adoption continues at the current pace. Oliver pointed to infrastructure rather than short-term hype. According to him, the foundation is being laid through licensing wins and partnerships that could support larger transaction volumes over time. He stressed that such growth is unlikely to be fully realized in the current market phase, suggesting the bigger move may come after another reset in sentiment. 😳German news media says #XRP will be the backbone of the new financial system. Targets mentioned: ▫️ $7–$9 in the near term pic.twitter.com/u79obRShDL — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) February 10, 2026 Licenses And Network Expansion Reports note that Ripple has secured more than 60 financial licenses worldwide, including an electronic money license in the United Kingdom. That approval allows the firm to operate certain regulated payment services in the region. The regulatory footprint has been expanding steadily, and that progress has been highlighted as a reason for long-term optimism. The base blockchain is called XRP Ledger. It was created to facilitate quick and cheap transactions. XRP is used to facilitate this. The assumption is that as more institutions are added to this ledger, this token could increase. The counterpoint to this is that this doesn’t necessarily translate to an increase in value. Currently, to go from this price to $9, it would be an increase of more than 500%. While this is possible, it has been done before. It requires a lot of money to come into this market. European Access Broadens Access to XRP has broadened within Europe. The crypto exchange Safello has increased access to XRP within more European Union countries. It has done this after receiving authorization under the Markets in Crypto-Assets framework. The exchange has supported XRP trading since December 2025. Related Reading: XRP Set To Dethrone Bitcoin Within 6 Years, Entrepreneur Says Greater availability can improve liquidity. It can also draw new participants into the market. Still, exchange listings alone rarely drive multi-hundred-percent gains. For now, XRP sits in a rebuilding phase. Some investors are watching licensing growth and ETF inflows as early signs of strength. Others remain cautious, noting that infrastructure progress must eventually show up in sustained demand. The coming cycles will determine whether the $7 to $9 range becomes a milestone or remains an ambitious forecast.

In a recent post, he wrote, “XRP: It’s MAKE or BREAK.. In just 7 minutes, I explain the importance of $XRP holding this 200-week EMA backtest. It remains one of $XRP’s biggest battles to date.” The statement was accompanied by a detailed video analysis focusing on the asset’s interaction with its 200-week exponential moving average. In the video, ChartNerd explained that XRP is currently trading directly at its 200-week moving average, which he marked on the chart with a red line. He noted that the data for this indicator stretches back to May 2017 and that historically, XRP’s behavior around this level has often determined the direction of its broader trend. According to him, the asset has previously either held this moving average as support and continued higher, or lost it and confirmed further downside. $XRP : Its MAKE or BREAK.. In just 7 minutes i explain the importance of $XRP holding this 200 week EMA backtest It remains one of $XRP 's biggest battles to date https://t.co/hzhwK9GDIb pic.twitter.com/2Pv7UohIhL — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) February 13, 2026 XRP Price Action XRP price was around $1.40 and $1.41 during the analysis. ChartNerd emphasized that the 200-week EMA is currently positioned at approximately $1.41, while XRP is trading around $1.40. He described this alignment as a “critical inflection point” based solely on the indicator. If XRP manages to hold above the moving average and establish support, he stated that it could set the stage for continuation toward new all-time highs. However, if weekly closes occur below this level, he warned that it could open the door to a deeper correction. Specifically, he pointed to the $0.70 region as a potential downside target. He explained that this level corresponds to previous highs from 2023 and early 2024, which were broken in October 2024 but have not yet been back-tested as support. He added that a loss of the 200-week EMA could imply a retracement toward that area. Historical Precedents From 2018 and 2022 To reinforce his analysis, ChartNerd referenced previous cycles. He discussed 2022, when XRP reached a local high near $1.97 before entering a bear market. During that period, the asset retested its 200-week EMA, formed a lower high, lost the level, and subsequently corrected further. He noted that when XRP lost the 200-week EMA in that cycle, it declined approximately 49 percent, a move that would roughly align with a drop toward $0.70 if repeated from current levels. He also cited 2018, following XRP’s previous all-time high of $3.30 . At that time, the asset consolidated around the 200-week EMA before losing it. This preceded a substantial decline into the 2020 lows near $0.11. According to the analyst, confirmed weekly closes below the moving average and a failed retest from underneath have historically been among the most bearish signals for XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bullish Case Hinges on Defending Support While outlining the risks, ChartNerd also described a bullish scenario. He pointed to a period when XRP consolidated above the 200-week EMA around $0.70 for over a year before eventually breaking out in November 2024. During that phase, the level was defended as support, which preceded a rally he described as roughly a sixfold increase. If XRP now holds the 200-week EMA and forms a higher low, he said, Fibonacci extension targets could project toward $7.60 on the next impulsive wave. He added that a move into the $5 to $7 range could be possible deeper into 2026, but only if the current level is maintained. ChartNerd concluded by stressing that his analysis was not a prediction but an interpretation of historical chart behavior. He reiterated that multiple weekly closes below $1.40 would significantly increase the probability of a deeper correction, while sustained support above the 200-week EMA could position XRP for a renewed advance.

Paramount Skydance has become the latest company to issue a cease-and-desist order to ByteDance, the parent company of video streaming platform TikTok, over the generative artificial intelligence model. ByteDance launched Seedance 2.0 earlier this week, with the updated model currently available to Chinese users of its Jianying app. While the company says it would soon be available to the global users of its CapCut app, the application has since drawn criticism over its ability to create videos using the likeness of real people as well as intellectual property owned by studios. Paramount Skydance sends cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance According to Paramount Skydance, ByteDance is engaging in what it calls a ‘blatant infringement’ of its intellectual property with its Seedance video and Seedream image generative AI platforms. The company alleged that the Chinese technology company is illegally using its IP, naming several characters and moves, including Dora the Explorer, South Park, Star Trek, The Godfather, and more. The company sent the letter on Saturday, asking ByteDance to discontinue the alleged infringement. The letter was sent from Gabriel Miller, the intellectual property head of Paramount Skydance, and was addressed to ByteDance CEO Liang Rubo. In the letter, Miller mentioned that much of the content that the Seed platforms have been producing contained depictions of famous characters and franchises of Paramount’s. He noted that these materials are protected under copyright law, trademark law, and the law of unfair competition. Miller added that the content in the AI-generated images and videos produced by ByteDance platforms is often indistinguishable, both visually and audibly, from Paramount’s copyrighted characters and stories. He noted that Paramount’s characters such as “South Park,” “SpongeBob SquarePants,” “Star Trek,” “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” “The Godfather,” “Dora the Explorer” and “Avatar: The Last Airbender” have “all been repeatedly infringed by the Seed Platforms’ production and subsequent public performance and distribution of these images and videos.” The intellectual property head also mentioned that the recent release of the Seedance 2.0 video generation tool has seen ByteDance not only continue its infringing activities, but it has now become more prevalent, and the unlawful outputs are now more widely released. In the letter, Paramount asked ByteDance to prevent violations of its intellectual property rights by ensuring that its content is not used or created by ByteDance or the Seed Platforms going forward, and remove all infringing instances of Paramount’s content from ByteDance’s platforms and systems. Hollywood groups blast ByteDance and Seedance 2.0 Paramount Skydance is not the only studio that has issued a cease-and-desist order to ByteDance since the release of Seedance 2.0. According to a previous Cryptopolitan report , Disney sent a letter to that effect on Friday, noting that the company is making its AI platform a pirated library of Disney’s copyrighted characters and franchises. “ByteDance’s virtual smash-and-grab of Disney’s IP is willful, pervasive, and totally unacceptable,” David Singer, a partner at Jenner & Block, wrote on behalf of Disney. Charles Rivkin, CEO of the Motion Picture Association, also issued a statement demanding that ByteDance cease its infringing activity. “In a single day, the Chinese AI service Seedance 2.0 has engaged in unauthorized use of U.S. copyrighted works on a massive scale,” Rivkin said. He noted that by launching a service that operates without safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding established copyright law that protects creators and facilitates millions of American jobs. The Human Artistry Campaign, an initiative backed by numerous Hollywood unions and trade groups, has also criticized ByteDance and Seedance 2.0, calling it an attack on every creator around the world, with SAG-AFTRA saying it stands with the studios in condemning the blatant infringement enabled by ByteDance’s new AI video model.

Two U.S. Senators are pushing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to open an urgent national security review over a $500 million foreign investment in World Liberty Financial. Here is where it gets tense. The money comes from a UAE backed investment vehicle and reportedly gives foreign players a 49% stake in the Trump linked crypto venture. That is a big slice. The timing makes it even more explosive. This all surfaced just days after the inauguration, raising concerns about who might gain access to sensitive financial or user data. Key Takeaways Senators Elizabeth Warren and Andy Kim formally requested a CFIUS probe into a UAE-backed vehicle purchasing 49% of WLFI. The $500 million deal allegedly funnels $187 million directly to Trump-family linked entities, raising conflict of interest flags. Lawmakers argue the structure grants foreign actors dangerous leverage over a firm collecting sensitive U.S. financial data. The Deal and the Threat In a letter sent Friday, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Andy Kim asked Treasury to confirm whether CFIUS was even alerted about the deal. The transaction would give a UAE backed investment vehicle nearly 49% of World Liberty Financial, the DeFi project widely promoted by the Trump family. That is not a minor stake. Reports link the funding to Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE national security adviser. If finalized, the foreign fund becomes the largest shareholder overnight. Source: Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan And Trump / UAE Embassy And this is happening as Trump affiliated ventures are expanding deeper into crypto, putting everything under a brighter spotlight. The real tension is about influence. A $500 million stake is not passive money. It can mean access, leverage, and potentially sensitive internal data. For a project tied to a sitting President’s family, the optics alone are enough to spark political fire. National Security Red Flags The concern is not just the $500 million. It is the data. Senators pointed out that WLFI privacy policy admits to collecting wallet addresses, device identifiers, and even approximate location data. If a foreign backed fund gains influence over a company holding that kind of financial information, it raises serious national security flags. The letter also references executives tied to G42, a tech firm that has faced U.S. scrutiny over alleged links to China. GM family — BIG ANNOUNCEMENT! Watch what our co‑founder @DonaldJTrumpJr has to say about the World Liberty Forum. pic.twitter.com/rkTocmlkem — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) January 20, 2026 Warren and Kim want confirmation by March 5 on whether a formal review is underway. With Treasury pushing for clearer crypto rules, ignoring a potential security gap tied to presidential business interests could turn into a political storm. All of this is unfolding while the broader Trump linked crypto network keeps expanding. Reports suggest roughly $187 million from the deal would flow to entities connected to the Trump family which makes it even more complicated. Will The Deal Unwind? If CFIUS steps in, this could get serious. The committee has the authority to unwind deals retroactively, especially if cybersecurity or national security risks are involved. High profile foreign investments with political ties rarely escape scrutiny. 24h 7d 30d 1y All time With crypto increasingly intersecting with federal oversight, headlines like this can move markets quickly. If Treasury confirms an active review, expect volatility to spike.

Not the sun – that was already white-hot – but rather a brilliant light emanating from its tech sector. A masterclass in digital transformation is underway as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) flexes its blockchain credentials. While traditional financial hubs grapple with aging infrastructure and fragmented regulation, the UAE has gotten its house in order from both a regulatory and technical perspective. As a result, the global financial map is being redrawn and the center of gravity is shifting toward the Gulf. Not content with forming a haven for crypto enthusiasts, the UAE is rapidly becoming the production-grade laboratory for the future of money. If you want to know where blockchain is headed through 2026 and beyond, you should start with the United Arab Emirates. Because it’s here that much of the innovation is happening. Regulated and Ready to Roll Recent regulatory evolution in the UAE has laid foundations for broader stablecoin deployment and digital asset integration. The Central Bank of the UAE has just approved the launch of a dirham-backed stablecoin – DDSC. It’s licensed for institutional and government use cases on a localized blockchain designed for compliant digital finance operations. The launch is part of a wider trend that’s seen the UAE dominate specific onchain spheres of operation – stablecoins especially. Within the region, Tharwa – led by founder Saeed Al Fahim – has already demonstrated demand for institutional yield products powered by stablecoins. Its thUSD token is backed by Shariah-compliant assets including gold, with Saeed Al Fahim articulating this approach as a structural alternative to conventional stablecoins. Alongside dirham-linked tokens, US dollar-pegged stablecoins are gaining regulatory recognition. In addition to thUSD, a USD-pegged token – USDU – has received approval from the UAE central bank under the nation’s Payment Token Service Regulation, marking one of the first formal approvals of a foreign currency stablecoin within its regulated financial system. Circle has also secured operating permissions in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), reinforcing the region’s role as a compliant regional base for major token issuers. The flurry of stablecoin protocols springing up in the UAE are part of a broader shift within the region that’s seen it transition from pilot frameworks to operational use. Everywhere you look, from programmable payments to settlement, and from treasury operations to trade flows, it’s all being shipped under clear oversight but with a mandate to be bold and build cool stuff. In It for Institutions While the full scope of blockchain projects making strides in the UAE extends beyond stablecoin developers, one commonality that connects the West Asian country is its target market. The majority of the products it’s pushing out are targeted at institutions as the UAE looks to seamlessly connect digital assets with mainstream finance. The DDSC project mentioned earlier, for example, is backed by leading domestic players including International Holding Company (IHC), Sirius International Holding, and First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), with the Central Bank’s endorsement facilitating integration into regulated payment and settlement systems. Aside from local currency tokens, stablecoin networks are also being linked as liquidity bridges. Institutional player Ripple has just announced a collaboration with UAE digital bank Zand. The pair aim to interconnect Ripple’s RLUSD with an AED-backed stablecoin (AEDZ), creating cross-currency digital liquidity that reduces friction for institutional counterparties. From Experimentation to Execution It’s easy to reel off a list of funding announcements and partnerships as evidence of activity within a particular region. With the UAE, however, there’s no need to cherry-pick projects to construct a narrative: there’s independent evidence that innovation is afoot. On February 11, the Blockchain Center Abu Dhabi released a report that summarized this trend, crediting the UAE’s regulatory framework with facilitating the institutional frameworks now being rolled out. The report shows the country entering an execution phase “defined by scale, regulatory clarity, and institutional deployment. Evidence of blockchain adoption appears in live, regulated use cases, including a national digital identity infrastructure serving 11 million users, multiple DFSA- and FSRA-approved stablecoins already live, a central bank digital currency in pilot with first transactions executed, and real-world asset tokenization initiatives intending to tokenize $4 billion across real estate alone.” It’s not just hype then – across the UAE, blockchain development is actually happening. If there’s one characteristic that these diverse projects share, aside from skewing overwhelmingly towards institutions, it’s that they’re often localized. This means developing solutions that meet the capital requirements, currency, and cultural preferences of Arabs. But that’s not to say it’s all inward looking: there’s also progress being made in integrating the UAE more deeply with the broader crypto industry. Exchanges such as CoinMENA are improving fiat-to-crypto flows and expanding support for stablecoin trading under local regulatory regimes. Meanwhile, national bank the CBUAE has entered the operational phase of its CBDC, marking a critical step toward a token-ready national economy. Whatever your take on CBDCs, it’s no coincidence that the countries closest to launching their own implementations are already renowned tech hubs with a high degree of digital literacy. What Happens in the UAE Doesn’t Stay in the UAE Exciting as all this innovation is, if you're a citizen of the United Arab Emirates, you may be wondering why it matters to crypto holders in the rest of the world. In short, because while regulations may be geo-fenced, ideas are not. When one region takes the lead in a particular blockchain vertical, be it institutional yield products or RWAs, these concepts tend to be adopted – and emulated – globally. At the same time, a rising reputation for tech excellence tends to form a talent magnet, attracting more developers, founders, and investors who are drawn like moths to a flame. That’s a fair summation of the UAE right now. In 2026, its blockchain sector is on fire – and the heat is radiating outwards. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Right as liquidity thins out, price ripped 4.5% toward $1.50. That is not a coincidence the market can ignore. On chain data shows Binance now holds only about 2.5 billion XRP. That is a noticeable squeeze on the sell side. Less supply sitting on exchanges usually means less immediate selling pressure. And with sentiment slowly turning bullish again, this kind of liquidity drain can add fuel fast. When supply tightens and demand wakes up at the same time, things can move quicker than most expect. Key Takeaways Binance XRP reserves have plummeted to roughly 2.5 billion, the lowest point since early 2024. Nearly 700 million coins have exited the exchange since November 2024, signaling a potential move to cold storage. Analysts interpret shrinking exchange balances as a classic accumulation signal that reduces selling pressure. Is a Supply Shock Incoming? The shift is not small. In November 2024, Binance was holding around 3.2 billion XRP. Now that number is closer to 2.5 billion. That is roughly 700 million tokens gone, about 22% of the stack wiped from exchange wallets in just over a year. Source: CryptoQuant Analysts says this kind of drop usually signals tighter sell side liquidity. When coins leave exchanges, they often move into self custody. That is typically a longer term play, something institutions and whales tend to do when they are positioning, not trading. What makes it more interesting is the timing. This reserve drain happened right after Binance rolled out full XRPL support for RLUSD. Many expected higher on chain velocity. Instead, XRP itself started flowing out. Less supply on exchanges. Stronger price reaction. That combination is getting hard to ignore. The Short Squeeze Scenario What happens next comes down to funding rates. XRP funding recently hit 10 month lows, and historically that kind of reset has often come before strong upside moves. If shorts are getting crowded while exchange supply keeps shrinking, a clean break above $1.55 could spark a sharp squeeze toward $1.80. Xrp (XRP) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time The setup is also getting support from improving regulatory sentiment, especially with Ripple leadership gaining more visibility in Washington. For now, $1.45 is the key level to watch. If price holds there while reserves continue falling, that is the kind of confirmation bulls want before aiming for new highs.

The collaboration will integrate CertiK’s Skynet security intelligence into CoinFound’s data infrastructure, creating a more structured and risk-aware environment for institutional participants. As blockchain markets mature, institutional investors are placing greater emphasis on data reliability, standardized attribution, and continuous monitoring. The partnership reflects a broader industry shift toward combining security intelligence with advanced analytics to support more informed decision-making. CoinFound operates at the intersection of traditional finance and crypto, offering real world asset data terminals, on-chain risk graph analytics, and AI-driven research tools tailored to institutional users. The platform focuses on providing structured data and analytical frameworks that bridge traditional capital markets and decentralized ecosystems. CertiK, widely recognized as the largest Web3 security company, brings its Skynet monitoring system into the integration. Skynet delivers real-time on-chain security monitoring and a structured security scoring framework designed to help investors assess protocol risk exposure. By incorporating Skynet intelligence, CoinFound aims to enhance risk visibility within its analytics layer and provide deeper security context around supported blockchain projects. The companies say the collaboration will focus on four primary areas. First, data and information synergy. The integration is expected to advance standardized data attribution and improve traceability across Web3 environments. In a market where fragmented data sources often complicate risk analysis, aligning structured security intelligence with financial analytics could help create greater consistency and comparability. Second, research and institutional insights. CoinFound and CertiK plan to co-develop research content examining industry trends, on-chain asset structures, and shifting market dynamics. As institutional participation in Web3 continues to expand, structured research supported by verified security intelligence may play a larger role in capital allocation decisions. Third, ecosystem collaboration and brand initiatives. The partnership includes joint events, co-branded educational content, and broader ecosystem engagement efforts. These initiatives are intended to foster dialogue around transparency standards and responsible infrastructure growth within the Web3 landscape. Finally, security insights and risk disclosure. Through the Skynet integration, CoinFound users will gain access to additional monitoring signals and security reference indicators embedded directly within its data platform. This added layer of intelligence is designed to surface potential vulnerabilities or risk factors that may not be immediately visible through financial metrics alone. Industry observers note that as Web3 infrastructure evolves, transparency and security are increasingly seen as foundational requirements rather than optional enhancements. Institutional capital entering the space often demands structured reporting, continuous monitoring, and clearer attribution models similar to those found in traditional markets. By combining CoinFound’s institutional-grade data tools with CertiK’s real-time security intelligence, the partnership seeks to contribute to a more resilient and data-driven blockchain environment. While the companies have not disclosed a timeline for additional product releases tied to the collaboration, both describe the integration as part of a longer-term effort to support institutional adoption through stronger information standards. As digital asset markets continue to converge with traditional financial systems, initiatives that unify analytics and security monitoring may become central to how institutions evaluate on-chain opportunities. The CoinFound and CertiK partnership signals continued movement in that direction. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The past few months, though, do not appear to be a regular correction . Bitcoin traded above $126,000 in early October before it plunged to under $100,000 by the end of the year. Its impressive start to 2026 was quickly halted, and the asset plummeted to $60,000 last Friday, charting a 52% drop since its all-time high. What’s perhaps even more worrying is the fact that most other asset classes, including the precious metal market, kept riding high during this time, charting consecutive new peaks. As such, we decided to ask ChatGPT if it believes BTC is indeed in a bear market or whether this is another ‘typical’ correction. Is It a Bear Market? The AI solution acknowledged the substantial crash in early February, indicating that it “represents a major structural shift.” “Importantly, the $60K zone was a former breakout level during the 2025 rally, which now acts as critical support.” If the cryptocurrency finds a solid support and stabilizes at these levels, as it has done in the past week, the move south could “resemble previous 50% resets seen during strong cycles,” said the AI. However, a breakdown below these levels could “strengthen the bear thesis significantly.” In conclusion to this question, ChatGPT said that BTC is indeed in a bear market, at least by the definition of that phrase. The only thing that remains uncertain is the magnitude and duration. Where Is the Bottom? OpenAI’s platform believes there’s a 35% chance that the bottom was in at $60,000. However, its most likely scenario envisions at least one more leg down that could drive the cryptocurrency to $50,000-$52,000. “The $50K region represents a strong psychological level and prior consolidation zone. A move here would mark a roughly 60% drawdown from the all-time high, aligning with more severe but still cyclical corrections.” ChatGPT also outlined two extreme cases, both of which it believes are highly unlikely – a capitulation crash to $40,000-$45,000 or a full-on investor exodus to under $35,000. Nevertheless, it explained that both of these scenarios would require a massive black swan event, such as FTX’s collapse or a new war. Will Bitcoin Endure? No matter which of the aforementioned scenarios materializes, ChatGPT remains positive on bitcoin’s long-term potential. It reminded that the asset has experienced and survived far worse drawdowns of up to 80% or even 90% in its early days. “The most realistic bottom range currently sits between $50K and $60K, with a deeper flush toward the low-$40Ks possible if macro conditions worsen. However, bitcoin has shown extreme resiliency in the past, and there’s not much evidence to suggest otherwise now.” The post We Asked AI: Is Bitcoin Really in a Bear Market and Where Is the Bottom? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Bitcoin Bear Market,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2026-02-15 13:54:07
58054912,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=273933,1771163711,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Price Plummets: BTC Falls Below $69,000 in Sudden Market Correction",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-falls-below-69000-5/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Plummets: BTC Falls Below $69,000 in Sudden Market Correction Global cryptocurrency markets witnessed a significant shift on March 25, 2025, as Bitcoin (BTC), the premier digital asset, fell below the critical $69,000 threshold. According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC was trading at $68,966.53 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market at the time of reporting. This price movement represents a notable pullback from recent highs and triggers analysis of underlying market dynamics, liquidity conditions, and historical precedent for investor behavior. Analyzing the Bitcoin Price Drop Below $69,000 Market data confirms the Bitcoin price decline breached a key psychological support level. Consequently, traders and analysts are scrutinizing order book depth and exchange flows. The move below $69,000 follows a period of consolidation after Bitcoin’s attempt to challenge its all-time high recorded in 2024. Typically, such levels act as both technical and sentiment-based barriers. Therefore, a sustained break often leads to increased volatility as automated trading systems react. Furthermore, on-chain analytics firms report specific changes in network activity. For instance, the number of large transactions, often called “whale” movements, showed a slight increase preceding the drop. Simultaneously, exchange net flows indicated a marginal rise in BTC deposits, suggesting some profit-taking or repositioning. These data points provide context beyond the simple price quote, illustrating the complex interplay of supply and demand on global trading platforms. Historical Context and Market Cycle Comparisons Bitcoin’s history is characterized by cyclical volatility. Comparing the current correction to past cycles offers valuable perspective. The table below outlines similar percentage pullbacks within bull market phases: Year Bull Market Phase Typical Pullback Depth Recovery Time (Median) 2017 Mid-cycle 30-40% ~45 days 2021 Mid-cycle 20-30% ~30 days 2024-2025* Post-Halving 15-25% (Observed) Ongoing *Current cycle data is preliminary. This historical pattern suggests corrections are a normal part of Bitcoin’s price discovery process. Moreover, the macroeconomic environment in 2025 presents unique factors, including global central bank policy trajectories and institutional adoption milestones. These elements collectively influence investor sentiment and capital allocation toward risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Expert Insights on Liquidity and Derivatives Markets Market structure experts point to derivatives activity as a key contributor to short-term price action. The funding rates for Bitcoin perpetual swaps had been moderately positive, indicating bullish leverage in the system. A cascade of long position liquidations can exacerbate downward moves as exchanges automatically close leveraged bets. Data from Coinglass and other analytics platforms showed a noticeable uptick in total liquidations across major exchanges coinciding with the break below $69,000. Additionally, the options market provides forward-looking signals. The put/call ratio and changes in implied volatility across different expiry dates help gauge professional trader expectations. Currently, analysts observe a cautious but not panicked adjustment in these metrics. This suggests the move is being interpreted by sophisticated players as a healthy correction rather than a trend reversal, though continued monitoring is essential. The Impact on the Broader Cryptocurrency Ecosystem Bitcoin’s price action invariably affects the entire digital asset market. As the dominant market leader, a sustained BTC drop often leads to correlated movements in altcoins. Key areas of impact include: Altcoin Performance: Major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and others frequently experience amplified volatility during Bitcoin downturns. DeFi and NFT Markets: Total Value Locked (TVL) in decentralized finance protocols can contract, and non-fungible token trading volumes may decline as risk appetite wanes. Miner Economics: Bitcoin’s hash price—a measure of mining revenue—directly correlates with the BTC/USD rate, affecting miner profitability and potential selling pressure from mining operations. Institutional Flows: Products like spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and elsewhere see changes in daily net inflows and outflows, reflecting institutional sentiment. This interconnectedness underscores Bitcoin’s role as the foundational asset for the crypto economy. Consequently, its price stability is a major focus for developers, venture capitalists, and regulatory bodies shaping the industry’s future. Regulatory and Macroeconomic Considerations for 2025 The 2025 trading environment incorporates evolving regulatory frameworks. For example, the implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in the European Union establishes clearer rules for exchanges and stablecoin issuers. In the United States, legislative developments and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) guidance continue to influence market access and product offerings. Regulatory clarity, while sometimes causing short-term uncertainty, is broadly viewed as a long-term positive for market maturation and institutional participation. Simultaneously, traditional financial indicators remain crucial. The direction of interest rates, inflation data, and the strength of the U.S. dollar (DXY Index) all create headwinds or tailwinds for digital assets. In a high-liquidity, globalized market, capital seeks the highest risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, shifts in traditional finance can precipitate rapid capital rotation into or out of cryptocurrencies. Analysts monitor these macro signals to contextualize intra-crypto price movements. Conclusion The event of Bitcoin falling below $69,000 serves as a reminder of the asset’s inherent volatility and the complex, multi-factor nature of its price discovery. While the immediate price action captures headlines, the underlying drivers—including derivatives market dynamics, on-chain holder behavior, macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory developments—provide the substantive narrative. For investors and observers, focusing on long-term adoption trends, technological advancements, and sound risk management remains paramount. The Bitcoin price journey continues to be a defining story in the evolution of global finance. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when Bitcoin falls below a round number like $69,000? It often represents a breach of a psychological support level where many stop-loss orders and algorithmic trades are clustered, potentially triggering accelerated selling in the short term. Q2: How does this drop compare to previous Bitcoin corrections? Based on historical bull market data, pullbacks of 15-25% are common. The current move’s depth and duration will determine if it aligns with typical mid-cycle corrections or signals a different market structure. Q3: Should investors be concerned about a long-term trend reversal? One price move does not define a trend reversal. Analysts assess multiple factors, including on-chain holder conviction, macroeconomic backdrop, and sustained trading volume below key levels, to gauge long-term direction. Q4: What immediate effects does this have on Bitcoin miners? A lower Bitcoin price directly reduces the U.S. dollar value of their block rewards, compressing margins. This may force less efficient miners to sell more of their mined BTC to cover operational costs, potentially adding sell pressure. Q5: How do spot Bitcoin ETFs react to such price movements? ETF flows are a key indicator. Sustained net outflows during a price drop could suggest weakening institutional demand, while inflows during a dip might indicate buying-the-dip sentiment and provide price support.

In a brief but pointed message, he stated: “XRP could surge 100% on BlackRock ETF filing, according to an analyst.” The remark reflects growing expectations within the digital asset sector that institutional developments could significantly impact XRP’s valuation in 2026. The statement arrives at a time when regulatory uncertainty surrounding XRP has largely subsided following the 2025 settlement between the SEC and Ripple . With legal ambiguity reduced and ETF approvals for multiple digital assets already established, market participants increasingly view institutional participation as the next potential catalyst. $XRP could surge 100% on BlackRock ETF filing, according to analyst — Amonyx (@amonyx) February 13, 2026 The Institutional Signal BlackRock’s involvement would carry weight beyond that of a typical asset manager. The firm oversees more than $10 trillion in assets and has successfully launched spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded products in recent years. Its filings for products such as IBIT and ETHA set a precedent for institutional adoption in the digital asset sector. An XRP ETF filing by BlackRock would likely validate XRP’s regulatory standing and market maturity. The development would signal that the asset has transitioned into a category considered suitable for mainstream portfolio allocation. Analysts argue that such a move could prompt additional asset managers to follow. Price Implications and Market Dynamics At current February 2026 price levels of approximately $1.40 to $1.50, a 100% increase would place XRP between $2.80 and $3.00. That range would bring the asset closer to its 2025 high of $3.65 and within reach of its historical peak. Supporters of the 100% surge thesis point to potential supply constraints. If institutional funds were required to acquire significant quantities of XRP to back ETF shares, the circulating supply available on exchanges could tighten. Even moderate institutional inflows under such conditions could have an outsized impact on price movement. Some market commentators, including crypto analyst Zach Rector, have previously suggested that capital rotation toward assets with clearer regulatory systems may already be underway. In this context, XRP’s post-settlement status could enhance its attractiveness relative to other digital assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory Context and Caution The 2025 resolution of the legal dispute between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission removed a major obstacle to an ETF structure. The classification of XRP as a digital commodity has made the concept of a spot ETF legally viable in previously uncertain ways. However, caution remains warranted. Market participants recall prior incidents, including a 2023 false ETF report that temporarily moved prices before being disproven. Until an official S-1 filing appears in the SEC’s EDGAR system, any expectation of a BlackRock XRP ETF remains speculative. Broader macroeconomic factors also continue to influence digital asset markets. Inflation data, interest rate adjustments, and liquidity conditions could moderate or amplify any ETF-related rally. Amonyx’s statement underscores a widely held belief among XRP proponents that institutional validation could trigger substantial appreciation. Whether such a filing materializes remains to be seen, but the possibility has clearly become a focal point in the current market cycle.

The authorities continue to unravel a case that has drawn attention from the global crypto community. Michael Greenberg, also known as Mike Green, was reportedly detained in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) about three months ago. He is described as a private investigator based in Thailand. However, Green is not suspected of carrying out the killings of Roman Novak and his wife Anna but is alleged to have had some involvement. Israeli linked to suspects in UAE crypto killings According to reports, Greenberg is under scrutiny for having ties to eight individuals already arrested in the case. Russian investigators reportedly found some crucial information on the suspects’ mobile phones that eventually led to his arrest in Dubai. Novak, a Russian national, had allegedly raised $500 million through a fraudulent crypto application before going on the run. He had previously been convicted in 2020 in St. Petersburg for fraud linked to investment and crypto projects. Novak got a sentence of six years in prison. However, after his release in 2023, he moved abroad and reportedly carried on with their fundraising activities. Russian authorities said Novak and his wife were reported missing after their relatives were unable to contact them. Reports suggest that the couple’s driver last saw them on Oct 2 2025. He allegedly dropped them near a lake in the Hatta area close to the Oman border. The meeting was described as a meeting with potential investors. The couple was lured under the pretext of an investment meeting to a rented villa. The alleged offenders then attacked the couple as they failed to provide access to their crypto wallets. Investigators believe that the suspects discovered the wallet was empty which led to the couple being allegedly killed and dismembered. Their remains were reportedly found on Oct 3. Russian and Emirati authorities are said to have traced the suspects’ movements using surveillance footage and phone signals. They tracked them in Oman and later in South Africa before disappearing on Oct. 4. ‘Wrench Attacks’ rise over crypto holders This massive case is unfolding when the global crypto community is witnessing rising violence against holders and builders. Law enforcement agencies across different countries have reported an increase in so-called “wrench attacks.” In May 2025, masked assailants attempted to abduct family members of the chief executive of Paris-based crypto exchange Paymium in broad daylight. Earlier in 2025, David Balland, co-founder of hardware wallet maker Ledger, was abducted in France. His partner also got captured in a ransom attempt involving crypto, but police managed to rescue the pair. Other incidents have been reported in France, Italy and the United States. Individuals linked to digital asset holdings were allegedly targeted for extortion or kidnapping. As some crypto transactions can be pseudonymous on-chain, enforcement officials mention that physical threats have emerged as a new tool for criminals seeking access to digital wallets.

Roundhill Investments, a company known for building investment products, has filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch the funds. If approved, the products would be a first of their kind, turning election predictions into tradable assets. New ground for ETFs The six funds are not like standard funds that own bonds or equities. Three would pay out if Democrats win, and three would pay out if Republicans win. Each pair covers a different race including the presidency, the Senate, and the House of Representatives. These funds would primarily invest in event contracts whose payouts depend directly on which party wins the specified election. Shares in the winning fund would converge toward $1 per share if the correct party wins, while shares in the losing fund could drop to near zero once results are certified. Typical investment funds don’t deliver binary, all-or-nothing outcomes like this. Each fund’s party alignment and specific race are clearly indicated in its name and proposed ticker symbol, following a consistent pattern: “RED” for Republican and “BLU” for Democratic, paired with “P” for President, “S” for Senate, and “H” for House. The program builds on recent advancements in political wagering. The CFTC dropped its plan to ban political betting exchanges in February 2026. Authorities halted attempts to outlaw websites that previously placed wagers on election outcomes. Michael Selig, the CFTC chairman, stated that the previous approach had gone too far in blocking customers’ ability to do what they wish. He told his staff to create more detailed rules that would allow new goods while preserving the required protections. Financial firms are already investigating solutions that connect elections and investments as a result of this shift. Risks are front and center for investors Eric Balchunas described the idea as “potentially groundbreaking” on social media. He noted that while election betting into regular brokerage accounts could pull in a much larger number of users, wider access also raises concerns. However, critics question whether people will make impulsive bets instead of taking time to think things through. There is also an unusual twist to how these funds are structured. While they purchase contracts tied directly to the 2028 election outcomes, the funds themselves do not terminate afterward. Instead, they’ll roll over and start betting on the 2032 cycle, giving investors a way to stay in the game across multiple elections. Roundhill’s idea might bring in way more everyday investors than the prediction markets we have now. Since these funds would just keep rolling over to the next election cycle, you’re locked into long-term political and regulatory uncertainty for years. The filing warns that the rules could change at any time. Regulators could still step in and restrict or outlaw these contracts. The company advises anyone who is uncomfortable with that uncertainty to avoid these products. The SEC might be the first to allow large amounts of money to be wagered on politics through legal channels if it accepts these funds. Critics fear that the funds may incite reckless speculation or sway public opinion on election outcomes. The SEC now has to review the application and decide whether to approve it. Whatever the agency decides, the outcome is expected to set the tone for whether other financial firms follow with similar products of their own. If approved, it’ll show how far they’re willing to let investing and gambling on elections mix. That could easily lead to more impulsive bets and possibly shape how people feel about politics, while also kicking off a bigger wave of creative financial products that connect markets with real-world events.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2029 expects the token to reach a peak price of $12.20. By 2032, the price of Internet Computer might reach a maximum of $19.21. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. Internet computer blockchain incorporates advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2026? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $2.49 Market Cap $1.367B Trading Volume $64.13M Circulating Supply 548.96M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.23 (Oct 10, 2025) 24-h High $2.59 24-h Low $2.41 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 19.89% (Very High) 14-Day RSI 42.26 (Neutral) 50-Day SMA $3.19 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 8 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 8/30 (27%) 200-Day SMA $4.17 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP is down 2.12% today at $2.494 and is still below key daily resistance at $2.63. Short-term momentum is improving, with a 13% bounce from local lows on the 4-hour chart. Below $2.20, it likely resumes the downtrend; above $2.80, momentum shifts meaningfully bullish. ICP 1-day price analysis As of February 15, 2026, ICP is trading at $2.494, down 2.12% on the day, still capped beneath the 20-day SMA at $2.629 and well below the upper Bollinger Band near $3.217. The broader structure remains bearish, with price printing a series of lower highs since late January and dropping roughly 23–25% from the recent swing high around $3.20–$3.30 to the February low near $2.05. However, the sharp selloff into $2.05 was quickly absorbed, and the price has since stabilized between $2.35 and $2.55, forming a short-term base. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The Bollinger Bands are tightening slightly, suggesting volatility compression, while MACD has crossed upward with the histogram flipping positive, signaling improving short-term momentum. That said, until ICP reclaims $2.63 decisively and pushes above $2.80, rallies remain corrective within a broader downtrend. A rejection here opens the door back to $2.30, and a break below $2.20 would likely retest the $2.05 low, which is the key support preventing another leg down. ICP 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour timeframe, ICP has built a clean recovery structure from $2.30 to a local high near $2.60, marking roughly a 13% bounce at its peak before pulling back. The Alligator lines have flipped bullishly aligned, with price holding above the jaw and teeth, reflecting short-term trend strength. OBV has also trended upward into the rally, confirming participation rather than a weak squeeze. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView However, the latest candle shows rejection around $2.55–$2.60, and the price is slipping back toward the Alligator cluster around $2.46–$2.49. If this zone holds, another attempt at $2.60 is likely, and a breakout above $2.60 could extend toward $2.75 quickly. Failure to defend $2.45 shifts momentum bearish again and increases the probability of revisiting $2.30. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $2.77 SELL SMA 5 $2.53 SELL SMA 10 $2.43 BUY SMA 21 $2.68 SELL SMA 50 $3.19 SELL SMA 100 $3.67 SELL SMA 200 $4.17 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $2.83 SELL EMA 5 $2.99 SELL EMA 10 $3.09 SELL EMA 21 $3.14 SELL EMA 50 $3.42 SELL EMA 100 $3.82 SELL EMA 200 $4.42 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis ICP is showing a short-term bounce, but the daily trend remains bearish. Upside toward $2.60–$2.80 is possible, but the structure stays weak below $2.80. A confirmed break above $2.80 signals potential trend reversal, while a drop below $2.20 likely resumes downside continuation. Is Internet Computer a good investment?

On-Chain Indicator Says Yes,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-to-bottom-at-45k-on-chain-indicator-says-yes/,"The Bitcoin price remains in a fragile phase in its broader market structure, alternating between recovery attempts and lingering macro uncertainty. Structurally, the market is in a transitional state, as it leaves euphoric expansion but is not yet fully in capitulation. Ultimately, current price action reflects a tug of war between long-term conviction holders and short-term speculative flows. Nonetheless, on-chain data suggests that the premier cryptocurrency is likely to embark on more trips to the downside. CVDD: Bitcoin’s Compass to Cycle Lows Since 2012 In a recent post on the X platform, market analyst Ali Martinez revealed that the Cumulative Value – Days Destroyed (CVDD) has identified Bitcoin’s bottom since 2012. According to the crypto pundit, the metric is one of the most respected long-term on-chain indicators for identifying structural lows, and its current value is $45,225. Related Reading: BNB Chain Expands With $1B Fund Access While BNB Price Nears Critical Support Launched by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, CVDD is a long-term Bitcoin valuation metric designed to identify major market bottoms by analyzing the behaviour of long-term holders. To understand CVDD, one needs to recognize the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD). CDD is every Bitcoin accumulated that remains unmoved in a wallet. Now, CVDD tracks the cumulative historical value of destroyed coin days and adjusts it into a valuation model to produce a price level that historically aligns with the major Bitcoin cycle bottom. Since 2012, CVDD has consistently marked major Bitcoin price bottoms with remarkable accuracy. The model essentially measures when older, long–held coins are spent. Because long-term holders tend to distribute near cycle tops and accumulate during deep bear phases. Is Bitcoin Sitting On A Hidden Safety Net? Over time, CVDD has acted as a floor beneath price during severe drawdowns. In past cycles, including the 2015 bear market bottom, the 2018 capitulation, and the 2022 sell-off, the Bitcoin price often approached or briefly fell below the CVDD line before staging long-term recoveries. Currently, CVDD sits at $45,225, a level that represents what many would consider a deep value zone within the current market structure. It does not necessarily imply that price must fall to this level, but rather that it serves as a historically significant structural support if broader market conditions further deteriorate. When BTC trades comfortably above CVDD, it typically signals that the market remains in a healthier macro position. Meanwhile, when the Bitcoin price compresses towards it, sentiment often becomes pessimistic, and long-term accumulation tends to intensify. As Bitcoin consolidates within its current range, it might be helpful to monitor whether the price maintains sufficient distance above the $45,225 CVDD level. A decisive move toward it could signal deeper corrective pressure, while sustained strength above it reinforces the argument that the broader cycle remains structurally intact. As of this writing, BTC is valued at around $70,000, reflecting a modest price increase of nearly 2% in the past day. Related Reading: Bitcoin NUPL Back In Hope/Fear Region: What Happens Next?

According to her post, the proposal identifies XRP alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum as examples of digital assets that could fall under a newly defined category designed specifically for cryptocurrencies. The development, as described in the tweet, reflects an effort to adapt existing financial models to the growing presence of digital assets in institutional markets.

Right now, crypto does NOT have its own category inside the… https://t.co/2DaevF5Uo0 pic.twitter.com/0H8TUgsvpS — Diana (@InvestWithD) February 13, 2026 Proposed Crypto Risk Classification Model In the tweet, Diana explains that cryptocurrencies do not currently have a distinct classification within the primary global risk-modeling framework used by banks to price and manage derivatives exposure. Instead, digital assets are typically grouped into traditional categories such as commodities or foreign exchange. She states that the Federal Reserve staff paper proposes introducing a new “crypto” risk class within the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Standard Initial Margin Model (SIMM), which is widely used across global banking institutions. The attached table in Diana’s post summarizes twelve cryptocurrencies used as calibration instruments in the proposed system. The table distinguishes between floating cryptocurrencies and pegged digital assets, indicating that six floating assets appear in the top rows while six pegged assets appear in the bottom rows. Among the floating assets listed are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP , which are presented alongside trading-volume data, market-capitalization figures, and dataset timelines extending to July 17, 2025. Details Highlighted in the Tweet Diana emphasizes that the proposal would formally separate cryptocurrencies into two categories: pegged assets, such as stablecoins, and floating assets, which include major market-driven cryptocurrencies. She notes that this classification structure mirrors how financial institutions already manage risk across other asset classes within derivatives markets. According to the tweet, the inclusion of XRP in the floating-asset group signals recognition of its market activity within the modeling system described in the staff paper. The table shown in the attached image lists XRP’s trading volume and market capitalization alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. Diana presents the information as evidence that digital assets are being evaluated within standardized financial-risk methodologies rather than being treated solely as speculative instruments. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications for Institutional Risk Modeling The tweet frames the proposal as a structural update to financial-risk systems rather than a policy decision affecting cryptocurrency regulation or adoption. Diana states that banks currently rely on legacy asset categories when modeling crypto exposure, and the proposed crypto-specific classification would align risk measurement practices with the evolving digital-asset market. While the staff paper represents research rather than finalized policy, Diana’s post underscores the significance of cryptocurrencies appearing in institutional modeling discussions. The proposal to establish a dedicated crypto risk class within SIMM suggests that financial institutions are continuing to refine how digital assets are measured, categorized, and incorporated into global derivatives-risk frameworks.

Consequently, Livepeer (LPT), a pioneering network for decentralized video transcoding and streaming, garners significant analyst attention. This analysis provides a factual examination of Livepeer’s market position, underlying technology, and the rational frameworks behind its price predictions for 2026 through 2030, specifically within the burgeoning AI streaming sector. Livepeer Price Prediction: Analyzing the 2026-2030 Trajectory Livepeer operates as a decentralized protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. Fundamentally, it provides a marketplace for video transcoding, the computational process of converting raw video into formats suitable for various devices and bandwidths. The network utilizes a native utility token, LPT, for staking, delegating, and securing the network. Therefore, any price prediction must first assess network adoption and utility growth. Market analysts often reference historical data and comparable growth models. For instance, the global video streaming market size, a key demand driver for Livepeer’s services, continues its expansion. According to industry reports, this market is projected to maintain a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) exceeding 15% through 2030. Subsequently, Livepeer’s potential capture of even a fractional share of this demand forms a core thesis for its valuation models. The Technical Foundation: More Than Just a Token Livepeer’s architecture distinguishes it from centralized cloud providers like AWS or Google Cloud. The network distributes transcoding jobs across a decentralized network of node operators, known as orchestrators and transcoders. Users pay for these services with Ethereum, while node operators earn fees and inflationary LPT rewards for their work and for staking LPT to secure the network. This creates a direct link between network usage, staking activity, and token economics. Decentralized Workforce: A global network provides transcoding, enhancing resilience and potentially lowering costs. Staking Mechanism: LPT must be staked to participate as a node operator, reducing circulating supply. Protocol Upgrades: The ongoing “Livepeer Alpha” roadmap focuses on scalability and new features like AI-powered video analysis. The AI Streaming Catalyst and Market Context The integration of AI represents a pivotal evolution for Livepeer’s utility. Beyond basic transcoding, the network’s roadmap includes support for AI-assisted tasks. These tasks include content moderation, object recognition, and real-time analytics directly on video streams. This capability could serve sectors like live sports broadcasting, security monitoring, and interactive media. Furthermore, the broader cryptocurrency market cycle historically influences all digital assets. Macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and institutional adoption trends in 2025 and beyond will inevitably impact LPT’s price. Analysts typically create multiple scenarios—bull, base, and bear—to account for this volatility. For example, a favorable regulatory climate for decentralized protocols could accelerate adoption, while a prolonged market downturn could suppress short-term price action despite strong fundamentals. Expert Perspectives and Rational Projections Financial modeling for cryptocurrencies incorporates various methodologies. Some analysts use discounted cash flow models based on projected network fee revenue. Others employ Metcalfe’s Law, which values a network based on the square of its number of users. It is crucial to note that all long-term predictions are inherently speculative and should not be considered financial advice. Based on current adoption metrics, total addressable market growth, and technological milestones, several independent analyst firms have published rational outlooks. These projections often hinge on key milestones, such as the successful deployment of AI subnetworks and a significant increase in the number of active video streams processed daily on the Livepeer network. Livepeer (LPT) Rational Price Outlook Framework (Scenario-Based) Year Base Case Scenario* Key Growth Drivers 2026 Growth tied to AI feature adoption and broader crypto market recovery. Launch of AI video tasks, increased developer activity. 2027-2028 Potential acceleration if network captures market share from traditional CDNs. Enterprise partnerships, scaling solutions reducing Ethereum gas costs. 2029-2030 Maturation phase where valuation aligns more closely with sustained revenue and usage. Established as a core infrastructure provider in the decentralized web (Web3). *Price ranges are intentionally omitted to avoid speculative claims. The focus is on the fundamental drivers behind valuation changes. Assessing the “10x Opportunity” in Decentralized Infrastructure The concept of a “10x return” refers to an asset increasing tenfold in value from a given entry point. For Livepeer to achieve such growth, several conditions would likely need to converge. First, the network must move beyond niche use cases to achieve mainstream demand for decentralized video and AI processing. Second, the staking ratio—the percentage of LPT staked to secure the network—would need to remain high, constraining liquid supply. Finally, the total market capitalization of the digital asset space would need to expand significantly, lifting fundamental projects. Comparisons are often drawn to early valuations of foundational internet protocols. Livepeer aims to be a similar foundational layer for video on the decentralized web. The risk, however, lies in execution, competition from both Web2 giants and other Web3 projects, and the unpredictable pace of technological adoption. Investors should conduct thorough due diligence, examining the Livepeer GitHub repository, quarterly project reports, and network activity dashboards to gauge real progress. Risks and Challenges to the Forecast No investment thesis is without risk. For Livepeer, primary challenges include technological scalability to handle ultra-high-definition global streaming demand, the volatility of cryptocurrency markets affecting developer funding, and the ongoing evolution of Ethereum’s own fee structure. Additionally, the competitive landscape is dynamic, with other projects exploring similar decentralized compute solutions. Conclusion In summary, Livepeer (LPT) presents a compelling case study at the intersection of blockchain, video streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The raise to 10% from its previous level of 7% significantly increases the attainable yield available to Buck token holders. At the same time, the Buck team have deployed a number of other enhancements including automated rewards that will eliminate user friction. Buck Ups the Yield Competition among DeFi yield protocols is intense, with each clamoring to safely maximize rewards in a responsible and ultimately sustainable manner. The more yield you can share with users, the more users you’ll attract – and the more loyal your existing users will become. Though not technically competing against synthetic stablecoins – whose yield-bearing analogs pay high single- or low double-digit rewards – there are clear overlaps between Buck and assets such as USDs. In the case of the former, however, Buck users don’t need to stake their stable to earn rewards. This is the very embodiment of passive income. Billed as the world’s first “SavingsCoin,” Buck is built different from conventional yield-bearing stables in a couple of ways. For one thing, yield accrues in real-time, before being collectable in holders’ wallets at the end of each month. It also doesn’t require staking, unlike the vast majority of yield-bearing products. These core properties have now been complemented by a new automatic rewards system that distributes earnings directly to holders. Prior to this, they had to claim manually. These upgrades mean that Buck can now claim to offer one of the most user-friendly products on the market. A New Category Is Born The Buck team is pushing hard for SavingsCoins to become a new crypto category – containing Buck, naturally, and any other emerging assets that fit into this bracket. The idea is that Buck sticks to its dollar peg while, in the background, holders earn yield that stacks up steadily. The longer you hold, the more you’ll earn. When a new month arrives, it’s just a question of collecting the rewards that have been directed to your wallet. Regardless of whether the SavingsCoin moniker takes off, Buck appears to have momentum behind it, and the latest improvements – not least the 30% yield boost – will do its prospects no harm. Automation – together with composability and interoperability – is one of the defining trends in DeFi right now, as protocols look to eliminate multiple hops that impair user experience, be it bridging or claiming rewards. For crypto users who just wanna save, without taking on undue risk or volatility, products such as Buck hold natural appeal. These are the sorts of solutions that will help mainstream crypto, making it easier for non-technical users to onboard and start taking advantage of opportunities to grow their wealth. With its yield hitting double figures, Buck has upped the ante for stablecoin projects. It’s now a yield leader – and according to its team, the best is yet to come.

Now, two chartists point to $72,000–$75,000 as the level that could set the next direction. BTC holds near $70,500 after sharp drop, chart highlights key support zones Bitcoin rebounded over the weekend after a steep selloff, and it traded near $70,572 on the two day BTC USDT chart from Binance. The latest candle showed a gain of about 2.5%, with price rising from an open near $68,854 to a high around $70,983. Still, price sat below a marked resistance line near $72,825, which the chart treats as a key decision point. Bitcoin/TetherUS 2D Binance. Source: TedPillows on X The chart, shared by trader TedPillows on X, shows Bitcoin sliding from the low $90,000s into a fast breakdown that briefly pushed into the low $60,000s before snapping back. Because that move cut through prior ranges, the chart emphasizes nearby demand levels around $65,944 and $60,421, with another lower level marked near $55,123. In other words, the rebound came after Bitcoin touched zones that previously acted as support. TedPillows said $72,000 is the main level to watch. He added that a move through that area could shift attention toward the $76,000 to $80,000 region shown on the chart as an overhead zone. At the same time, he pointed to $68,800 as another level in focus, tying it to a CME gap that traders often monitor for potential fills. Bitcoin trades near $70,700 as Ali Charts compares BTC path to S&P 500 recovery Bitcoin hovered around $70,707 on the chart shared by Ali Charts, as the analyst argued BTC could mirror a recent S&P 500 pattern if it regains a key support level. The graphic places the S&P 500 on the left and Bitcoin on the right, showing both markets dropping sharply, then bouncing, with the next phase framed as a potential climb if support returns.

A horizontal line sits near the mid $70,000 area, which the chart treats as a pivot that separates a deeper retrace from a stronger recovery path. Ali Charts said reclaiming $75,000 as support would “significantly increase the odds” that Bitcoin follows the same type of post dip advance shown in the S&P 500 panel.

This acquisition aligns with the company’s long-term strategy of stacking TRX as a core treasury asset to enhance shareholder value. The latest buy signals Tron's continued commitment to increasing its holdings, further strengthening its position in the cryptocurrency space. The move has garnered attention from investors and analysts, especially with Tron’s founder, Justin Sun, voicing support for the strategy. Last year, Sun emphasized the importance of stacking TRX, highlighting it as a key component in the company’s growth and stability. Following an earlier purchase last week, Justin Sun reiterated his support with a simple “keep going” tweet , reinforcing the belief in TRX’s potential for future value growth. The announcement comes at a time when TRX has been showing signs of stability and positive momentum. While the price of TRX recently fluctuated between $0.2795 and $0.2829, with a slight decline of 0.66%, technical indicators suggest that TRX might be poised for a potential breakout. As the market continues to analyze the coin’s price movement, Tron Inc.’s strategy of increasing its TRX holdings has created a sense of optimism around its future performance. Tron’s Strategic Focus on TRX Holdings Tron Inc.’s latest purchase of TRX tokens is part of a broader strategy to build and maintain a strong treasury, supporting the long-term growth and stability of the project. The company’s TRX treasury now holds over 681 million tokens, with the latest addition bolstering its position in the market. This acquisition is not just a short-term move but a strategic effort to accumulate more assets in a market that continues to show interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Justin Sun’s support for the TRX stacking strategy remains a critical element of Tron's long-term vision despite being investigated in an SEC lawsuit. Sun's confidence in the growth of TRX as a central treasury asset aligns with the company's push to establish a dominant position in the DeFi space. By focusing on acquiring and holding a significant amount of TRX, Tron is strengthening its financial position and signaling to the market that it plans to hold a substantial stake in the future of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Furthermore, Tron's move to increase its TRX holdings comes at a time when many cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, are facing fluctuating prices. By acquiring more tokens, Tron can hedge against potential price volatility while positioning itself for future gains as the market matures. TRX Price Technical Analysis and Market Sentiment The technical analysis for TRX price shows key observations in the price action, suggesting that the cryptocurrency could be on the verge of a breakout. The price has been fluctuating within a narrow range of $0.2795 to $0.2829, with a slight decrease of 0.66%. However, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) at 0.23 indicates moderate accumulation of buying pressure, suggesting that buyers are gaining control of the market. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 43.11 shows that the TRX price is neither overbought nor oversold. The RSI is closer to the oversold zone but remains below the neutral 50 mark, indicating slight bearish momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram shows smaller bars, suggesting that bearish momentum is weakening and a potential reversal could occur. Source: TradingView Buyers are watching the $0.2829 level closely as a breakout point for the TRX price. A push above this resistance level could signal a continuation of the upward trend, with the next target being the $0.30 mark. However, if the TRX price fails to break above this level, it could test the lower support levels near $0.2795 or $0.27.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|TRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-02-15 15:46:20

This clash represents a critical moment for the future of creative rights in the artificial intelligence era, pitting rapid technological innovation against established intellectual property law. Seedance 2.0: The AI Video Generator That Ignited a Firestorm ByteDance, the Chinese technology conglomerate, launched Seedance 2.0 earlier this week, marking a significant upgrade to its AI video synthesis capabilities. Consequently, the updated model initially debuted for Chinese users through the Jianying app, with plans for a global rollout via the popular CapCut editing platform. The tool operates similarly to competitors like OpenAI’s Sora, allowing users to generate short, 15-second videos from simple text prompts. However, its apparent lack of robust content filters quickly drew intense scrutiny. Almost immediately, social media platforms showcased Seedance 2.0’s ability to create hyper-realistic videos featuring copyrighted characters and celebrity likenesses. For instance, one viral post on X displayed a fabricated clip of Tom Cruise fighting Brad Pitt, reportedly created with just a two-line prompt. This demonstration of accessible, high-fidelity synthetic media triggered alarm across creative industries. Screenwriter Rhett Reese, known for “Deadpool,” reacted starkly on social media, stating, “I hate to say it. It’s likely over for us,” highlighting the existential fear permeating Hollywood. Hollywood’s Unified Front Against AI Copyright Infringement The response from major entertainment institutions was swift and severe. The Motion Picture Association (MPA), representing major Hollywood studios, issued a forceful statement from CEO Charles Rivkin. He demanded ByteDance “immediately cease its infringing activity,” alleging that Seedance 2.0 engaged in “unauthorized use of U.S. copyrighted works on a massive scale” within a single day. Rivkin’s statement emphasized that ByteDance, by launching a service “without meaningful safeguards,” was disregarding copyright law that protects creators and underpins millions of American jobs. This institutional condemnation gained further momentum from industry coalitions and unions. The Human Artistry Campaign, backed by numerous Hollywood unions and trade groups, condemned Seedance 2.0 as “an attack on every creator around the world.” Similarly, the actors’ union SAG-AFTRA publicly announced it “stands with the studios in condemning the blatant infringement enabled by ByteDance’s new AI video model.” This unified stance underscores a strategic shift from mere concern to active, coordinated legal and public pressure. The Legal Onslaught Begins: Cease-and-Desist Letters Fly The conflict rapidly escalated from statements to legal action. Disney, whose intellectual property appeared prominently in early Seedance-generated content, moved decisively. Characters like Spider-Man, Darth Vader, and Grogu (Baby Yoda) were reportedly featured in user-created videos. In response, Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance, accusing the company of a “virtual smash-and-grab of Disney’s IP.” The letter claimed ByteDance was “hijacking Disney’s characters by reproducing, distributing, and creating derivative works” without authorization. Paramount Global followed suit, sending its own legal notice to ByteDance. The studio alleged that Seedance platforms were producing content containing “vivid depictions of Paramount’s famous and iconic franchises and characters,” which was often “indistinguishable, both visually and audibly” from its official films and TV shows. This legal one-two punch from two entertainment giants signals a new phase of aggressive enforcement. Interestingly, Disney’s approach appears nuanced; while targeting ByteDance, it has simultaneously entered a three-year licensing deal with OpenAI, suggesting a strategy that penalizes bad actors while collaborating with partners who respect IP boundaries. The Broader Context: AI, Copyright, and a Global Industry at a Crossroads This dispute does not exist in a vacuum. It arrives amid a global reckoning over generative AI’s impact on creative fields. The 2023 Hollywood strikes, partly focused on AI protections, set the stage for this heightened sensitivity. Furthermore, tools like Stable Diffusion and Midjourney have already faced multiple lawsuits for training on copyrighted images without consent. Seedance 2.0 amplifies these concerns into the video domain, where the potential for misuse and market disruption is even greater. The core legal questions are profound. They revolve around issues of fair use, derivative works, and the liability of platform providers for user-generated content. Legal experts note that while U.S. copyright law is robust, it is being tested by AI systems that can mimic style and character without directly copying a specific, fixed work. The outcome of this confrontation could establish crucial precedents. A comparison of key AI video tools and their announced safeguards illustrates the regulatory gap Seedance is accused of exploiting. AI Video Model Company Announced Content Safeguards Current Status Sora OpenAI Refusal policy for IP, celebrity likeness; limited red-team access Not publicly released Luma Dream Machine Luma AI Prohibits infringing content; automated + human review Publicly available Seedance 2.0 ByteDance Unclear; cited as lacking by Hollywood Publicly available in China Moreover, the geopolitical dimension adds complexity. ByteDance’s status as a Chinese company, coupled with the ongoing scrutiny of TikTok, influences the dynamics of the dispute. U.S. lawmakers and industry groups may view this not just as a copyright issue, but through the lens of technological competition and data sovereignty. The company’s next move—whether it implements stringent filters, negotiates licensing, or contests the claims—will be closely watched worldwide. Potential Impacts and the Path Forward for AI Video Generation The ramifications of this clash extend far beyond a single software tool. First, it could accelerate the development of mandatory technical safeguards, such as: Proactive Content Recognition: AI filters trained to block prompts for known copyrighted characters. Digital Watermarking: Embedding imperceptible signals to identify AI-generated content. Rights Holder Databases: Systems allowing IP owners to opt-out or license their assets for AI training. Second, the controversy pressures other AI developers to proactively address copyright concerns before public release. Finally, it energizes legislative efforts, such as the proposed NO FAKES Act in the U.S., which seeks to establish a federal right of publicity to protect individuals’ likenesses from AI misuse. The path forward likely requires a multi-stakeholder approach, balancing innovation with protection. Sustainable solutions may include standardized licensing frameworks, clearer fair use guidelines for AI training, and transparent collaboration between tech firms and creative industries. Conclusion The fierce backlash against the Seedance 2.0 AI video generator marks a watershed moment for the intersection of artificial intelligence and intellectual property. Hollywood’s coordinated legal and public relations offensive demonstrates that major rights holders will not tolerate what they perceive as systemic infringement. This conflict underscores the urgent need for clear guardrails, ethical development practices, and potentially new legal frameworks to govern generative AI. As ByteDance formulates its response, the entire technology and entertainment sectors await an outcome that will shape the creative economy for years to come. The era of unchecked AI video generation is facing its first major reckoning, and the precedents set now will define the boundaries of innovation and ownership in the digital age. FAQs Q1: What is Seedance 2.0? Seedance 2.0 is an advanced AI video generation model developed by ByteDance. It allows users to create short, realistic videos from simple text prompts, similar to tools like OpenAI’s Sora. Q2: Why is Hollywood suing over Seedance 2.0? Major studios and industry groups allege the tool has insufficient safeguards, enabling users to easily create videos that infringe on copyrighted characters and celebrity likenesses, constituting mass-scale copyright infringement. Q3: Which companies have taken legal action? As of February 2026, The Walt Disney Company and Paramount Global have sent cease-and-desist letters to ByteDance. The Motion Picture Association has also issued a strong public condemnation demanding the service cease infringing activity. Q4: How is this different from other AI video tools? While other models like Sora have announced strict policies against generating content with copyrighted IP or celebrity likenesses, critics argue Seedance 2.0 launched without “meaningful safeguards,” making infringement easily accessible. Q5: What could be the long-term outcome of this dispute? The conflict could lead to new laws governing AI and copyright, force the implementation of robust technical safeguards across the industry, and establish critical legal precedents regarding liability for AI-generated content.

The question now is whether next week can deliver further gains and how high the price could go. Here’s what four of the most widely used AI-powered chatbots said on the matter. The Bulls ChatGPT estimated that the most probable outcome for the week ahead is for XRP to rise to roughly $1.60, which it did on Sunday, but has yet to reclaim that level. It claimed that a move north is much more plausible than a renewed crash, based on recent investor behavior. “At the moment, XRP looks more like it’s in a stabilization phase rather than the beginning of a major breakout. The bounce from around $1.10 to $1.50 shows that buyers stepped in aggressively at lower levels, which is constructive. However, sharp rebounds are often followed by consolidation before any serious continuation higher,” its analysis reads. The chatbot projected that an explosion to as high as $2 next week is also possible, but it would depend heavily on a major catalyst, such as a solid revival of the broader crypto market or huge news concerning Ripple and its ecosystem. Grok – the chatbot integrated within X – agreed with ChatGPT’s assumption that XPR is most likely to surge and maintain $1.60 next week. Nonetheless, it projected that such a scenario will only be possible if the price reclaims decisively the important zone of $1.40. Grok also envisioned a jump to as high as $1.80 but expects the rally to occur toward the end of February rather than in the following seven days. Several indicators, including the declining amount of XRP held on the largest crypto exchange, Binance, and the formation of certain technical setups, reinforce the bullish thesis. The Bears Unlike the aforementioned chatbots, Perplexity is pessimistic about XRP’s performance next week and expects the price to decline. It outlined that investor sentiment has been quite depressing lately, predicting that the price may drop to as low as $1.24 in the coming days. Google’s Gemini also envisioned a bearish tilt in the week ahead. It noted that February has historically been a challenging month for XRP, characterizing the $1.35 – $1.40 range as “the line in the sand.” “This level isn’t just a number – it’s the technical floor that has been holding the ‘February slide’ together. XRP is hovering right on that edge, and if it plummets below this, it could open the door to a further plunge to as low as $1,” it concluded.
