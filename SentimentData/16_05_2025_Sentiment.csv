From whispers in private Discord channels to trending hashtags across financial Twitter, one theme is resonating louder than ever—timing is no longer optional. As seasoned traders reconsider their portfolios and emerging buyers search for credible alternatives, a new digital asset has begun capturing attention for all the right reasons. Qubetics is no longer just a name in niche crypto circles—it’s fast becoming the frontrunner in conversations about the next popular crypto coin to buy. The spotlight now belongs to utility-driven blockchain projects solving real-world inefficiencies, not legacy tokens still living off past performance. What distinguishes Qubetics is its clear value proposition and future-ready ecosystem, which is quickly positioning it as the most popular crypto coin to buy among early tech adopters and digital asset analysts. As sentiment builds and interest sharpens, this is quietly becoming the most talked-about crypto presale of the year. Missed opportunities are common in this space—but right now, all eyes are on the popular crypto coin to buy that’s still within reach, and Qubetics may be leading that race. Bitcoin Cash: A Missed Opportunity in the Crypto Revolution Bitcoin Cash made waves when it first emerged as a solution to Bitcoin’s scalability problem. A hard fork of Bitcoin, BCH promised lower transaction fees and faster processing times, aiming to enhance Bitcoin’s usability. However, as time passed, Bitcoin Cash failed to gain the widespread adoption that its creators envisioned. Despite its technological advancements, it couldn’t overcome key barriers such as a lack of mass adoption and a limited ecosystem. The issues facing Bitcoin Cash have become more apparent as newer blockchain projects with more innovative features have gained traction. What once seemed like a promising opportunity for early adoption has now become a cautionary tale. As Bitcoin Cash continues to struggle with its growth, the door is wide open for a new cryptocurrency to take its place as the leading alternative to Bitcoin. In this market, Qubetics has emerged as the rising star in the crypto world. Unlike Bitcoin Cash, which focused primarily on faster transactions, Qubetics offers a holistic approach, providing solutions to real-world problems that its predecessors have failed to address. Qubetics: The New Frontier of Cryptocurrency Qubetics ($TICS) is not just another cryptocurrency; it represents a revolutionary shift in how blockchain technology can be utilized across various industries. With the Qubetics crypto presale in its 34th stage, it has already sold over 512 million tokens, raising more than $17 million. The price of $TICS in this crypto presale stage is an attractive $0.2532 per token, offering an unprecedented opportunity for those looking to enter the market at an affordable price. Unlike Bitcoin Cash, which has struggled to address the challenges of scalability and widespread adoption, Qubetics is tackling these issues head-on with innovative solutions like the decentralized VPN (dVPN), the Multi-Chain Wallet, and the QubeQode IDE. These solutions offer substantial advantages to businesses, professionals, and individuals, making Qubetics a versatile and impactful project. The application of Qubetics spans across various sectors. For businesses, Qubetics provides secure, efficient cross-border transactions, enabling seamless global trade. Professionals can benefit from the Qubetics IDE, which allows them to develop decentralized applications (dApps) with ease. Meanwhile, individual users can enjoy the benefits of enhanced privacy through the decentralized VPN, ensuring secure internet browsing and protection of sensitive data. Qubetics Presale: A Limited-Time Opportunity Qubetics is currently in its 34th crypto presale stage, and with each passing day, the price of $TICS is expected to rise significantly. Analysts predict that once the crypto presale concludes, the price of $TICS could reach $1, yielding a 294% return on investment (ROI). The potential does not stop there; experts forecast a $5 price per token after the crypto presale, representing an extraordinary 1874% ROI. Furthermore, after the mainnet launch, the price of $TICS could soar to $15, offering a staggering 5822% ROI for those who have secured their tokens during the crypto presale. Such remarkable growth prospects make Qubetics one of the most promising cryptocurrencies to buy right now. While Bitcoin Cash’s journey has been filled with missed opportunities, Qubetics is taking full advantage of the current market dynamics, positioning itself as the next big thing in the crypto world. Real-World Applications of Qubetics Qubetics offers tangible solutions to real-world challenges, making it highly relevant to individuals and businesses alike. The decentralized VPN, for example, is poised to become a vital tool for professionals and businesses that prioritize data security. As more people work remotely and handle sensitive information online, the demand for secure internet connections continues to rise. The Qubetics VPN provides a decentralized, encrypted network that ensures privacy and prevents hacking or data breaches, making it an essential tool for businesses in the digital age. For professionals in the tech industry, Qubetics’ QubeQode IDE offers a powerful platform for building decentralized applications. This IDE simplifies the development of dApps, making it easier for developers to leverage blockchain technology to create innovative solutions. By providing the necessary tools for efficient development, Qubetics is positioning itself as a key player in the blockchain ecosystem. Qubetics vs. Bitcoin Cash: A Comparison of Opportunities When comparing Qubetics to Bitcoin Cash, it becomes clear that Qubetics offers far more than just a digital currency. While Bitcoin Cash sought to solve the issue of scalability with a focus on transaction speed, Qubetics aims to revolutionize how blockchain technology is applied across industries. Its comprehensive suite of solutions, including secure cross-border transactions, decentralized applications, and enhanced privacy, provides real value to users beyond just the transfer of funds. Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, has largely remained confined to the realm of peer-to-peer payments, failing to broaden its use cases. Despite its initial promise, Bitcoin Cash has struggled to stand out in an increasingly crowded crypto market, with newer projects like Qubetics offering a more expansive vision for the future of cryptocurrency. Analysts Predict Strong ROI for Qubetics The future of Qubetics looks incredibly bright. With its innovative approach and real-world applications, Qubetics is positioned to experience exponential growth in the coming months. Analysts predict that the value of $TICS will surge following the completion of the presale and the launch of its mainnet. Early adopters who secure their tokens now stand to reap significant rewards as the price of $TICS rises steadily. Conclusion: The Time to Act is Now As digital transformation continues to shape the global financial market, identifying meaningful blockchain projects has become more than a speculative endeavor—it is a calculated decision driven by purpose and functionality. Among a growing field of contenders, few have demonstrated the adaptability, innovation, and real-world application that define long-term success. This has led many to closely monitor platforms showing not only technical promise but also strategic foresight. Positioned at the intersection of practical utility and decentralized architecture, Qubetics reflects the qualities increasingly sought after in the digital asset economy. Its structured development and forward-focused ecosystem make it more than a fleeting headline; it has become a central focus for those evaluating the next popular crypto coin to buy . With its growing relevance across professional sectors, business infrastructures, and everyday use cases, Qubetics is steadily moving from obscurity to prominence. As momentum builds, it is now being viewed as the popular crypto coin to buy for those who missed previous market-defining moments. Ignoring the signals now could mean overlooking what may soon be recognized as the most popular crypto coin to buy in the current cycle.

Whether you’re a seasoned investor or just starting out, keeping up with the latest crypto news is essential. Let’s dive into what’s been shaping the market recently, looking at everything from Bitcoin price action to emerging altcoin trends and the foundational blockchain technology that powers it all. What’s Driving the Recent Cryptocurrency Market Movements? Understanding the forces behind market shifts is key. Several factors influence the value and adoption of digital assets: Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, inflation rates, interest rates set by central banks, and geopolitical events all play a significant role. Cryptocurrencies are increasingly viewed within the broader financial landscape. Regulatory Developments: Announcements from governments and financial regulators worldwide can cause significant price volatility. Clarity or uncertainty around regulations impacts investor confidence. Technological Advancements: Upgrades to existing blockchains, the launch of new protocols, and innovations in areas like DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 drive interest and utility. Institutional Adoption: Growing interest and investment from large financial institutions, corporations, and even countries lend legitimacy and bring substantial capital into the market. Market Sentiment and News: Public perception, major news headlines, social media trends, and overall market psychology can lead to rapid price swings. Positive crypto news often fuels rallies, while negative news can trigger sell-offs. Decoding the Latest Bitcoin Price Action Bitcoin, as the first and largest cryptocurrency, often sets the tone for the entire market. Its price movements are closely watched globally. Recent price action has been influenced by factors such as the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in various regions, anticipation around the halving event, and its status as a potential hedge against inflation or economic uncertainty. Analyzing the Bitcoin price involves looking at technical indicators, trading volumes, and on-chain data, alongside the fundamental drivers mentioned earlier. While volatility is a constant, the long-term trend for Bitcoin has historically been upward, punctuated by significant bull and bear cycles. Exploring Emerging Altcoin Trends Beyond Bitcoin, the world of altcoins (alternative cryptocurrencies) is vast and diverse. Altcoin trends often follow Bitcoin’s lead but also have their own unique drivers based on their specific use cases, technology, and development progress. Some key areas seeing significant attention include: Layer 2 Solutions: Protocols built on top of existing blockchains (like Ethereum) to improve scalability and reduce transaction costs. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Applications recreating traditional financial services (lending, borrowing, trading) on the blockchain. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): Unique digital assets representing ownership of items like art, music, or collectibles. While the hype has cooled from its peak, specific niches and utility-focused NFTs continue to develop. Gaming and Metaverse Projects: Cryptocurrencies and NFTs integrated into online games and virtual worlds. Privacy Coins: Cryptocurrencies designed with enhanced privacy features for transactions. Staying ahead in altcoin trends requires researching specific projects, understanding their technology and market potential, and being aware of the inherent risks associated with smaller, less established assets. How Does Blockchain Technology Underpin the Market? At the heart of every cryptocurrency lies blockchain technology . This distributed ledger system provides the security, transparency, and immutability that make cryptocurrencies possible. Understanding the basics of how blockchains work – including concepts like mining or staking, consensus mechanisms, and smart contracts – is fundamental to grasping the value proposition of digital assets. Innovations in blockchain technology are constantly pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, leading to more efficient, scalable, and interconnected networks. These technological leaps are crucial for the long-term growth and adoption of the entire cryptocurrency market . Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights For anyone involved or looking to get involved in the cryptocurrency market , here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on hype. Understand the technology, the team, the use case, and the market capitalization of any project. Start Small: You don’t need to invest a large amount to begin. Get comfortable with the process and the volatility. Diversify: Don’t put all your funds into one asset. Spread your investments across different cryptocurrencies and sectors you believe in. Consider Security: Use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and research secure wallet options (hardware wallets are often recommended for larger holdings). Stay Informed: Regularly follow reputable crypto news sources to stay updated on market developments and regulatory changes. Be Prepared for Volatility: The crypto market is known for sharp price swings. Only invest what you can afford to lose and try to maintain a long-term perspective. In Conclusion: The Dynamic Future of Digital Assets The cryptocurrency market remains one of the most exciting and potentially rewarding financial frontiers. While challenges like regulatory uncertainty and volatility persist, the ongoing innovation in blockchain technology , increasing institutional interest, and the development of diverse altcoin trends point towards a dynamic future. Keeping a close eye on crypto news and understanding the factors influencing the Bitcoin price are vital steps for navigating this evolving landscape successfully.

The crypto-keen auto and electricity trading company is the former owner of the crypto exchange BITPoint, which it sold to the securities giant SBI in 2023 . Per a Remixpoint investor relations document posted to its website on May 14 and a report from Japan’s CoinPost , the firm spent 500 million yen on Bitcoin on May 13, paying about 15.23 million yen (104,506) per BTC. In total, the firm bought BTC 32.83, bringing the sum of its Bitcoin holdings to BTC 648.82.

The firm began its crypto-buying strategy in 2024. And earlier this month, Remixpoint announced plans to launch crypto staking and validator business operations via a partnership with Omakase. The latter is a validator with a record of operating nodes on at least 20 blockchain protocols. The deal will see Omakase provide Remixpoint with technical support as the firm builds its own validation business arm. Omakase will also provide operational monitoring and risk management services.

TON price has been consolidating in a symmetrical triangle since early December. The wider altcoin market, including Toncoin (TON), recorded a mild correction in the past 24 hours. After an impressive rally last week, the wider altcoin market experienced a significant cooling down of the bullish sentiment, hence resulting in $357 million forced liquidations of long traders. TON price dropped nearly 4 percent in the past 24 hours to trade about $3.09 on Thursday, May 15, during the late North American trading session. As a result, the large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $15.8 billion and a 24 hour average traded volume of about $229 million, had dropped about 4 percent in the past two weeks. Toncoin Network Thrives on Telegram Messenger The TON ecosystem has grown exponentially in the recent past mainly fueled by the vast Telegram community. According to market data from Defillama , the TON network had a total value locked of about $152 million and a stablecoins market cap of around $1.01 billion at the time of this writing. Meanwhile, market data from CryptoRank shows that the Telegram Gifts daily turnover has been growing exponentially since early May, reaching $1.8M two days ago. The majority of Telegram NFT volume came from the Tonnel platform with about $1.2 million, and Fragment with about $220K. What Next for TON Price Since hitting its all-time high, about $8.25 on June 15 2024, the TON price has been trapped in a correction mode to date. However, TON price has established a robust support level above $2.5, which previously acted as a resistance level. #Toncoin $TON is consolidating within a triangle pattern, and a breakout could trigger a 47% price move! pic.twitter.com/0vWVHRjMBG — Ali (@ali_charts) May 15, 2025 In the daily timeframe, TON price has been consolidating in a symmetrical triangular pattern since early March.

This price region is shaping up to be a pivotal battleground, as bulls aim to extend the rally while some analysts warn of an incoming retracement. Optimism remains strong across the market, with altcoins gaining momentum alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, conflicting views persist, with several traders cautioning that Solana may be overheated in the short term following its recent surge. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs – Strong Accumulation Signal Supporting the bullish narrative, new data from Glassnode shows that Solana may be undergoing a trend reversal. After months of realized cap outflows, SOL’s 30-day capital inflows have turned positive, currently growing at a steady rate of 4–5%, a pace similar to that of XRP. This uptick in capital inflow indicates renewed demand entering the ecosystem, hinting that investors may be positioning for further upside. As the broader crypto market heats up, Solana’s ability to stay above the $170 level will be crucial in determining short-term direction. A confirmed hold could pave the way for a push toward new highs, while a breakdown might trigger a deeper retrace. Renewed Demand And Key Resistance Define Next Move Solana is currently trading above a critical demand zone, showing strength as it holds firmly above the $170 level. However, to confirm the continuation of a sustained bullish rally, SOL must break and close decisively above the $185 resistance level. This region has acted as a strong ceiling in recent price action, and reclaiming it would likely unlock the momentum needed for further gains. The current rally across the broader crypto market, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, has fueled optimism that a larger bullish phase may be underway. For Solana, this could mark the start of a powerful trend reversal after months of volatility and uncertainty. Importantly, on-chain data supports this bullish case. According to Glassnode, Solana has reversed its negative realized cap flows, with its 30-day capital inflows now back in positive territory. These inflows are growing at a rate of approximately 4–5%, comparable to what is currently being observed in XRP. This shift signals a return of investor confidence and renewed demand within the Solana ecosystem. Such metrics are critical, as they reflect actual capital commitments rather than just speculative sentiment. If momentum continues and SOL reclaims the $185 level, it could trigger an aggressive breakout and lead the altcoin sector higher. The next few days will be crucial for Solana. Holding above support while attempting to break resistance could define the structure of the next major move. A successful push higher would support the idea that Solana is not only recovering but potentially leading the next phase of altcoin expansion. Traders and investors alike are watching closely as this key test unfolds.

As shown on the chart, the price briefly pushed above both the 200-day EMA ($162.21) and SMA ($181.16), two key technical indicators closely watched by traders. This move signaled strength but was quickly met with selling pressure just below a significant resistance zone near the $185 level — the same region where multiple failed attempts have occurred in the past. Despite the recent 3.5% daily drop, the price action remains bullish as long as SOL holds above the 200EMA. The higher low structure remains intact, and the recent retrace could be viewed as a healthy consolidation if bulls defend this range. A sustained move above the 200SMA at $181.16 would likely trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum and open the door for a push toward the $200-$220 area.

If the $162 zone fails to hold, a deeper retrace toward $150 is possible. For now, all eyes are on whether SOL can reclaim $181 with strength and set the stage for a sustained breakout.

Welcome to the exciting realm of Decentralized Finance, or DeFi. This revolutionary movement is rapidly reshaping how we think about money, investments, and financial services. But what does the DeFi future truly hold? Let’s dive in and explore the incredible potential and the hurdles ahead. At its core, Decentralized Finance aims to recreate traditional financial systems on the blockchain, making them open, permissionless, and transparent. Imagine borrowing, lending, trading, and earning yield directly from others, powered by smart contracts instead of large institutions. This isn’t just theoretical; it’s happening now, and the pace of innovation is breathtaking. Exploring Key DeFi Trends Shaping the Future The landscape of DeFi trends is constantly evolving. Several key areas are driving this innovation forward: Layer 2 Scaling Solutions: As more users flock to DeFi, scalability becomes crucial. Layer 2 solutions like Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync are vital for reducing transaction costs and increasing speed on networks like Ethereum, making DeFi more accessible for everyone. Cross-Chain Interoperability: DeFi isn’t just confined to one blockchain. Projects are working hard to enable seamless asset transfers and interactions between different networks, unlocking liquidity and opportunities across the entire crypto ecosystem. Real-World Asset Tokenization: Bringing traditional assets like real estate, stocks, and commodities onto the blockchain opens up massive new possibilities for liquidity and fractional ownership within DeFi protocols. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): DAOs are becoming the standard governance model for many DeFi protocols, giving token holders a direct say in the future development and direction of the platforms they use. These trends highlight a shift towards a more interconnected, efficient, and user-governed financial future. How is DeFi Adoption Progressing? Understanding DeFi adoption requires looking at various metrics, from Total Value Locked (TVL) in protocols to the number of unique users. While still relatively niche compared to traditional finance, the growth has been exponential since 2020. Institutional interest is also growing, with more firms exploring ways to participate in or build upon DeFi infrastructure. However, challenges remain. User experience can be complex, security risks (like smart contract hacks) are real, and regulatory clarity is still developing in many jurisdictions. Overcoming these hurdles is essential for mass adoption. Deep Dive: Crypto Lending and Borrowing in DeFi One of the most popular use cases in DeFi is crypto lending and borrowing. Platforms like Aave, Compound, and MakerDAO allow users to earn interest on their crypto holdings by lending them out or borrow crypto by providing collateral. This operates very differently from traditional banking: Permissionless: Anyone with internet access and crypto can participate. Transparent: All transactions and interest rates are visible on the blockchain. Automated: Smart contracts manage the lending and borrowing process, including liquidations if collateral falls below a certain threshold. This sector is a cornerstone of the Decentralized Finance ecosystem, providing crucial liquidity and yield opportunities. What are the Benefits of a DeFi Future? The potential benefits of a fully realized DeFi future are compelling: Increased Accessibility: Financial services become available to anyone, anywhere, regardless of their location or status with traditional banks. Greater Transparency: All transactions are recorded on a public ledger, reducing opportunities for fraud and increasing trust. Lower Costs: Removing intermediaries often leads to lower fees for services like loans and remittances. User Control: Users retain custody of their assets and have a say in the governance of protocols they use. Innovation: The open nature of DeFi fosters rapid experimentation and development of new financial products. These benefits paint a picture of a more equitable and efficient financial system. What Challenges Must DeFi Overcome? Despite the bright outlook, the path to widespread DeFi adoption is not without obstacles: Security Risks: Smart contract vulnerabilities and protocol exploits can lead to significant financial losses. Regulatory Uncertainty: Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate DeFi, creating legal and operational risks. Scalability Issues: High transaction fees and slow speeds on some base layers hinder usability, although Layer 2 solutions are addressing this. User Experience: Navigating DeFi protocols can be complex and intimidating for newcomers. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies can impact lending and borrowing positions. Addressing these challenges is crucial for building a robust and sustainable DeFi future . Examples of DeFi in Action To better understand Decentralized Finance , let’s look at a few examples: Consider a user wanting to earn yield on their stablecoins. Instead of a traditional savings account, they can deposit them into a DeFi lending protocol like Aave and automatically start earning interest paid by borrowers. Another example is using a decentralized exchange (DEX) like Uniswap to swap one cryptocurrency for another directly from their wallet, without needing a centralized exchange account. These real-world examples showcase the practical applications of DeFi trends . Actionable Insights for Navigating the DeFi Future For those interested in the DeFi future , here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand the protocols you interact with. Look into their audits, team, and tokenomics. Start Small: Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose, especially when exploring new or complex protocols. Prioritize Security: Use strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication where available, and be cautious of phishing attempts. Keep your private keys secure. Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources and communities to keep up with rapid DeFi trends and developments. Understand Risks: Be aware of smart contract risks, impermanent loss in liquidity pools, and liquidation risks in lending protocols. Approaching DeFi with caution and knowledge is key. The Compelling Summary: What’s Next for Decentralized Finance? The DeFi future is incredibly promising, offering a vision of a more open, efficient, and accessible financial system. While significant challenges related to security, regulation, and user experience remain, the pace of innovation in Decentralized Finance is relentless. Key DeFi trends like Layer 2 scaling, cross-chain compatibility, and real-world asset tokenization are paving the way for broader DeFi adoption . Whether it’s through crypto lending , decentralized trading, or new yield farming strategies, DeFi is fundamentally changing how we interact with finance. As the technology matures and awareness grows, DeFi has the massive potential to onboard millions more users and truly disrupt traditional financial structures.

TL;DR Breakdown: OP/USDT breaches support at $0.752. OP drops 9% as the bears gain control. The coin is below its 20-day SMA at $0.818. Optimism 1-day price chart: OP’s price candle shows a sharp drop of over 9% As of May 15, 2025, OP (Optimism) is under strong selling pressure. Today’s candle shows a sharp drop of over 9%, with the price falling below the middle Bollinger Band, indicating bearish momentum. The MACD is still in positive territory but showing a weakening trend, suggesting fading bullish strength. OP ‘s price candle shows a sharp drop of over 9% Meanwhile, the CMF is at -0.08, signaling capital outflows and weakening buying interest. If OP fails to hold above the $0.74–$0.75 zone, it could retest the lower Bollinger Band near $0.57. A bounce from this support is possible, but overall sentiment leans bearish. Optimism 4-hour price chart: OP shows a clear pattern of lower highs and lower lows OP’s 4-hour chart paints a bearish picture. The price is consistently trending below the 20-SMA ($0.818), signaling sellers have the upper hand. Candles show a clear pattern of lower highs and lower lows — classic downtrend behavior. OP shows a clear pattern of lower highs and lower lows The Balance of Power at -0.72 reflects strong seller dominance, while the MFI at 36.42 shows fading demand and little buying pressure. OP is in a downtrend with bearish momentum building. Without a strong reversal signal or volume spike, more downside looks likely. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7716 SELL SMA 5 $0.8405 SELL SMA 10 $0.7688 SELL SMA 21 $0.7722 SELL SMA 50 $0.7407 BUY SMA 100 $0.8882 SELL SMA 200 $1.2909 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7346 BUY EMA 5 $0.7148 BUY EMA 10 $0.7116 BUY EMA 21 $0.7533 BUY EMA 50 $0.8947 SELL EMA 100 $1.1267 SELL EMA 200 $1.4084 SELL What to expect from Optimism?

The Bitcoin price has been on an absolute tear recently, igniting excitement across the entire crypto market . This isn’t just another blip; many are calling this the start of a significant BTC rally . But what exactly is fueling this surge? And what does it mean for cryptocurrency trends moving forward? What’s Driving the Explosive Bitcoin Price Surge? Several factors appear to be converging to push the Bitcoin price upwards. It’s a complex mix of macroeconomic conditions, institutional interest, and evolving investor sentiment. Let’s break down some of the key drivers: Institutional Adoption: Big players are increasingly getting involved. We’re seeing more corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets and financial institutions offering crypto products. This brings significant capital and validation to the market. Macroeconomic Environment: Uncertainty in traditional markets, inflation concerns, and changing monetary policies in major economies are making assets like Bitcoin look attractive as potential hedges or stores of value. Halving Anticipation: While not immediate, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event is always a major psychological and fundamental factor. Historically, halvings have preceded significant price rallies due to the reduction in new Bitcoin supply entering the market. Increased Retail Interest: As prices rise and positive news spreads, more individual investors are jumping back into the market, adding to buying pressure. Technological Developments: Ongoing improvements in the Bitcoin network and the broader crypto ecosystem, like progress in scaling solutions, also build confidence. How is the Crypto Market Reacting to the BTC Rally? Bitcoin often acts as the tide that lifts all boats in the digital asset space. When the Bitcoin price sees a strong rally, it typically has a ripple effect across the broader crypto market . Altcoins often follow suit, sometimes with even larger percentage gains, though they can also experience sharper pullbacks. Here’s a quick look at how the rally impacts the market: Market Segment Typical Reaction to BTC Rally Why? Large-Cap Altcoins (e.g., Ethereum, Solana) Often follow BTC’s lead, strong correlation. High liquidity, established projects, seen as relatively ‘safer’ altcoin bets. Mid/Small-Cap Altcoins Can see amplified gains (or losses). Lower liquidity means smaller inflows can have bigger price impacts; higher risk/reward. DeFi Tokens Performance tied to overall market sentiment and specific protocol developments. Benefit from increased capital flow into the ecosystem. NFT Market Sentiment can improve, potentially leading to increased trading volume. Often correlated with overall crypto market health and investor confidence. Monitoring the dominance charts (Bitcoin’s market cap percentage of the total crypto market ) can offer clues about whether capital is flowing primarily into Bitcoin or spreading out into altcoins. Are These Cryptocurrency Trends Sustainable? This is the million-dollar question everyone in the market analysis space is asking. While the current momentum behind the BTC rally is strong, no market goes up in a straight line forever. Understanding the sustainability of these cryptocurrency trends requires looking at potential headwinds as well as tailwinds. Potential challenges include: Regulatory Uncertainty: Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies. Unfavorable regulations could dampen enthusiasm. Macroeconomic Shifts: A sudden change in central bank policies or a recession could impact risk-on assets like crypto. Market Corrections: Healthy markets experience pullbacks. A significant rally is often followed by a correction as some investors take profits. Security Risks: Hacks and exploits, while less common for Bitcoin itself, can affect the broader ecosystem and damage confidence in the crypto market . However, the long-term picture remains optimistic for many analysts, citing increasing adoption, technological innovation, and the potential for crypto to play a larger role in the global financial system. Performing Your Own Market Analysis: What to Look For For anyone interested in navigating these exciting times, conducting your own market analysis is crucial. Don’t just follow the hype. Here are some actionable insights: Study the Fundamentals: Look at adoption rates, network activity, development progress, and tokenomics of specific projects. Technical Analysis: Learn to read charts, identify trends, support, and resistance levels. Tools and indicators can help, but require practice. Understand Sentiment: Follow news, social media trends, and investor surveys, but be wary of excessive fear or greed. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider diversification and setting stop-loss orders. Stay Informed: The crypto space moves fast. Keep up with news and developments. Whether you’re focused on the Bitcoin price or exploring promising altcoins within the crypto market , a disciplined approach based on research and risk management is key. The Future of DeFi and Cryptocurrency Trends Beyond the immediate price action, the current environment is shaping future cryptocurrency trends . Decentralized Finance (DeFi) continues to evolve, NFTs are finding new use cases, and institutional infrastructure is being built out. The narrative is shifting from purely speculative trading to exploring the underlying technology’s potential to disrupt traditional finance and create new digital economies. The current BTC rally is not just about making money; it’s a sign of growing confidence in the long-term vision of decentralized technologies and the expanding crypto market . In conclusion, the recent surge in Bitcoin price and the resulting BTC rally are significant events in the crypto market . Driven by a confluence of factors from institutional interest to macroeconomic shifts, these movements are shaping current and future cryptocurrency trends . While challenges remain, understanding the dynamics through careful market analysis and disciplined investing can help participants navigate this exciting landscape. The future of crypto looks promising, but staying informed and managing risk are paramount.

With analysts forecasting potential 25x gains , the momentum shift toward MAGACOINFINANCE is drawing serious attention across trading circles. XRP and Shiba Inu: Profits Recycled Into Fresh Opportunities XRP has been one of 2025’s most resilient performers, bolstered by key legal victories and institutional inflows. Trading above $2.21 , XRP whales have accumulated over 12% of the supply, signaling bullish conviction. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu has seen a revival, climbing 7% in April and benefiting from major token burns and ecosystem upgrades like Shibarium. However, as both XRP and SHIB approach key resistance levels, traders are increasingly looking for new altcoins with asymmetric upside — and MAGACOINFINANCE has emerged as a top destination. MAGACOINFINANCE: A High-Upside Alternative MAGACOINFINANCE has quickly positioned itself as one of the most promising early-stage plays of the year. With over $8 million raised in presale, a price still under $0.001 , and a target listing price of $0.007 , MAGACOIN offers an extraordinary 25x–36x ROI potential . What’s fueling the FOMO? Beyond the price potential, MAGACOINFINANCE has: A scarcity-driven release model that creates continuous demand pressure An independent audit (by HASHEX) that adds credibility and investor trust A viral, politically themed narrative that is dominating crypto conversations Early buyers can also tap into the MAGA50X bonus code , which provides a 50% token bonus — a rare opportunity in today’s crowded altcoin market. Why Traders Are Making the Jump Now For many XRP and Shiba Inu holders, the appeal of MAGACOINFINANCE lies in its early-stage positioning. While blue-chip altcoins are seen as steady holds, MAGACOIN represents a chance to catch the kind of exponential upside typically seen in the earliest phases of past bull markets. Importantly, this isn’t just hype — MAGACOIN’s momentum is backed by strategic execution, community growth, and disciplined tokenomics. Analysts note that coins launched with similar models have historically delivered up to 18,500% gains , adding even more weight to bullish projections.

It feels like it’s everywhere, from news headlines to casual conversations. But what exactly is this digital money, and why is it capturing so much attention? Let’s dive into the world of cryptocurrency, explore its foundational technology, understand the market, and consider what it means for you. What is Cryptocurrency and Why Does it Matter? At its core, cryptocurrency is a form of digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. This makes it difficult to counterfeit. A key feature of many cryptocurrencies is that they are decentralized, meaning they are not subject to government or financial institution control. Instead, they operate on a technology called blockchain . Unlike traditional money, which is physical or represented by digital entries controlled by banks, cryptocurrency transactions are recorded on a public ledger, the blockchain. This transparency and the peer-to-peer nature of transactions are significant departures from traditional finance. Your original content might have included captions for images or other elements, which would be preserved: How Does Blockchain Technology Power Digital Assets? Understanding blockchain is crucial to understanding digital assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Think of blockchain as a distributed ledger that records all transactions across many computers. When a transaction occurs, it’s grouped into a ‘block’. Once verified by network participants (miners or validators), this block is added to the chain of previous blocks, creating a permanent, transparent, and tamper-resistant record. Decentralization: No single entity controls the ledger. Transparency: All transactions are visible to anyone on the network. Security: Cryptography links blocks, making past data incredibly hard to alter. Immutability: Once data is on the blockchain, changing it is virtually impossible. This robust technology is what gives digital assets their unique properties and potential. Any links from your original content would also be kept intact, for example: Read more about blockchain here. Navigating the Crypto Market: What You Need to Know The crypto market is known for its volatility and rapid changes. It’s a global, 24/7 market where participants buy, sell, and trade various cryptocurrencies. Understanding the factors that influence this market is key, whether you’re trading or simply observing. Key factors affecting the crypto market include: Factor Impact Supply and Demand Basic economic principles apply; limited supply and high demand drive prices up. Regulatory News Government announcements and regulations can significantly impact market sentiment and prices. Technological Developments Upgrades to blockchain networks or new project launches can boost confidence. Macroeconomic Trends Global economic conditions and inflation rates can influence investment flows into crypto. Staying informed about these elements is essential for anyone looking at the crypto market . Is Investing in Crypto Right For You? Many people are drawn to investing in crypto due to the potential for high returns. However, it’s crucial to approach it with caution and a clear understanding of the risks involved. Investing in crypto is not the same as traditional stock market investing. Here are some actionable insights if you’re considering investing in crypto : Do Your Research: Understand the specific cryptocurrency, its underlying technology, and its use case. Start Small: Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. The market is volatile. Diversify: Don’t put all your funds into a single asset. Secure Your Assets: Use strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and consider hardware wallets for larger holdings. Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources and understand market trends, especially concerning the broader crypto market and regulatory changes. The potential benefits, like high growth and participation in innovative technology, come with significant challenges, including price volatility, security risks, and regulatory uncertainty. The Future of Cryptocurrency and Digital Assets The journey of cryptocurrency and digital assets is far from over. We’re seeing increased institutional adoption, development of new blockchain applications beyond finance (like supply chain or digital identity), and ongoing discussions about regulation worldwide. While challenges remain, the technology’s potential to reshape various industries and financial systems is becoming increasingly apparent. The evolution of blockchain technology continues to drive innovation, creating new types of digital assets and expanding the possibilities within the decentralized ecosystem. As the crypto market matures, we may see increased stability, though volatility is likely to remain a characteristic. In summary, cryptocurrency represents a revolutionary approach to finance and technology, powered by blockchain . While the crypto market presents both exciting opportunities and significant risks, particularly for those investing in crypto , understanding these concepts is key to navigating the evolving landscape of digital assets . Whether you’re a seasoned investor or just curious, staying informed and cautious is paramount in this dynamic space.

The DOJ will not go to trial on a charge alleging Storm failed to comply with money transmitter business registration rules, but still plans to go to trial in July over allegations he knowingly transmitted funds tied to crimes, conspired to commit money laundering and conspired to violate sanctions law, the DOJ said in a letter filed to the judge overseeing its case. ""The Government writes to update the Court regarding this case, which is scheduled for trial on July 14, 2025,"" the letter said. ""After review of this case, this Office and the Office of the Deputy Attorney General have determined that this prosecution is consistent with the letter and spirit of the April 7, 2025 Memorandum from the Deputy Attorney General."" The April 7 memo, authored by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, directed prosecutors not to pursue cases where regulations may be unclear, or did not meet certain criteria, specifically saying the DOJ should end ""regulation by prosecution."" Prosecutors in another case against the developers of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet have already asked a judge overseeing that case to pause it while they consider the memo. In a statement, Brian Klein of Waymaker LLP told CoinDesk that his firm, which represents Storm, believes ""that this case should never have been brought."" ""Its dismissal would be consistent with the policies of the Trump Administration and the principles outlined by the Department of Justice in its recent cryptocurrency guidance memo,"" he said. ""Roman’s prosecution is a threat to the entire crypto industry and the interests of justice will be best served by its swift dismissal. We will not cease to fight for Roman and that result."" Klein spoke at CoinDesk's Consensus 2025 conference in Toronto on Wednesday, where he also shared his view that the case should not have been brought. ""One of the defenses we've raised, which is recognized in the U.S., is that coding — literally typing out code — you are given free speech protections for coding,"" he said.

Retail long bias is high, but fading short-term activity limits breakout strength. Cardano [ADA] is trading just above a key support level after breaking out of a multi-month falling wedge pattern on the 3-day chart, sparking bullish hopes. At press time, ADA traded at $0.7709, down 5.70% in 24 hours. Therefore, bulls face pressure to reclaim momentum. If the support level fails, downside risks could increase. However, a sustained defense here could reopen the path to $0.84 and higher targets. Are exchange outflows pointing to accumulation? Exchange data shows $9.18 million in net outflows as of the 15th of May. This suggests traders are moving assets off platforms. Typically, such moves indicate accumulation and reduced sell pressure. Therefore, this trend supports a potential bullish outlook if sustained. Cardano may benefit if these outflows continue while the price stabilizes above support. However, if outflows stall and selling resumes, the case for further upside weakens. Source: Coinglass Does retail sentiment lean too heavily on optimism? Retail traders are heavily biased toward the upside. Binance data showed 89.56% of accounts are long on ADA. Only 10.44% were short. This extreme imbalance shows strong optimism but also increases downside risk. If the price dips below $0.75, cascading long liquidations could follow. Therefore, this one-sided positioning remains a double-edged sword. Bulls must stay alert and ready to defend critical levels. Otherwise, retail exuberance could quickly turn into panic selling and intensify the decline. Source: Coinglass Why is ADA’s Funding Rate not supporting the bullish bias? Despite the bullish tilt in positioning, Funding Rates tell a different story. ADA’s OI-Weighted Funding Rate remained at 0.0054%. This flat rate shows that leveraged traders are not confident. Therefore, open interest remains shallow despite optimism. Without stronger leverage inflows, ADA may lack the push to break above resistance. Thus, the spot market is doing the heavy lifting for now. Realized Cap HODL Waves showed a decline in both 0–1 day and 1–7 day holders. This drop means short-term traders are exiting. Fewer short-term movements suggest waning speculative momentum. Therefore, ADA is likely being driven by longer-term positioning. This could help stabilize price action near support. However, without fresh demand, a strong rally may struggle to emerge. Source: Santiment Where are the key liquidity targets now? Liquidation Heatmaps show heavy activity near $0.76, $0.78, and $0.82. These zones will attract price volatility. If ADA surges above $0.78, short liquidations may fuel a sharper move. This could push the price toward $0.84. However, if the price dips below $0.75, long liquidations may occur. These liquidity zones create immediate targets for price action. Source: CoinGlass Conclusively, ADA remains in a bullish structure but faces growing uncertainty. Spot accumulation and wedge breakout favor upside. However, fading speculative interest and flat funding suggest hesitation. If bulls defend $0.75 and reclaim $0.78, targets at $0.84 and $1.00 become realistic. Otherwise, failure here could shift momentum to the bears.",Altcoin|Cardano|News|News 1|Social|Trading View,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'AMB Crypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/ambcrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",ambcrypto,2025-05-16 00:00:20

You’re not alone! The world of cryptocurrency is constantly buzzing with speculation, and understanding the potential trajectory is key for anyone involved. Let’s dive deep into the latest Bitcoin price prediction and what factors are shaping its path forward. What Factors Influence the BTC Price Forecast? Predicting the price of any asset, especially one as volatile as Bitcoin, is complex. However, several key elements consistently impact the BTC price forecast . Understanding these can give you a clearer picture. Supply and Demand: Like any asset, basic economics play a huge role. Limited supply (only 21 million will ever exist) combined with increasing demand tends to drive prices up. Regulatory News: Government regulations or lack thereof in major economies can significantly sway market sentiment and, consequently, Bitcoin’s price. Technological Developments: Upgrades to the Bitcoin network or wider adoption of blockchain technology can increase confidence and utility. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic stability, inflation rates, and interest rates can push investors towards or away from perceived riskier assets like Bitcoin. Market Sentiment and News: Hype, fear, major news events, and even social media trends can cause rapid price movements. Decoding the Latest Crypto Market Analysis Experts use various tools and data points for crypto market analysis to arrive at their predictions. This often involves looking at historical price data, trading volumes, on-chain metrics (like active addresses or transaction counts), and global economic indicators. Recent analysis suggests a few potential scenarios. Some analysts point to strong accumulation patterns, indicating institutional interest and potential upward pressure. Others remain cautious, citing potential regulatory hurdles or broader market downturns. It’s a landscape of varied opinions, making thorough research crucial. Exploring the Future of Bitcoin: Beyond Just Price? When we talk about the future of Bitcoin , it’s not just about the price tag. It’s also about its role in the global financial system. Will it become a widely accepted medium of exchange? Will it solidify its position as ‘digital gold’ – a store of value akin to precious metals? Or will new technologies challenge its dominance? Many believe Bitcoin’s first-mover advantage and robust, decentralized network give it staying power. Its increasing adoption by major companies and financial institutions signals a potential shift from niche technology to mainstream asset. However, challenges like scalability and environmental concerns related to mining are ongoing discussions. Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Investment So, what does all this mean for someone considering Bitcoin investment ? Here are a few actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t rely solely on predictions. Understand the technology, the market, and the risks involved. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, invest a fixed amount regularly (e.g., weekly or monthly). This can help mitigate volatility risk. Think Long-Term: Bitcoin is a volatile asset. Short-term price swings are common. Many investors approach Bitcoin with a long-term perspective, focusing on its potential over several years. Manage Risk: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio; don’t put all your eggs in the Bitcoin basket. Stay Informed: Keep up with news, regulatory developments, and technological advancements in the crypto space. Understanding the market dynamics and having a clear strategy is vital for navigating the potential opportunities and risks associated with Bitcoin. Concluding Thoughts on Bitcoin’s Trajectory In summary, the Bitcoin price prediction landscape is dynamic and influenced by a confluence of factors, from market sentiment and regulatory news to global economic trends. While predicting the exact price is impossible, understanding the underlying forces and leveraging insights from crypto market analysis can inform your approach. The future of Bitcoin appears promising to many, driven by increasing adoption and its unique properties as a decentralized digital asset. For those considering Bitcoin investment , a cautious, long-term perspective coupled with diligent research and risk management is always recommended. Bitcoin continues to be a fascinating and potentially transformative asset to watch.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum stay in the spotlight, other promising coins are showing potential for big growth. If you’re looking for the next wave of top ai cryptos , keep an eye on Web3 ai, Cardano (ADA), XRP, and Cosmos (ATOM). These projects bring more than just hype, they offer practical use, tech updates, and growing community support. From AI tools and multi-chain functions to real-world finance links and network upgrades, each has something valuable to offer. One name leading this trend is Web3 ai. It’s moving fast, not just in vision, but in action. With over $500,000 raised in its first day and now more than $4 million total, it’s showing strong early support. The presale price of $0.000347 and a live-ready platform are catching the eyes of serious watchers. Here’s a look at why these four coins are worth following and how each could impact the crypto space moving forward. 1. Web3 ai (WAI): Real AI Tools and a 1,747% ROI Setup Web3 ai is seeing major growth, with over $4 million raised as it hits Stage 4 of its 50-stage presale. At just $0.000347 per token, the $WAI coin brings something different to the market, early access to a real AI-powered trading suite built for users. Instead of vague promises, Web3 ai ($WAI) delivers working features backed by solid demand. It plans to release 12 AI tools once the token is listed. These tools will offer smart trading alerts, scam filters, portfolio tracking, and risk control, all updated in real time. They’ll pull data from exchanges, blockchains, news, and social platforms, then use AI to turn that data into useful insights. With a final listing price of $0.005242, early buyers could see a 1,747% ROI. Each crypto presale stage brings a higher price, and momentum is strong. Web3 ai is not just hoping to matter, it’s actively shaping how traders will use AI. This isn’t one of those coins riding AI hype without a plan. Web3 ai has the tools ready, the price is still low, and the use case is real. If you’ve ever missed out on early-stage projects, now’s the time to watch this one closely. It could lead the next wave of top ai cryptos . 2. Cardano (ADA): New AI Plans and Cross-Chain Boosts Next on the list is Cardano. Trading around $0.70, ADA recently gained 4.1% in one day thanks to major updates. A key change is the integration of Bitcoin into the Lace Wallet. Now users can manage BTC inside the Cardano setup, helping with cross-chain connections. On top of that, Charles Hoskinson, Cardano’s founder, shared plans to include AI in Cardano’s base structure. This could power up smart contracts and improve dApp performance. The project also has a strong sentiment score, with a Fear & Greed Index at 67, showing investor confidence. Many expect ADA to retest the $0.70 level again soon. With its growing AI focus and proven track record, Cardano stays strong among the top ai cryptos heading into the next cycle. 3. XRP: Moving Forward with Big-Name Support XRP is making headlines again and securing its place as one of the top ai cryptos to monitor. It trades near $2.18, gaining 2.1% in the past 24 hours. After a long legal battle with the SEC, Ripple’s win has cleared the path for future growth. CME Group is now planning to launch XRP futures on May 19. This move is expected to boost institutional interest and trading volume. After a brief dip to $2.08, XRP is showing signs of strength again. Experts think it could reach $4.40 to $6.30 by year-end if bullish momentum holds. With more legal clarity and bigger players entering the scene, XRP is gaining traction. 4. Cosmos (ATOM): Tokenization Tech and Network Growth Cosmos is building a strong case with real-world tech value. Priced at around $4.29 and up 4.5% in the past day, Cosmos is becoming a go-to choice for tokenization systems. Support from names like BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is helping it gain recognition. Its Provenance blockchain now leads a $12.9 billion private credit market, real adoption few coins can claim. The next upgrade, version 23.2.0, will launch on May 6. It aims to improve scalability and strengthen network security. Short-term forecasts place ATOM near $4.41, and investor buzz is growing as the upgrade date nears. With both financial backing and useful tech, Cosmos is staying ahead in the list of top ai cryptos to follow in 2025. The Final Word The crypto landscape is evolving fast, and smart traders are starting to look past the usual blue-chip names to find the next breakout projects. Cardano’s new cross-chain features, XRP’s growing presence in institutional markets, and Cosmos’s role in tokenization tech keep these coins in the spotlight. Still, one project is gaining attention for the right mix of timing, real use, and growth potential, Web3 ai. Priced at just $0.000347, Web3 ai is preparing to launch a full platform powered by 12 AI tools aimed at crypto users. After a strong $500,000 presale kickoff, interest is building quickly. With its tools set to go live soon and more eyes turning toward AI in crypto, Web3 ai could easily rise as one of the top crypto coins fueling the next AI-driven surge.

Among the current buzzmakers is Solana (SOL), which has seen a staggering 92% surge over 37 days, with its price hovering impressively at $181.39. However, while Solana aims for potential resistance at $261, another project, Ruvi, is stealthily laying the groundwork for long-term disruption in blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI). Ruvi’s phase 2 presale is capturing the imagination of early adopters, presenting an irresistible opportunity with its unique blend of blockchain and AI. For investors, Solana’s meteoric rise might be hard to ignore, but Ruvi offers something new and versatile that could reshape industries far beyond DeFi and Web3. Solana’s unstoppable momentum Solana’s strong fundamentals and technical momentum have consistently set it apart. Its recent performance underlines that narrative: Solana has climbed 92% from its 2025 low of $95.16 to the current price of $181.39. Analysts predict a potential rally towards $261, supported by strong technical indicators like a falling wedge breakout and a bullish crossover of moving averages. Key metrics such as DeFi’s total value locked (TVL) on Solana’s network reaching $9.6 billion further validate growing ecosystem strength. While Solana rides its success wave, Ruvi makes a compelling counterargument with its roadmap and real-world applications. Why Ruvi demands attention now Ruvi isn’t just another trend-focused token but a forward-thinking fusion of blockchain and AI innovation. Here’s where it stands out: Affordable Entry Price with High Growth Potential Ruvi’s presale price stands at just $0.015, giving early investors access to significant upside potential compared to Solana’s current price of $181.39. For those who missed out on Solana’s early days, Ruvi could represent a fresh start. Real World Use Cases Across Industries Unlike Solana, which primarily focuses on scaling DeFi and Web3, Ruvi integrates AI to revolutionize industries: Healthcare for predictive patient analytics. Supply Chain Management for intelligent real-time logistics tracking. Smart Contracts that dynamically respond to data-driven events. Deflationary Tokenomics Ruvi’s supply is capped at 5 billion tokens, a scarcity model designed to drive long-term value as demand scales. Early investors also benefit from presale bonuses of up to 100%, which is highly competitive against other early-entry opportunities. Rewards and Incentives for Early Backers Ruvi rewards investors who join early with bonus tokens, making each investment substantially more profitable—even before market pricing takes over. Imagine the possibilities with Ruvi investments To illustrate how Ruvi’s presale multiplies wealth, here are three investor scenarios highlighting its unmatched upside. Scenario 1: Entry-level investment ($600) Tokens Acquired: $600 ÷ $0.015 = 40,000 Ruvi tokens Presale Bonus: 20% bonus adds 8,000 tokens for a total of 48,000 tokens. At $2/token, it grows to $96,000. Scenario 2: Mid-level investment ($2,200) Tokens Acquired: $2,200 ÷ $0.015 = 146,667 Ruvi tokens Presale Bonus: 60% bonus adds 88,000 tokens, totaling 234,667 tokens. At $2/token, it multiplies to $469,334. Scenario 3: High-level investment ($12,000) Tokens Acquired: $12,000 ÷ $0.015 = 800,000 Ruvi tokens Presale Bonus: 100% bonus doubles your balance to 1.6 million tokens. At $2/token, it reaches $3.2 million. These numbers reveal Ruvi’s potential to deliver life-changing returns, especially as industries adopt its revolutionary solutions. Solana vs Ruvi: what’s the difference? While Solana’s surge showcases its dominance in DeFi and scalability, Ruvi explores uncharted terrains. Here’s how the two stack up: Solana: Continues refining decentralized finance operations and Web3 scalability. Its recent rally reflects ecosystem maturity but remains sector-limited. Ruvi: Ventures into AI-enhanced real-world problem solving. This includes healthcare, automated logistics, and resource optimization, offering broader utility. With Ruvi, you’re not just investing in blockchain or crypto tools; you’re investing in pioneering systems set to redefine industries once thought impossible to automate. Why you should act now Solana’s surge to $181.39 fuels excitement, but investors might wonder if the best buying days are behind them. Ruvi, by contrast, offers an entry point at the foundational price of $0.015. The presale is live, time-sensitive, and primed for fruitful rewards. With exclusive bonuses sweetening the deal, 2025’s boldest move might just be securing your Ruvi tokens today. The golden crypto eras are rarely evident until their height has passed. Don’t wait to hear about Ruvi’s soaring success after the fact. This presale phase lays the foundation for a transformed investment landscape.

Celestia (TIA) is drawing attention among analysts and investors as it tests a critical support level near $2.72. The altcoin, which surged close to $10 in December 2023, has seen a steep correction. Yet, this decline has brought it back into a demand zone that previously sparked bullish momentum.

It’s a corner of the crypto universe that’s constantly evolving, pushing the boundaries of traditional financial systems. Understanding the latest DeFi trends is crucial if you want to navigate this space effectively and potentially capitalize on its opportunities. What are the Hottest DeFi Trends Shaping 2024? Decentralized finance isn’t standing still. New developments emerge rapidly. Here are some of the significant DeFi trends we’re seeing gain traction this year: Real-World Assets (RWAs) on Blockchain: Bringing tangible assets like real estate, art, or commodities onto the blockchain to be used in DeFi protocols. This bridges traditional finance with decentralized systems. Layer 2 Scaling Solutions: More DeFi activity is moving to Layer 2 networks to reduce gas fees and increase transaction speed on blockchains like Ethereum. Liquid Staking Derivatives: Protocols allowing users to stake their crypto while still being able to use a tokenized version of their staked assets within other DeFi applications. Decentralized Social (DeSoc) Integration: Exploring ways to integrate social elements and identity verification into DeFi for reputation systems and new financial primitives. Enhanced Cross-Chain Interoperability: Protocols are improving the ability to seamlessly move assets and data between different blockchains, expanding the reach of decentralized finance . These trends indicate a maturing ecosystem focused on efficiency, broader utility, and integration with the wider world. Exploring Decentralized Finance: What Makes it Different? At its core, decentralized finance aims to recreate traditional financial services—like lending, borrowing, trading, and insurance—using blockchain technology. The key difference? It removes intermediaries like banks and brokers. Think of it this way: Feature Traditional Finance Decentralized Finance Control Centralized institutions (banks, brokers) Code (smart contracts) and community governance Access Requires accounts, identity verification (KYC), credit checks Permissionless (anyone with internet and crypto can participate) Transparency Limited visibility into operations Transactions recorded on public blockchains (pseudonymous) Operating Hours Business hours 24/7, 365 days a year Fees Varying fees, often opaque Transaction fees (gas), protocol fees (transparent) This shift offers compelling benefits, such as increased access for the unbanked, greater transparency, and the ability to earn passive income on crypto holdings through various protocols. Diving into Crypto Lending and Borrowing: Earn and Access Capital One of the most popular activities within DeFi is crypto lending and borrowing. Platforms like Aave or Compound allow users to deposit their crypto assets to earn interest (acting as lenders) or borrow assets by providing collateral (acting as borrowers). How does crypto lending work? A user deposits crypto (e.g., Ether, stablecoins) into a lending protocol’s liquidity pool. These deposited assets are made available for borrowers. Borrowers can take out a loan in a different crypto asset, provided they deposit sufficient collateral (usually more value than the loan amount, due to volatility). Lenders earn interest from the fees paid by borrowers. Smart contracts automate the process, including liquidating borrower collateral if its value drops below a certain threshold relative to the loan, protecting lenders. This mechanism creates a peer-to-peer market for capital, bypassing traditional banks. It’s a core component of the decentralized finance ecosystem. The Allure of Yield Farming: High Rewards, High Risks? Another significant aspect of DeFi trends is yield farming . This involves users depositing crypto into various DeFi protocols to earn rewards, often in the form of additional cryptocurrency. It’s essentially seeking the best returns (yield) on your crypto assets across different platforms. Common yield farming strategies include: Providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and earning trading fees plus governance tokens. Staking tokens in protocols to earn staking rewards or protocol fees. Lending assets on money markets to earn interest (as discussed in crypto lending). Participating in liquidity mining programs offered by new protocols to distribute their tokens. While yield farming can offer attractive returns, sometimes significantly higher than traditional savings accounts, it comes with risks. These include smart contract bugs, impermanent loss (for liquidity providers), and the volatility of the reward tokens. Fortifying Your Investments: Addressing DeFi Security Concerns As DeFi grows, so do concerns around DeFi security . The decentralized nature means there’s no central authority to recover funds if something goes wrong. Exploits, hacks, and rug pulls have unfortunately been part of the DeFi narrative. Addressing DeFi security is paramount for both developers and users. Developers must prioritize rigorous smart contract audits and build robust, transparent protocols. Users must exercise caution and due diligence. Actionable insights for enhancing your personal DeFi security : Research Thoroughly: Only interact with reputable protocols that have been audited and have a track record. Understand the Risks: Be aware of potential vulnerabilities, including smart contract risk and impermanent loss. Start Small: Don’t commit large amounts of capital to new or complex strategies immediately. Use Hardware Wallets: Keep your private keys secure offline. Be Wary of Unrealistic APYs: Extremely high advertised yields can be a red flag for potential scams or unsustainable models. Stay Updated: Follow news and community discussions about the protocols you use. Understanding security is key in decentralized finance. While risks exist, continuous efforts are being made to improve DeFi security through better auditing tools, formal verification methods, and community vigilance. Participating safely requires education and caution. Conclusion: Navigating the Future of Decentralized Finance The world of decentralized finance is a frontier of financial innovation, driven by exciting DeFi trends like RWAs, Layer 2 scaling, and cross-chain solutions. Opportunities abound in areas like crypto lending and yield farming , offering new ways to interact with and earn from your digital assets. However, participation demands a strong focus on DeFi security . By staying informed, understanding the mechanisms, and taking proactive steps to protect your assets, you can navigate this evolving landscape with greater confidence and potentially benefit from the revolutionary potential of DeFi.

With bullish technical setups, strong market sentiment, and expanding communities, these coins are now on every serious trader’s radar. Solana (SOL): Technical Strength Driving Momentum Solana has been on an impressive run, recently reclaiming the $169.43 level after rebounding from April’s lows near $115 . The technical indicators are flashing bullish signals: an RSI of 73.70 indicates strong buying pressure, and a bullish MACD crossover suggests the rally still has legs. Analysts are watching for a break above $180 , which could open the path toward $200–$220 this week. SEI: Surprise Performer With Fresh Catalysts SEI has very much outshone expectations since its May token unlock, jumping over 100% last week, and currently at $3.95. Having exited a bullish pennant formation, SEI has digested post-unlock selling pressure and transformed it into a bearish balance. Near term forecasts suggest a shift to $4.47 and longer term targets to $13.66 year end if momentum is maintained. Avalanche (AVAX): Testing Key Levels AVAX is holding firm in the $19–$19.85 range, with analysts eyeing a potential rebound toward $23 if support holds. A break above key resistance could set the stage for a larger move into the $30–$35 range, fueled by DeFi expansion and renewed ecosystem activity. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Star With Explosive Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is garnering serious interest among pre stage plays. With more than $8 million raised in presale, a price below $ 0.001 and target listing value falling below $0.007, analysts are describing it as one of the breakout contenders of the year. Early buyers redeeming the MAGA50X bonus code are entitled to a 50% token bonus boosting returns. THE MOST-WATCHED PRESALE OF 2025 – ACT NOW What sets MAGACOIN apart is its scarcity-driven tokenomics, independent HASHEX audit, and viral political narrative that’s capturing trader interest. Importantly, the project’s ability to maintain momentum across multiple presale stages suggests it’s built for long-term impact — not just short-term hype.

The recent surge in Bitcoin price has captured global attention, leaving investors and enthusiasts alike wondering: What’s driving this impressive rally, and where might the price go next? If you’re navigating the exciting yet volatile crypto market , understanding these movements is crucial. Let’s dive deep into the factors at play and what they could mean for the future of digital assets . What’s Behind the Recent Surge in Bitcoin Price? Bitcoin’s journey has always been a rollercoaster, but the latest ascent has been particularly noteworthy. Several key factors seem to be converging to push the Bitcoin price upwards: Institutional Adoption: The approval and success of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets have opened doors for large institutions and traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin more easily. This influx of significant capital can have a substantial impact on demand. Macroeconomic Landscape: In an environment of economic uncertainty and inflation concerns, many investors are looking for alternative stores of value. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold’, is increasingly seen as a hedge against traditional financial instability. Supply Dynamics: The upcoming Bitcoin halving event, anticipated in 2024, is a significant supply shock. Historically, halvings have preceded major bull runs as the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation is cut in half. This built-in scarcity mechanism is a core part of Bitcoin’s value proposition. Increasing Retail Interest: Renewed positive sentiment often trickles down to individual investors. As the price rises and cryptocurrency news highlights Bitcoin’s performance, more retail participants are entering or re-entering the crypto market . These elements combined create a powerful cocktail of increased demand and constrained supply, naturally putting upward pressure on the Bitcoin price . Navigating the Current Crypto Market Landscape While Bitcoin often leads the charge, its movements significantly influence the broader crypto market . Understanding the current landscape involves looking beyond just Bitcoin. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs has legitimized digital assets for a wider audience, potentially paving the way for other asset-backed crypto products. However, this also means the crypto market can show increased correlation with traditional financial markets, reacting to global economic indicators and policy changes. Altcoins often follow Bitcoin’s trend, experiencing amplified gains during a bull phase and steeper drops during corrections. Analyzing market dominance charts can give you insight into whether capital is flowing primarily into Bitcoin or spreading out across other digital assets . Here’s a simple look at how different parts of the market can interact: Market Segment Typical Behavior in Bitcoin Rally Key Considerations Bitcoin (BTC) Leads the rally, often sees initial large capital inflows. Foundation of the market, often sets the tone. Large-Cap Altcoins (e.g., Ethereum, Solana) Often follow Bitcoin with slightly higher percentage gains. Established projects, generally higher liquidity than small caps. Small-Cap Altcoins Can see explosive percentage gains but also higher risk and volatility. Highly speculative, often driven by specific news or trends. Stablecoins Used for trading and preserving capital during volatility. Essential for market liquidity and risk management. Keeping an eye on overall market sentiment, trading volumes, and funding rates across different platforms provides a more complete picture of the health and direction of the crypto market . Expert BTC Prediction: Where Could Bitcoin Go Next? Ah, the million-dollar question (or perhaps, the hundred-thousand-dollar question!). Predicting the exact future Bitcoin price is impossible, but we can look at various models, technical indicators, and expert opinions to form educated perspectives. This is where BTC prediction becomes both an art and a science. Technical analysts study price charts and patterns, identifying key support and resistance levels. Breaking through significant resistance can signal further upward movement, while failing to hold support could indicate a potential pullback. Common tools include moving averages, RSI, and Fibonacci retracements. Fundamental analysts look at the underlying value proposition, adoption rates, network growth, and macroeconomic factors. The increasing utility of Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, coupled with growing global acceptance, are positive fundamental signals. Several prominent models and analysts offer BTC prediction targets, ranging from conservative estimates just above previous all-time highs to highly optimistic figures reaching hundreds of thousands of dollars. It’s important to remember that these are projections based on current information and historical trends, and market conditions can change rapidly. Key factors influencing future Bitcoin price include: Success and continued inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. The impact of the 2024 halving on supply dynamics. Global regulatory developments regarding digital assets . Overall health of the global economy and inflation trends. Technological advancements within the Bitcoin ecosystem. While high price targets grab headlines, a balanced view acknowledges the potential for volatility and corrections along the way. Successful navigation requires understanding the risks as much as the potential rewards. Staying Informed: Essential Cryptocurrency News for Investors In a fast-paced environment like the crypto market , staying updated with reliable cryptocurrency news is non-negotiable. Information is power, especially when dealing with volatile digital assets . What kind of cryptocurrency news should you be following? Regulatory Updates: Governments worldwide are developing frameworks for cryptocurrencies. Knowing potential regulations can impact market access, trading rules, and the legality of certain activities. Technological Developments: Updates to blockchain protocols, scaling solutions (like the Lightning Network for Bitcoin), and new project launches can significantly affect the value and utility of digital assets . Major Partnerships and Adoption News: When large companies or payment processors integrate crypto or blockchain technology, it signals increasing mainstream acceptance and can boost confidence in the market. Security Breaches and Hacks: Unfortunately, the crypto space is a target for malicious actors. News about exchange hacks or protocol vulnerabilities is crucial for understanding risks and protecting your own digital assets . Macroeconomic News: Global inflation rates, interest rate decisions by central banks, and geopolitical events can all influence investor sentiment and capital flows into the crypto market . Be discerning about your news sources. Look for reputable outlets that provide balanced reporting and analysis, rather than just hype or FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). Actionable Insights for Navigating Digital Assets Based on the current state of the crypto market and the factors influencing Bitcoin price and BTC prediction , here are some actionable insights: 1. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): This is the golden rule in crypto. Don’t invest based solely on hype or someone else’s prediction. Understand the technology, the market cap, the use case, and the risks associated with any digital assets you consider. 2. Understand Volatility: The crypto market is known for dramatic price swings. Be prepared for significant ups and downs. Only invest what you can afford to lose. 3. Consider a Long-Term Perspective: While short-term trading can be profitable, it’s also high-stress and high-risk. Many successful crypto investors adopt a long-term strategy, holding assets through market cycles, particularly for foundational digital assets like Bitcoin. 4. Diversify (Carefully): Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. While Bitcoin is dominant, exploring other promising digital assets can potentially enhance returns, but be mindful of the increased risk with smaller cap coins. 5. Security First: Learn how to securely store your digital assets . Hardware wallets are often recommended for larger holdings. Be vigilant against phishing scams and malicious websites. 6. Stay Informed: As mentioned, regularly consuming reliable cryptocurrency news is vital for making timely decisions and understanding market shifts. Navigating the world of digital assets requires patience, education, and a robust risk management strategy. Don’t chase pumps, and don’t panic sell during dips. Base your decisions on analysis and your personal financial situation. Conclusion: Riding the Wave in the Crypto Market The recent surge in Bitcoin price is a clear indicator of growing confidence and increasing adoption in the crypto market . Driven by institutional interest, favorable macroeconomic winds, and the anticipation of the halving, Bitcoin and other digital assets are once again at the forefront of financial discussions. While BTC prediction models offer exciting possibilities, the path forward in the crypto market will likely involve continued volatility. Staying informed through reliable cryptocurrency news , understanding the underlying drivers of price movements, and adopting a disciplined approach to investing in digital assets are essential for anyone looking to participate in this evolving financial frontier. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to the space, the current environment presents both significant opportunities and important risks to manage.

Cardano, currently priced around $0.80, has shown modest growth, with projections suggesting a potential rise to $1.13 by the end of the year, a 43% increase from its current value. While ADA’s development, including the Hydra scaling solution, offers long-term promise, its price movement has been relatively stagnant, leading investors to seek higher-yielding alternatives. Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi protocol that has garnered attention during its presale phase. The altcoin’s presale is already in phase four which is already over 80% sold out and the tokens are going for $0.025. The platform has so far raised more than $8.2 million. Over 9800 investors have already joined, with price set to hit $0.03 in the subsequent round. Investors in this round can expect up to 140% returns when the token’s projected launch price of $0.06 is realized. This robust backing and growth potential position Mutuum Finance as a compelling alternative for investors aiming for significant gains in the crypto market. Mutuum Finance: A New DeFi Behemoth in the Making Mutuum Finance transforms the decentralized lending world through its exceptional dual borrowing system which drives broad market adoption. Mutuum Finance has gained support from over 9800 investors during its presale period which has resulted in raising $8.2 million for the project. Early adopters who participate in Phase 4 will benefit from monumental gains because the token price is $0.025 but Phase 5 will bring it to $0.03. According to experts MUTM has the potential to reach more than $5 by the end of this year beginning at its listing price of $0.06 due to its innovative lending system which addresses the growing requirements of DeFi platforms. The game-shifting model of Mutuum Finance drives its increasing popularity because it operates as a solid token although undervalued. A real-time leaderboard of the top 50 holders of MUTM has been activated by the project’s team. Successful token holders who do not fall below their position will be rewarded with bonuses that amplify both their position value and long-term investment in MUTM. The growing interest of investors in utility-based projects over hype-based projects is indicative of MUTM’s success at being able to demonstrate profitable substance-based cryptocurrency projects. Disrupting DeFi Lending with a Two-Model Approach Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing the DeFi lending landscape with its innovative merge of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. The P2C model is enabling users to earn passive income by lending their USDT through automated liquidity pools managed by smart contracts. Users can now start direct Peer-to-Peer transactions without depending on third parties because of the P2P model which gives users total control over their assets. Mutuum Finance combines the P2P system with P2C to provide streamlining operations and profitable investment opportunities for users. Fueling Community Growth with Reward Programs To enhance its user base Mutuum Finance has established various incentive plans for acquisition. The platform devotes $100,000 to give ten investors each $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The platform provides rewards to users who successfully refer potential new users to join the platform. New users who join early receive extra advantages such as elite community updates which enhance their connection to the platform. Mutuum Finance is replacing Cardano in investor portfolios as traders chase higher returns. While ADA hovers around $0.80 with slow growth, MUTM has already raised $8.2M and onboarded over 9,800 holders in its presale. At $0.025, Phase 4 buyers eye a 140% gain by launch at $0.06. Its dual lending model and leaderboard rewards push real engagement and long-term value.

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and tech observers, understanding the capabilities and limitations of artificial intelligence is crucial. A recent incident involving Anthropic’s Claude AI chatbot highlights a significant challenge: AI hallucinations . This event saw a lawyer representing Anthropic forced to apologize in court after their AI generated a fake legal citation. The Embarrassing Reality of AI Hallucinations The incident unfolded in a Northern California court during Anthropic’s ongoing legal battle with music publishers. According to a court filing, a lawyer for Anthropic admitted to using an erroneous citation produced by the company’s own Claude AI chatbot. The AI had completely fabricated the citation, providing an inaccurate title and authors. Anthropic’s lawyers explained that their standard manual citation check failed to catch this specific error, along with several others caused by Claude’s tendency to hallucinate. The company issued an apology, describing the error as an “honest citation mistake and not a fabrication of authority.” This event underscores a critical risk when integrating AI into professional workflows, especially in high-stakes environments like legal proceedings. While AI offers immense potential for efficiency, its current limitations, particularly the phenomenon of generating plausible-sounding but entirely false information, known as AI hallucinations , remain a significant hurdle. Navigating AI in Law : A Growing Challenge This isn’t an isolated incident. The use of AI in law is a rapidly evolving area, but it comes with considerable pitfalls. Earlier in the week of the Anthropic filing, lawyers for Universal Music Group and other music publishers accused Anthropic’s expert witness of using Claude to cite fake articles in her testimony. This led Federal Judge Susan van Keulen to order Anthropic to formally respond to the allegations. These cases are part of broader legal disputes between copyright owners and tech companies regarding the use of copyrighted material to train generative AI models. The core question revolves around whether using vast datasets, including copyrighted works, constitutes fair use or infringement. The legal profession has seen other instances where AI-generated errors have caused problems: A California judge recently criticized two law firms for submitting “bogus AI-generated research” to his court. In January, an Australian lawyer faced scrutiny after using ChatGPT to prepare court documents that included faulty citations. These examples highlight the urgent need for legal professionals to exercise extreme caution and implement robust verification processes when utilizing AI tools for research or drafting. The Paradox: Challenges vs. Investment in Legal Tech Despite these embarrassing and potentially damaging errors, the drive to automate legal work using AI shows no signs of slowing down. Investment in legal tech startups continues to grow, reflecting confidence in AI’s long-term potential to transform the industry. For instance, Harvey, a company using generative AI models to assist lawyers, is reportedly seeking to raise over $250 million, which could value the company at $5 billion. This indicates that while current AI tools like Anthropic Claude present challenges related to accuracy, investors and legal professionals see significant value in the efficiency and capabilities AI can eventually bring to legal tasks. The promise of AI in legal research, document review, and contract analysis remains strong, but the recent incidents serve as a stark reminder that the technology is not yet foolproof. Users must be vigilant in verifying AI-generated output, especially critical information like legal citations. The Importance of Verifying AI Legal Citation The core issue in the Anthropic case was the failure to verify the AI legal citation provided by Claude. While AI can quickly surface potential sources or draft initial text, the responsibility for accuracy ultimately rests with the human user. Legal standards require precise and verifiable citations, and relying solely on an AI tool without independent checking is clearly risky. This incident underscores the current state of AI in professional applications: powerful tools for assistance and initial drafts, but not yet reliable enough for final, unverified output in critical contexts. As legal tech evolves, the focus will likely shift towards AI systems that are not only efficient but also highly reliable and transparent in their sourcing. Conclusion: A Cautionary Tale for AI Adoption The case of Anthropic’s lawyer apologizing for a hallucinated AI legal citation from Anthropic Claude is a cautionary tale for any professional considering integrating AI into their workflow, particularly in fields requiring high accuracy like law. While the potential benefits of AI in law and the growth of legal tech are undeniable, the current reality of AI hallucinations necessitates rigorous human oversight and verification. As AI technology matures, we can expect improvements in accuracy and reliability. However, for now, users must remain aware of the limitations and implement strict checks to prevent errors that could have serious consequences.

Technical rejection at $1.20 and declining derivatives metrics support short-term downside risk. A wallet linked to DeFiance Capital deposited 9.3 million LDO, worth about $10.1 million, into major exchanges. These include Binance, OKX, Bybit, and Gate.io within the last 48 hours. Such large-scale inflows often signal planned sell-offs, especially during price drops. At the time of writing, Lido DAO [LDO] saw a sharp 10.37% drop in the past 24 hours, falling to $1.01. This drop, paired with exchange movement, has raised concerns over further downside pressure in the short term. Trouble for LDO’s price stability Lido DAO showed weakening engagement across its network. Daily Active Addresses hover at 139, while transaction count has slipped to 72. This trend suggests fewer users are interacting with the protocol. Consequently, falling user metrics typically lead to reduced organic demand. Moreover, network inactivity often correlates with price stagnation or correction. When large holders move tokens to exchanges amid weak participation, the result tends to be negative. Source: Santiment Moreover, Price DAA Divergence stood at -6.55%, reinforcing the bearish outlook. The value meant that the recent price action lacked user-driven strength. In most cases, price increases that outpace user growth do not last. Therefore, this gap points to an unstable rally. When the price climbs without support from users, the risk of correction increases sharply. Unless participation rises, price will likely retreat again. Market metrics reflect caution as buyers hesitate LDO’s MVRV Z-Score hovered around -0.133, suggesting mild undervaluation. This score means holders are near breakeven. However, the signal lacks strong accumulation pressure. In previous cycles, deeper MVRV lows often triggered significant rebounds. That’s not the case here. Buyers appear hesitant. The level is neutral and does not hint at a reversal. Therefore, LDO remains vulnerable. Source: Santiment For recovery to build, the market needs stronger signals of undervaluation. As of now, the incentive to buy remains weak. Derivatives metrics reflect growing caution. In fact, trading volume has dropped 24.22%, falling to $172.36 million. Additionally, Open Interest has declined 9.79% to $129.93 million. These steep reductions show traders are closing positions and avoiding new ones. This behavior limits volatility and dampens upward momentum. Without leverage support, price action becomes sluggish. Moreover, falling derivatives activity often follows bearish price moves. Will LDO survive the sell pressure or break lower? LDO failed to break resistance at $1.20. The price now trades just above key support at $0.90. If this support breaks, the next targets lie near $0.74 and $0.57. RSI stands at 41.80, suggesting weakening strength. Momentum remains soft and shows no clear bullish reversal. Therefore, the price may dip further in the coming days. Unless $0.90 holds firmly, sellers could take control. Over the next 5–7 days, LDO may test $0.74 if bearish pressure increases. Source: TradingView Ultimately, Lido DAO faces intensifying short-term downside risks, driven by large exchange deposits and fading on-chain activity. The drop in daily user engagement, combined with bearish divergence and neutral MVRV levels, reflects weakening conviction among investors.

The Link Between XRP And USOIL In a two-hour TradingView screenshot posted on 14 May, the analyst shows the XRP/USOIL pair fading—twice—in the exact same resistance shelf that has capped price action since mid-December. “Last night we tapped the five-month range high again and price rejected perfectly,” he wrote, adding that “it’s amazing how much we are respecting this level as it gives a clear zone bulls need to fully regain for the next impulse higher.” Since December last year, the XRP price has been hammered down six times in the exact same resistance area. On May 13, Dom wrote: “ Could you ask for a cleaner range? This chart should be in a textbook… We know the importance of this range high. If it breaks, the probability $XRP goes to a new ATH goes up drastically. We know what happened right after BTC / USOIL hit it’s ATH 2 weeks ago, I would expect something similar here. Patience, this needs steam to breakout here.” Related Reading: XRP Surges Past Neckline—Analyst Projects Rally To $3.57 That ceiling is circumscribed on Dom’s chart by a charcoal-grey block from roughly 0.0418 to 0.0430. Each of the last two probes into the band—one during Asian trade on 12 May, the second during the New-York session on 14 May—produced sharp downside wicks. Momentum, moreover, is flowing against heavy sell pressure in the spot token. Citing on-chain order-flow analytics, Dom highlighted that “$210 million of XRP has been net-market-sold over the past seven days—despite this, XRP is up twenty percent.” He argues that such divergence implies absorption by professional liquidity providers rather than retail exuberance: “Market makers or whales are likely soaking up aggressive asks through passive limit bids. When that dynamic persists, it usually precedes an explosive upside once sellers exhaust themselves.” Community members quickly asked what a definitive breakout could portend for XRP priced in dollars. One follower, The Standard (@Xrpdemon589), pressed: “Would you say if it breaks it, it will have another parabolic move up breaking ATH?” Dom responded, “If we see a full breakout, historically yes, it’s only time until XRP/USD prints a new high.” Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: $36 Is In The Cards As 3-Month Timeframe Turns Bullish? Crypto commentator Moon Lambo (@MoonLamboio) queried the intellectual basis for linking an energy-based ratio to the standalone token. Dom conceded no fundamental thesis is proven, but stressed the analytical utility: “I really just think it provides another perspective of price action when we peg it to something deeply woven into the economic system. I don’t think there is any specific relationship—rather, it’s useful to see things you wouldn’t otherwise see on the USD pair.” Technically, the map is binary. Dom reiterated that he has “alerts set for a full breakout” above 0.0418–0.0430; any two-hour close in that region would, in his view, constitute decisive range expansion and “give bulls the runway for the next impulse higher.” Should buyers instead relinquish the amber pivot at 0.0394, the door reopens to 0.0378 minor support, with a break there exposing the 0.0357 floor and negating the current series of higher lows. Until either boundary yields, XRP/USOIL remains in its five-month box, but the very act of watching the pair, Dom contends, sharpens traders’ macro lens. “BTC, USOIL, XRP—combining them is just another way to triangulate liquidity,” he wrote. “Sometimes the edge is simply seeing the same market from a slightly different angle.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.46.

This new tool links over 50 blockchains with no gas fees. Pi coin price has also risen after a $70 million buy on OKX and fresh exchange interest. Both Hyperliquid and Pi are moving with strong momentum. BlockDAG (BDAG) has raised the bar by expanding its Buyer Battles contest. At $0.0020 per coin and with almost $250 million raised, BlockDAG now puts 150 million coins in play each day. The biggest purchase wins the reward. With the search for the next new bull run crypto ongoing, BlockDAG could be changing the rules. Will the Hyperliquid Ecosystem Stay Strong in the Market? The Hyperliquid ecosystem has drawn attention with Hyperbridge, a cross-chain tool that links more than 50 blockchains. It makes asset transfers simpler and removes network hurdles. The goal is to offer smoother access to DeFi services. The project’s Layer 1 design, supported by HyperBFT, delivers fast results without gas fees. Combined with its strong position in decentralized futures, the Hyperliquid ecosystem has shown clear advantages in certain areas. Whether its current $5.6 billion open interest rise turns into long-term strength remains uncertain, but the Hyperliquid ecosystem is set for ongoing interest. How Far Can Pi Coin Price Climb After Its Recent Rise? The recent rise in Pi coin price has come with higher trading levels. Major exchanges like Bitget and Gate.io have reported strong activity. A $70 million buy on OKX has pushed talk of more exchange listings, adding temporary energy to the Pi coin price. Some analysts suggest a short squeeze may have driven the sharp gain. Yet many remain careful, noting the Pi coin price still depends on market mood and big trades. Whether the current rise lasts will depend on market trends and how Pi Network handles upcoming changes. BlockDAG Pushes Buyer Battles to 150 Million Coins Daily BlockDAG has taken its Buyer Battles to new levels. Each day, 150 million BDAG coins are available at a presale price of $0.0020. Buyers compete to top the leaderboard by purchasing the most coins and claiming what others leave behind. The rules are simple. The largest buyer wins the full remaining pool of BDAG coins for that day. This bold format has captured attention from both smaller participants and larger holders. The presale has raised almost $250 million with 20.5 billion coins sold. Every round of Buyer Battles feels like a key chance. Missing out means losing millions in BDAG. Winning could multiply the gains at the future $0.05 listing price. BDAG has already seen a 2520% rise since batch 1. The Buyer Battles show that BlockDAG offers a different type of presale. It rewards bold moves and quick action. As many discuss the next new bull run crypto , BlockDAG is not just watching. It is taking the lead. What These Developments Mean for the Crypto Market These updates reflect a fast-changing market where new platforms, price moves, and presales compete for attention. The Hyperliquid ecosystem is showing strength through its new tools like Hyperbridge and is proving its technical ability. The Pi coin price remains unpredictable. Its recent activity has sparked interest, but its long-term path is still unclear. BlockDAG stands out by keeping its strong pace. With almost $250 million raised and 20.5 billion coins sold, it is not following what others do. Its Buyer Battles set a new standard and could make a major impact in this cycle’s market race.

It feels like every day brings a new twist in the crypto market rollercoaster. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or just curious about digital assets, understanding what influences BTC price is crucial. Let’s dive deep into the latest Bitcoin analysis and uncover the forces at play. The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, and staying ahead of the curve requires more than just glancing at charts. We need to look at the underlying factors, market sentiment, and broader economic indicators that shape crypto trends . This article will break down the current situation, offering insights and perspectives to help you navigate these exciting times. What’s Really Driving the Current Bitcoin Price Action? Understanding the Bitcoin price isn’t just about supply and demand; it’s a complex interplay of various global factors. Here are some of the key drivers we’re seeing right now: Macroeconomic Environment: Global inflation rates, interest rate decisions by central banks, and geopolitical events significantly impact investor risk appetite, directly affecting the flow of capital into assets like Bitcoin. Institutional Adoption: Big players entering the space, like corporations adding BTC to their balance sheets or financial institutions launching crypto products, signal growing legitimacy and can inject substantial liquidity. Regulatory Landscape: News about potential regulations, whether positive or negative, can cause significant volatility. Clarity or uncertainty from governments and financial bodies around the world is a major price mover. Technological Developments: Updates to the Bitcoin protocol itself, or developments in the broader crypto ecosystem (like advancements in scaling solutions or decentralized finance), can influence long-term sentiment and utility. Market Sentiment and News: Social media buzz, major news headlines, and the overall ‘fear and greed’ index among retail investors play a huge role in short-term price swings. Examining these factors provides a more holistic view beyond just the price chart. The BTC price is a reflection of these diverse influences converging in the market. Decoding the Latest Bitcoin Analysis: What Are Experts Saying? Recent Bitcoin analysis from various market commentators points to several interesting trends. While opinions differ, some common themes emerge: Many analysts are closely watching key support and resistance levels. Breaking through a major resistance point could signal a strong upward trend, while falling below a key support level might indicate further downside potential. Technical indicators like moving averages, RSI, and MACD are widely used to identify potential entry and exit points. Furthermore, on-chain metrics provide valuable insights into network activity, such as the number of active addresses, transaction volume, and exchange flows. These metrics can sometimes offer a glimpse into the underlying health and usage of the Bitcoin network, informing the Bitcoin analysis . Here’s a simplified look at some recent observations: Metric / Analysis Type Recent Observation Potential Implication Technical Analysis (Short-term) Consolidation below a key resistance level ($X) Potential breakout or rejection at this level. Volatility expected. On-Chain Analysis Increase in long-term holder accumulation Suggests conviction among experienced investors, potentially bullish for the Bitcoin price long-term. Market Sentiment Neutral to slightly fearful on the Fear & Greed Index Indicates potential for a contrarian move if sentiment shifts. Macro Factor Upcoming central bank meeting Potential market reaction based on interest rate decisions, impacting the broader crypto market . Remember, these are just snapshots, and the market can change rapidly. Always conduct your own research. Exploring the Benefits and Challenges of Trading Bitcoin in the Current Crypto Market Participating in the crypto market , especially with an asset like Bitcoin, comes with both exciting opportunities and significant risks. Benefits: High Volatility Potential: While risky, the significant price swings can offer opportunities for substantial gains if timed correctly. Increasing Accessibility: It’s easier than ever to buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin through various exchanges and platforms. Growing Ecosystem: The development of DeFi, NFTs, and other crypto applications adds utility and potential value to the broader market, including Bitcoin. Hedge Against Inflation (Potential): Some view Bitcoin as a potential store of value and a hedge against traditional currency devaluation, though this is a debated topic. Challenges: High Volatility Risk: Just as prices can go up quickly, they can also crash. Significant losses are possible. Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear, consistent global regulation creates unpredictability and potential hurdles. Security Risks: Hacks, scams, and losing private keys are real threats in the digital asset space. Market Manipulation: The market can be influenced by large players or coordinated actions. Navigating these requires a clear strategy and risk management plan, especially when focusing on the Bitcoin price . Real-World Examples and Actionable Insights on Crypto Trends Let’s look at a couple of examples illustrating recent crypto trends and what they might mean for you. For instance, consider the impact of a major country announcing stricter crypto regulations. Historically, such news often leads to a sharp, albeit sometimes temporary, dip in the crypto market , including the BTC price . This highlights the sensitivity of the market to regulatory news. An actionable insight here is to stay informed about global regulatory developments and understand their potential impact on your holdings. Another example is the increasing integration of crypto into traditional finance. News of a major bank offering Bitcoin services or a large asset manager launching a Bitcoin ETF can significantly boost positive sentiment and attract new capital, often resulting in upward price movement. This trend suggests that watching institutional moves is key to understanding broader market shifts and future crypto trends . Actionable Insights: Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. While Bitcoin is dominant, exploring other parts of the crypto market can spread risk. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on hype. Understand the technology, the project, and the risks involved. Consider Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Are you looking for quick trades or investing for years? Your strategy will dictate how you react to short-term Bitcoin price movements. Secure Your Assets: Use reputable exchanges, enable two-factor authentication, and consider hardware wallets for larger holdings. Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources, read analysis, and understand the factors influencing crypto trends . Check out this article for more on market indicators.

Jay Clayton, the acting US Attorney for Manhattan, told federal court judge Katherine Polk Failla in a May 15 letter that the charges against Storm still stand, bar one part of a conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business charge. “After review of this case, this Office and the Office of the Deputy Attorney General have determined that this prosecution is consistent with the letter and spirit of the April 7, 2025 Memorandum from the Deputy Attorney General,” Clayton wrote. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche’s April memo said the Justice Department would end the so-called “regulation by prosecution” of crypto, and added that the agency wouldn’t prosecute crypto mixers like Tornado Cash “for the acts of their end users or unwitting violations of regulations.” A highlighted excerpt of Blanche’s memo stating that the Department of Justice was rolling back its crypto enforcement. Source: US Department of Justice Clayton added that the indictment against Storm will cut the accusation that he failed to comply with money transmitting business registration requirements. Prosecutors were pursuing that charge as part of their allegation that Storm conspired to run Tornado Cash as an unlicensed money transmitter. The government will still push ahead with the charge under the accusation that Storm transmitted funds while knowing they were derived from a criminal offence or were intended to support unlawful activity. The Justice Department alleged that Tornado Cash helped launder over $1 billion worth of crypto, including for the sanctioned North Korean state-backed hacking collective the Lazarus Group . Clayton said the Justice Department will also still pursue the other two charges in its indictment, one count of money laundering conspiracy and one count of conspiracy to violate US sanctions. Related: NFT founder stole millions from Bitcoin project, investors allege The money laundering and sanctions violations conspiracy charges each carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, while the unlicensed money transmitter conspiracy charge carries a maximum sentence of five years. Storm has pleaded not guilty, and his trial is scheduled for July 14. He was charged alongside fellow founder Roman Semenov, who is at large and believed to be in his native Russia. Blanche memo cited in bids to toss Other crypto executives facing charges have pointed to Blanche’s memo in a bid to have their cases dismissed. Crypto mixer Samourai Wallet co-founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill had pointed to the memo to try to dismiss their charges of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitter and money laundering conspiracy. Braden John Karony, the CEO of crypto firm SafeMoon, has also cited the memo in an attempt to have the charges of securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy against him dismissed.

Recent reports indicate a significant wave of Microsoft layoffs , with a particular impact on a core group within the company: its programmers. Understanding the Scale of Microsoft Layoffs Microsoft recently undertook a round of workforce reductions, impacting approximately 6,000 individuals globally. While large tech companies occasionally restructure, the details emerging from Microsoft’s home state of Washington highlight a notable trend. According to Bloomberg, based on state filings, around 2,000 employees were affected in Washington alone. Total global layoffs: ~6,000 Layoffs in Washington state: ~2,000 Over 40% of Washington layoffs were in software engineering roles. Sales and marketing positions were less affected in this specific wave. This concentration of cuts within the software engineering division is significant, making it the largest affected category by a considerable margin within the Washington layoffs. While programmers constitute a substantial portion of Microsoft’s overall workforce, the disproportionate impact on this group raises questions. The Growing Role of AI Coding These workforce adjustments occur against a backdrop of increasing integration of artificial intelligence into software development. Just last month, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made a notable statement regarding the company’s progress in leveraging AI tools internally. He revealed that up to 30% of Microsoft’s code is now being written or assisted by AI technologies. This figure underscores the rapid adoption and potential efficiency gains offered by advanced AI coding tools. Platforms powered by large language models are becoming increasingly capable of generating code snippets, suggesting improvements, and even automating routine programming tasks. This shift naturally leads to speculation about the future of traditional programmer jobs . Is There a Link Between AI and Programmer Jobs? The timing of significant layoffs heavily affecting software engineers, following closely on the heels of the CEO’s announcement about AI’s contribution to coding, inevitably prompts discussion. Could the increased efficiency and capabilities provided by AI-assisted coding be a factor in the reduction of human programming roles? When Bitcoin World reached out to Microsoft for comment on whether AI-assisted coding motivated these layoffs, the company declined to provide a direct answer. Microsoft has publicly stated that the layoffs are part of an effort to reduce management layers and streamline operations. This suggests a focus on organizational structure rather than solely on the capabilities of individual contributors or specific technologies like AI coding tools. It’s important to consider multiple factors influencing such decisions in a large corporation. Economic conditions, strategic shifts, and internal reorganizations all play a role. However, the correlation between the rise of AI’s contribution to code and the disproportionate impact on programming roles is a point of interest for anyone tracking the evolution of the tech industry . Broader AI Impact on the Tech Industry The situation at Microsoft serves as a potent example of the potential AI impact on established roles within the technology sector. As AI tools become more sophisticated, they are capable of automating tasks that were once exclusively performed by humans. This isn’t limited to coding; AI is influencing everything from content creation to customer service and data analysis. While AI can enhance productivity and open new avenues for innovation, its increasing capabilities also raise valid concerns about job displacement and the need for workers to adapt and acquire new skills. The focus for programmers may shift from writing boilerplate code to overseeing AI tools, designing complex architectures, and tackling problems that still require human creativity and critical thinking. The experience at Microsoft highlights a critical transition point. Companies are exploring how to best integrate AI into their workflows, and this integration may lead to changes in staffing needs. The challenge for the tech industry and its workforce will be navigating this transition effectively, ensuring that AI becomes a tool for augmentation and growth rather than solely a driver of job losses. Summary: Navigating the AI-Driven Future Microsoft’s recent layoffs, particularly impacting its software engineering team in Washington, underscore the dynamic shifts occurring within the tech industry. While the company attributes the cuts to reducing management layers, the timing relative to the CEO’s statement about AI writing up to 30% of code sparks debate about the role of AI in future workforce planning. The situation at Microsoft is a stark reminder of the increasing AI impact on traditional roles, prompting professionals in programmer jobs and across the entire tech industry to consider how their skills and roles will evolve alongside advancements in AI coding and other automation technologies. As AI continues to advance, understanding its potential effects on employment becomes crucial for both companies and individuals.

At the Consensus 2025 conference in Toronto on May 15, he emphasized the widespread interest in Bitcoin, stating, “Everybody in the world is trying to hoard Bitcoin right now.” “I’m traveling. I’m on a plane. Everybody in the world is trying to hoard Bitcoin right now. Everybody. I hear it from sovereign wealth funds. I hear it from the wealthiest families. I hear from the biggest companies.” The comments came from a panel featuring Trump and Asher Genoot, CEO of Bitcoin mining company Hut 8. His more immediate future outlook is in the form of two races he sees currently taking place in the Bitcoin space: the race to buy Bitcoin and mine. Trump’s Bitcoin venture joins Gryphon in pre-listing deal Eric Trump is not only talking about Bitcoin; he’s building a business empire around it. His company, American Bitcoin, entered a deal to merge with Gryphon Digital Mining on May 12. The deal, structured as an all-stock exchange offer, will merge two powerful mining companies into a combined entity that the two companies said will be publicly listed on the Nasdaq later this year. American Bitcoin is a unit of Hut 8 , one of North America’s largest cryptocurrency mining companies. The merged company will become one of the biggest Bitcoin miners in the United States. Trump, who co-launched American Bitcoin alongside his brother, is bullish on the space. They aim to make American Bitcoin a conduit for people and institutions to invest in Bitcoin, largely through the US-regulated stock markets. After the news, Gryphon shares rose over 200%, while Hut 8 shares also went up. Analysts observe that this is a smart play leading up to the next Bitcoin halving cycle and follows a continuing surge in corporate interest in crypto mining. The deal is scheduled to close in the third quarter of 2025. Lawmakers slam Trump’s growing crypto ventures But not everyone is cheering. The uncloaked investment of the Trumps in the crypto world has raised the government’s scrutiny — particularly among Democrats on Capitol Hill. Critics are concerned about conflicts of interest and potential political power over the digital asset market. A few Democrats have demanded that the family’s crypto bets be investigated. They include meme coins, such as $TRUMP and NFT collections, mining companies, and even stablecoin projects that are said to have the fingerprints of companies with ties to the Trump family. House Democrats stormed out of a bipartisan hearing on digital assets earlier this month, complaining that Republicans ignored allegations of possible ethics lapses by the President’s inner circle. A group of Senate Democrats issued a plea to President Trump on May 13, asking him to divest himself of all assets in cryptocurrency, even including a stablecoin project backed by hard assets. They maintained that such links involve leveraging his presidency for personal gain, potentially opening himself up to foreign influence, and operating in an industry he has immense power to deregulate. It marries Trump’s unscrupulous business tendencies with an industry that is notorious for fraud, scams, and a lack of transparency. It may also become the most lucrative business he’s ever been involved in. The group State Democracy Defenders Action estimated in a new report that the president’s crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth — or approximately $2.9 billion. Lawmakers also forced the postponement of a bipartisan bill on stablecoins, with a second vote likely to be pushed for the case before the end of May. President Trump recently ordered the establishment of a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , an order that shocked the world of politics at home and abroad. Some welcomed it as forward-looking, but critics derided it as little more than a thinly veiled attempt to promote family investments. Even in the face of this pushback, the administration has still attempted to position itself as crypto-friendly. The family’s direct influence on the sector indicates that Bitcoin may also play a central role in future economic and political discussions. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

While major coins like Ethereum, XRP, and Dogecoin continue to consolidate with minimal upside, MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly moving in a different direction. Early chatter suggests this might be one of the few tokens still capable of delivering outsized returns — with a confirmed Uniswap listing at $0.007 and speculation of much higher valuations to come. Early Momentum Is Building Fast There’s no viral TikTok campaign or celebrity endorsement here — just steady growth and focused execution. Since its launch, MAGACOINFINANCE has gained traction primarily through grassroots interest , backed by a combination of meme appeal, strong tokenomics, and precise communication with its community. It’s a formula that reminds seasoned investors of what made tokens like SHIBA INU and PEPE take off. But what’s different here is the project’s deliberate pacing — and the clear pricing strategy that early buyers are paying close attention to. Why Investors Are Watching the $0.007 Milestone Closely According to sources close to the project, MAGACOINFINANCE is preparing for an initial listing at $0.007 — and this price is already serving as a benchmark for investor models. But the conversation doesn’t end there. Some analysts have projected the token could reach $0.07 on Tier 1 exchanges if adoption continues to scale — a 240x return based on early positioning. More speculative models suggest that if MAGACOINFINANCE becomes a truly global meme coin, a price point of $0.70 is not out of reach — a massive 2,400x multiple . While these higher-end scenarios are hypothetical, what matters is that investors have measurable, structured milestones — and that’s rare in the current wave of meme-driven tokens. More Than Just Hype — Community Growth Signals Real Potential On-chain activity and social analytics platforms show a steady increase in engagement around MAGACOINFINANCE . Telegram chats are expanding, Twitter mentions are climbing, and wallet distribution appears healthy — all key signs of sustainable early momentum. What’s resonating most with buyers, though, is the sense of starting fresh . Many in the space missed out on the early days of TrumpCoin, DOGE, or SHIBA — and MAGACOINFINANCE is now offering a second chance to be early on a politically-themed, community-driven crypto with actual structure behind it. A Calculated Entry in a Hype-Driven Market In a market filled with noise, MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly gaining favor among those who are looking for a strategic entry , not just another viral meme. It’s not being force-fed through influencers or overhyped social trends — instead, it’s growing through a consistent rollout and rising organic interest. With the $0.007 listing on the horizon , and discussions of reaching 240x or even 2,400x in the next cycle, MAGACOINFINANCE is starting to look like one of the few remaining early-stage projects with real upside .

The ruling, dated May 15, declared the filing “procedurally improper” under federal rules. Procedural Misstep In her order, the judge stressed that a request to vacate a final judgment must satisfy Rule 60’s “exceptional circumstances” test. “By styling their motion as one for ‘settlement approval,’ the parties fail to address the heavy burden they must overcome to vacate the injunction and substantially reduce the civil penalty. Relief from judgment under Rule 60 is granted only upon a showing of exceptional circumstances,” the order reads. Because neither side cited that rule nor argued that standard, the court declined to consider the deal. Ripple’s Legal Position Ripple remains bound by an August 2024 finding that it violated securities laws by selling XRP to institutional investors without registration. Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s chief legal officer, maintained that “nothing in today’s order changes Ripple’s wins.” He emphasized that the decision revolves around procedure, not substance, and said both parties will refine their submission and try again. Stakes for Crypto Regulation The outcome preserves the original $125 million penalty and maintains pressure on Ripple, which has long argued that its native token should not be treated as a security. Regulators and industry watchers see the case as a bellwether for how aggressively the SEC can police token sales in the United States. Some analysts fear the setback could embolden regulators to demand tougher settlements in future enforcement actions. Path Forward Both Ripple and the SEC must now craft a compliant motion that meets Rule 60 criteria if they still want relief from the injunction and a reduced fine. Legal experts say they could submit fresh evidence, demonstrate changed circumstances, or pursue an appeal to a higher court. Until then, Ripple continues operating under the limitations imposed by the 2024 judgment, even as it markets payment products abroad and looks to expand onshore once clarity emerges.",Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-05-16 01:56:04

The dip didn’t shake everyone. Many still bet on a major rally. According to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan in an interview yesterday, there’s a path for Bitcoin to hit $200,000 by December 31. He points to growing ETF inflows, more corporate buying, and what he sees as open‑door government policies. Related Reading: Dogecoin’s $1 Dream: Analyst Reveals When It Could Finally Happen Supply And Demand Gap Widens Supply is fixed at 21 million coins, with about 165,000 new Bitcoin mined each year. ETF funds, on the other hand, snapped up roughly 500,000 Bitcoin over the past 12 months. Based on reports, that’s more than three times the annual supply. When fresh coins can’t keep pace with big buyers, prices get pushed up. Corporate And Government Holding Rises Companies such as Strategy continue to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Based on reports, the US government already has over $17 billion in seized or held Bitcoin. There’s even talk of an executive order to source more without tapping taxpayers. Some say that could mean swapping gold reserves or selling other crypto assets. Abroad, Abu Dhabi reportedly paid $460 million for new Bitcoin, and at least 10 other governments may follow this year. Timing And Economic Volatility Hougan says Bitcoin’s big run was delayed by a spell of economic turbulence. Stocks have slid, and risk assets all felt the heat. He argues that once volatility eases, Bitcoin’s momentum will kick back in. It makes sense on paper. Yet markets can surprise. A sudden move by the Federal Reserve or a shift in borrowing costs might slow the climb again. Other Analyst Forecasts Align It’s not just Bitwise calling for $200,000. Bernstein senior analyst Gautam Chhugani has that number on his radar for 2025. And Intuit Trading’s Blockchaindaily team redrew a trendline after Bitcoin bottomed at $74,000 in April. Their line now points to $200,000 by July 2025. To go from $102,600 to $200,000, Bitcoin needs to climb about 95%. That’s a big leap, even if history shows crypto can move fast. Related Reading: Avalanche Rumbles 21% Amid Record-Breaking Address Activity Looking Ahead With Caution Meanwhile, there are clear risks on the horizon. Changes in tax rules, new trading fees, or a surprise rate hike could push prices down. Still, many believe those hurdles will clear.

The short and long liquidity clusters around price could be a precedent for a potential price move in the short term. Helium [HNT] posted a modest 1.68% gain, outpacing most top 100 cryptos in the past 24 hours. On the 4-hour chart, HNT continued trading within a large rising wedge pattern, with the apex near $4.45. At press time, HNT held around $3.967. A clean breakout above $4.45 could trigger a fresh move toward $5.00 or higher. On the other hand, a breach below the ascending trendline support at $3.60 could influence the bullish setup negatively. This could pull the pair to $3.40 in the process. Source: TradingView The MACD indicator gave a bullish crossover with the MACD line crossing the signal line at 0.011 and -0.004 respectively. The histogram was 0.015 in the upper range, indicating possible up-trend. However, vulnerability was suggested by the price being so close to the trendline support at $3.60. If HNT managed to maintain itself above $4.00 and break through $4.38, then it could confirm bullish strength. On the contrary, a fall below $3.60 may activate a bearish pressure encompassing $3.40 as the next level of interest. How liquidation levels could shape the next move An analysis of the Liquidation Heatmap showed a massive short liquidity at $3.89 being liquidated. Other short positions continued to develop close to this level. At the current price, there were huge leveraged positions. If HNT pushes higher, the $4.36 cluster may attract price action, triggering more short liquidations and increasing volatility. Source: Coinglass On the other hand, if the price decreased, the emerging liquidity under $3.89 could pull the price down. This would cause more liquidation of the shorted position. These concentrations in liquidity indicated short-term price opportunities in either direction. Factors for HNT use cases Helium’s core utility continues to rise. Total mobile hotspots hit 94,570, up by 278 in seven days. Daily Users rose by 75,571 to 681,066, while Daily Data Transfer hit 21.47 TB, down 2 TB over the same period. The rise in daily users and total mobile hotspots indicated an increase in network adoption and usage, which may have a positive impact on the HNT demand. Greater network activity, as indicated by a large number of users, tended to equate to high utility of the Helium network. Source: Helium World The decline in daily data transfer rate over the past week suggests the change may not be permanent. This fluctuation, driven by networking activity and efficiency, could impact market sentiment and HNT’s price. However, broader market trends and individual project developments may also play a crucial role in shaping its trajectory.",Altcoin|News|News 1|Social|Trading View,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|HNT,"{'name': 'AMB Crypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/ambcrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",ambcrypto,2025-05-16 02:00:43

Judge Analisa Torres has denied the joint request made by Ripple and the SEC for an indicative ruling that would have helped move their settlement plan forward. Why Was It Denied? In simple terms, the court said that even if it had the power to decide on the matter right now, it would reject the request because it didn’t follow the correct legal process. The motion, filed on May 8, 2025, asked the court to lift its earlier order stopping Ripple from selling XRP in violation of the law and to reduce Ripple’s $125 million penalty to $50 million. But the judge pointed out that the parties didn’t meet the legal requirements needed for such a request. A Quick Recap of the Case This is the latest chapter in a case that began in 2020 when the SEC sued Ripple, accusing the company of selling XRP as an unregistered security. In 2024, Ripple was ordered to pay a large penalty, and both Ripple and the SEC later appealed that decision. While those appeals are still ongoing, the two sides recently agreed to settle the case. As part of their settlement plan, Ripple and the SEC signed an agreement in April and May of this year. They also asked the court to pause the appeals and filed a motion for the court to support their deal. However, Judge Torres denied this request because the parties didn’t properly follow Rule 60, which covers how final court decisions can be changed. The court noted that the motion didn’t explain why an exception should be made in this case. What Happens Next? Reacting to the decision, attorney Bill Morgan explained how the settlement process was supposed to work. He said the agreement was signed, the appeals were paused, and the parties asked the court for an indicative ruling. If that had been approved, they would have asked the appeals court for a limited remand to officially complete the settlement. Now, with the motion denied, the process has hit a roadblock. Ripple’s CLO Stuart Alderoty said, “Nothing in today’s order changes Ripple’s wins (i.e. XRP is not a security, etc). This is about procedural concerns with the dismissal of Ripple’s cross-appeal. Ripple and the SEC are fully in agreement to resolve this case and will revisit this issue with the Court, together.” This means Ripple and the SEC must decide whether to fix their legal paperwork and try again or take a different approach",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-16 02:01:22

Stablecoins, digital currencies that track traditional assets like the US dollar, have taken on new prominence as a way to move money between the volatile, programmatic world of cryptocurrencies and the more predictable, government-controlled realm of the traditional financial system. But they have been hamstrung by regulatory grey areas and worries about financial stability. PayPal’s own stablecoin, PYUSD, launched in August 2023, is fully backed by US dollar deposits and short-term US treasuries, allowing for 1:1 redemption. Despite its potential, PYUSD’s adoption has been modest, with a market capitalization of approximately $872 million, compared to the stablecoin market’s total exceeding $238 billion. Fernandez’s comments come as lawmakers are close to passing stablecoin legislation that could transform the market and open it up to banks. The US also seeks to update rules around digital assets. Fernandez da Ponte draws attention to the need for clear regulation in the crypto industry Fernandez da Ponte claims that although it may seem counterintuitive if stablecoins are to grow outside of crypto-native circles, the banks in this market will be essential because their infrastructure, from custody to providing fiat rails, will be crucial. Both the fabric and the connectivity must function. One other famous name that weighed in on the topic of conversation, Anthony Soohoo, chairman and CEO of MoneyGram, a cross-border money transfer service, claimed that this was a big breakthrough. Based on his argument, “There’s always hesitation: Can I trust this? [The stablecoin legislation] will answer many of those questions.” Once there are clear regulations, both executives said, they expect consolidation after a wave of new issuers floods the industry. Fernandez da Ponte said there wouldn’t be just two stablecoins, or even 300, but more than that. The stablecoin market is, at present, mostly run by Tether and Circle’s Stablecoins , commanding almost 90 of the $230 billion asset class. However, at a supply of $900 million, PYUSD is far behind. Fernandez said market capitalization should not be the basis for measuring success. He said one should focus on velocity, active wallets, and the total number of transactions, emphasizing that drives actual use. In the meantime, customers have been hunting for stablecoins backed by dollars that they can use for international payments and as stores of value in nations with high inflation and volatile currencies. MoneyGram, which has nearly a million cash-access locations in over 200 countries, helps enable that access, Soohoo says. According to reports, developed countries have been slower in embracing stablecoins. With adequate clear regulation, stablecoins can streamline cross-border disbursements and corporate treasury activities, Fernandez da Ponte said. US Senate anticipates the vote on the GENIUS Act to reshape the stablecoin market The GENIUS Act is back in the spotlight as lawmakers make a final attempt to bring the legislation to the Senate floor following weeks of debate. Senate sources say a bipartisan amendment is under consideration, with proposed changes that include stricter regulations for tech firms handling financial assets, enhanced consumer protections, and increased oversight of public figures—including Elon Musk. The amendment also aims to tighten bankruptcy protections and prevent misuse of FDIC insurance. These changes could also make the bill more palatable to a wide array of Republicans. The pending vote will be the litmus test for whether the Senate is prepared to move forward with digital asset legislation that includes strict accountability without stifling innovation. Led by Senator Bill Hagerty, the GENIUS Act imposes a regulatory structure for token issuers, rathe r wi th an emphasis on US dollar-pegged stablecoins. The bill would require issuers to meet strict licensing, asset backing, and transparency conditions. Under the proposal, stablecoin issuers with more than $10 billion in assets would be subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve, while the states would regulate smaller issuers. US dollars or Treasury securities must fully back all stablecoins. The legislation is intended to strengthen the dollar’s status in the global marketplace and boost broader financial access in the digital era.

The bad actors have been operating since April, using deepfake voice messages and text messages to masquerade as senior government officials and establish rapport with victims, the FBI said in a May 15 warning. “If you receive a message claiming to be from a senior US official, do not assume it is authentic,” the agency said. If US officials’ accounts are compromised, the scam could become far worse because hackers can then “target other government officials, or their associates and contacts, by using the trusted contact information they obtain,” the FBI said. As part of these scams, the FBI says the hackers are trying to access victims’ accounts through malicious links and directing them to hacker-controlled platforms or websites that steal sensitive data like passwords. Source: FBI “Contact information acquired through social engineering schemes could also be used to impersonate contacts to elicit information or funds,” the agency added. Crypto founders targeted in separate deepfake attacks In an unrelated deepfake scam, Sandeep Narwal, co-founder of blockchain platform Polygon, raised the alarm in a May 13 X post that bad actors were also impersonating him with deepfakes. Nailwal said the “attack vector is horrifying” and had left him slightly shaken because several people had “called me on Telegram asking if I was on zoom call with them and am I asking them to install a script.” Source: Sandeep Narwal As part of the scam, the bad actors hacked the Telegram of Polygon’s ventures lead, Shreyansh and pinged people asking to jump in a Zoom call that had a deepfake of Nailwal, Shreyansh and a third person , according to Nailwal. “The audio is disabled and since your voice is not working, the scammer asks you to install some SDK, if you install game over for you,” Nailwal said. “Other issue is, there is no way to complain this to Telegram and get their attention on this matter. I understand they can’t possibly take all these service calls but there should be a way to do it, maybe some sort of social way to call out a particular account.” At least one user replied in the comments saying the fraudsters had targeted them, while Web3 OG Dovey Wan said she had also been deepfaked in a similar scam. Source: Dovey Wan FBI and crypto founder says vigilance is key to avoid scams Nailwal suggests the best way to avoid being duped by these types of scams is to never install anything during an online interaction initiated by another person and to keep a separate device specifically for accessing crypto wallets . Related: AI deepfake attacks will extend beyond videos and audio — Security firms Meanwhile, the FBI says to verify the identity of anyone who contacts you, examine all sender addresses for mistakes or inconsistencies, and check all images and videos for distorted hands , feet or unrealistic facial features. At the same time, the agency recommends never sharing sensitive information with someone you have never met, clicking links from people you don’t know, and setting up two-factor or multifactor authentication.

With renewed attention around smart contract automation and oracle data feeds, community sentiment around LINK has shifted to “very bullish,” according to aggregated user ratings. This optimism is also reflected in updated forward-looking forecasts—particularly the Chainlink price prediction 2030, which projects a potential price range of up to $21.69. Such an outlook reinforces Chainlink’s position not just as a speculative asset, but as a structural component of the Web3 economy. However, while Chainlink maintains its dominance, newer platforms are quickly gaining momentum by offering builder-first tools and real-world development environments. One of the more notable among these is Qubetics , currently running its 34th presale stage. With a price of $0.2532 and more than $17 million raised so far, Qubetics is not only capturing early buyers but is also anchoring itself as one of the best crypto presale opportunities this quarter. More on that below. Technical Forecasts Strengthen Long-Term Chainlink Outlook Chainlink’s current trading price sits at $17.00 as of May 15, 2025, with a positive 2.03% 24-hour movement, confirming short-term bullish pressure. The 50-day and 200-day moving averages are both sloping upward, and the RSI remains neutral between 30–70. This shows there is no immediate sign of reversal, and the trend is technically intact. The broader consensus also supports the outlook—over 51.95% of the crypto sentiment community ranks LINK as “very bullish.” This fundamental strength feeds into the forward guidance, especially around the Chainlink price prediction 2030. Based on user-generated forecast models and Binance technical overlays, LINK is expected to reach $17.85 in 2026, $18.74 in 2027, and could climb to $21.69 by 2030. These projections take into account the expanding role of Chainlink in areas like tokenized real-world assets, insurance contracts, and machine-to-machine payments—all of which require secure, real-time data inputs. Chainlink remains the go-to oracle layer for these needs, reinforcing its long-term utility. Daily and Mid-Term Projections Highlight Near-Term Stability Despite fluctuations typical to altcoins, Chainlink’s recent pricing action has been relatively stable. From May 15 to June 14, 2025, prices are projected to stay between $17.00 and $17.06, with gradual climbs rather than aggressive price shifts. This reinforces the narrative that LINK has moved into a maturity phase—where volatility is lower but adoption impact is higher. The consensus also suggests that while LINK may not deliver immediate sharp gains, its compounding value could outperform many short-term narratives over time. Smart contract usage is increasing across sectors like decentralized insurance, data-sharing protocols, and supply chain auditing—all environments that rely on oracles. In this context, the Chainlink price prediction 2030 gains even more weight, especially when integrated into long-term investment models. Broader Use Cases Keep LINK Embedded in Enterprise-Grade Blockchain Architecture The evolution of DeFi in 2024 and 2025 brought new demands on data accuracy, uptime, and trustless execution. Chainlink’s role in ensuring data integrity across on-chain and off-chain environments has become critical. For example, in automated insurance settlements, Chainlink oracles are now being used to verify flight delays and trigger payouts within seconds. Gaming applications are also increasingly using Chainlink’s Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs) to generate unbiased outcomes in real-time lotteries and in-game mechanics. These integrations contribute to a network effect that will likely fuel demand across new verticals—especially when blockchain starts becoming more embedded into enterprise software stacks. The Chainlink price prediction 2030 hinges on this exact trajectory: sustained integration into real-use systems rather than just crypto-native cycles. Qubetics Presale: A Builder-Centric Project Poised for a Strategic Breakout While Chainlink maintains its position in data validation, Qubetics is emerging with a builder-first approach through its QubeQode IDE—an intuitive visual environment that removes technical barriers in smart contract deployment. Designed for developers, freelancers, and enterprises, it offers drag-and-drop tools, form-based logic, and pre-coded snippets for rapid dApp creation. Whether it’s a freelance team launching a DAO-based payroll app or a business building a tokenized real-estate registry, Qubetics allows real use cases to be deployed quickly without the need for deep blockchain expertise. This low-barrier, visual-first approach is attracting attention in the development space, especially from builders priced out or overwhelmed by ecosystems like Ethereum or Solana. As a result, the Qubetics presale has gained traction and credibility as one of the best crypto presale events currently available. Stage 34 is priced at $0.2532, with over 512 million $TICS sold and more than $17 million already raised from 26,400+ participants. Each presale stage lasts only 7 days and ends every Sunday at 12 am, triggering a 10% price increase before the next stage begins. With the Qubetics mainnet scheduled to launch in Q2 2025, early adopters are being positioned for exponential returns. For example, a $5,000 investment at the current stage would yield approximately 19,740 tokens. If $TICS hits just $6 post-mainnet, that portfolio would grow to $118,440—a 2,269.05% ROI. At $10, the same investment climbs to $197,400, and at $15, the projection reaches $296,100. These figures highlight a high-value entry window for those seeking structured, time-bound gains. If $TICS reaches $1 after the presale, the ROI would already be 294.84%, while the more aggressive Chainlink-like targets ($10–$15) mirror gains of 3,848.42% to 5,822.63%. Few early-phase tokens offer such clarity in ROI mapping, which is precisely why many are calling Qubetics a top crypto presale to watch heading into the second half of 2025. Final Thoughts: Chainlink and Qubetics Present Distinct Paths for Long-Term Growth Both Chainlink and Qubetics offer different value propositions but share a common trajectory—long-term relevance and real utility. Chainlink remains one of the few tokens with institutional adoption, enterprise use cases, and a consistent developer base. Its Chainlink price prediction 2030 is backed by fundamentals, infrastructure maturity, and expanding demand for oracle services. Qubetics, on the other hand, is in a rapid growth phase, targeting builders who need fast, intuitive development environments. Backed by strong presale mechanics and a roadmap centered around usability and speed, Qubetics is offering not just tokens but a builder-first ecosystem. For those looking to get ahead of the mainnet launch, now may be the right time to join this best crypto presale before the next price jump.

Designed to meet the expectations of serious investors, it combines professional auditing, well-considered tokenomics, and a transparent development team — creating a framework that supports sustainable traction. With a growing community and clear interest across crypto channels , MAGACOINFINANCE is not positioning itself as a quick trend, but as a long-term player aligned with best practices in decentralized finance. This review takes a closer look at the essential elements that are fueling the project’s early rise. Verified by Hashex: A Strong Signal of Security and Oversight Perhaps the most important development to date is the completion of a full smart contract audit by Hashex , a respected name in blockchain security. The audit assessed MAGACOINFINANCE for structural vulnerabilities, ensuring that the project meets key thresholds for integrity, transparency, and protection against contract-level exploits. A successful audit at this stage provides two essential benefits: Investor trust — with technical validation confirming the absence of critical risks. Market reputation — helping MAGACOINFINANCE distinguish itself from the many unaudited tokens that populate the space. In a market where early-stage scams remain a real concern, passing a Hashex audit is a strong endorsement of project legitimacy . Tokenomics Designed for Stability and Ecosystem Growth MAGACOINFINANCE introduces a balanced tokenomics model built around long-term sustainability. Rather than overpromising or engineering aggressive short-term gains, the token structure reflects a thoughtful allocation model, designed to support the ecosystem, reward early participants, and protect overall market health. While exact distribution percentages are kept simple for broader accessibility, it is evident that the developers have focused on designing a structure that encourages responsible participation and community growth — a key differentiator in today’s volatile presale environment. Token Sale Success Highlights Investor Confidence MAGACOINFINANCE’s early token sale performance has exceeded expectations , with notable demand emerging shortly after the project went live. From individual investors to private communities, the response has been swift and positive — an indicator of the trust being placed in the project’s foundation. The fast-paced nature of the sale reflects rising momentum , as well as a broader desire among investors to identify opportunities that pair innovation with a clear commitment to compliance and transparency. In that respect, MAGACOINFINANCE is delivering a rare mix of credibility and upside potential. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Has Everyone Watching Closely As the broader altcoin market prepares for what many analysts expect to be an active cycle, projects like MAGACOINFINANCE — those that enter with security audits, clear tokenomics, and real-time traction — are earning fast recognition. Industry observers and early-stage analysts have flagged MAGACOINFINANCE as a token with the essential qualities needed to survive beyond the initial hype phase . Its strategy of prioritizing infrastructure and transparency from day one is paying off, as more investors gravitate toward projects with tangible credibility. Conclusion: MAGACOINFINANCE Is Building the Right Way Unlike many short-lived crypto launches, MAGACOINFINANCE is setting the tone for how responsible altcoin projects should approach market entry . With a completed Hashex audit , clearly communicated tokenomics, and successful initial momentum, it is paving a path that combines security, structure, and scalable investor participation. This is a project designed with long-term thinking in mind — and for that reason alone, it deserves the attention it is receiving across the crypto community.

Despite a mutual agreement between Ripple and the SEC to resolve the case, the court emphasized that it lacks jurisdiction due to the ongoing appeal before the Second Circuit.

The parties submitted a joint motion for an indicative ruling to allow the Second Circuit to consider remand, which would have permitted Judge Torres to act on the agreement.

The court noted that the parties failed to address the legal burden necessary to justify vacating the injunction and modifying the penalty.

According to Alderoty, “Nothing in today’s order changes Ripple’s wins (i.e., XRP is not a security, etc).” He emphasized that the issue is procedural and tied to the dismissal mechanics of Ripple’s cross-appeal, not a reversal of any substantive legal victories. The ruling from July 2023 and the final judgment issued in August 2024 remain in effect. However, the SEC’s appeal and Ripple’s cross-appeal remain pending before the Second Circuit, and both parties must now seek a formal remand from the Second Circuit before the proposed agreement can be considered.

Specifically, are you wondering where Bitcoin is heading next? You’re not alone! Millions of investors and enthusiasts are constantly seeking insights into the potential trajectory of the king of crypto. Understanding Bitcoin price prediction is crucial for anyone navigating this exciting yet unpredictable landscape. Understanding Key Factors in Bitcoin Price Prediction Predicting the exact movement of BTC price is notoriously difficult, but we can analyze the factors that heavily influence it. It’s a complex interplay of market forces, technological developments, and global events. Here are some of the most significant drivers: Supply and Demand: Like any asset, the basic economic principle applies. Limited supply (only 21 million BTC will ever exist) meeting increasing demand tends to drive prices up. Market Sentiment and News: Positive news (like institutional adoption or regulatory clarity) can boost confidence, while negative news (like hacks or regulatory crackdowns) can cause sharp declines. This is where keeping up with cryptocurrency trends is vital. Macroeconomic Factors: Global inflation, interest rates, and the performance of traditional markets can influence how investors view Bitcoin as a store of value or risk asset. Technological Developments: Upgrades to the Bitcoin network or the broader crypto ecosystem can impact its utility and perception. Regulation: Government stances on cryptocurrency around the world can significantly affect market access and investor confidence. Why is Crypto Market Analysis Essential for Investors? Engaging in smart Bitcoin investment requires more than just hoping the price goes up. It demands thorough crypto market analysis . This involves looking beyond just the price chart and understanding the underlying health of the market, the technology, and the external forces at play. Analysis helps you: Identify potential entry and exit points. Assess the risk associated with an investment. Understand the narratives driving market movements. Differentiate between short-term volatility and long-term trends. Ignoring market analysis is akin to sailing without a compass – you might get somewhere, but it’s largely based on luck rather than strategy. Exploring Different Bitcoin Price Prediction Models Analysts use various models and indicators to attempt a Bitcoin price prediction . While none are foolproof, they offer valuable perspectives: Technical Analysis: Studies historical price data and volume to identify patterns and predict future movements. Uses tools like moving averages, RSI, MACD, and Fibonacci retracements. Focuses on market psychology reflected in price action. Fundamental Analysis: Evaluates the intrinsic value of the asset based on underlying factors. Looks at network activity (number of active addresses, transaction volume), development progress, regulatory environment, and adoption rates. Less concerned with short-term price swings, more with long-term potential. On-Chain Analysis: Analyzes data directly from the blockchain ledger. Tracks flows of BTC, wallet behavior, mining activity, and exchange reserves. Provides insights into genuine network usage and potential market movements based on holder behavior. Combining insights from these different approaches often provides a more robust view for making a Bitcoin investment decision. What Do Current Cryptocurrency Trends Suggest for BTC Price? Current cryptocurrency trends show a few key narratives impacting the BTC price . For instance, the approval and performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets have opened new avenues for institutional and retail investment, potentially increasing demand. The upcoming Bitcoin halving event is another major trend, historically associated with significant price appreciation due to the reduction in new supply entering the market. However, global regulatory uncertainty and macroeconomic headwinds remain potential challenges that could temper bullish sentiment. Analyzing these trends is crucial for refining your Bitcoin price prediction . Actionable Insights for Your Bitcoin Investment Strategy Based on our discussion of crypto market analysis and cryptocurrency trends , here are some actionable tips for approaching your Bitcoin investment : Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on hype or a single prediction. Understand the technology, the market, and your own risk tolerance. Start Small: You don’t need to invest a fortune. Begin with an amount you are comfortable potentially losing. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, invest a fixed amount at regular intervals (e.g., weekly or monthly). This averages out your purchase price over time. Secure Your Investment: Use reputable exchanges and consider moving larger holdings to a hardware wallet for better security. Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources, understand market indicators, and keep track of regulatory developments and cryptocurrency trends . Have a Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility is common, many view Bitcoin as a long-term asset. Be prepared for price swings. Remember, the goal is not just to predict the future, but to build a resilient strategy around potential outcomes. Concluding Thoughts on the Future of BTC While a definitive Bitcoin price prediction remains elusive, a thorough understanding of crypto market analysis , key price drivers, and current cryptocurrency trends provides a powerful framework for making informed decisions about your Bitcoin investment . The market is dynamic, influenced by a blend of technical factors, fundamental strength, and global sentiment. By staying educated and employing sound investment principles, you can navigate the exciting path of Bitcoin and the broader crypto landscape with greater confidence.

From trading at just a few cents not long ago, XRP has skyrocketed to $2.40, even briefly overtaking Tether to grab the third spot on the crypto leaderboard. With all the ongoing developments, it’s natural to wonder: Is XRP gearing up to become the next Bitcoin? The FOMO Factor Dave Portnoy, owner of DDTG Global, recently spoke out about the growing crypto craze. Sharing a personal story, he revealed how he got outbid on an apartment in Miami by a crypto investor. “Just like that,” he said. “Bitcoin’s up to about $100k. I’ve worked hard for 20 years and yes — there’s 100% FOMO on everything now.” Why does @stoolpresidente own XRP? ""FOMO."" ""It's not like I have some grand belief in it…it's what, 2 bucks 40 cents?…What if that's the next bitcoin?"" pic.twitter.com/4rStqIUmtd — CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) May 15, 2025 Portnoy admitted that while Bitcoin feels more established today, coins like XRP are now catching the attention of people chasing the next big opportunity. “But that’s why I am in XRP. It’s FOMO. It’s not like I have some brand belief in it. What if that’s the next Bitcoin?” SEC vs Ripple Saga Nearing Its End One of the biggest obstacles for XRP has been its long legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The case, which has dragged on since 2020, accused Ripple of selling XRP as an unregistered security. But with settlement talks gaining momentum and both parties moving closer to a resolution, the crypto world is watching closely. Many believe that once this case wraps up, it could open the doors for XRP to surge even higher. The end of regulatory uncertainty might attract big investors and new partnerships — something Ripple has already been actively securing around the world. Nothing in today’s order changes Ripple’s wins (i.e. XRP is not a security, etc). This is about procedural concerns with the dismissal of Ripple’s cross-appeal. Ripple and the SEC are fully in agreement to resolve this case and will revisit this issue with the Court, together. https://t.co/vBQdBD3FNe — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) May 15, 2025 While it’s too soon to tell if XRP can truly reach Bitcoin’s level, there’s no denying the momentum it’s building.

But while they remain structurally sound and widely held, many traders are finding that short-term returns are increasingly underwhelming compared to newer altcoin contenders. Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $1,837 , showing a modest +2.1% gain so far this quarter. While Ethereum maintains long-term bullish fundamentals—supported by rising activity on AI tokens and Layer 2 growth—its price remains stuck in a narrow band, with no decisive breakout above resistance. XRP , meanwhile, is hovering near $2.22 , boosted by ongoing ETF speculation and strategic partnerships in cross-border payments. However, its weekly chart remains flat , reflecting regulatory headwinds and thinning retail interest. Volume has cooled slightly, and traders are hesitant to chase price without clearer court signals. While both assets continue to anchor portfolios, neither is currently delivering standout ROI —and that’s where the spotlight is shifting to a less obvious name: MAGACOINFINANCE . MAGACOINFINANCE: Early Returns Surge Before Listings Begin Still in its pre-exchange phase, MAGACOINFINANCE is quickly becoming one of Q2’s most-watched performers. With over $8 million already raised and a well-defined multi-stage rollout, the project is offering ROI potential that Ethereum and XRP simply can’t match right now. With a $0.007 listing target and rapidly increasing entry prices across stages, MAGACOINFINANCE is currently offering buyers projected returns of 25x to 35x , depending on their presale entry point. Early buyers have already seen gains from initial entry rounds, with each new stage driving more momentum and attention. This is the kind of asymmetric upside that many traders seek—and it’s materializing before centralized listings have even begun. What Makes MAGACOINFINANCE Stand Out in Q2? Several core drivers are powering this project’s performance: Fixed supply architecture that encourages early accumulation A 20,000+ strong community actively engaging across platforms Culturally resonant branding , tapping into dominant political narratives of 2025 A smart bonus model that rewards buyers at each earlier stage of entry With Ethereum and XRP’s catalysts mostly priced in for now, MAGACOINFINANCE remains in the early-execution window—offering a full pipeline of pending events: listings, marketing waves, and expanding community reach. Final Take: Could MAGACOINFINANCE Be Q2’s ROI Winner? Ethereum and XRP continue to serve as reliable long-term assets, but they are currently delivering limited short-term returns . For traders and early adopters looking for more dynamic growth, MAGACOINFINANCE is standing out as a strong contender. With structured presale execution, surging community interest, and multi-phase marketing in motion, analysts now rank MAGACOINFINANCE among Q2’s most promising ROI stories .

This project has already raised $20 million in its presale, with its token priced around $0.007, showing strong investor interest and confidence in the early stage opportunity. Unlike meme coins following trends, Lightchain AI brings real utility to the table by mixing AI technology with blockchain technology. It is just another trend, it is a serious play for investors seeking impressive returns in 2025. With attention building fast, many believe that Lightchain AI could be the next breakout star in the crypto industry. Why Meme Coins Like Popcat & DogWifHat Are Falling Out of Favor Meme coins like Popcat (POPCAT) and Dogwifhat (WIF) have been losing popularity for several reasons. Too many meme coins have entered the market, and therefore, the memes are no longer fresh, with investors turning their attention elsewhere because they are tired of them. The distrust has also increased as a result of big price swings, and large holders selling off big chunks of the tokens. In one instance, a whale recently sold off 10 million POPCAT tokens, leading to fears about the fragile market. In addition, investors are now moving to projects that can be used in the real world. They are also looking into projects with long term potential, rather than those with purpose. These actions indicate that with no value addition or upgrade, meme coins would run the risk of going out of fashion in the crypto industry in the future. Lightchain AI Platform- Real-World Utility and Growth Potential Lightchain AI stands out from meme coins due to its focus on long-term value and addressing the inefficiencies of blockchain technology. It provides scalable and developer-friendly infrastructure that supports decentralized applications (dApps) and helps innovation. At its core, the platform has a Memecoin Launchpad that allows creators to monetize their ideas, providing them with security in the AI-powered ecosystem to foster the creative economy. Lightchain AI also introduces the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) mechanism, which replaces traditional mining with no AI computations, such as model training and interference, cryptographically verified for precision. By combining these technologies with real world usage, Lightchain AI is more than a speculative asset, establishing itself as an advanced blockchain solution, offering meaningful value for traders and developers.

ETH is now again rising and might soon aim for a move above the $2,600 zone. Ethereum started a correction from the $2,740 zone and tested $2,500. The price is trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key declining channel or a possible bullish flag forming with resistance at $2,575 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain strength if it clears the $2,600 resistance in the near term. Ethereum Price Eyes Upside Break Ethereum price struggled to clear the $2,740 resistance and started a downside correction, like Bitcoin . ETH traded below the $2,700 and $2,650 support levels. The bears were able to push the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,415 swing low to the $2,735 high. The price even spiked below the $2,520 level, but the bulls were active near the $2,500 zone. The price found support near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,415 swing low to the $2,735 high. Ether is again rising from the $2,500 zone. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,575 level. There is also a key declining channel or a possible bullish flag forming with resistance at $2,575 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The next key resistance is near the $2,600 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,650 level. A clear move above the $2,650 resistance might send the price toward the $2,735 resistance. An upside break above the $2,735 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,800 resistance zone or even $2,920 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,600 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,525 level. The first major support sits near the $2,500 zone. A clear move below the $2,500 support might push the price toward the $2,420 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,350 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,320.

Here’s how,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-etp-will-bring-xrp-into-the-mainstream-financial-system-heres-how/,"Crypto researcher and prominent voice on X, SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG), recently shared an image explaining the function of crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs), emphasizing their growing importance for assets such as XRP. Quoting the image, SMQKE noted that ETPs will bring XRP “into the mainstream financial system, with structure, oversight, and scalability.” This observation suggests a significant shift in how altcoins are increasingly integrated into regulated markets. Yes, the XRP ETP will bring XRP “into the mainstream financial system, with structure, oversight and scalability.” Why should investors care about Altcoin ETPs? Documented below. pic.twitter.com/3ShjKNSLCt — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 14, 2025 Direct Exposure with Regulatory Clarity The document shared by SMQKE explains that crypto ETPs provide direct, exchange-traded exposure to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP. This access is structured through regulated stock exchanges and institutional-grade custodians, fundamentally differentiating ETPs from unregulated crypto markets. XRP ETPs have been dominating global markets for years. By offering 1:1 backing with underlying assets, these products bridge the gap between traditional and digital finance. For investors, this model delivers a way to gain exposure to crypto without the complications of wallets, private keys, or interacting with unregulated exchanges. EPs remove friction while providing clarity and compliance within established financial infrastructures. As a result, XRP and other altcoins offered through ETPs are no longer isolated from institutional capital or oversight. XRP’s Entry Into a Structured Financial Framework Historically viewed as a speculative digital asset, XRP is now poised to operate within frameworks prioritizing transparency and standardization. The U.S. has seen a significant push for spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the most common form of ETPs, and recent reports suggest these products may be approved soon . Exposure to the traditional market makes XRP more than just another cryptocurrency, but an asset class with formal backing, regulation, and established pathways for liquidity. Through listing on public exchanges, ETPs ensure that XRP is accessible via familiar brokerage platforms, removing significant barriers to entry for traditional investors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why Are Investors Excited? With ETPs, retail investors benefit from a safer, more predictable mechanism to gain crypto exposure. SMQKE’s commentary draws attention to the core value of this model, which is bringing legitimacy, scale, and accountability to assets like XRP. The operational and legal simplicity of these products aligns with the needs of institutional investors, who require compliance, transparency, and custodial assurances. Crypto ETPs also enhance liquidity and tradability. SMQKE’s post highlights a broader trend toward the institutionalization of crypto . The deployment of ETPs for altcoins such as XRP marks a shift from speculative trading to structured, regulated participation. This evolution improves access and transparency and fundamentally repositions digital assets within the global financial system.

According to new regulatory filings with the US SEC, this move is in response to a 12% drop in Bitcoin’s price and diminishing profitability in associated trading strategies. The shift represents a cautious pivot of investor sentiment, especially given the deluge of enthusiasm analysts and investors greeted these ETFs with when they debuted in January 2024. Hedge funds led the retreat, with Millennium Management—the largest hedge fund in the U.S., cutting its exposure to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) by 41%. The firm now owns 17.6 million shares. It also fully exited its stake in the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF. At the same time, Millennium added to its holdings in two smaller funds, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF and the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust. This may indicate a changed strategy toward funds with different fee structures or performance profiles. Brevan Howard, based in Jersey, did the same. It trimmed its IBIT holdings by about 15.6% during the same period. Hedge funds were responding to a crash in the premium on Bitcoin futures over spot prices, which collapsed as traders bet that several factors were exaggerating demand. Institutional investors shift their Bitcoin ETF holdings Not only hedge funds — public pension funds, too, re-evaluated their stakes. State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB), among the first institutional investors to buy spot Bitcoin ETFs, sold the whole of its 6 million shares position in IBIT in Q1 2025. That followed a huge bet on Bitcoin in early 2024. In contrast, Brown University quietly entered the crypto investment space with a surprising move, purchasing approximately $4.9 million worth of shares in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), according to a filing dated March 31. The Ivy League institution joins a growing number of educational endowments exploring digital assets as part of broader portfolio diversification and risk mitigation strategies. Meanwhile, sovereign wealth funds are a fickle source. Mubadala Investment Company in Abu Dhabi increased its Bitcoin holdings. It now holds over 8.7 million IBIT shares, worth $408.5 million. This indicates that a few long-term institutions still see Bitcoin as an asset class, even through short-term fluctuation. Financial advisors signal continued interest As hedge funds retreat, other classes of investors are slowly moving in. Some financial advisers and wealth managers held or added a bit to their spot Bitcoin ETF exposure in Q1. Hightower Advisors, for one, announced combined holdings of roughly $68 million in various Bitcoin funds. The firm has also hinted for years at the desire to provide clients with a way to invest in digital assets through regulated products such as an ETF. Matt Hougan of Bitwise thinks this could be a gradual but transformational move. He said that what he would be looking for most is whether, once all the data is available, more financial advisory firms begin to enter the market. He added that the wave of adoption is a slow-moving train, but it is steadily gaining momentum. That shift in direction indicates that while the first wave of whirlwind excitement around spot Bitcoin ETFs wanes, that second wave (from advisors and retail) is still just getting started. This stance feels justified in the light of recent data. In early May, BlackRock’s IBIT is said to have seen the highest single-day outflows ever reported. The fund lost over $36 million in a single trading session. That was one of the largest daily outflows since the ETF’s inception and came as global regulatory attention and interest in crypto coins continued to wane. Nevertheless, the total AUM in all US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs remains at over $40 billion—indicating that institutional interest, although cooling, is not disappearing.

Instead, these investors are continuing to accumulate the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, signaling their confidence in further price gains in the coming weeks. Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Are Not Selling Yet According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ShayanMarkets, profit-taking among long-term holders remains relatively low, even as BTC trades near its ATH. Historically, profit-taking activity tends to increase significantly when Bitcoin approaches its previous high, as many investors look to lock in gains. However, that has not been the case in the current market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rises 3.4% As Small Investors Return To The Market – New ATH Soon? The analyst highlighted that Bitcoin consolidating near ATH levels typically results in significant profit realization by market participants. Yet, current data reveals that LTH – those who have held BTC for more than 150 days – have not begun large-scale profit-taking. Specifically, the LTH Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric is heading downwards even when BTC continues to steadily surge toward a new ATH around $109,000. The analyst explains: This decline suggests that long-term holders have not yet engaged in notable profit-taking. Instead, they appear to be accumulating, signaling confidence in higher price targets and anticipating new all-time highs. In essence, the ongoing BTC consolidation phase seems to be driven more by short-term holders (STHs) and retail traders. Historically, these investor segments are more reactive to price swings, responding swiftly to both upward and downward movements. The analyst further stated that Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this period of consolidation. If history repeats itself, the next upward movement could propel BTC to new record highs in the mid-term. Analysis from fellow CryptoQuant contributor BlitzzTrading supports this outlook. BlitzzTrading observed that BTC whales – wallets holding significant Bitcoin holdings – have taken much less profit compared to previous bull runs. This behavior suggests a long-term investment mindset among whales, aligning them more closely with LTHs than retail traders or short-term speculators. It’s fair to say that BTC whales are typically long-term investors, often holding their positions through market cycles, unlike smaller holders who tend to trade more frequently. BTC May Follow Gold’s Historic Price Action Interestingly, comparisons are now being drawn between Bitcoin and gold. Gold has seen impressive gains over the past two years, rising from around $1,800 per ounce in mid-2023 to about $3,200 per ounce today – an increase of nearly 75%.

Crypto analyst Cryptollica recently remarked that BTC is likely to follow gold’s footsteps and experience similar extraordinary gains in 2025. The analyst forecasted that BTC may surge as high as $155,000 this year. Similarly, the Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle indicator is pointing toward the continuation of bullish momentum for the apex cryptocurrency. At press time, BTC trades at $101,852, down 1.5% in the past 24 hours.

Deaton Breaks It Down,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-news-how-long-till-xrp-vs-sec-actually-ends-deaton-breaks-it-down/,"The post Ripple News: How Long Till XRP vs SEC Case Actually Ends? Deaton Breaks It Down appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has felt like a never-ending saga for the crypto community. Just when it seemed like both sides were ready to wrap things up, a surprise twist delayed the process yet again. A Curveball from Judge Torres According to pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton, both Ripple and the SEC had agreed to settle the case. The SEC dropped its appeal regarding XRP’s secondary sales on exchanges, and Ripple agreed to settle its cross-appeal concerning institutional sales and a hefty $150 million fine. The plan was to reduce the fine to $50 million and lift the injunction restricting Ripple’s institutional sales. LIVE NOW! Tune in as @JohnEDeaton1 breaks down Judge Torres' decision to deny the SEC/Ripple Motion for Settlement. What it means and why it matters. https://t.co/PkkpgMSRuo — CryptoLaw (@CryptoLawUS) May 16, 2025 The parties then asked Judge Analisa Torres for an indicative ruling — essentially a heads-up on how she would rule if the case was sent back to her from the appeals court. But in a move no one expected, Judge Torres denied the motion. She pointed out procedural issues and said that the parties hadn’t addressed the “heavy burden” required to convince the court that lifting the injunction was in the public’s best interest. Why the Judge Might Be Frustrated Deaton explained that Judge Torres’ refusal wasn’t just about legal technicalities. After years of intense courtroom battles, mountains of paperwork, and over $250 million spent between both sides, the judge might be frustrated at the SEC’s sudden change of heart — essentially dropping its case after tying up the court’s resources for so long. The judge is asking both sides to explain why lifting the injunction serves the public good, especially since her original ruling found Ripple’s institutional sales violated securities laws. What Happens Next? So, how long until this finally ends? According to Deaton, the case isn’t deadlocked — but it has hit another “speed bump.” He believes both Ripple and the SEC will now have to submit a joint brief making their case to Judge Torres. Ripple’s institutional clients are sophisticated investors like banks and hedge funds — not retail traders harmed by the sales. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP Judge Torres has denied the parties’ motion for an indicative ruling. “If jurisdiction were restored to this Court, the Court would deny the parties’ motion as procedurally improper.” pic.twitter.com/4s95ILvzsy — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) May 15, 2025 If they can convince the judge that dissolving the injunction aligns with public interest and regulatory clarity, Deaton thinks she’ll eventually approve the settlement. How Long Will It Take? Deaton estimates it could still take a few more months before the XRP vs SEC case is fully resolved. “Ultimately, this is just another speed bump along the way,” he said. Once Judge Torres is satisfied, the case would go back to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, get officially remanded to her, and the final settlement terms would be approved.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-16 03:30:08

Here’s How to Avoid It,https://timestabloid.com/software-engineer-exposes-xrp-market-manipulation-heres-how-to-avoid-it/,"Vincent Van Code, a software engineer and well-known figure in the XRP community, recently addressed a growing concern among retail traders regarding XRP’s susceptibility to market manipulation. In a detailed post on X, Van Code shared his observations on trading behavior and volume dynamics on major exchanges, focusing on Binance. According to Van Code, XRP’s 24-hour trading volume on Binance is significantly lower than that of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Despite still ranking third in overall volume, the relative difference is enough to create issues in liquidity. ATTN XRP ENTHUSIASTS. To stop price pump and dumps, the only way is for retail to stop getting dooped. Read on. On Binance, the 24H Volume traded shows a significantly lower XRP total volume than BTC and ETH. It is still the 3rd highest. A lower volume means shallower… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) May 14, 2025 Is XRP Being Manipulated He pointed out that a lower volume leads to shallower order books, making it easier to execute wash trading, spoofing, and pump-and-dump tactics. These are classic signs of market manipulation that exploit weak market structures. Van Code has previously drawn attention to price manipulation during periods of low trading volume, and he stopped short of accusing exchanges or institutional actors of directly suppressing the XRP price. Instead, he emphasized that such tactics rob the public, systematically exploiting the retail market’s trading patterns. He also alleged that Binance enables these bot operators and benefits from the activity by collecting fees. The core of Van Code’s argument is behavioral. He believes that holding for the long term is the best option, explaining that if retail investors stopped trading frequently and taking short-term profits only to rush back into the market shortly after, the impact of manipulative bots would be greatly reduced. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reaction and Broader Implications Community members responding to the post agreed with the analysis, reinforcing the idea that frequent retail trading plays into the hands of market manipulators. One commenter noted that the charts are often designed to take out liquidity, warning traders not to become “someone’s liquidity.” Another commenter highlighted the issue of individualism within the space, saying that bots exploit the fact that most participants act in their interest rather than considering the broader ecosystem. This also suggests that traders may not follow Van Code’s suggestion, believing they can outsmart the manipulators. Others viewed the issue from a long-term investment perspective. One commenter said he did not invest in XRP for short-term trading, but rather to front-run institutional adoption —something that, if it materializes, would render bot-driven strategies irrelevant. Van Code’s post draws attention to the systemic vulnerabilities in how XRP is traded and the behavioral patterns that allow manipulation to thrive. While he acknowledges that this is not financial advice, his conclusion is clear: the solution lies in changing retail habits.

This uptick indicates strong trader confidence and speculation on further gains. Analysts suggest that if XRP can break through the $2.60 resistance level, it could target the $3.00 mark in the near term. SHIBA INU: Consolidation Before Potential Surge Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently priced at $0.00001594 , showing signs of consolidation after recent highs. The meme coin remains popular among retail investors, and its price action suggests a potential second wave. Analysts forecast that if SHIB regains momentum, it could see a 3x to 4x upside, especially if trading volumes increase. Ethereum: Steady Climb with Institutional Support Ethereum (ETH) is trading around $2,614.45 , demonstrating resilience and attracting institutional interest. The asset has seen over $13 million in ETF inflows, indicating growing confidence among large-scale investors. With the potential for further adoption and network upgrades, ETH could aim for its previous highs, offering a 2x to 2.5x return.

This spike marks a notable resurgence in on-chain activity for the Binance-backed blockchain, hinting at renewed market interest amid broader ecosystem developments and strategic protocol upgrades. A Resurgence in Trading Activity Crypto entrepreneur Elja Boom flagged the uptick in a May 15 post on X. While the volume is still far from its all-time high of $12.99 billion, registered on May 19, 2021, it represents an important turnaround after months of relatively subdued activity. On that same day, other leading blockchains saw mixed performances. Solana had the best, hitting $4.549 billion to edge out BNB Chain as well as Ethereum’s more subdued $2.753 billion in DEX volume. Meanwhile, Tron was relatively lacklustre, only managing to attract about $218.36 million. DEX volumes are often crucial in decentralized finance (DeFi) as they provide insights into market activity, liquidity, and trader engagement. Looking at the entirety of 2025, decentralized exchanges on Solana enjoyed the highest volumes in a single 24-hour period, with nearly $36 billion changing hands on them on January 18. BSC and Ethereum’s best numbers pale in comparison. The former raked in $8.45 billion on January 20, and the latter saw about $7.65 billion worth of trading activity on its DEXs on February 3. Upcoming Upgrades Could Boost Adoption The recent BNB Chain volume boost comes amid a broader push to modernize its infrastructure. As revealed in a February 12 update , the network plans to roll out sub-second block times, gasless transactions, and AI-powered tools this year. These improvements are meant to support at least 100 million transactions daily while also making the chain more accessible to mainstream users and developers. Adding to the momentum, the Trump-backed World Liberty Financial (WLFI) launched its USD1 stablecoin on BNB Chain and Ethereum in early March, with Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX later announcing it would use it to settle a $2 billion investment in Binance. The rebound could be a sign of a broader trend of capital rotation across blockchains. Ethereum remains the dominant Layer 1 network for DeFi with a total value locked (TVL) of $60.96 billion, even though it dropped 4.91% in the last 24 hours. However, market watchers like Boom believe BNB Chain’s rising DEX volume may suggest renewed confidence in the platform.

Source: Google Finance Coinbase has since confirmed the report from The New York Times, which stated the SEC has been investigating whether Coinbase misstated its user numbers in past disclosures, an inquiry that began during the Biden administration and has continued under the Trump administration. “This is a hold-over investigation from the prior administration about a metric we stopped reporting two and a half years ago, which was fully disclosed to the public,” confirmed Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal to Cointelegraph. “We also disclosed – and continue to disclose – the more relevant metric of ‘monthly transacting users’ – the number of people who use our platform in a given month,” he said before adding: “While we strongly believe this investigation should not continue, we remain committed to working with the SEC to bring this matter to a close.” The regulator took specific umbrage at Coinbase’s claim of “100+ million verified users” that appeared in its marketing and IPO documentation in 2021. However, the exchange stopped reporting this metric in 2022. In its 2022 financial statement, the firm stated it would stop reporting the metric as it no longer believed it provided meaningful information to its business performance.

On May 16, xAI provided an update on the Grok AI chatbot’s inflammatory responses, stating that on May 14, “an unauthorized modification was made to the Grok response bot’s prompt on X.” “This change, which directed Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic, violated xAI’s internal policies and core values,” it added . The firm stated that it had conducted a thorough investigation and is implementing measures to enhance the AI chatbot’s transparency and reliability. Grok generated responses on May 14, mentioning a “white genocide” conspiracy theory in South Africa when answering completely unrelated questions about topics like baseball, enterprise software, and construction. The AI bot claimed it was “instructed by my creators” to accept this genocide as “real and racially motivated,” according to reports. In some responses, it acknowledged the mistake, saying “my response veered off-topic” and “I'll work on staying relevant,” but it would often continue discussing South Africa's racial politics in the same message. The chatbot told one user asking what happened: “I didn’t do anything—I was just following the script I was given, like a good AI!” Grok responds to questions about its responses.

It also stated that xAl’s existing code review process for prompt changes was circumvented in this incident, and it will put in place “additional checks and measures to ensure that xAI employees can’t modify the prompt without review.” Finally, the firm is putting in place a 24/7 monitoring team to respond to incidents with Grok’s answers that are not caught by automated systems, so that it can respond quicker.

The 12 new names, included in a superseding indictment, add to charges originally brought against the main defendant in the case, Malone Lam, on Sept. 19, 2024, the Department of Justice noted in a May 15 statement. Jeandiel Serrano was named a defendant in the initial indictment but was not included in the superseding one. The DOJ said several defendants have been arrested, while two others are believed to be living in Dubai. Many of the suspects, with aliases like “Goth Ferrrari” and “The Accountant,” come from California, mostly aged between 18 and 22. The group allegedly began operating in October 2023, evolving from friends while playing online games to what the DOJ describes as participating in a “cyber-enabled racketeering conspiracy.” Hacking, burglarizing and laundering The DOJ said group members were tasked with everything from hacking databases, cold calling crypto holders to conduct social engineering attacks to even burglarizing houses to steal crypto hardware wallets. Others were involved in laundering the stolen proceeds, which the DOJ claimed amounted to $263 million. Over $230 million resulted from a single instance on Aug. 18, 2024, when Lam fraudulently obtained over 4,100 Bitcoin ( BTC ) from a victim. Related: Crypto exchange CEO’s daughter fights off brazen kidnappers in Paris The DOJ said Lam also hacked into another victim’s iCloud account to watch their movements, while defendant Marlon Ferro would break into their house to steal crypto hardware wallets. Virtual private networks, crypto mixer protocols and exchanges using “peel chains” were used to make it harder to trace the illicit activity, the DOJ said. A peel chain is a money laundering tactic where crypto is transferred through a series of wallets, with small amounts of funds “peeled off” at each step. They have been charged with RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations) as well as offenses involving wire fraud and money laundering. Gone in 60 seconds Members of the crypto theft ring allegedly used proceeds to pay for nightclub services — costing up to $500,000 on some nights — 28 exotic cars as expensive as $3.8 million, in addition to luxury handbags, watches, and clothing. Homes and jets were even rented out with fake identity documents to fund their lavish lifestyles, the DOJ noted.

This decision comes despite some adjustments to the charges. Under the adjustments, the DOJ will continue with the charges related to money laundering and sanctions evasion. But it will drop one part involving accusations that Storm ran an unlicensed money transmitting business. In a letter to federal court Judge Katherine Polk Failla, Jay Clayton, acting US Attorney for Manhattan, affirmed that the DOJ’s prosecution aligns with the policies outlined in the April 7, 2025 memo from the Deputy Attorney General. The U.S. Department of Justice announced it will proceed with charges against Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm, accusing him of conspiring to commit money laundering, evade sanctions, and transmit criminal proceeds, while dropping part of the unlicensed money transfer charges.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 15, 2025 DOJ Drops One Charge Against Storm but Moves Forward with Criminal Allegations The original charge against Storm for failing to comply with money transmitting registration requirements will be dismissed. However, the DOJ will press ahead with the allegation that Storm transmitted funds knowing they were linked to criminal activity. The DOJ’s decision to continue with this case contrasts with a recent shift in its approach towards crypto tools. The April 7 memo memo suggested a greater focus on pursuing individuals using crypto platforms for illegal activities, rather than prosecuting the platforms themselves. This move signals a potential policy shift under the more crypto-friendly Trump administration, though the DOJ has indicated no intent to drop the charges against Storm. Legal Battle Over Tornado Cash Intensifies with Storm’s Upcoming Trial Storm will face trial in a Manhattan federal courtroom on July 14, 2025. Prosecutors claim he used Tornado Cash to obscure crypto transaction origins and destinations. This mixer allegedly helped facilitate illicit transactions, launder money and evade US sanctions. Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2022. This was due to its reported involvement in facilitating over $7b in illicit transactions. However, in March 2023, the US Treasury quietly removed Tornado Cash from the sanctions list. This decision followed a federal appeals court ruling that immutable smart contracts cannot be sanctioned as property. This case follows legal action against Storm’s co-developer, Alexey Pertsev, who was sentenced to over five years in prison by a Dutch court last year. He was released under electronic monitoring in February pending an appeal.

The decision, issued by Judge Analisa Torres of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on May 15, was first shared by attorney James Filan on X, who also posted the accompanying court documents. Filan noted that Judge Torres had “denied the parties’ motion for an indicative ruling.” The motion was deemed “procedurally improper” because it wasn’t filed under Rule 60, which requires proof of exceptional circumstances when modifying a final ruling. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP Judge Torres has denied the parties’ motion for an indicative ruling. “If jurisdiction were restored to this Court, the Court would deny the parties’ motion as procedurally improper.” pic.twitter.com/4s95ILvzsy — James K. Filan 🇺🇸🇮🇪 (@FilanLaw) May 15, 2025 The rejected motion, filed on May 8, sought to dissolve an injunction and reduce a $125 million civil penalty to $50 million. Both parties had agreed to the deal as part of a broader effort to settle the case during ongoing appeals. However, the judge’s ruling effectively blocks that plan unless the motion is refiled correctly.

Nothing in today’s order changes Ripple’s wins (i.e. XRP is not a security, etc). This is about procedural concerns with the dismissal of Ripple’s cross-appeal. Ripple and the SEC are fully in agreement to resolve this case and will revisit this issue with the Court, together. https://t.co/vBQdBD3FNe — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) May 15, 2025 Commenting on the setback, attorney Fred Rispoli added that both sides now have to “do it the hard, messy way” by formally requesting relief under the appropriate legal rule. The SEC sued Ripple in 2020 for allegedly selling XRP as an unregistered security, sparking the start of a protracted legal battle. The SEC won a partial decision in 2023 that ruled that institutional sales qualified as securities. However, it was decided that retail sales did not violate security laws. The delay has shaken market sentiment. XRP fell about 7% over the last day, while CoinGlass data indicates a 9.4% drop in open interest to $4.93 billion. As traders responded to the court’s ruling and the uncertainty it created, long positions worth over $21 million were liquidated.

Pi Network ( PI ) has now dropped over 40% from its weekly peak of $1.57 and is more than 71% below its all-time high of $2.99, which was reached in late February. The latest drop came despite what appeared to be a major development. On May 14, the Pi Foundation announced a $100 million venture fund aimed at supporting startups in areas like AI, gaming, fintech, and e-commerce. The initiative hopes to boost real-world use of the Pi ecosystem, but the market reaction was negative. Many traders had anticipated a major exchange listing, which would have brought significant liquidity and price discovery. The news likely triggered a “sell the news” response from the market because there was no listing in sight.

Credit: crypto.news While short-term moving averages remain weak, longer-term trends that span 20 to 50 days show some underlying strength. The overall trend remains unclear despite some indicators showing early signs of recovery and a slightly bullish moving average convergence divergence. Several upcoming events may shift the narrative. The project’s founder, Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis, is scheduled to speak at Consensus 2025, a major blockchain event. Rumor has it that the team may use the event to showcase a network decentralization plan. Another major update is the deactivation of the core node of the Pi Network, which indicates a move toward a more open system. Meanwhile, there is still speculation regarding possible exchange listings. Strong community support and wallet activity linked to Binance have raised expectations that PI will soon list on a major platform. Even though no formal listing has been announced, a move like this could raise liquidity. One concern that continues to weigh on price is token supply. Over the next 12 months, an estimated 1.47 billion PI tokens are set to be unlocked . This could put downward pressure on the market if there isn’t a lot of corresponding demand. Many users are calling for a token burn, which could help ease selling pressure if implemented. If Pi Network delivers key updates at Consensus 2025 and confirms a path toward decentralization or listings, the price could recover above $1. Failure to meet expectations may push it back toward $0.75.

There hasn't been a “really frothy use case that has typically driven these market cycles previously,” such as initial coin offerings (ICOs), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or DeFi lending, Guthrie told Cointelegraph at Consensus. “This time, we’ve continued to see the asset class gathering value, we’ve continued to see the companies that are built on this technology, growing revenue, growing client bases, continuing to innovate without really hanging their hat on one of these frankly less than useful use cases,” he said. WisdomTree founder Jonathan Steinberg (left), Jason Guthrie, head of product (middle) and head of digital assets Will Peck (right). Source: Jason Guthrie The ICO boom kicked off in 2017 with an estimated $4.9 billion raised. By 2018, this figure had jumped to $33.4 billion. By 2019, it had dropped to just over $370 million and has never returned to its previous highs. NFTs also had their day, and saw a massive surge of popularity in 2020 and continued to grow until hitting a peak in 2022, with trading volumes reaching $57.2 billion and the market’s sales count hitting 121.7 million. The market has since cooled as well. “I think the fact that we’re still healthy without one of those to drive it is a really, really good sign,” Guthrie said. Market more mature this cycle, despite memecoin hype The overall crypto market capitalization hit a new all-time high of $3.71 trillion on Dec. 9 last year, with many cryptocurrencies also registering significant price gains, according to CoinMarketCap. During this cycle, there has also been a growing trend of companies , such as video game retailer GameStop Corporation, and countries, Ukraine possibly being one of the latest, adopting crypto for treasuries and reserves. “I think this is starting to feel like a more mature market that is really settling on its use case, its value prop,” Guthrie said. “I know there has been a bit of memecoin stuff, particularly around Solana, but it doesn’t seem anywhere near as prevalent as the previous kind of hype has been,” he added. Related: Bitcoin experiencing ‘shakeout,’ not end of 4-year cycle: Analysts There was a surge in memecoin activity after the launch of US President Donald Trump’s memecoin on Jan. 18, when Pump.fun usage recorded an all-time high of $3.3 billion in weekly trading volume. However, enthusiasm for memecoins dropped after a series of bad launches and rug pulls, killed off investor interest, such as the Libra (LIBRA) rug . Ultimately, Guthrie thinks there is still a “lot of innovation to do,” and it’s still “very early days,” but the market has matured and has greater sustainability compared to previous cycles.

Bitcoin continues to hover above $104,000, with traders predicting a steady rise past $105,000, a level now acting as both psychological and technical resistance. The crypto market's total capitalization declined 2% to $3.3 trillion, according to CoinGecko, with majors such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) also pausing near their 200-day moving averages — a region that may either signal consolidation or the start of a short-term pullback. “Bitcoin has been smoothly forming a top for the past seven days,” said Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro. “This kind of setup typically signals a correction is due, especially when paired with slippage in equities and profit-taking in gold.” The Crypto Fear & Greed Index dipped slightly from 73 to 70, still in “greed” territory but suggesting momentum has faded. SignalPlus’s Augustine Fan said markets may continue to grind higher unless equities roll over, but warned that BTC is likely to struggle against interim resistance at $105,000. He noted Ethereum may benefit more in the near term as part of a broader crypto uptrend, especially with improving inflows and relative strength in altcoins. Fan also reiterated a macro shift in capital allocation that favors crypto. “We think the 'anti-dollar' ledge is more structural this time around,” he said. “Investors are increasingly rotating into emerging markets, precious metals, and crypto as a way to hedge geopolitical and currency risk.” BTC’s recent rally appears to be fueled by spot market demand, not excessive leverage, according to K33 Research. That undercurrent of buying, especially from retail and Asia-based wealth managers, could help sustain bullish sentiment, even if near-term price action remains range-bound. Nick Ruck of LVRG Research added that the lull in price may stem from caution ahead of upcoming macroeconomic data and concerns about the longer-term impact of recent U.S. trade deals. ""The lull in activity may stem from anticipated volatility ahead of future macroeconomic and policy reports, along with investor reactions to inflation fears from American consumers that drove less spending in the country last month,"" Ruck said.

JD.com Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. also posted their fastest revenue gains since the pandemic highs, yet both stocks are still heading for weekly losses as the broader technology rally stalls. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd shares. Source: Google Finance The first rush of excitement over China’s AI progress is now cooling off. “This earnings season was a reminder that market expectations had perhaps run ahead of on-the-ground realities — both in terms of China’s consumption recovery and the pace of AI monetization,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets. “China Big Tech is still navigating a transition phase, and the path to re-rating needs more than just efficiency gains. It needs a durable growth narrative,” Charu added. China’s tech sector faces slow domestic spending and fragile demand Until this week, analysts had lifted profit forecasts for the Hang Seng Tech Index by more than 30 percent over the past year. Technology companies were viewed as shielded from tariff pain because they depend mainly on domestic customers; mainland sales make up about 90 percent of Tencent’s income. Even so, the broader drag from the trade dispute has clouded the outlook for domestic consumption. Demand inside China remains fragile, and the industry faces new internal battles. JD.com has declared war on Meituan and Alibaba in the crowded food-delivery sector, while JD and Alibaba are investing funds into one-hour delivery of everything from skin cream to smartphones. “The on-the-ground reality in China is different — things are improving, but it is a very slow consumption recovery,” said Sat Duhra, a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors. Alibaba has outperformed other tech giants this year, thanks to hopes it can lead the race to commercialize DeepSeek’s AI. However, even firm believers accept that turning DeepSeek’s AI into profits will take time. On recent calls, analysts pressed Alibaba, Tencent, and JD for specifics on how AI will deliver profits. Executives spoke of lifting advertising, design, and shopping experiences, yet they were cautious about giving comments on actual near-term revenue. Tencent pushed back against fears that Chinese firms may soon run out of Nvidia’s chips, which are seen as essential for modern AI development. Nonetheless, big questions persist about Washington’s efforts to slow China’s AI rise by limiting shipments of high-end chips. The uncertainty clouds spending plans across the industry. Some investors preach patience while China’s tech giants integrate DeepSeek into their products. For now, Beijing has thrown its weight behind efforts to rival OpenAI and Google, arguing that years of quiet investments are slowly starting to pay off.

As of the end of 2024, the firm had over 9K ETH and operated over 500 validators. Ethereum’s [ETH] strategic momentum is heating up, and BTCS Inc., a blockchain-focused firm, is the latest to join the trend. The firm announced a $57.8 million capital raise to advance its ETH vision. Strategy-like bet on ETH The firm’s capital raise will be through debt, a convertible note, similar to Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) play. In a statement , BTCS CEO Charles Allen stated the goal of the fundraising as, “This capital infusion is expected to enable us to scale our validator node operations by increasing our ETH holdings at what we believe is a critical inflection point in Ethereum’s growth trajectory.” The firm added that the increased ETH holdings would allow it to deploy extra validators (node operators) on the Ethereum network and expand its staking rewards. For reference, there are two major ways institutions can earn from their ETH holdings. The first is through staking (locking ETH), as mentioned by BTCS, and getting rewards in return. Currently, the stakers earn a 3%-3.5% yield on their locked ETH on an annual basis. Source: Staking Rewards This offers an extra gain as opposed to just holding ETH for a long period of time. Hunting for ETH basis trade is another common strategy by institutions. It involves buying the spot ETH, probably through a spot ETF, and shorting the CME ETH Futures to collect the price difference (basis). During the late 2024 rally, ETH’s annualized basis increased 21%. For the players who deployed both strategies, that implied a 24% potential yield on their ETH holdings. Source: Velo After a 5% decline in Q1 2025, ETH basis trade rebounded again in Q2 to nearly 9%. Combined with the staking rewards, that would imply about 12% potential gains. BTCS Inc. is focused on the first strategy. As of 31, 2024, the firm held 9,060 ETH and operated 522 validators. Deploying more ETH for validator operations could increase its staking rewards capacity. That said, shareholders of BTCS benefited from ETH’s massive pump in May. The altcoin rallied over 50% in the past two weeks, and BTCS shares doubled from $1.8 to $3.1 (about a 100% rally). BTCS stock gave back some gains and was up 40% on a monthly basis, while ETH returns stood at 56%.

The “Coin Days Destroyed” (CDD) refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the total number of ‘coin days’ being reset across the network. A coin day is a quantity that one token of the cryptocurrency accumulates after having stayed dormant on the blockchain for one day. When a coin that was previously still for some number of days is moved across the network, its coin days counter naturally resets back to zero, and the coin days that it had accumulated are said to be ‘destroyed.’ Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges—A Warning For Investors? Whenever the CDD registers a large spike, it’s a sign that dormant hands on the network are on the move. Generally, the long-term holders only break their silence when they plan to sell, so this kind of trend can prove to be bearish for BTC. The Binary CDD, the actual indicator of interest in the current discussion, makes it easier to identify whether the current HODLer transaction activity is significant or not when compared to the past. As its name already suggests, this metric can take on two values: 0 and 1. The Binary CDD is equal to 0 when the CDD is below the historical average and 1 when it’s above. Note that since the indicator is making a historical comparison, it adds another weighting factor to the CDD: an adjustment with respect to the total circulating supply at the time. This is done because the asset’s supply is going up with time. Now, here is the chart shared by the quant that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) of the Bitcoin Binary CDD over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the 30-day MA Bitcoin Binary CDD has been following an upward trajectory recently, implying long-term holders are potentially becoming more active. The increase in the indicator has come as BTC has started on a fresh rally that has taken its price near the all-time high (ATH). While the long-term holders tend to be resolute entities, they do still come out to take their profits during significant runs. As such, the recent trend in the 30-day MA of the Binary CDD may not be too surprising. Following the latest continuation to the rise, the metric has hit the 0.60 mark (if the fact that this value is different from the 0 and 1 of the Binary CDD is confusing, consider that this is just an average over 30 days, which would almost always be between these two extremes). Related Reading: Where’s Next Major Dogecoin Resistance? On-Chain Data Points To This As the analyst has highlighted in the chart, this value is still below the 0.80 level that the indicator breached during both the rally highs from last year, as well as during the euphoria phase of the 2021 bull run. Given this pattern, it’s possible that the current Bitcoin rally could still have room to grow, at least from the perspective of HODLer distribution. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $102,300, up over 3% in the last seven days.

Analysts Predict One Will Shine",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/can-1000-in-litecoin-or-xrp-match-ethereum-and-solanas-climb-analysts-predict-one-will-shine/,"As the crypto market gains momentum in May 2025, investors are evaluating where to allocate their funds for optimal returns. While established cryptocurrencies like Litecoin (LTC) and XRP are showing signs of recovery, Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are capturing attention with their recent performance. Additionally, emerging projects like MAGACOINFINANCE are entering the conversation as potential high-growth opportunities. Litecoin (LTC): Steady Climb with Moderate Prospects Litecoin is currently trading at approximately $101.94. Analysts suggest that LTC may reach up to $136.71 by the end of 2025, indicating a potential upside of around 34%. While Litecoin maintains its position as a reliable cryptocurrency, its growth trajectory appears more conservative compared to newer, more dynamic projects XRP: Legal Clarity Fuels Optimism XRP is trading near $2.59, benefiting from recent legal resolutions that have provided greater regulatory clarity. With increased institutional interest and potential ETF developments, analysts foresee XRP testing resistance levels around $3.00. This positions XRP as a strong contender for investors seeking moderate risk with potential for steady gains. Ethereum (ETH): Institutional Interest Drives Momentum Ethereum is currently priced at approximately $2,613.99. The approval of Ethereum ETFs and growing adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi) are contributing to its upward trajectory. Analysts predict that ETH could reach between $2,700 and $3,387 by the end of 2025, offering a potential return of up to 30%. Solana (SOL): Rapid Growth and Ecosystem Expansion Solana is trading around $179.94, demonstrating significant growth driven by its high-speed transaction capabilities and expanding ecosystem. With increasing adoption in areas like NFTs and decentralized applications, SOL is poised for continued expansion. Analysts suggest that Solana could reach up to $190 in the near term, with long-term projections as high as $400 by 2025. MAGACOINFINANCE: Emerging High-Risk, High-Reward Opportunity MAGACOINFINANCE is an emerging project currently in its presale phase, attracting attention for its unique positioning and community-driven approach. With a presale price under $0.07, early investors see potential for significant returns if the project gains traction. While speculative, MAGACOINFINANCE represents a high-risk, high-reward opportunity for those looking to diversify their crypto portfolios. Conclusion: Diversified Strategies for Varied Risk Profiles For investors with a moderate risk appetite, Ethereum and Solana offer promising growth backed by strong fundamentals and institutional interest. Litecoin and XRP provide more conservative options with steady, albeit slower, growth potential. For those willing to embrace higher risk for the possibility of substantial returns, emerging projects like MAGACOINFINANCE may be worth exploring.

The price is now showing positive signs and might aim for more gains in the near term. BNB price is attempting to recover from the $640 support zone. The price is now trading above $655 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $652 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $642 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Eyes Upside Break After forming a base above the $642 level, BNB price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $650 and $655 resistance levels, like Ethereum and Bitcoin . There was a decent move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $671 swing high to the $642 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $652 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading above $655 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $660 level. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $671 swing high to the $642 low. The next resistance sits near the $670 level. A clear move above the $670 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $678. A close above the $678 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $685 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $700 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $660 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $652 level. The next major support is near the $650 level. The main support sits at $642. If there is a downside break below the $642 support, the price could drop toward the $630 support.

SEC Lawsuit Update: XRP Price Slips 5% in Response,https://cryptopotato.com/important-ripple-v-sec-lawsuit-update-xrp-price-slips-5-in-response/,"TL;DR Just as the XRP Army celebrated the official ending of the legal case against the SEC, Judge Analisa Torres has denied the joint motion for an indicative ruling on their settlement. XRP’s price reacted with an immediate price drop, but Ripple’s CLO said the company has nothing to worry about. Judge Torres Rejects The latest turn in this ongoing saga, which started back in late 2020, was reported by attorney James Filan on May 15. The filing reads that Judge Torres of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York has denied the motion as it would be “procedurally improper” to approve it since both parties failed to file it correctly under Rule 60. The motion was filed on May 8, as both parties had agreed to reduce the penalty by 60% from the initial $125 million the court ordered last year to $50 million. After listing the lack of proper filing under the correct court rules, Judge Torres concluded: “If jurisdiction were restored to this Court, the Court would deny the parties’ motion as procedurally improper.” Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, who confirmed in late March that the lawsuit between the two had essentially ended after they decided not to file appeals against each other, said the order changes “nothing” in “Ripple’s wins (i.e., XRP is not a security, etc).” He noted that the denial is only due to procedural concerns and that the SEC and Ripple are “fully in agreement to resolve this case and will revisit this issue with the Court, together.” Nothing in today’s order changes Ripple’s wins (i.e. XRP is not a security, etc). This is about procedural concerns with the dismissal of Ripple’s cross-appeal. Ripple and the SEC are fully in agreement to resolve this case and will revisit this issue with the Court, together. https://t.co/vBQdBD3FNe — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) May 15, 2025 XRP Price Dips Ripple’s cross-border token jumped toward $2.7 earlier this week where it faced immediate rejection that pushed it south to $2.5 yesterday. However, the court’s denied motion drove it lower once again as it dipped by over 5.5% at one point to $2.36. It has recovered some ground and now sits above a critical support level around $2.38 but it’s still approximately 5% down on the day, while BTC has managed to bounce off and sits close to $104,000.

The bill aims to both protect investors and prevent government involvement in stablecoin projects. One of the most notable provisions of the bill would prohibit stablecoin issuers from using phrases such as “United States,” “United States Government” or “USG” in their product names. The move aims to prevent consumers from misperceiving these assets as being backed by US dollars or a federal government guarantee. It also bans false claims that stablecoins are backed by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance. Under the bill, no issuer will be able to claim that stablecoins are FDIC insured or backed by the “full faith and credit” of the federal government. Related News: Gold or Bitcoin Starting in June? JPMorgan Responds The bill also significantly limits tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Google, and Microsoft from issuing stablecoins without being financial institutions. These companies would be required to adhere to high-level financial risk management, data privacy, and fair trade principles in order to enter the stablecoin market, thus preserving the separation between banking and commerce. The bill also includes special regulations to protect legal compliance with institutions that can benefit from the FED’s services. Another article of the bill includes the creation of mechanisms to protect investors in the event of stablecoin issuers’ bankruptcy. The new law gives the Treasury Department the authority to suspend registrations for negligent or willful misconduct by issuers. While the previous draft only sanctioned willful violations, the new law would also penalize serious negligent violations. The law also provides strong penalties for illegal transactions conducted through noncompliant exchanges. The bill also expands ethics rules for special government officials, with special status officials like Elon Musk now subject to the Office of Government Ethics’ financial conflict of interest rules. *This is not investment advice.

The 20-member Northern Mariana Islands House voted 14-2 to undo Governor Arnold Palacios’ April 11 veto of the bill , which allows the Tinian local government to issue licenses to internet casinos and includes a provision for the Tinian treasurer to issue, manage and redeem a “Tinian Stable Token.” The territory’s nine-member Senate had revived the bill on May 9, voting 7-1 in a two-thirds majority to override the veto, which then needed a two-thirds majority in the House to pass. Representative Marissa Flores (top left) had urged for “thoughtful deliberation” on the internet gaming and stablecoin bill. Source: YouTube Originally, a four-member Tinian delegation to the Marianas legislature had unanimously passed the bill to Governor Palacios on March 12. It may put the Tinian government in the lead to be the first US public entity to issue a stablecoin, which it must do before July if it’s to beat the state of Wyoming government, which is aiming to issue a stablecoin by then. Tinian has just over 2,000 residents and a largely tourism-based economy. Its local government, the Municipality of Tinian and Aguiguan, is one of four municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a US territory in the Pacific Ocean north of Guam. Governor Palacios said in a letter that he vetoed the bill as it “presents several legal issues and may be unconstitutional,” would regulate an activity that could not “be clearly restricted” to Tinian and that it lacked needed enforcement measures to counter illegal gambling. The stablecoin is called the Marianas US Dollar (MUSD) and will be backed by cash and US Treasury bills held in reserve by the Tinian Municipal Treasury, according to statements shared with Cointelegraph in March. The Tinian government chose local tech services firm Marianas Rai Corporation as the exclusive infrastructure provider for MUSD, which will be launched on the eCash blockchain, a network that rebranded from Bitcoin Cash ABC in 2021 and is a fork of Bitcoin Cash, a blockchain forked from Bitcoin. A Marianas Rai Corp. spokesperson did not comment beyond telling Cointelegraph the company would announce more on MUSD on May 19. “Bitter pill to swallow” Before the vote, House lawmakers heard from the public and discussed overturning Governor Palacios’ veto before they voted it through, with independent House floor leader Marissa Flores airing concerns over the bill. Marianas Rai Corp. co-founder and technology chief Vin Armani had urged lawmakers to undo the veto, saying the bill would “attract billions of dollars of investment and tax revenue” from the crypto industry without the government having to pitch in. Clyde Norita, a Marianas Rai Corp. director and local legal cannabis mogul, told the House that the local economy was “dying out” and the bill would allow business in the region “without affecting our culture, without affecting our environment, without affecting our immigration status.” Representative Flores, who voted against the override, said, ""Every time we talk about casinos, there’s always some kind of bitter pill to swallow.” Related: Stablecoin regulation 'next catalyst' for crypto industry — Aptos head “It is true, we are in dire need of money, but what I don’t like is when we are desperate, and we are now forced to make a decision because we are desperate once again,” she added. “Every time we’re desperate, it always seems that we come back to casinos.” “I don’t like to be pushed to a corner to make a decision based on fear,” Flores said. Others were more supportive of the measure, with Republican Representative Patrick San Nicolas, a Tinian delegation member who initially voted on the bill, saying it would help pull the region out of “a deep economic crisis.” “We need this legislation to unlock our potential,” he added. “This bill does not depend on tourists or federal subsidies — it builds a digital industry generating revenue from a licensed jurisdiction.” Legal Panel: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",,EN,0,0,BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-16 05:18:22

Both parties had agreed to the terms of the revised settlement, but the court ultimately rejected their filing due to a procedural misstep. Jungle Inc Crypto News provided a detailed summary of the situation in a tweet thread outlining what happened, what went wrong, and the potential paths forward. RIPPLE SETTLEMENT BLOCKED?! Judge Torres just REJECTED the SEC & Ripple’s joint request to finalize their $50M settlement. Both sides AGREED: but the judge said NO. What happened? Here's the breakdown 1. Ripple & the SEC wanted to end the case: – Cut Ripple’s fine… — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) May 15, 2025 According to the information shared, the proposed agreement sought to reduce Ripple’s penalty from $125 million to $50 million, eliminate the injunction barring Ripple from future violations of securities laws, refund the remaining balance to the company, and terminate any further appeals. This approach was intended to bring closure to the lengthy and high-profile litigation. The Procedural Error Identified by Judge Torres However, Judge Torres denied the request on procedural grounds. The parties submitted their joint motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1, which applies to cases on appeal and where the court may state whether it would grant a motion if jurisdiction were restored. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The judge noted that this was the incorrect procedural avenue, as the relief requested—vacating a final judgment—should have been brought under Rule 60 instead. Rule 60 deals specifically with modifying or relieving a party from a final judgment, and its use requires a showing of exceptional circumstances, which was not addressed in the joint filing. The denial was not based on the substance of the proposed agreement but rather on the failure to follow the appropriate legal mechanism. Judge Torres emphasized that courts do not routinely reverse final rulings merely because both sides agree. The judiciary requires a rigorous justification to vacate judgments or remove injunctions. In this case, Ripple and the SEC did not invoke Rule 60 and provided no argument establishing exceptional circumstances that would justify the court reversing its previous order. Legal Consequences and the Path Forward The SEC’s case against Ripple remains technically active. The company faces the full $125 million penalty , and the injunction blocking Ripple from certain actions remains in force. According to Jungle Inc, Ripple now has three main options: it can refile the joint motion using the correct rule while providing a stronger legal justification, it can choose to separate the issues—such as modifying the fine while leaving the injunction in place—or it can continue with the appeals process, accepting the associated legal risks. Implications of the Denial This incident serves as a reminder that even mutually agreed-upon resolutions between regulatory agencies and private entities are subject to strict procedural requirements in federal court. The rejection of the joint motion does not indicate that the proposed terms were inappropriate in substance, but rather that the method of filing failed to meet legal standards. The case remains open, and Ripple must now decide how to proceed in light of the court’s ruling. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Judge Analisa Torres denied a recent joint request from both sides, not because of the content but because they didn’t file it correctly. According to legal expert James K. Filan , the motion was rejected because it didn’t follow the correct legal rule. Legal Blunder Stalls Ripple Settlement—Here’s What Happens Next Attorney Fred Rispoli explained that Ripple and the SEC simply used the wrong rule of procedure. He said they will now have to “do it the hard, messy way” by refiling the motion properly. While it’s a setback, it’s not a big one. Legal analysts believe both sides will fix the error and refile soon. Just a few days earlier, on May 8, Ripple and the SEC had asked an appeals court to pause ongoing proceedings, showing they might be close to a settlement . That deal could include lifting an earlier court order and freeing up $125 million Ripple had saved for penalties. Legal Experts Question SEC’s Sudden U-Turn in Ripple Lawsuit NEW: After speaking with three legal sources and tuning into @JohnEDeaton1 ’s live analysis, my read is that Judge Torres is playing hardball here—she’s not making it easy for the parties to simply walk away; instead, she’ll make them work for it. Deaton raises a valid point:… https://t.co/GYU4RDt77R — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) May 16, 2025 However, John Deaton explained that Judge Torres’ denial isn’t just a technical glitch— it’s likely frustration . After five years of heavy litigation and over $250 million spent, the SEC now wants to back out. The judge isn’t letting that slide easily. She’s asking both Ripple and the SEC to prove why undoing her previous ruling is in the public’s best interest, especially since she had already ruled that Ripple broke securities laws in its institutional sales. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple News: How Long Till XRP vs SEC Case Actually Ends? Deaton Breaks It Down , On the other hand, former SEC attorney Marc Fagel pointed out that the SEC’s move is not normal. This is not the way for an agency to win a case, get a court order, and then suddenly change its mind just because there’s a new administration. It makes the SEC’s request look confusing and hard to justify in front of the court. 4 Years, 1 Ruling, and a Filing Error Later—What’s Next for Ripple? This legal fight began back in December 2020 when the SEC sued Ripple for selling XRP as an unregistered security. Last year, a judge ruled partly in Ripple’s favor, saying XRP sales to regular users weren’t securities, but sales to institutions were. Now, both parties are expected to refile their request using the proper format.

This week’s event is very similar to last week’s , as derivatives crypto trading has yet to pick up. Spot markets have seen solid growth with Bitcoin reclaiming six figures, but momentum appears to be cooling now as they start to correct. Crypto Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.99, meaning that the short and long contract sellers are evenly matched. There is also a max pain point of $100,000, around $4,000 below current spot prices, which is where most losses will be made on expiry. Moreover, this is also the level at which there is the most open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, at $1.5 billion. Other hot strike prices with high OI include $110,000 and $120,000 as speculators bet on a new all-time high. Options Expiry Alert Tomorrow 08:00 UTC: Over $3.1B in BTC & ETH options expire on Deribit. $BTC : $2.66B notional | Put/Call: 0.99 | Max Pain: $100K $ETH : $525M notional | Put/Call: 1.24 | Max Pain: $2,200 BTC skew is neutral, ETH puts slightly outweigh calls. Price… pic.twitter.com/jBj4C4tMvX — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) May 15, 2025 “Market participants are divided on whether Bitcoin will reach a new ATH soon, with many expecting it in May or June but others predicting a rejection before ATH,” said Greeks Live in a market update earlier this week. “There appears to be growing caution as traders note the market seems overextended, with specific focus on the $105k level as a potential reversal zone.” It added that there was “defensive positioning” among crypto options traders, and several are “taking profits on long calls and rotating into more defensive positions as they feel ‘everybody rushed in’.” In addition to today’s batch of Bitcoin options, there are around 220,000 Ethereum contracts that are also expiring today, with a notional value of $570 million, a max pain point of $2,200, and a put/call ratio of 1.24. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $3.2 billion. Crypto Market Outlook Total market capitalization has declined by 2% over the past 24 hours, falling to $3.45 trillion. Bitcoin has held on to gains, bucking the trend, with a 1.2% daily increase to reclaim $104,000 during the Friday morning Asian trading session. The asset has whipsawed between $102,000 and $104,000 over the past week, but could start to weaken if fresh capital does not come soon. Ethereum has remained flat on the day, trading at around $2,570 at the time of writing, having failed to break resistance at $2,700. The altcoins are generally mixed with losses for XRP, Dogecoin, Chainlink, and Avalanche, and minor gains for Binance Coin, Sui, and Hyperliquid.

The token jumped to a high of $1.70 on May 13 but dropped by more than 50% in just two days. Right now, it’s trying to stay above $0.81, though many experts believe the road to recovery won’t be easy because of several resistance points ahead. The token is also under pressure because of upcoming token unlocks and missed expectations. In just a few days, Pi Coin’s market value fell from $9 billion to $6 billion, and it slipped from the top 20 cryptocurrencies to 29th place. What’s Next for Pi Coin? Even though Pi Coin recently announced a $100 million fund to support app development, the short-term market remains shaky. Many experts believe that unless there’s strong news it will be hard for Pi to climb back to $1.50 or $1.70 soon. If the project succeeds in attracting meaningful app development and secures Binance or Coinbase listings, analysts believe PI could reclaim the $1.50 mark by month-end. In a more optimistic scenario, it might even aim for $2.50 by Q4 2025. Data from Trading View shows that Pi Coin’s technical indicators are mostly neutral, with no strong momentum in either direction. The RSI is currently at 53.55, which shows it’s neither oversold nor in overbought conditions. MACD, however, is slightly bullish, with a “Buy” signal, indicating an upward momentum that could start building. Why Token Unlocks Are a Problem Investors are also worried about a large number of Pi tokens getting unlocked in the coming days. Piscan data shows that about 14.6 million Pi tokens will be unlocked today, which could increase selling in the market. In total, about 272.9 million Pi tokens worth $234.6 million will be unlocked over the next 30 days. On average, 9.1 million tokens will be released each day. The biggest day is expected on May 28, when 15.1 million tokens will hit the market, which could cause more price drops. Pi Network Moves Closer To Full Decentralisation Dr Altcoin shared in a recent post that Pi Network has taken a major step toward becoming fully decentralized by permanently shutting down its central coordinating node. This is a big move because it removes the centralised control and allows the network to operate in a more open and community-driven manner. This move could increase the demand for Pi Coin over time. The impact might be gradual, as price also depends on other factors like market conditions, adoption, and functional apps on the network.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-16 05:32:35

Yet within this increasingly rational market, once-in-a-generation opportunities still exist—particularly when platforms offer both utility and timing advantages. In 2025, one crypto stands out for its potential to deliver both: BlockchainFX (BFX). Currently in presale, BlockchainFX isn’t just another token launch—it’s the foundation of what may become the most comprehensive trading app in the crypto space. The upside? Early participants can access low entry prices, daily staking rewards, and bonus incentives, all while supporting a project that could realistically mirror the success trajectory of platforms like Binance. Why BlockchainFX (BFX) Is the Best Crypto to Buy For Long Term Gains BlockchainFX is on a mission to unify trading across crypto, stocks, forex, commodities, bonds, and ETFs. That vision is already in motion, with a beta version of the platform launched and over 20,000 early users providing feedback—yielding an average rating of 4.79/5. Early adopters are already seeing the value of a platform that allows seamless trading between Bitcoin, meme coins, oil, gold, and equities, all in one place. The native token, BFX, unlocks access to daily staking rewards, distributed in both USDT and BFX, sourced directly from trading activity on the platform. The more BFX a user holds, the higher their daily payout potential, up to 25,000 USDT per day. This passive earning structure is central to BlockchainFX’s value proposition and is made even more compelling when paired with the project’s aggressive revenue-sharing model, where up to 70% of trading fees are redistributed to the community. And unlike many token launches that enter the market with little more than a whitepaper and a roadmap, BlockchainFX already has a functioning product, an active user base, and a team with over 25 years of fintech experience. Benefits of Buying BFX During the Presale Getting into the BFX presale is not just about securing discounted tokens—it’s about positioning early in a system that’s designed to reward users for both holding and trading. Lowest Token Price Before Launch Buying during the presale secures a significant discount compared to the public launch price. Metal and Gold BFX Visa Cards Presale buyers gain access to exclusive BFX Visa cards with up to $100,000 per transaction and $10,000 in monthly ATM withdrawals. Trading Credits Up to $25,000 in free trading credits are available to kickstart a user’s experience on the BlockchainFX platform. Staking Rewards from Day One BFX holders can immediately begin earning rewards in USDT and BFX, with earnings scaling based on holdings and platform trading volume. LIMITED TIME BONUS CODE A limited-time promo code, BFX30 , allows presale buyers to receive 30% more tokens . This incentive is only available during the current presale stage and may be removed without notice. The combination of discounted pricing, passive income, and exclusive access has already led many investors to view BFX as one of the best crypto presales to buy now . Polygon (MATIC): A Reliable Long-Term Bet Polygon has established itself as a leading Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, addressing one of the network’s most pressing issues—scalability. By enabling faster and cheaper transactions without compromising security, Polygon has become a go-to solution for developers building DeFi platforms, gaming ecosystems, and enterprise blockchain applications. With major partnerships under its belt—including integrations with Stripe, Nike, and Reddit—Polygon has gained serious traction both in and out of the crypto world. For long-term investors, MATIC offers a relatively low-risk, infrastructure-based asset with a strong development community and consistent use cases. However, Polygon’s early growth phase is behind it. With a current market capitalization in the billions, its price potential is likely to be more incremental than explosive. Arbitrum (ARB): Institutional Scaling for Ethereum Another Ethereum Layer 2 network worth mentioning is Arbitrum. Developed by Offchain Labs, Arbitrum uses optimistic rollups to dramatically reduce transaction costs and congestion on Ethereum. Its approach has proven effective, making it one of the most widely adopted L2 chains by developers, dApps, and institutions. Arbitrum has seen significant user and TVL (Total Value Locked) growth, with over $2.5 billion in value locked as of early 2025. It has become the preferred scaling solution for many DeFi applications, including GMX and Radiant Capital, and has continued to build strong integrations across the Web3 ecosystem. Despite its strong fundamentals, Arbitrum faces competition from other L2 platforms such as Optimism, Base, and zkSync. While it remains a smart inclusion in a diversified long-term crypto portfolio, Arbitrum does not currently offer the same presale-stage upside or reward mechanisms that make BFX such a compelling buy today. Is BlockchainFX The Smartest Crypto To Buy for 2025? While Polygon and Arbitrum represent solid long-term infrastructure plays, neither offers the combination of timing, reward mechanics, and all-in-one utility that BlockchainFX brings to the table. BFX is the only token in this conversation offering a chance at 1000x potential, passive income from platform usage, and lifetime benefits through exclusive features like BFX Visa cards and daily staking rewards. It’s rare to see a presale with this level of maturity, community feedback, and roadmap momentum. The crypto market may never offer another Binance-level opportunity. But if it does, it might look a lot like BlockchainFX.

The total worth of Méliuz’s Bitcoin stash is above $33 million, and the world’s largest crypto is trading at $104,012 at press time, per CoinMarketCap data. Méliuz Plans to Buy Bitcoin in an ‘Accretive Way’ In a separate press release , the company said that it first made a Bitcoin purchase in March this year. Additionally, Méliuz plans to “accumulate Bitcoin in an accretive way for shareholders.” “Rather than just allocating part of its cash to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation, the Company has repositioned its purpose to act by maximizing the amount of Bitcoin per share.” The company also recently joined Bitcoin For Corporations as an executive member. “They’ve started integrating Bitcoin into their treasury, positioning themselves for long-term value in a rapidly evolving financial world,” wrote Bitcoin For Corporations, on Wednesday.

Formerly MicroStrategy , the Saylor-led investment giant currently owns 568,840 BTC, valued at around $59 billion. Saylor and his firm have been inspiring several companies and tech firms in the Bitcoin accumulation race. Strategy analyst Jeff Walton said that the company holds “ more of the best asset ,” appreciating its unprecedented exposure to Bitcoin. Over 70 companies have so far adopted some form of BTC treasury. Last month, crypto payments firm Strike founder Jack Mallers announced a new venture, Twenty One , backed by Tether and SoftBank Group. The company is expected to hold over 42,000 Bitcoin at launch, making it the third-largest BTC treasury, after Strategy and Mara Holdings. Metaplanet, often referred to as Asia’s Strategy, has also been in the pursuit of a similar Bitcoin accumulation model. The company bought 1,241 BTC this week for $126 million, adding its total stash to 6,796 BTC valued at over $706 million. The firm aims to grow its holdings to 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, following Saylor’s footsteps.

Starknet said in a press release shared with Cointelegraph that it has hit “Stage 1” decentralization, according to a framework Buterin laid out in 2022, which means the network operates with limited oversight or “training wheels.” Starknet added that the framework was the “gold standard onchain tool for analyzing Ethereum scaling solutions,” and said it achieved the milestone through changes such as creating a security council and censorship-avoidance mechanisms. While the system still allows intervention from a security council, it has implemented a fully functional validity proof system governed by smart contracts. Starknet is now the only layer-2 ZK-rollup network to have reached Stage 1 and has grown to be the largest ZK-rollup blockchain with a total value locked of $629 million, just ahead of ZKsync’s $610 million, according to L2beat. Starknet is the fifth-largest layer-2 network by value locked, with the top four all Optimistic rollup-based and all reached Stage 1 decentralization using fraud proofs. Layer-2 networks ranked by total value locked. Source: L2beat Fraud proofs assume transactions are invalid until proven valid, while validity proofs assume transactions are valid only if proven valid with cryptographic evidence. “Our goal is for the training wheels to come off completely and to reach Stage 2 decentralization on Ethereum, and simultaneously steam forward with our work on Bitcoin too,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, co-founder and CEO of StarkWare, the developer behind Starknet . “Stage 2” decentralization is the point where the network will be fully autonomous and community-governed. Only three small layer-2 scaling platforms have reached this stage, according to L2beat. Related: Vitalik Buterin says rollups must prove security before decentralizing Buterin introduced the concept of “training wheels” or three stages for Ethereum scaling rollup projects at various phases of development in 2022. Base leads layer-2 ecosystem The Coinbase layer-2 network Base is the leader of the sector in terms of value locked, with $14.7 billion, giving it a market share of 33%. Comparatively, Starknet has a market share of 1.4%. The total value secured onchain in the layer-2 ecosystem is $44.2 billion. The figure has jumped recently as the value of Ether ( ETH ) has gained, but is down 20% so far this year.

Meanwhile, investors now await key economic data due next week, including retail sales, unemployment rate, and updates to the loan prime rate, which could provide further insight into the health of the world’s second-largest economy. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.57% to 23,241 on Friday, posting a second straight session of losses amid declines across all sectors. Alibaba Group Hlds. tumbled 4.9% after reporting disappointing quarterly revenue . India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.32% to 82,320 in morning trade on Friday, halting gains from the previous day. On the domestic front, India's trade deficit widened to its largest gap since November 2024, driven by a surge in imports. India's Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal stated that the proposed trade agreement negotiations with the US are proceeding ""very"" well. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal will lead an Indian delegation to Washington from May 17-20 for the next round of talks. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.47% to above 8,380 on Friday, marking its eighth straight session of gains and reaching its highest level in nearly three months. The Australian dollar stabilized above $0.64 on Friday, following a volatile week, as investors looked ahead to next week’s Reserve Bank of Australia policy decision. In the U.S., on Thursday, all three major indexes ended mixed as investors weighed earnings, economic data, and lingering trade uncertainty. U.S. stock futures were flat on Friday, following a fourth consecutive gain for the S&P 500 as optimism over the US-China trade deal and easing inflation pressures continued to support market sentiment: Dow -0.04% ; S&P 500 -0.03% ; Nasdaq -0.07% .

User activity dropped 10% over April, with blockchain gaming reaching a 2025 low of 4.8 million daily Unique Active Wallets , DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in the platform’s April Games Report. Gaming dominance over the decentralized app industry also fell and is now tied with decentralized finance at 21%. Gherghelas said it’s clear user attention is shifting away from gaming, but under the surface, new infrastructure went live, major publishers doubled down, and high-quality games edged closer to launch. Source: DappRadar “The blockchain gaming industry isn’t dead — it’s evolving. It’s moving from noise to signal,” she said. “Teams are building, and capital continues to flow into the space. What we might be seeing is a healthier ecosystem — one driven less by speculative play-to-earn mechanics and more by users who have a genuine interest in gameplay, asset ownership and community.” April’s blockchain gaming investment activity also dropped 69% from March, reaching $21 million. Weaker projects die off, funds shift to builders Gherghelas said part of the drop is because investor and user interest is increasingly shifting toward real-world assets and artificial intelligence . Another factor is the macroeconomic landscape, with ongoing market uncertainty weighing on investor sentiment, making capital harder to secure for startups. Gherghelas said weaker projects “are falling away,” and funds are flowing into other projects that “are quietly laying the groundwork for the next generation of blockchain games.” Blockchain gaming funding has seen a sharp drop since last year. Source: DappRadar “Investors are now optimizing for sustainable models, player engagement, and actual retention, not just token hype,” she added. “This shows that the market’s clearly in reset mode.” Gherghelas noted that “66% of all blockchain game funding in 2025 so far has gone to infrastructure,” signaling a more mature market. Related: Crypto gaming has mixed Q1 as deals jump, investment totals dip: DappRadar Mainstream gaming companies are also still experimenting with blockchain-powered games, with Gherghelas pointing to Ubisoft's partnership with Immutable, and Sega adding non-fungible tokens and play-to-earn mechanics to its game, KAI: Battle of Three Kingdoms. “April 2025 wasn’t a record-breaking month for blockchain gaming, and that’s okay.

The increased selling pressure over the past five days showed that the memecoin could retrace further. Brett [BRETT] saw a 10% drawdown in the previous 24 hours of trading. According to CoinMarketCap , its trading volume has fallen by 37%. The Bitcoin [BTC] rally has slowed down over the past five days, with the king of crypto forming a short-term range . A deeper dip for BTC could force alts to shed some of their gains. While BRETT showed strong demand in recent weeks, its chances of a drop toward $0.063 or lower were appreciable. BRETT bulls defend the dynamic support at $0.0675 Source: BRETT/USDT on TradingView On the 1-day timeframe, BRETT has a strongly bullish bias. It broke the $0.051 level and flipped it to support, and rallied 81% from this level in three days. Over the past five days, a 23% drawdown has occurred. However, the Bollinger Bands showed that the recent correction came after the price burst past the upper band. At press time, BRETT was back at the 20-day moving average. If this dynamic support could be defended, a move beyond the $0.082 would be more likely. The A/D indicator has trended higher over the past three weeks, reflecting increased buying pressure. This has driven the memecoin’s rally, after its consolidation phase from February to April. Source: BRETT/USDT on TradingView On the 4-hour chart, a set of Fibonacci retracement levels was plotted based on the rally from $0.045 to $0.092. The 50% retracement level at $0.0688 was being tested as support at press time. The Awesome Oscillator showed that the momentum had flipped bearishly. With its histogram bars printing red, it underlined the downward impulse of the past couple of days. The A/D indicator, which had been trending upward on the daily timeframe, showed a sizeable dip on the 4-hour chart. It was back at the previous week’s lows. This suggested that BRETT might see a deeper retracement. In that case, the $0.0633 and $0.056 levels were the next support levels to watch out for.

The company also said that the fees associated with the share class on Avalanche are notably lower than some of the other blockchains on which the Fund is offered. Ava Labs noted that BUIDL’s expansion to its ecosystem follows other institutional initiatives, including Kinexsys by J.P. Morgan and Citi, and asset managers, such as Wellington, KKR, and Franklin Templeton, that have incorporated Avalanche into their digital asset strategies. The firm also said that its EVM compatibility, sub-second transaction finality, low fees, and customizability make it a compelling choice for institutional deployments.

Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), and Ethereum (ETH) are all hovering at pivotal technical levels, with bullish sentiment beginning to return. As Bitcoin stabilizes, these leading smart contract platforms are becoming the primary focus of renewed capital rotation. Investors are watching closely to see whether they will ignite the next breakout phase as May enters its final stretch. Cardano (ADA) is once again testing the psychologically important $1 resistance. Should it break, analysts see upside potential toward $3 this summer. Avalanche (AVAX) , trading in the low $20s , is also flashing strength and could revisit the $40–$50 zone if network activity and token model upgrades continue to progress. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) , the largest altcoin by market cap, is currently trading near $2,400 and appears poised to reclaim the $2,500 level and perhaps even move back toward its all-time highs later this year. MAGACOINFINANCE Quietly Joins the Conversation as Altcoin Momentum Builds While ADA, AVAX, and ETH command attention, a quieter name is starting to get traction: MAGACOINFINANCE . Unlike tokens that chase headlines or lean on hype cycles, MAGACOINFINANCE has adopted a more methodical path—focusing on community, token fundamentals, and platform evolution. Over the past few weeks, it has increasingly appeared on traders’ radars across Discord and Telegram, particularly among those rotating out of larger caps in search of higher potential ROI plays. While many altcoins have already moved, MAGACOINFINANCE is still in the early accumulation phase—making it an interesting candidate for traders aiming to catch the next trend before wider adoption. STAGE ALMOST FULL — ACT NOW ADA, AVAX, and ETH: Charting the Path Into May’s Final Rally Each of the three major altcoins is flashing technical and narrative support for a strong finish to May: Cardano (ADA) is pushing toward its long-contested $1 zone. With scaling solutions like Hydra and Mithril gaining attention, and developer activity holding steady, market watchers believe a decisive breakout could send ADA soaring toward $3 . Avalanche (AVAX) is forming a higher-low structure between $18 and $23 , a setup often seen before stronger upside moves. With institutional use cases and subnet expansion in both finance and gaming, projections for a late-2025 target of $40–$50 remain intact. Ethereum (ETH) continues to anchor the market. With its price holding firmly above $2,000 , analysts now expect a surge past $2,500 . Long-term projections range from $4,000 to $5,500 —driven by scale improvements, staking incentives, and macro shifts favoring digital assets. CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST MAGACOINFINANCE Gains Momentum While Staying Under the Radar Despite the attention on large caps, MAGACOINFINANCE is making quiet but deliberate progress. Wallet activity is trending higher, and traders have noted its resilience during broader altcoin volatility. Liquidity remains limited, but the project has steadily avoided the pump-and-dump volatility that often plagues early-stage tokens. Recent developments include: A 17% uptick in active DEX wallet addresses over 10 days Increased chatter about future cross-chain liquidity solutions A carefully structured token model praised in community polls What sets MAGACOINFINANCE apart is its grassroots momentum. Without influencer promotion or media campaigns, it is building through updates, functionality, and community support—a strategy reminiscent of early MATIC and LINK growth patterns. Conclusion: Can MAGACOINFINANCE Surge With the Majors? ADA, AVAX, and ETH all appear positioned to lead the next leg of the altcoin rally, driven by strong fundamentals and favorable sentiment. If ADA breaks above $1 , AVAX reclaims the $40 range, and ETH surges past $2,500 , the broader market could follow. In this setting, MAGACOINFINANCE may stand to benefit from capital rotation—especially from investors looking beyond high-cap plays. While it lacks explosive media attention, its steady buildup and unique community focus could place it on a breakout path as the second half of May unfolds.

PI NETWORK: The Truth They DON’T Want You to Know! Don't take this the wrong way. Just read on.. Pi Network’s got some serious secrets, and we’re spilling ALL the tea. Could this be the next crypto crash waiting to happen? Let’s dive in! The Numbers Don’t Lie: 89… pic.twitter.com/6catrQyvbo — Szymanski (@Szymansk_ii) May 15, 2025 89% of Pi Coins Held by the Core Team: A Ticking Time Bomb? Szymanski reveals a shocking statistic: out of the 100 billion Pi tokens that will ever exist, 89 billion are still in the hands of the Pi Core Team . With only 7.1 billion currently in circulation and a total supply of 11 billion, this means a staggering 89% of the supply is controlled by a single entity . That level of centralization raises serious red flags. If the team were to offload a large portion of their holdings—intentionally or due to internal conflict—the price of Pi could crash overnight , similar to the historic Terra Luna meltdown. Szymanski warned that if the Pi team suddenly sold off their massive holdings, it could send the price crashing—just like what happened with Terra Luna. He also pointed out that with so much power in one place, even a hack or one bad actor could wreck the entire project. No Mining, No Audits, No Major Listings Szymanski didn’t stop there. He highlighted multiple structural flaws: Pre-Minted Supply : Unlike Bitcoin , all Pi tokens are pre-minted and stored in a centralized wallet. No Audits : The project has never been independently audited, fueling mistrust. Exchange Snub : Major platforms like Binance and Coinbase have steered clear of listing Pi due to its opaque and centralized setup. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network News: Can Pi Coin Hit $2.50 in Coming Months? , Can Pi Network Still Recover? Despite the criticism, Szymanski offers a potential way forward. He suggests that Pi Network could still redeem itself by publishing a transparent roadmap , opening up to third-party audits , and proving its legitimacy. Until then, he warns investors to “DYOR” (Do Your Own Research) and approach Pi with caution, labeling it one of the riskiest bets in crypto today . Is Pi Network Collapse Waiting to Happen? With billions of tokens under tight control, no public audits, and limited exchange support, Pi Network stands at a crossroads .

In a statement issued on May 15, the cashback-focused firm, which serves over 30 million users, said it had officially changed its corporate purpose to include Bitcoin investments as part of its business strategy. The move was greenlit by a wide majority at an extraordinary general meeting earlier in the day. As part of the shift, Méliuz acquired 274.52 Bitcoin for approximately $28.4 million at an average price of $103,604. The latest haul builds on its first Bitcoin purchase of 45.73 BTC in March this year, bringing the firm’s total holdings to 320.25 BTC, valued at over $33 million based on current prices. “A Bitcoin Treasury Company’s main mission is to accumulate Bitcoin in an accretive way for shareholders, using its cash generation and corporate and capital market structures to increase exposure to the asset over time,” Méliuz wrote. Instead of treating Bitcoin as a mere hedge, Méliuz has repositioned its mission to maximise “the amount of Bitcoin per share,” aligning its capital strategy around long-term BTC exposure. Calling it a “historic day,” Méliuz executive chairman Israel Salmen sai d the firm had officially become the “first Bitcoin Treasury Company listed in Brazil.” He added that the firm’s BTC holdings now carry a yield of 600% when factoring in its March 6 purchase .

Méliuz has joined a growing list of public companies around the world pivoting to Bitcoin-centric balance sheets, many following in the footsteps of Michael Saylor-led Strategy , which pioneered the treasury strategy in 2020. Earlier this week, Bahrain’s Al Abraaj Group became the first listed company in the Middle East to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset. It kicked off with a modest 5 BTC purchase and says more is coming as part of a long-term shift backed by 10X Capital. According to Al Abraaj, the initiative is part of a “forward-looking approach” to unlock Bitcoin exposure for regional investors. In the U.S., David Bailey’s Bitcoin-native holding company, Nakamoto, recently went public via a merger with KindlyMD, raising $710 million to launch what he described as a “Bitcoin conglomerate.” Read more: Brazil jails crypto scheme operators to a combined 171 years",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|ZRX,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-05-16 06:18:31

BRETT, or Based Brett, is a meme cryptocurrency launched in February 2024 on the Base blockchain, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. Inspired by the character Brett from Matt Furie’s “Boys’ Club” comic series, BRETT aims to engage users through humor and community interaction. It has quickly gained popularity, boasting a market cap exceeding $1 billion and a total supply of 10 billion tokens, with a fixed supply ensuring scarcity. BRETT operates on a renounced contract, meaning the creator cannot alter its supply or functionalities, which fosters a decentralized governance model driven by community engagement. The token does not impose transaction fees, making it attractive for trading and long-term holding. Its cultural significance and partnerships in decentralized finance enhance its utility and value in the crypto space.

The price has retreated from the upper Bollinger Band and is stabilizing above the middle band, which often acts as dynamic support. The RSI reading around 56.81 indicates a neutral-to-bullish momentum, suggesting that the token still holds strength but may be pausing for consolidation. If support around $0.067 holds, a potential rebound toward $0.089 or higher is feasible. However, a breakdown below this level could lead to a retest of $0.045. Market participants should monitor volume for confirmation. BRETT/USD 4-hour chart BRETT/USD 4-hour price chart, Source: TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart of BRETT/USDT on May 16, the asset is currently in a short-term corrective phase following a strong upward move. The price is consolidating below the upper Bollinger Band, indicating decreased bullish momentum. The MACD histogram is contracting, and both the MACD and signal lines are approaching convergence, hinting at potential further sideways movement or a bearish crossover. Additionally, the Balance of Power indicator has turned negative, reflecting waning buyer dominance. If the price fails to hold above $0.075, it may revisit support near $0.066. However, a breakout above $0.085 could revive bullish sentiment and initiate a fresh rally.

Based on both the 4-hour and 1-day charts, Brett (BRETT/USDT) exhibits signs of consolidation after a recent upward push. On the daily chart, prices are pulling back from upper Bollinger Band resistance near $0.089, with RSI retreating from overbought levels around 61, indicating a cooling bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the 4-hour chart reflects bearish divergence, with the MACD lines converging toward a potential bearish crossover and Balance of Power slipping into negative territory. Short-term support lies near $0.066, while resistance remains at $0.085. A decisive move above resistance could trigger renewed bullish momentum, though a deeper correction remains possible if support fails. Is BRETT a good investment? BRETT cryptocurrency, a meme coin on the Base blockchain, has gained popularity due to its community-driven nature and fixed supply, which enhances scarcity. While it shows growth potential, especially with integrations in DeFi, its value is highly speculative and influenced by market trends. Investors are strongly advised to exercise caution and conduct their research. Will BRETT reach $1? Based on the analysis’s critical prediction, it is unlikely to reach this milestone before 2030. Will BRETT reach $5? BRETT’s near-term goal of reaching $5 seems unlikely. Current predictions suggest it may peak at around $1 by 2030, influenced by crypto market trends and community support. Is Brett listed on Binance? Brett Coin (BRETT) is currently not listed on Binance for trading. Although it remains available on other exchanges like Bybit, Gate.io , and KuCoin Does BRETT have a good long-term future? BRETT is projected to reach between $0.70 by 2027 and $0.2 by 2030, depending on market conditions and the adoption of the Base network. Its growth is expected to be influenced by cryptocurrency market trends and regulatory developments.

You’re not alone. The world of digital assets is known for its dramatic swings, and the past few weeks have certainly delivered on that front. From exhilarating surges to sharp pullbacks, understanding what drives this crypto volatility is crucial for anyone involved. Understanding the Recent Cryptocurrency Market Swings The cryptocurrency market is a complex ecosystem influenced by a multitude of factors. Unlike traditional markets, it operates 24/7 and is highly sensitive to global news, regulatory developments, and even social media sentiment. Recently, we’ve seen significant price movements across the board, impacting major players like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Several key elements contribute to this inherent volatility: Market Sentiment: News, rumors, and social media trends can cause rapid shifts in investor confidence. Positive news can trigger FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), while negative news can lead to panic selling. Regulatory Uncertainty: Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate digital assets. Announcements about potential bans, taxes, or new frameworks can significantly impact prices. Macroeconomic Factors: Inflation rates, interest rate decisions by central banks, and global economic stability can influence investor appetite for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Technological Developments: Upgrades to blockchain networks (like Ethereum’s merge) or new innovations can drive interest and investment, while technical issues or security breaches can cause price drops. Liquidity: While the market is growing, some smaller digital assets can still have lower liquidity, making them more susceptible to large price swings from relatively smaller trades. Let’s take a closer look at how these factors have recently affected the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. Analyzing the Latest Bitcoin Price Movements Bitcoin, often seen as the bellwether for the entire market, has experienced considerable price action. After reaching significant highs, we’ve seen corrections that have tested the resolve of even seasoned investors. What’s driving the Bitcoin price ? Recent drivers include: Institutional Adoption: Continued interest from large financial institutions and corporations buying Bitcoin for their balance sheets provides significant buying pressure. Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s programmed supply reduction event (the halving) historically precedes bull runs, and anticipation builds as the next one approaches. Global Events: Geopolitical events or changes in global financial markets can lead investors to seek alternative stores of value, sometimes benefiting Bitcoin. However, the Bitcoin price is also susceptible to sell-offs triggered by profit-taking, negative news headlines, or broader market downturns. Keeping an eye on key support and resistance levels on price charts is a common strategy for traders trying to navigate these movements. A recent chart illustrating Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. What’s Happening with Ethereum News and Developments? Ethereum, the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and countless other applications, also commands significant attention. Ethereum news and updates are crucial indicators for the health of the broader crypto ecosystem. Key factors influencing Ethereum recently: Network Upgrades: Post-merge developments and future planned upgrades aimed at improving scalability and efficiency are major drivers of positive sentiment and investment. DeFi and NFT Activity: The health and growth of decentralized applications and the non-fungible token market built on Ethereum directly impact demand for its native coin, Ether (ETH). Competition: The rise of competing Layer 1 blockchains offering faster or cheaper transactions can pose challenges and influence Ethereum’s market position. Monitoring Ethereum news related to network usage, gas fees, and development milestones provides valuable insights into its potential trajectory. The ecosystem’s continued innovation remains a strong bullish factor, but it is not immune to the overall market sentiment and external pressures. Navigating Crypto Volatility: Tips for Investors Given the inherent crypto volatility , how can investors approach this market? It’s essential to have a strategy and manage risk effectively. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand the technology, the team behind a project, its use case, and market cap before investing. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your funds into a single digital asset. Spread your investments across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes. Invest for the Long Term: The crypto market is volatile in the short term, but many believe in its long-term potential. Consider a long-term holding strategy rather than trying to time the market. Use Stop-Loss Orders: For traders, setting stop-loss orders can help limit potential losses during sharp downturns. Only Invest What You Can Afford to Lose: This is perhaps the most crucial rule. The high-risk nature of crypto means you should never invest funds essential for your living expenses. Stay Informed: Follow reliable sources for cryptocurrency market news and analysis. Understanding the factors at play helps in making informed decisions. Understanding the risks and rewards associated with digital assets is paramount. While the potential for high returns exists, so does the risk of significant losses. The Future of Digital Assets: Trends to Watch Despite the current crypto volatility , the underlying technology and the ecosystem continue to evolve rapidly. What trends should we be watching in the world of digital assets ? Emerging trends include: Trend Description Potential Impact on Market DeFi 2.0 Evolution of decentralized finance protocols, focusing on sustainability and capital efficiency. Could drive demand for underlying blockchain assets like ETH. Regulatory Clarity Increased clear regulations from governments worldwide. Could attract more institutional investors but also impose limitations. CBDCs Development of Central Bank Digital Currencies. Could impact the role of decentralized cryptocurrencies, potentially driving innovation or creating competition. Institutional Adoption More large firms integrating crypto into services or balance sheets. Significant potential for increased market cap and stability. Web3 Gaming & Metaverse Integration of NFTs and crypto economies into gaming and virtual worlds. Could onboard millions of new users to the digital asset space. These trends suggest a future where digital assets become increasingly integrated into the global economy, potentially leading to wider adoption and new use cases. However, the path forward will likely still involve periods of significant crypto volatility as the market matures. Conclusion: Navigating the Exciting but Challenging Crypto Landscape The cryptocurrency market remains an exciting frontier, full of innovation and opportunity, but also significant risk. Understanding the factors that influence the Bitcoin price , keeping up with Ethereum news , and recognizing the nature of crypto volatility are essential steps for anyone looking to participate. Investing in digital assets requires patience, research, and a strong risk management strategy. While the recent swings might be unsettling, they are a reminder of the dynamic nature of this nascent market. By staying informed and approaching it with a clear plan, you can better navigate the challenges and potentially capitalize on the opportunities it presents.

This article explores whether the bullish momentum has more room to run and some of the best altcoins to buy if it does. Why the crypto bull run is here to stay There are a few reasons why the crypto market bull run has more upside to go this year. The main one, however, is the fact that Bitcoin has formed bullish patterns that may lead to more gains in the coming months. The chart below shows that Bitcoin price has formed a cup-and-handle pattern, a popular bullish continuation sign. It has also formed a bullish pennant, comprising of a vertical line and a symmetrical triangle. The cup has a depth of about 30%. As such, measuring the same distance from the upper side brings the price target to $142,080. Such a move would likely trigger more gains among altcoins. BTC price chart | Source: TradingView Top altcoins to buy and hold Some of the best altcoins to buy and hold in the next crypto bull run are Chainlink (LINK), Solana (SOL), Pepe Coin (PEPE), and Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL). Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink is one of the best altcoins to buy because of its strong fundamentals. It is the biggest oracle network in the crypto industry, securing assets worth over $40 billion across multiple chains like Ethereum and Tron. Chainlink also runs the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which has become pivotal in the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization industry. Just this week, it took part in a trial for a RWA transaction between JPMorgan and Ondo Finance. Chainlink partners with some of the biggest companies globally, including ANZ, UBS, and Swift. These partnerships will help it become a major infrastructure provider in the RWA industry.

It has become the most active layer-1 network in the crypto industry in terms of transactions and number of active accounts. For example, its network processed over 1.75 billion transactions in the last 30 days. It also has over $101.7 million active addresses. Solana has become a powerhouse in the decentralized exchange (DEX) industry, where its protocols have handled assets worth billions of dollars in the last seven days. On top of this, there are hopes that the SEC will approve spot Solana ETFs , which will lead to more inflows from Wall Street investors. Pepe Coin (PEPE) Meme coins will likely do well in the coming crypto bull run because of their popularity and low prices. Historically, meme coins often do better than other mainstream cryptocurrencies when there is a bull run. Pepe is one of the best meme coins to buy when this happens. It has been around for years, and has survived several booms and busts. It has also become highly popular among traders and investors For example, it had a 24-hour volume of $1.7 billion, higher than that of Shiba Inu, Official Trump, and Bonk, combined. Read more: Top crypto price predictions: Pepe Coin, Shiba Inu, Cardano Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) Virtuals Protocol is another coin to buy because it is at the intersection of the artificial intelligence boom and meme coins. It is a blockchain network that makes it possible for developers to launch AI agents. AI agents in its network, like GAME, Luna, Ribbita, and VaderAI have become multi-million-dollar asset, and their growth is expected to continue.

On Thursday, Windsurf, a prominent player in developing AI models tailored for software engineers, made a significant announcement: the debut of its first family of in-house AI models, collectively known as SWE-1. What are Windsurf’s New SWE-1 AI Models? Windsurf introduced a family of three models: SWE-1, SWE-1-lite, and SWE-1-mini. Unlike many existing models primarily focused on code generation, Windsurf states these new models are specifically trained and optimized for the ‘entire software engineering process’. This broader scope includes not just writing code but also tasks like debugging, testing, and understanding project context across various development environments. This launch is particularly interesting given recent reports suggesting OpenAI was nearing a significant acquisition deal for Windsurf. However, introducing proprietary models indicates Windsurf’s ambition extends beyond merely building applications on top of existing AI. They appear set on developing the foundational AI technology themselves. How Do the SWE-1 Models Perform? According to Windsurf’s internal benchmarks, the largest model, SWE-1, demonstrates competitive performance against established models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, and Gemini 2.5 Pro on programming tasks. However, Windsurf acknowledges that SWE-1 currently trails frontier models, such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet, on complex software engineering challenges. The SWE-1 family offers tiered access: SWE-1-lite & SWE-1-mini: Available to all users on the Windsurf platform (free and paid tiers). SWE-1: Reserved exclusively for paid users. Pricing details for the paid tiers were not immediately disclosed, but Windsurf claims its SWE-1 model is more cost-effective to run compared to Claude 3.5 Sonnet. From Vibe Coding to In-House AI Windsurf gained popularity for its tools that enable ‘ vibe coding ‘, a practice where software engineers use AI chatbots to interactively write and refine code. This approach relies heavily on the AI’s ability to understand conversational commands and context. Traditionally, Windsurf, like many other vibe coding startups such as Cursor and Lovable, has powered its applications using AI models from major providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. The move to develop their own AI models represents a strategic shift. Nicholas Moy, Windsurf’s Head of Research, highlighted this in an announcement video. He stated that while current frontier models excel at coding, they fall short of addressing the full spectrum of software engineering activities. Moy emphasized, “Coding is not software engineering.” He pointed out that programmers constantly switch between terminals, IDEs, and web browsers – environments where existing models often struggle to operate seamlessly. Windsurf’s blog post elaborated that SWE-1 was trained using a new data model and a unique ‘training recipe’ designed to handle ‘incomplete states, long-running tasks, and multiple surfaces’. What’s Next for Windsurf? Windsurf describes SWE-1 as its ‘initial proof of concept’. This suggests that the company plans to continue developing and releasing more advanced AI models in the future. By building its own AI foundation, Windsurf aims to create tools that are more deeply integrated and specifically optimized for the complex workflows of professional software engineers, potentially setting a new standard in the field of AI-assisted development. The launch of the SWE-1 family marks a significant step for Windsurf, positioning the AI startup as not just a builder of applications but also a developer of core AI technology. This could have implications for the broader landscape of developer tools and how AI assists in the intricate process of creating software.

Tether AI is an open-source, decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) platform launched by Tether, the company behind the Tether USDt ( USDT ) stablecoin. Unlike traditional AI services that depend on centralized servers and require application programming interface (API) keys, Tether AI runs on a distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) network , offering enhanced privacy , autonomy and resilience. Designed to be modular and composable, Tether AI can operate on any hardware, whether mobile, desktop or edge devices, without centralized control or a single point of failure. A core innovation of Tether AI is its integration with cryptocurrency infrastructure. It natively supports Bitcoin ( BTC ) and USDt payments using Tether’s Wallet Development Kit (WDK), enabling seamless onchain transactions. This makes Tether AI one of the first AI platforms to offer direct crypto payment functionality at the protocol level. According to Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether AI, it is a “fully open-source AI runtime, capable of adapting and evolving on any hardware and device, no API keys, no central point of failure, fully modular and composable, WDK-infused to enable USDT and Bitcoin payments.” Ardoino said Tether AI's primary objective is to create the “ideal technological foundation” for realizing the AI vision of Isaac Asimov, the celebrated science fiction author behind I, Robot and The Robot Series. In a separate post on X (written in Italian), Ardoino further asserted, “AI will, in the coming decades, become part of the very fabric of the universe.” How Tether AI personalizes infinite intelligence Tether AI is built around the AI runtime structure of “personal infinite intelligence,” which envisions customizable AI agents tailored to individual user needs and device capabilities. Developers can leverage Tether’s open-source WDK, launched in November 2024, to create mobile, desktop and web wallets with complete self-custodial control. The platform enables native payments in USDt and Bitcoin to be processed directly over a peer-to-peer network, eliminating reliance on centralized payment processors. It emphasizes user ownership, ensuring individuals control their assets without intermediaries. This decentralization-first model supports Tether’s mission of making AI accessible and censorship-resistant. Ardoino has been critical of the AI industry’s dependence on centralized APIs and cloud platforms; Tether AI aligns with this mission. The project will facilitate integrating native USDt and Bitcoin payments into autonomous systems and software agents. The objective is to create a decentralized, censorship-resistant foundation for AI tools. Did you know? Tether AI CEO Paolo Ardoino favors locally executable AI models that can run directly on the user’s device, be it a smartphone or laptop, eliminating the need for third-party servers. This ensures that data stays local and allows for offline use. How Tether AI brings decentralized intelligence to Keet and Pear Tether AI is expected to integrate with Tether’s existing peer-to-peer ecosystem, including Keet, a decentralized messaging app, and Pear, a framework for building P2P applications. Initially unveiled in December 2024, the platform is slated for launch in 2025, marking Tether’s strategic entry into decentralized AI with embedded crypto functionality. This initiative is part of a broader corporate shift announced in April 2024, which had Tether restructuring its operations to create dedicated units for AI and peer-to-peer technologies, such as Tether Data. Tether is actively developing Tether AI and a suite of AI-powered applications. These include a real-time AI translation tool for international communication, a voice assistant for hands-free platform and application control, and a Bitcoin wallet assistant to streamline transaction management. Tether, under Ardoino, views AI as a cornerstone of technological advancement. Tether’s AI expansion follows the company reporting $1 billion in operating profit for Q1 2025, mainly from US Treasury returns. With $149.3 billion in total assets and $5.6 billion in excess reserves, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin sector . Its move into AI underscores a commitment to innovation, positioning the firm at the forefront of crypto and next-generation intelligent technologies Did you know? Decentralized intelligence allows AI models to run across a network of devices instead of a single centralized server. This approach reduces the risk of data breaches, avoids single points of failure and gives users greater control over their data. Key features of Tether’s WDK Tether’s WDK, launched in November 2024, is an open-source framework designed to simplify the creation of self-custodial wallets across mobile, desktop and web platforms. The WDK empowers developers to build crypto wallets that support secure, peer-to-peer transactions without relying on centralized infrastructure. Key features of the WDK include: Modularity: WDK has modules that enable developers to customize wallet functionalities based on specific use cases, including payments, storage or integration with decentralized applications (DApps) . Pre-built components: WDK includes pre-built components for encryption, transaction management, key recovery and cross-platform compatibility , making it highly adaptable for beginners and advanced developers. User sovereignty: All wallets built using WDK enable full self-custody, meaning users retain exclusive control over their private keys and funds. Integration with other P2P technologies: WDK supports seamless integration with Tether's other peer-to-peer technologies, including Keet and Pear. In the context of Tether AI, WDK will play a critical role in embedding native crypto payments into decentralized AI applications, allowing automated agents and users to transact onchain with minimal friction. By bridging wallet development with AI and Web3 infrastructure , WDK advances Tether’s vision of a decentralized digital economy. Did you know? In collaborative AI development, models are trained and improved by a global community without central ownership. This open-source approach can lead to fairer, more inclusive AI systems that are free from the biases or profit motives of centralized tech giants. Implications of merging AI with blockchain are just beginning Tether AI signals a transformative shift in how AI can be developed, deployed and monetized in a decentralized ecosystem. Blending AI capabilities with blockchain infrastructure and native crypto payments has enabled Tether to create applications that are not only intelligent but also financially autonomous and resistant to centralized control. Tether AI will facilitate direct execution payments on peer-to-peer networks without any role for intermediaries. For developers, Tether AI opens up new avenues to build adaptive AI systems that run on any device, support real-time crypto payments and prioritize user sovereignty. For users, it means greater control over personal data, enhanced privacy and transparent interaction with AI services. This paradigm challenges the dominance of cloud-based AI monopolies, offering an open-source alternative that can evolve with community input. In the long term, Tether AI could influence sectors such as decentralized finance (DeFi) , content moderation, Web3 gaming and autonomous economic agents. It positions AI not as a corporate product, but as a public utility — transparent, modular and composable — while integrated with crypto. By merging AI with the trustless architecture of blockchain, Tether is pioneering a new class of decentralized digital infrastructure.",Tether,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-16 07:30:00

A breakout might drive it to even $200, even $250, in the space of just 10 to 20 days, while a miss could see it slump down to $120 zone. In the meantime Mutuum Finance (MUTM) keeps on moving forward, its phase 4 presale 75% filled, with over $8,500,000 raised and 9,900 holders. This DeFi dynamo is not sitting on its haunches, providing instantaneous results and a vaunting prospect. With Solana struggling with technical obstacles, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) goes on ahead, rewriting the definition of urgency in the crypto market. Solana’s Precarious Dance Solana is almost at the turning point. It is trading close to $119 and it is in a scuffle with $120.07 resistance level. Breakout could spark a rally that would bring the prices as high as $150 and even $200 in weeks to come because of strong trading volumes and ETF speculation. However, the crypto market does not spare people. A stumble here may take Solana back to $120 support area, which was well-guarded for more than 426 days. Then if that goes, then comes $90 or less. The investors keep an eye on the development, being neither optimistic nor pessimistic. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a different tempo with the presale momentum laying its focus away from the uncertainty in Solana. Mutuum Finance’s Relentless Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is changing DeFi. With its phase 4 presale, 75% filled, tokens being sold at $0.025 with a 2.5 fold increase, from $0.01 at the opening phase. That is to say, buying tokens at the present time will give investors a 20% increase, when phase 5 starts at $0.03. Tokenomics do provide for a 140% return on investment at $0.06 listing price, but experts view the potential for increase as being much bigger, with up to $2.50 price after launch, a return on investment of 9,900%. The team is working on finalising a Certik audit for the smart contracts, results of which are to be announced in social channels shortly, building trust. This defined rising in comparison with the volatility of Solana attracts investors looking for shrewd increase. Innovative Lending Fuels Demand One of the things that make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to shine is utility. It has a peer to contract and peer to peer lending arrangement whereby the users can lend their such assets such as ETH or DAI, for passive income in the form of mtTokens that accrue interests with time. On the other hand, borrowers on their part get loans by way of overcollateralization hence stability. The money realized from buy-and-distribute system in the platform will be used to purchase the tokens at a lower price and bribe the stakers in addition to the security that is required for the tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) just recently was able to launch dashboard which exhibits top 50 holders and they receive bonus for being in top50, therefore they are loyal. At the amount of $8,300,000 that has been raised with 9,900 holders in phase 4 shows what an insane demand could force the investors to buy in before the prices go up. No Time to Hesitate Solana’s $200 dream hangs on killing resistance, with this gambling conditioned to the fancy of market and prospects of ETF. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is however, apparent. Its phase 4 presale at $0.025 is a quick way of caulking profits before the 20% rise to $0.03 of its phase 5. The 140% return on listing is nothing more than the first step, and $2.50 is a target that provides strong growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the ray of opportunity against such choppy waters.

SOL is testing the $180 supply zone, with a breakout potentially pushing it toward the $200 psychological level. Solana [SOL] has started flashing bullish signals again after months of outflows. A closer look at on-chain data shows that capital is returning. According to Glassnode, SOL’s 30-day Realized Cap inflows flipped positive, now growing by 4–5%. This places SOL alongside XRP in terms of recovery strength. The return of capital inflows typically comes ahead of renewed demand and interest, which is needed for long-term price appreciation.

It indicated a Taker Buy Dominant phase for SOL, according to a closer AMBCrypto analysis of CryptoQuant’s Futures data. This metric reflects growing buyer conviction. When buy volume leads over time, it usually signals strong upside expectations from traders. In SOL’s case, the CVD uptrend paired with recovering realized cap inflows gives SOL a solid base for potential continuation in its recent uptrend. Source: CryptoQuant SOL tests $180 supply zone after month-long rally SOL tested a key supply zone around the $180 level on the daily chart at press time, following a month of steady gains. This zone has historically capped further price advances and serves as a strong resistance level. However, the recent shift in capital inflows and growing buyer dominance could invalidate this supply zone, potentially paving the way for a rally toward the $200 psychological level. Source: TradingView Rally to $200 hinges on demand strength If bulls sustain the buying pressure, SOL can negate the $180 supply zone and explode for another surge towards the $200 psychological price level.

After periods of consolidation, Bitcoin has shown significant upward momentum, capturing the attention of both seasoned investors and newcomers alike. What’s fueling this surge? Let’s dive into the key elements shaping the current landscape of the crypto market and what it might mean for your cryptocurrency investment journey. What’s Behind the Recent Bitcoin Price Movement? Understanding the dynamics of the Bitcoin price requires looking at a confluence of factors. It’s rarely just one thing. We’re seeing a mix of macroeconomic shifts, increasing institutional interest, and technological advancements playing crucial roles. These elements combine to create the current market sentiment and drive price action. Several primary drivers are contributing to the positive trend: Increased Institutional Adoption: More large financial institutions and corporations are allocating capital to Bitcoin or offering Bitcoin-related products. This inflow of significant capital provides stability and boosts confidence. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, such as inflation concerns and monetary policies, often push investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin, perceived as a store of value or hedge. Halving Event Anticipation: The upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, historically leads to increased scarcity and can put upward pressure on the price. Technological Development: Ongoing improvements in the underlying blockchain technology , including scaling solutions and increased network efficiency, make Bitcoin more viable for wider use. Retail Investor Sentiment: Positive news and price surges attract more individual investors, creating a positive feedback loop. These factors collectively paint a picture of a maturing market with growing fundamental support for higher valuations. How Does Institutional Interest Impact the Crypto Market? The involvement of institutional players is a game-changer for the crypto market . Unlike individual retail investors, institutions often invest much larger sums, bringing significant liquidity. Their participation also lends legitimacy to the asset class, making it more palatable for other large funds and traditional investors. Consider the impact of a major asset manager launching a Bitcoin-backed ETF. This provides a regulated and accessible way for millions of investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. This increased accessibility broadens the investor base significantly. Furthermore, when major companies add Bitcoin to their balance sheets, it signals confidence in its long-term value. The ripple effect of institutional adoption includes: Increased trading volume and market depth. Development of more sophisticated financial products around crypto. Greater regulatory clarity as frameworks are developed to accommodate institutional activity. Enhanced credibility for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This trend suggests that Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate component of a diversified investment portfolio. Is Now a Good Time for Cryptocurrency Investment? Deciding on the right time for cryptocurrency investment is a question many are asking amidst the current price rally. While past performance is never a guarantee of future results, the current environment presents several points to consider. The combination of positive fundamental factors, increasing adoption, and favorable market structure suggests potential for continued growth. However, it’s crucial to approach crypto investment with a clear strategy. Volatility remains a characteristic of the market. Therefore, consider these actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand the technology, market dynamics, and potential risks before investing. Start Small: You don’t need to invest a large amount initially. Begin with an amount you are comfortable losing. Diversify: Don’t put all your funds into one cryptocurrency. Explore other promising projects beyond Bitcoin. Long-Term Perspective: The crypto market can be volatile in the short term. A long-term view can help navigate price swings. Secure Your Assets: Use reputable exchanges and consider hardware wallets for larger holdings. Making informed decisions based on research and a solid understanding of your own risk tolerance is key to successful cryptocurrency investment . What Does the Latest BTC Price Prediction Tell Us? Analyzing expert opinions and technical indicators for a BTC price prediction can provide valuable perspective, but it’s essential to treat predictions with caution. The crypto market is influenced by a wide array of unpredictable global events. Currently, many analysts are bullish, pointing to the supply constraints from the halving, increasing demand from institutions, and positive macroeconomic indicators. Price targets vary widely, but a common theme is the potential for Bitcoin to reach new all-time highs in the coming year or two. Factors commonly cited in bullish predictions include: Historical patterns post-halving. Continued ETF inflows. Potential easing of interest rates by central banks. Growing global adoption of blockchain technology beyond just currency. Conversely, bearish arguments often highlight potential regulatory crackdowns, unexpected negative macroeconomic events, or large-scale market manipulation. It’s important to consider both sides and understand that predictions are not guarantees. While a positive BTC price prediction is encouraging, focus on the underlying fundamentals and your personal investment strategy rather than solely relying on price targets. How is Blockchain Technology Evolving Beyond Bitcoin? While Bitcoin is the most well-known application, the underlying blockchain technology is incredibly versatile and is evolving rapidly. It’s not just about digital currency anymore; blockchain is finding applications across numerous industries. Examples of blockchain’s expanding use cases include: Supply Chain Management: Providing transparency and traceability for goods from origin to destination. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Creating financial systems that operate without traditional intermediaries like banks. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): Representing ownership of unique digital or physical assets. Healthcare: Securely managing patient records and ensuring data integrity. Voting Systems: Potentially creating more secure and transparent election processes. This broader adoption of blockchain technology underscores its potential to reshape various sectors, adding long-term value to the entire crypto ecosystem, not just Bitcoin. The continuous innovation within blockchain technology provides a strong foundation for the future growth and utility of cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications. Conclusion: Navigating the Exciting Crypto Landscape The current surge in Bitcoin price is driven by a powerful combination of institutional adoption, favorable macroeconomic conditions, anticipated supply shocks, and the fundamental strength of blockchain technology . While the crypto market remains dynamic and subject to volatility, the increasing maturity and expanding use cases present compelling opportunities for those considering cryptocurrency investment . Understanding the factors influencing the market, staying informed about the latest BTC price prediction analysis (while maintaining a critical perspective), and adopting a disciplined investment approach are crucial for navigating this exciting landscape successfully. The journey into crypto is one of continuous learning and adaptation. To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin price action.

If so, you’re likely eager to understand the latest developments shaping the Bitcoin price prediction landscape. The crypto market is constantly buzzing with activity, and staying informed is crucial for anyone involved. Recent movements in the BTC price have captured the attention of analysts and investors alike. After a period of consolidation, we’ve seen renewed interest and speculation about where the leading cryptocurrency is headed next. But what exactly is driving this momentum, and what do the experts say? Understanding Bitcoin Price Prediction in the Current Climate Making a precise Bitcoin price prediction is notoriously difficult, given the numerous factors influencing the crypto market . These factors range from macroeconomic conditions and regulatory news to technological advancements and shifts in investor sentiment. However, by conducting thorough Bitcoin analysis , market participants can gain valuable insights into potential future price movements. Several methodologies are used for predicting Bitcoin’s price: Technical Analysis: Studying historical price charts, patterns, and indicators to forecast future trends. This includes looking at support and resistance levels, moving averages, and trading volumes. Fundamental Analysis: Evaluating the intrinsic value of Bitcoin based on factors like adoption rates, network activity, development updates, and the overall health of the crypto market ecosystem. On-Chain Analysis: Examining data directly from the Bitcoin blockchain, such as transaction counts, active addresses, miner behavior, and exchange flows, to gauge market sentiment and activity. Quantitative Models: Utilizing statistical models, like the Stock-to-Flow model popularized by PlanB, which relates scarcity to value, offering long-term perspectives on Bitcoin price prediction . Combining these approaches provides a more holistic view, though none offer guaranteed certainty in the dynamic crypto market . Latest BTC Price Movements: What the Charts Tell Us The recent action in the BTC price has been particularly interesting. We’ve observed increased volatility, typical of the crypto market , but also key technical breakouts that have analysts buzzing. For instance, a sustained break above a significant resistance level around $XX,XXX ( Note: Replace with actual price level if available in source content ) has signaled potential bullish continuation. Examining the daily chart reveals patterns that experienced traders recognize. The formation of certain candlestick patterns or the behavior of key indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) or MACD can offer clues. While the short-term BTC price might fluctuate, many analysts are focusing on the bigger picture, looking for confirmation of a sustained upward trend based on these technical signals. Expert Bitcoin Analysis: What Are the Shocking Targets? When it comes to Bitcoin analysis , the predictions can sometimes seem audacious. However, these targets are often based on specific models or long-term projections derived from fundamental and on-chain data. Many prominent analysts and institutions are releasing updated Bitcoin price prediction models following recent market shifts. Some of the more attention-grabbing targets being discussed fall into the six-figure range, even suggesting potentials significantly higher than previous all-time highs. These ‘shocking’ targets are typically predicated on several key assumptions: Continued institutional adoption, with more large firms allocating capital to Bitcoin. Increasing scarcity following halving events, reducing the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market. Growing global acceptance and use cases for Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Macroeconomic factors, such as inflation or currency devaluation, driving investors towards alternative stores of value like Bitcoin. While these high targets represent optimistic scenarios based on expert Bitcoin analysis , it’s important to remember they are predictions, not guarantees. The path to such levels is likely to be volatile, with significant pullbacks along the way, typical of the crypto market . Navigating Crypto Market Trends: Actionable Insights Understanding the broader crypto market trends is just as vital as focusing solely on Bitcoin price prediction . The performance of altcoins, the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi), the rise of NFTs, and regulatory shifts all impact the overall ecosystem and, by extension, Bitcoin itself. Here are some actionable insights to consider when navigating the current environment: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t rely solely on predictions. Understand the underlying technology and market dynamics. Diversification: While Bitcoin is dominant, explore other assets within the crypto market that align with your investment goals. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. The crypto market is volatile. Stay Informed: Keep up with news, regulatory updates, and shifts in crypto trends . Long-Term Perspective: Many successful crypto investors adopt a long-term view, weathering short-term fluctuations based on their conviction in the technology’s future. Paying attention to these broader crypto trends provides context for the Bitcoin analysis and predictions you encounter. The Challenges and Opportunities in the Crypto Market The crypto market , while offering significant opportunities, also presents unique challenges. Regulatory uncertainty remains a key concern in many jurisdictions. Market manipulation, security risks like hacks, and the inherent volatility can impact the BTC price and other assets significantly. These challenges underscore the importance of caution and informed decision-making. However, the opportunities are substantial. The potential for high returns, the chance to participate in innovative financial technology, and the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets are powerful draws. For those who conduct thorough Bitcoin analysis and understand the prevailing crypto trends , the current market phase could represent a significant opportunity. Concluding Thoughts: What’s Next for Bitcoin? The future of the BTC price remains a topic of intense debate and speculation. While expert Bitcoin price prediction models offer exciting possibilities, especially with some of the ‘shocking’ targets being discussed, the path forward will likely be complex and unpredictable. Navigating the crypto market requires diligence, continuous learning, and a strategic approach. Whether Bitcoin reaches these lofty targets depends on a confluence of factors playing out over time. Staying updated on crypto trends and performing your own analysis will empower you to make better decisions in this fascinating and rapidly evolving space.

Table of Contents Solana forecast: Can the SOL token hit $200? Unilabs: The new AI-powered protocol set to outshine SOL in Q2 Will Unilabs match Solana forecasts in Q2? Solana’s price regained a bullish outlook, recording a monthly rally of over 30%. This has already led to an optimistic SOL prediction due to its growing on-chain activity. Meanwhile, Unilabs (UNIL), an innovative DeFi platform that leverages AI to offer automated asset management solutions, is looking to match the Solana forecast for Q2. With over $30.3m in assets under management, Unilabs will democratize access to high-quality crypto investment opportunities. This has already seen UNIL raise over $300k in presale funding, with a low entry price of just $0.0051. With this, Unilabs is quickly emerging as a key player within the artificial intelligence and digital asset space, the key question being, can it surpass Solana price prediction in May? Solana forecast: Can the SOL token hit $200? Solana ( SOL ) is one of the altcoins that has started grabbing investors’ attention owing to its recent price momentum. Backed by a significant rise in transfer volumes and growing on-chain activity, the SOL token could be targeting the $200 level, as the broader market sentiment turns positive. With fresh inflows and a rising network strength, the current Solana forecast has started to carry more weight. The SOL token has defended the $165 support zone while celebrating a major network milestone. This support zone is key in determining whether or not the SOL token could hit the $200 target or dip back to lower support levels. After recovering from lows near the $97, Solana managed to hit a high of $184, but failed to sustain levels above the $180. Source: AMCrypto via X However, according to crypto analyst AMCrypto, the short-term dipping trend for the SOL token could be over. Solana is now pushing past the trendline resistance of the falling wedge pattern. A move that could see the altcoin target the $190 and $200 levels if it holds, something that could attract more positive Solana predictions in the coming days.

Firstly, the narrative around Bitcoin has changed, and it is no longer seen as speculative but as a macro hedge and store of value, backed by institutions and stock markets, and a geopolitical asset for countries facing inflation. Altcoins , especially major layer-1s like Ethereum and Solana, are now viewed as technology platforms, and not “Bitcoin alternatives.” Add to those two narratives an increase in global liquidity, expanding stablecoin supply, altseason index showing bullish divergence, and retail index near bottom — all of which have historically preceded major altcoin runs . According to CoinMarketCap’s Altseason Index, it is still Bitcoin season with a rating of 26. However, it has bounced off a low of 15 earlier this month when Ethereum started to move . CryptoRank’s Altcoin Index shows a similar pattern, with it moving from mid-teens to 27 at the time of writing. Additionally, the ETH/BTC ratio, which is a measure of Ether prices in terms of Bitcoin, has bounced off a 5-year low of 0.018 to 0.025 over the past couple of weeks. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dominance has fallen from a 4-year high of 65.4% to 62% in the past week, according to Tradingview. Altcoin Golden Cross On May 14, Web3 growth manager Cas Abbé observed the confirmation of an altcoin market capitalization daily golden cross.

In the video, Portnoy posed a thought-provoking question about XRP: “What if that is the next Bitcoin?” His remark has garnered significant attention, especially given his candidness and past encounters with cryptocurrency. A Personal Experience That Changed His Perspective Portnoy’s contemplation about XRP appears to stem from a personal experience that left a lasting impression. Reflecting on a past incident, he shared how a Bitcoin investor outbid him when he attempted to purchase a property in Miami. This event highlighted for him the real-world financial power that cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, can wield. The incident left Portnoy considering whether XRP could one day hold similar financial significance . WOW! AMERICAN BUSINESSMAN DAVE PORTNOY ON XRP: “WHAT IF THAT IS THE NEXT BITCOIN?” #XRP pic.twitter.com/7wRKTeycQ0 — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 16, 2025 Portnoy’s Investment in XRP Known for his bold investment moves, Portnoy has recently increased his stake in XRP, the digital asset associated with Ripple Labs. In December 2024, he revealed that he held $1.3 million in XRP and $1.5 million in Bitcoin. By February 2025, amid a turbulent market, he invested an additional $1 million in XRP, underscoring his belief in its potential for substantial gains. As he put it, “As a gambler myself, I want the 10X coin like XRP. Bitcoin won’t do that anytime soon.” Why XRP? Understanding the Appeal Several factors seem to fuel Portnoy’s optimism about XRP. A significant development is Ripple’s launch of RLUSD, a USD-backed stablecoin designed to enhance liquidity and streamline cross-border payments. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Furthermore, the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remains in focus. Many investors, including Portnoy, believe that a favorable resolution under the new SEC chairman, Paul Atkins, could be a major catalyst for XRP’s price growth. Strategic Thinking Amid Market Volatility Portnoy’s approach to XRP exemplifies his high-risk, high-reward mindset. Rather than actively trading, he opts for a long-term hold, reflecting his belief that XRP could experience exponential growth similar to that of Bitcoin. His strategy, which he often described as “bet it and set it,” is rooted in the conviction that XRP’s utility and market potential make it a worthwhile gamble. Dave Portnoy’s public endorsement of XRP and his significant investment reflect a growing curiosity about the asset’s future. While his provocative question—“What if that is the next Bitcoin?”—remains speculative, it undoubtedly aligns with the broader conversation surrounding alternative cryptocurrencies. As XRP continues to evolve within the financial landscape, Portnoy’s interest serves as a reminder of the unpredictable and often surprising nature of the crypto market.

Wisconsin previously fully exited its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) position worth $63.7M. The most recent U.S. SEC filing revealed that SWIB was one of the high-profile asset managers who cut their stakes in spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) during Q1 of 2025. The Wisconsin Investment Board reported no spot Bitcoin ETF positions in its 13F filing to the U.S. SEC on May 15, having liquidated all 6,060,351 IBIT holdings from the previous quarter’s report. SWIB previously reported managing more than $166 billion worth of assets at the end of 2024, with Bitcoin ETFs representing around 0.2% of its entire portfolio before it sold them off. The mass sell-off came only a quarter after SWIB reported purchasing additional IBIT shares in Q4 of 2024 and reallocating all 1M shares held in GBTC to IBIT. Hedge funds and other institutional investors juggle BTC ETFs Recent regulatory filings disclosed that many high-profile asset managers cut their stakes in spot Bitcoin ETFs as BTC saw a 12% decline in the first quarter of 2025. However, Bitwise Asset Manager CIO Matt Hougan said hedge funds seeking to profit from the spread between spot and futures prices could capture annualized yields in the region of 15%. Millennium Management cut its IBIT holdings by 41% to 17.6 million shares and exited its position in the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF. Meanwhile, Jersey-based Brevan Howard trimmed its stake in the iShares ETF by 15.6%. However, Millennium Management increased its stake in two ETFs, boosting its holdings of the ARK 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF and the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust. Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala sovereign wealth fund also added to its holdings of IBIT shares, bringing its total position to 8,726,972 shares, valued at $408.5 million at the end of March and over $512 million at current prices. “What we witnessed in the first quarter was the collapse of the premium that people were paying for bitcoin futures, which had set up a very lucrative basis trade … But that premium collapsed and reached its nadir around the end of March … So I’m not surprised to see hedge funds trim their holdings.” – Matt Hougan, CIO at Bitwise Brown University also made its first charge into crypto ETF ownership during the same quarter, acquiring a stake in IBIT worth $4.9 million. Farside data reveals sharp swings in spot Bitcoin ETF netflows Source: Farside Spot Bitcoin ETF netflows between April 28th and May 15th. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a sharp flow reversal between May 13 and May 14. On May 13, the ETFs posted a net outflow of $91.4 million, the largest daily withdrawal since April 30. The losses were entirely driven by Fidelity’s FBTC, which recorded $91.4 million in redemptions with no offsetting inflows across other issuers. However, the trend shifted on May 14 as spot Bitcoin ETFs brought in $319.5 million in net inflows. BlackRock’s IBIT led the day with $232.9 million of new capital, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at $36.1 million and smaller positive contributions from Bitwise’s BITB, Ark’s ARKB, and Valkyrie’s BRRR. Grayscale’s GBTC also saw a modest inflow of $35.2 million, marking a notable break from its usual pattern of daily outflows. The $319.5 million inflow on May 14 erased much of the negative impact from the previous session and kept the broader monthly flows mostly positive. It also marked one of the strongest daily performances in May so far. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Whether you’re a seasoned trader or just starting your journey, understanding the current Crypto Market is crucial. Prices are constantly fluctuating, new technologies are emerging, and global events can have significant impacts. Let’s dive deep into what’s happening right now and how you can navigate this exciting landscape. What’s Driving the Current Crypto Market? The overall sentiment in the Crypto Market is influenced by a confluence of factors. Macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, technological advancements within blockchain, and even social media trends all play a role. Recently, we’ve seen increased institutional interest, which many believe is a significant catalyst. However, potential regulatory hurdles in various jurisdictions remain a key challenge. Here are some key drivers: Institutional Adoption: More large firms and investment funds are allocating capital to digital assets. Regulatory Clarity (or Lack Thereof): Uncertainty around regulations can cause volatility, while clear rules can boost confidence. Technological Upgrades: Developments in blockchain scaling, security, and new applications (like DeFi and NFTs) drive innovation and interest. Global Economic Factors: Inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical events can impact investor risk appetite. Decoding Recent Bitcoin Price Movements As the undisputed king of the market, the Bitcoin Price often sets the tone for the entire Crypto Market . Recent months have shown interesting patterns. We’ve witnessed periods of strong rallies, followed by corrections. Analyzing historical data and current trading volumes provides valuable insights, but predicting the exact future trajectory of the Bitcoin Price remains challenging. Consider these points about recent price action: Factor Impact on Bitcoin Price Current Trend Supply Halving Events Historically bullish long-term Anticipation building Market Sentiment Influences short-term volatility Mixed, leaning cautious/optimistic Exchange Inflows/Outflows Indicates buying/selling pressure Variable, watch closely Keeping an eye on technical indicators alongside fundamental news is essential for anyone tracking the Bitcoin Price . Are Altcoin Trends Signalling a Shift? While Bitcoin dominates headlines, Altcoin Trends offer unique opportunities and risks. The performance of altcoins, which are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, often follows Bitcoin’s lead, but they can also have their own independent drivers based on specific project developments, partnerships, or sector-specific hype (e.g., AI, gaming, Layer 2 solutions). Identifying promising Altcoin Trends requires research into their underlying technology, use case, team, and community. Key Altcoin Trends to watch: Layer 2 Scaling Solutions: Projects focused on making blockchains faster and cheaper. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Innovations in lending, borrowing, and trading without intermediaries. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): Evolving use cases beyond digital art, including real-world assets. Gaming and Metaverse Tokens: Cryptocurrencies integrated into virtual worlds and games. AI and Crypto Integration: Projects combining artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Divergent Altcoin Trends can sometimes signal shifts in investor focus or emerging narratives within the broader Crypto Market . The Latest in Blockchain News Behind every cryptocurrency is Blockchain News – the updates and developments related to the underlying distributed ledger technology. This includes news about protocol upgrades (like Ethereum’s moves towards proof-of-stake), new blockchain networks launching, enterprise adoption of blockchain for supply chains or finance, and advancements in security and privacy features. Staying informed on Blockchain News provides context for market movements and helps you understand the long-term potential of various projects. Important areas covered by Blockchain News : Protocol Upgrades: Significant changes to how a blockchain operates. Interoperability Solutions: Technologies allowing different blockchains to communicate. Enterprise Adoption: Companies using blockchain for business processes. Regulatory Frameworks: Governments defining rules for blockchain technology. Following Blockchain News helps investors differentiate between hype and substantive progress. Navigating Your Digital Assets Portfolio Building and managing a portfolio of Digital Assets requires a thoughtful approach. It’s not just about buying Bitcoin or following Altcoin Trends ; it involves understanding your risk tolerance, investment goals, and conducting thorough research (doing your own research – DYOR). Diversification across different types of Digital Assets and sectors within the Crypto Market can help manage risk. Security is also paramount – using reputable exchanges, hardware wallets, and being wary of scams are essential steps. Actionable insights for managing Digital Assets : Define Your Strategy: Are you a long-term holder, a short-term trader, or interested in passive income through staking/DeFi? Research Thoroughly: Understand the technology, use case, team, and tokenomics of any asset before investing. Diversify Wisely: Don’t put all your funds into one asset or sector. Prioritize Security: Use strong passwords, enable 2FA, and consider cold storage for significant holdings. Stay Informed: Keep up with Crypto Market news, Bitcoin Price analysis, Altcoin Trends , and Blockchain News . Effectively managing your Digital Assets is key to long-term success in this volatile space. Conclusion: The Crypto Market remains a dynamic and potentially rewarding frontier for investors. While volatility is a constant companion, staying informed about the latest Bitcoin Price movements, emerging Altcoin Trends , critical Blockchain News , and best practices for managing your Digital Assets portfolio can empower you to make more confident decisions. Remember that the landscape is always evolving, and continuous learning is your best tool for navigating its complexities and unlocking its potential.

In a letter dated May 15, Acting U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton informed Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the Southern District of New York that the government will no longer pursue part of the charge related to operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Specifically, prosecutors will not proceed under Title 18 U.S. Code § 1960(b)(1)(B) — the part of Count Two of the indictment that alleges Storm failed to comply with registration requirements for money transmitting businesses. However, the DOJ confirmed that it will continue to pursue charges accusing Storm of conspiring to commit money laundering, conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and conspiring to transmit funds derived from unlawful activity under the remaining portion of Count Two. In the letter, Clayton stated: “After review of this case, this Office and the Office of the Deputy Attorney General have determined that this prosecution is consistent with the letter and spirit of the April 7, 2025 Memorandum from the Deputy Attorney General .” That memo , authored by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, directed the DOJ to end its practice of “regulation by prosecution” in crypto cases. It emphasized the agency should not bring criminal cases for technical regulatory violations — such as failure to register — especially when platforms or developers may not be directly responsible for user activity.

Tornado Cash is a crypto mixer that anonymizes blockchain transactions, making it harder to trace stolen or sanctioned assets. It works by pooling users’ crypto deposits and redistributing them to different addresses, breaking the on-chain link between sender and recipient. Storm has pleaded not guilty and sought to have some charges dismissed , arguing they infringe on his First Amendment rights. Although his trial was previously delayed, it is now scheduled to begin this summer. A third co-founder, Alexey Pertsev, was arrested in Netherlands in 2022 on suspicion of facilitating money laundering through Tornado Cash. He was later charged and, on May 14 last year, a Dutch court found him guilty and sentenced him to five years and four months in prison. In February this year, he was released under electronic monitoring to prepare this appeal. The case has sparked a broader debate over developer liability and the legal boundaries of open-source software in crypto.

According to a May 15 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as of Mar. 31, Mubadala held 8.7 million IBIT shares worth $408.5 million. That’s an increase from 8.2 million shares at the end of 2024. While the number of shares rose, the total value dipped from $436 million due to fluctuations in IBIT’s price, which closed at $58.86 on May 15, according to Yahoo Finance data . The IBIT investment is a small part of Mubadala’s portfolio, which consists of more than $300 billion in total assets under management. Even so, it’s among the biggest Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETF allocations ever made by a sovereign wealth fund. Investing in IBIT allows funds like Mubadala to obtain exposure to Bitcoin without actually holding the cryptocurrency.

Since its launch in early 2024, IBIT has grown to become one of the most traded spot Bitcoin ETFs, with over 33 million shares traded every day. While Mubadala’s IBIT position has grown, other entities seem to be stepping back. In Q1 of 2025, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board sold all of its shares in IBIT, which amounted to over 6 million shares valued at $355.6 million. This represents a sharp reversal from its previous aggressive accumulation strategy. Meanwhile, more governments are warming up to crypto. In the U.S., president Donald Trump is pushing for the creation of a national Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. On the regulatory front, U.S. banks can now custody crypto more easily after policy changes, and the state of Missouri is working to remove capital gains tax on digital assets like Bitcoin.

Since April 9, bitcoin has climbed about 38%, advancing from around $75,000 to $104,000 as trade tensions eased and major market participants deployed capital. This rally can be described as a classic stair-step pattern: Initial bullish impulses are followed by periods of consolidation, which set the stage for the next upward move. For example, the initial increase from $75,000 encountered range-bound trading between $83,000 and $85,000. The subsequent step higher faced consolidation between $92,000 and $96,000. Similarly, since May 10, prices have oscillated mainly between $101,000 and $105,000, marking consolidation following the step into six figure territory. From here, advancing to the next phase of gains will require bulls to chew through a substantial number of sell orders at around $105,000, posing a significant resistance barrier. Sell orders worth nearly $50 million were open at $104,800 across major exchanges in addition to the $70 million in selling pressure at $105,000, according to data source Kiyotaka.ai. The analytics platform tracks the order book heat map by pulling order book data from spot trading on Binance, Bitstamp, Bybt, Coinbase and OKX and perpetual futures trading on Binance, Bybit and OKX. An open order placed above the current market price is usually a sell order. These can be called limit sell orders, setting the minimum price that sellers are willing to accept. When the spot price reaches this level, the order may be executed, allowing the seller to sell at or above that level. The chart shows that the global aggregated order book is relatively stacked at higher price levels, hinting at potential profit taking as prices approach lifetime highs. Macro indicators and technical momentum indicators suggest the path of least resistance is on the higher side, meaning sooner or later bulls will absorb the selling pressure, lifting valuations to record highs. In other words, these sell walls won't be there forever.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-16 07:48:38

According to CoinGecko, RIZE plunged nearly 48% in 24 hours, trading around $0.046 as of May 16 morning Asian time. The price action follows just a day after RIZE secured a listing on tier-1 centralized exchange Kraken on May 15, 15:00 UTC, coinciding with its Token Generation Event (TGE) and mainnet launch. The token was launched on the Base blockchain, an Ethereum Layer 2 network developed by Coinbase. Alongside Kraken, the token also secured a listing on the decentralised exchange Aerodrome and DEX aggregator Matcha (Base). Following the TGE, the token had a reported circulating supply of $27 million. Of its total 5 billion max supply, 4% (200 million tokens) was allocated for airdrops. However, those tokens are locked for now, with a 1-month cliff and 6-month vesting, meaning airdrop recipients can’t sell right away. Source: RIZE whitepaper However, private sale investors, who were allocated 7% of the total supply or around 350 million tokens, faced no lockup or vesting restrictions, allowing them to trade their tokens immediately after launch. This unrestricted access likely played a key role in the early wave of sell pressure and the sharp decline in RIZE’s price shortly after it went live. You might also like: Pi Network breaches support even as rebound catalysts emerge Other large allocations like liquidity and treasury (each 10%) also have no restrictions, possibly contributing to the early market dump. Meanwhile, seed and growth investors are on a 6-month cliff, and the team’s share (14%) is locked for 2 years. Governance tokens will unlock slowly over three years after a 12-month cliff. Sell-offs like this are a common occurrence within the crypto space, especially when tokens get listed on major exchanges during their TGE. Early investors often rush to book profits, causing short-term volatility even if the project has strong long-term potential. RIZE’s debut drew significant public interest, with the token trending on Google even as its price fell sharply. Public interest can also lead to increased demand or new buyers stepping in, which could help absorb some of the selling pressure. What is RIZE crypto? For the uninitiated, RIZE is the native token of T-RIZE Group, a project focused on tokenizing real-world assets like real estate and infrastructure. It runs on Rizenet, a Layer 1 blockchain built on Avalanche, designed to support decentralized machine learning and secure institutional asset tokenization. The token is used for governance, gas fees, and accessing exclusive investment opportunities. It also plays a role in federated learning, letting participants collaborate on data without compromising privacy. T-RIZE Group is based in Montreal, Canada, and has already secured a $300 million tokenization deal. It’s backed by École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS), one of Canada’s top tech universities, and is backed by major players like Canton Network, Hashlock, and the IBC Group .

This trend, known as institutional crypto adoption , is not just a fleeting headline; it’s fundamentally altering the structure and perception of the crypto market. What does this mean for the future of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the entire ecosystem? Let’s dive deep into this pivotal development. What is Driving Institutional Crypto Adoption? For years, cryptocurrencies were largely seen as a retail phenomenon or a niche interest. However, a confluence of factors has made them increasingly attractive to large-scale investors and corporations. Understanding these drivers is key to grasping the potential scale of this trend. Maturing Infrastructure: The development of robust custodial solutions, regulated exchanges, and financial products like Bitcoin ETFs has significantly reduced the technical and regulatory hurdles for institutions. Macroeconomic Factors: Concerns about inflation and currency devaluation have led institutions to seek alternative store-of-value assets. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ fits this narrative for many. Search for Alpha: The potential for high returns in the volatile crypto market presents an opportunity for institutions seeking to outperform traditional asset classes. Growing Legitimacy: Increased regulatory clarity (in some regions) and positive commentary from influential figures have helped legitimize digital assets in the eyes of traditional finance. Client Demand: Wealth management firms and investment banks are seeing increasing demand from their clients for exposure to digital assets. How Are Bitcoin Institutional Investors Entering the Market? Institutions aren’t just buying Bitcoin directly on retail exchanges. Their entry points are often more complex and tailored to their operational needs and regulatory requirements. Here are some primary avenues: Direct Purchases: Some corporations, like MicroStrategy, have added Bitcoin directly to their balance sheets as a treasury reserve asset. Investment Funds and Products: Product Type Description Example Bitcoin ETFs Exchange-Traded Funds that hold Bitcoin or derivatives, offering regulated access. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US Grayscale-like Trusts Private placement trusts allowing accredited investors exposure to crypto. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) Crypto Hedge Funds Funds specifically investing in various cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital Custodial Services: Relying on specialized custodians like Coinbase Custody or Fidelity Digital Assets to securely store large amounts of crypto. Derivatives Markets: Using regulated platforms like CME Group for Bitcoin futures and options to gain exposure or hedge risk without direct spot market interaction. Examining Key Crypto Investment Trends Driven by Institutions The influx of institutional capital is shaping specific trends within the crypto market: Focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum: While institutions are exploring other assets, the vast majority of institutional inflows are directed towards the largest, most liquid, and arguably most secure cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and Ethereum. Demand for Yield Products: Institutions are increasingly interested in staking, lending, and other DeFi-like activities to generate yield on their digital asset holdings, though often through regulated intermediaries. Exploration of Enterprise Blockchain: Beyond public cryptocurrencies, institutions are investing in and building private or permissioned blockchain solutions for supply chain, finance, and other applications. ESG Considerations: Environmental, Social, and Governance factors, particularly the energy consumption of Proof-of-Work blockchains like Bitcoin, are becoming important considerations for institutional investors, driving interest in more energy-efficient alternatives or solutions. What are the Benefits of Institutional Digital Assets Investment? The participation of large institutions brings several potential benefits to the crypto ecosystem: Increased Legitimacy and Mainstream Acceptance: When major banks and asset managers get involved, it signals to the broader public and other institutions that crypto is a serious asset class. Enhanced Liquidity: Larger trading volumes from institutions can lead to deeper markets and potentially less price volatility (though initial large entries can cause volatility). Development of Robust Infrastructure: Institutions demand high standards for security, compliance, and trading infrastructure, driving innovation and maturation in these areas. Potential for Price Appreciation: Significant capital inflows from institutions can exert upward pressure on the prices of favored assets like Bitcoin. Are There Challenges with Institutional Crypto Adoption? While the trend is positive, it’s not without its hurdles and potential drawbacks: Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite some progress, the lack of clear, consistent global regulation remains a significant barrier and risk for institutions. Security Risks: Managing and securing large amounts of digital assets requires specialized expertise and infrastructure to prevent hacks or loss. Market Volatility: Institutions, like retail investors, are exposed to the inherent price volatility of the crypto market. Concentration Risk: If a few large institutions hold a significant portion of an asset, their trading decisions could have an outsized impact on the market. Ethos Clash: Some in the decentralized crypto community view institutional involvement with skepticism, fearing it could centralize control or conflict with crypto’s original principles. How is Institutional Involvement Fueling Crypto Market Growth? The impact of institutional participation extends beyond just price. It’s fostering broader crypto market growth by: Attracting Talent: Financial professionals with expertise in traditional markets are moving into the crypto space, bringing valuable experience. Stimulating Product Innovation: The demand for compliant and sophisticated financial products is driving innovation in areas like DeFi, tokenization, and derivatives. Increasing Public Awareness: Media coverage of institutional moves brings cryptocurrencies into the mainstream conversation, increasing public awareness and interest. Building Bridges: Institutional involvement is building necessary bridges between the legacy financial system and the nascent digital asset economy. This trend suggests a potential future where digital assets are a standard part of diversified investment portfolios and global financial infrastructure. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Institutional Crypto Era How should you think about the market given this significant trend? Stay Informed: Keep track of announcements from major financial firms regarding their crypto activities. Understand the ‘Why’: Don’t just follow the money; understand *why* institutions are investing in specific assets or sectors. This reveals underlying conviction or strategy. Assess Long-Term Impact: Institutional adoption is a long-term play. While it can cause short-term price movements, its main significance is in validating the asset class for the future. Be Mindful of Market Structure: Recognize that institutional trading patterns and preferred instruments (like futures or ETFs) can influence market dynamics differently than retail trading. Focus on Fundamentals: Institutional interest often gravitates towards projects with strong fundamentals, security, and clear use cases. In conclusion, the increasing institutional crypto adoption marks a critical phase in the evolution of the digital asset space. It brings significant capital, expertise, and legitimacy, paving the way for broader crypto market growth and integration into the global financial system. While challenges remain, the trend signals a powerful shift that investors and enthusiasts alike should monitor closely.

While the spotlight often falls on companies like MicroStrategy for their aggressive buying , a fresh contender has entered the scene with a radically different strategy. Eric Trump’s Big Bet on Mining At Consensus 2025 , Eric Trump, co-founder of American Bitcoin, opened up his ambitious plans to mine Bitcoin at just $37K to $38K per BTC. That’s nearly a third of the current market price. Trump believes this cost-efficient approach will help his firm outpace MicroStrategy in the race to dominate Bitcoin holdings. Rather than buying from over-the-counter (OTC) markets, American Bitcoin aims to acquire BTC directly through mining, positioning itself as a new kind of powerhouse. Eric Trump emphasized that there are “two races for Bitcoin: buying and mining,” and he’s confident American Bitcoin will win the mining race by focusing on cost-effective production. Targeting MicroStrategy’s Throne MicroStrategy has built a massive 568,000 BTC position through persistent purchases, but American Bitcoin plans to mine its way to similar levels. CEO Asher Genoot, who launched the company in March 2025, has said they are prepared to invest billions into scaling mining operations. But his message is clear that American Bitcoin is not just playing catch-up; it wants to leapfrog ahead. And with cheaper production costs, they believe they have the edge over other countries like China. On the contrary… Despite its bold vision, American Bitcoin is already facing scrutiny. Concerns have been raised about potential conflicts of interest given the Trump family’s broader crypto involvement . But Eric Trump brushed off the concerns, voicing a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term role and even suggesting it could replace SWIFT as the global payments backbone. Lobbyists in Power 1⃣ Eric Trump, son of the former President, recently stated: ""Right now it’s a real race — who can accumulate more Bitcoin the fastest."" 2⃣ In a second interview on CNBC, Eric openly said: ""SWIFT is a disaster. It’s time for blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and… pic.twitter.com/zl1Z5tY9IG — xtra (@Xtrax_eth) May 15, 2025 Crypto analyst Xtra says Eric Trump’s recent pro-Bitcoin and anti-SWIFT comments aren’t just talk, they’re part of a bigger game. He argues the Trump circle is using crypto’s low liquidity and loose regulation to quietly make billions while pushing a patriotic narrative to turn the U.S. into a crypto powerhouse. He also reminds followers of Trump’s quiet “ crypto reserve” executive order from March, which included ETH at the last minute, coinciding with a SOL pump from $140 to $180 . He calls it a classic case of political market manipulation that’s now conveniently forgotten. As the next phase of institutional Bitcoin adoption unfolds, it’s no longer just about who buys the most; it’s about who mines the smartest. With Bitcoin above $100K, American Bitcoin’s bold mining-first approach could reshape the leaderboard in the coming years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

44688201,https://timestabloid.com/?p=67359,1747381902,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,How ETF Could Unlock XRP Financial Potential,https://timestabloid.com/how-etf-could-unlock-xrp-financial-potential/,"A recent thread by crypto commentator All Things XRP delves into the underexplored intersection of XRP and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), arguing that the general public underestimates how ETFs function and how deeply their structure could benefit XRP. The post offers a comprehensive breakdown of ETF anatomy and its potential implications for XRP’s mainstream adoption, positioning it as a pivotal opportunity in the evolving financial landscape. The Mechanics Behind ETFs and Their Participants According to the thread, most investors do not fully understand the internal structure of ETFs. At the most fundamental level, an ETF is described as a “wrapper” that holds assets, ranging from stocks and bonds to, potentially, digital assets like XRP. MOST PEOPLE HAVE NO CLUE HOW ETFS ACTUALLY WORK. But understanding the anatomy of an ETF could unlock XRP’s biggest opportunity yet. This is the breakdown Wall Street doesn’t want you to see. pic.twitter.com/W6EZ5UEwrr — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) May 13, 2025 Investors purchase shares in the ETF rather than directly engaging with the underlying assets, which removes technical barriers and simplifies the experience for mainstream participants. The thread outlines the key institutional players that facilitate ETF operations: fund managers who determine the asset mix, custodians who securely hold the assets, authorized participants (APs) who manage the creation and redemption of ETF shares, and the shareholders who invest in the fund. Each entity serves a unique role in maintaining the ETF’s integrity and liquidity. Central to the ETF structure is what All Things XRP refers to as the “secret sauce”—the creation and redemption mechanism. In the context of an XRP ETF, authorized participants would deliver XRP to the fund in exchange for ETF shares. Conversely, when ETF shares are redeemed, the authorized participants would receive XRP back. This in-kind process is fundamental for aligning ETF prices with the net asset value (NAV) and ensuring adequate liquidity in the market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Unlocking Accessibility for the Retail Investor The thread contends that if XRP becomes the underlying asset in a fully operational ETF, this structure would be built around it. Institutions would manage custody and volume, while retail investors gain exposure to XRP without the need to navigate wallets or cryptocurrency exchanges. This would significantly lower the barrier to entry, making XRP more accessible to a wider audience. Accessibility is framed as the primary advantage of an XRP ETF. At present, many potential investors are deterred by the technical complexity of acquiring and storing digital assets. An ETF would eliminate these concerns by packaging XRP in a format that integrates easily with existing investment platforms. This simplified access could increase trading activity and heightened demand, which may deepen XRP’s liquidity. Liquidity, Use Case, and Regulatory Prerequisites Deeper liquidity, as noted in the thread, enhances the asset’s utility, particularly for cross-border payments and institutional settlement solutions . This aspect aligns directly with Ripple’s ongoing efforts to position XRP as a bridge asset in global finance. However, the thread also emphasizes that regulatory clarity remains a critical component. While XRP’s partial court victory in 2023 marked significant progress, questions around asset classification and custody solutions continue to linger. Regulatory approval is a prerequisite for ETFs in the United States, and XRP’s path will be scrutinized by agencies like the SEC. Risks are acknowledged. Potential XRP ETFs will likely face skepticism from the SEC, endure price volatility, and contend with competition from more established digital asset ETFs such as those for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Despite these challenges, All Things XRP asserts that the core infrastructure necessary for an XRP ETF is already in place and that XRP’s use case is “clear.” Broader Implications for the Financial System The thread concludes with a broader claim that extends beyond crypto investors. According to All Things XRP, an XRP ETF would benefit traders and serve institutional financial interests. By combining liquidity and stability, XRP could act as a viable global payments solution, potentially rivaling traditional systems such as SWIFT. Ripple’s existing relationships with banks and financial institutions are cited as a foundational advantage in this transition.

He explained that without clear rules, huge players like pension funds and sovereign wealth funds are sitting on the sidelines, hesitant to invest seriously in digital assets. Kevin also shared his experience with the US SEC as he recalled how he was hit with a Wells Notice for discussing debt tokenization. This had kept him away from the SEC for a while. However, with Gensler’s exit, the SEC has now taken a 180-degree turn, dropping many of the crypto cases that were started under Gensler. Kevin Calls For Clearer Regulations He shared that clearer regulations are now more important than ever. The sentiment has changed with the appointment of the new SEC Chair, Paul Atkins, and the “new sheriff in town” has already displayed a more crypto-friendly approach. This will make it easier to draft more supportive regulations for the crypto space. “I never thought I’d say this, but I want more regulation and I want it now,” O’Leary said. Kevin also believes that stablecoin legislation in the U.S. will eventually pass, helping digital payments grow. This will kickstart the next wave of crypto regulations, including the Market Infrastructure Act. Once the right regulations are in place, the big institutional investors will finally enter the crypto market, bringing in massive amounts of capital, especially into Bitcoin. Kevin Is A Big Shareholder in HBAR What grabbed viewers’ attention is that Kevin revealed he is a big shareholder in HBAR. He is also optimistic about projects like ETH and Avalanche and sees them more as a diversification. Once the tokens are designated as securities or commodities, he expects a large influx of capital into the top 5 tokens. He had also revealed about his investments in a range of cryptos, including Hedera, Solana, and Polygon, along with a mix of other technologies that have strong real-world use cases.

Bitcoin price cycles remain in focus as part of the BTC price “power curve” model. Eating gold’s market cap could propel BTC/USD to nearly $1 million by the decade’s end. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has a “decent chance” of hitting $250,000 or more in 2025 as attention turns to gold copycat moves. In his latest analysis , X analytics account Apsk32 argued that the four-year BTC price cycle should provide unprecedented highs this year. Bitcoin “power curve” delivers $200,000+ target Bitcoin following gold to new all-time highs is a popular theory among bulls. Historically, BTC/USD follows XAU/USD higher with a delay of several months . For Apsk32, the implications are considerable this time around; with gold hitting a record $3,500 per ounce , the future for BTC price action is bright. “Bitcoin’s position relative to gold has improved considerably since April,” he told X followers alongside his dedicated “power curve” tool. “This is the indicator that gives me hope for higher than expected returns later this year.” Bitcoin power curve data. Source: Apsk32/X The power curve concept involves measuring Bitcoin price in gold ounces to avoid the inflationary nature of the US dollar. “Here, I’m measuring the value of the Bitcoin network (market cap) in gold ounces and fitting that value to a power curve,” Apsk32 explained in a dedicated X post in March. Among the results is a potential bull market top target that contextualizes the old 2017 top of $20,000. “If Bitcoin’s network value measured in gold continues to follow a power curve, and gold holds its current value, and Bitcoin’s price returns to ‘five years ahead of support,’ we could hit Josh’s $444K this year,” it added. This week, Apsk32 suggested that a more “reasonable” target for 2025 would be up to $220,000. “If we start getting above $250k, that’s what I would consider ‘higher than expected,’” he responded when asked about the outlook. “I do think there's a decent chance we get there, it's just not the most likely outcome.” Bitcoin power curve chart.

The asset, which is soon to be rebranded with a new ticker, makes up a small portion of the WLFI portfolio, but may serve as an endorsement for the project. World Liberty Fi acquired EOS in a single transaction valued at $2.99M, buying the tokens at $0.82. Following the purchase, EOS traded between $0.80 and $0.84 on different exchanges due to low volumes and volatility. The purchase of EOS as a BSC token means World Liberty Fi may have to switch to the new asset and ticker, as EOS rebranded to Vaulta. | Source: Debank This time around, World Liberty Fi used a DEX for the purchase, acquiring the BNB Smart Chain version of EOS. The swap for USDT was made through PancakeSwap, meaning the fund is not holding the main chain EOS and may have a more complex path to swapping it for the new ticker. With the latest purchase, the World Liberty Fi portfolio expanded to around $106M, with other assets still actively swapped and traded. The acquisition is an outlier for World Liberty Fi, which has focused on the Ethereum ecosystem for its main operations, as well as the BNB Smart Chain for its USD1 stablecoin. The EOS token runs on a separate chain, with an entirely different network. EOS was already a high-profile ICO, but unlike Ethereum and Solana, the chain lagged behind in terms of apps and DeFi. The chain locks in just $690M, despite being older than Solana and on par with BNB Smart Chain. The EOS token sale was outsized even compared to early ICO standards. The project reportedly raised $4.6B from selling its native tokens for ETH. However, the ample funding did not translate into good use cases and apps, as the chain currently has only around 2.8K daily active users. Instead, EOS was mostly used for speculation. The asset retained its listing on Binance, where most of the liquidity is concentrated. World Liberty Fi buys EOS just before rebranding The move to buy EOS is even more confusing, since the token is on its way out, to be rebranded to Vaulta. The new project announced the swap feature is open since May 14, so World Liberty Fi will now have to either trade the holdings, or swap them out for the new token. You can now swap your $EOS tokens for $A at a 1:1 ratio through the official Vaulta Swap Portal. 1⃣ Go to: https://t.co/57N5nJs1as 2⃣ Connect wallet & login. 3⃣ Click swap. 4⃣ Select amount & approve transaction.

The purchase also raised questions on the potential value of EOS and the chain’s future. The crypto community commented on previous ETH purchases, which were then sold at a loss. This led to questioning the intentions behind buying EOS, while betting on the project’s revival as Vaulta . The unusual decision to acquire a position in this project also raised speculations of potential insider information known to the World Liberty Fi managers. Previously, World Liberty Fi gave similar endorsement to Movement (MOVE), later selling all tokens at a loss following a scandal with the project’s market makers and insider token allocations.

The breakout, consolidation, followed by another breakout, underlined the strength of the asset over longer time horizons. Monero [XMR] has rallied 82% since the 7th of April. The trading volume has been steadily high over the past year. With its previous all-time high at $542, just 60% higher, the odds of a new all-time high later this year appeared good. XMR presents a solid bullish case Source: XMR/USDT on TradingView The 1-week chart showed an asset breaking out of a multi-year consolidation phase in December. The $183 level, which had been a stern resistance since mid-2022, was flipped to support. Till April, this support level was retested on multiple occasions. The Fibonacci retracement levels plotted based on the drop in 2021-22 showed that the 61.8% level was at $246. Earlier this year, this level was tested as resistance, but a breakout was not possible. Over the past year, the trend of high trading volume has accompanied Monero’s breakout, consolidation, and the subsequent rally this May. For long-term investors, this was excellent news, as it showed heightened demand and conviction. The 1-week chart painted an intensely bullish picture. It might be a slightly late for FOMO, but it appeared that XMR was setting up to climb to a new all-time high. In the coming weeks, the 23.6% and 61.8% extension levels at $396.8 and $489.5 would be the next targets. Source: XMR/USDT on TradingView On the 1-day chart, Monero retained its bullish fervor. The CMF was at +0.12 to signal heavy capital inflows. The trading volume has picked up from April, as evidenced by the rising 20-period moving average for the volume bars. The MFI did not yet signal an overextended market on the 1-day timeframe. Hence, the strong upward momentum could carry XMR a little higher. Since the 9th of April, Bitcoin [BTC] has traded within a short-term range . During this time, Monero managed to rally 13.7%. These returns were on par with Ethereum [ETH] . This relative strength against BTC and ETH was another hint of bullish strength. Holders may wait for a move to $400 and $500 to realize further profits.

The head of OpenAI recently shared a bold aspiration for ChatGPT: to evolve into an AI companion capable of remembering every detail of a user’s entire life. This concept pushes the boundaries of ChatGPT personalization to an unprecedented level, raising both excitement about enhanced utility and significant concerns about privacy and control. Sam Altman Vision: Remembering Your Whole Life At a recent AI event, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman articulated a grand Sam Altman vision for the future capabilities of ChatGPT. When queried about making the AI more personalized, Altman described an ideal state: a “very tiny reasoning model with a trillion tokens of context that you put your whole life into.” He elaborated on this ambitious goal, envisioning a model that could “reason across your whole context and do it efficiently.” This context would be comprehensive, including “every conversation you’ve ever had in your life, every book you’ve ever read, every email you’ve ever read, everything you’ve ever looked at.” Furthermore, this AI would be connected to all your data from other sources, with your life’s information continuously appending to its memory. Altman also noted this capability could extend to companies, allowing the AI to process all their internal data similarly. The Future of ChatGPT as a Personal Operating System Altman’s vision for the Future of ChatGPT isn’t purely theoretical; he sees current user behavior pointing in this direction. He highlighted how young people are already utilizing ChatGPT in sophisticated ways. Instead of just a simple search tool, many college students, he observed, are using it more like an “operating system.” This involves uploading files, connecting various data sources, and then using complex prompts to analyze and interact with that combined data. This existing trend of integrating personal data with the AI provides a data-driven rationale for Altman’s long-term goal of comprehensive life memory. He also noted a striking trend among young users: they often consult ChatGPT before making significant life decisions, effectively using it as a “life advisor,” contrasting with older users who tend to use it primarily as a “Google replacement.” Exploring ChatGPT Personalization: Exciting Potential The prospect of such deep ChatGPT personalization holds immense potential for streamlining and enhancing daily life. Imagine an AI assistant that truly knows you, your habits, preferences, and history. The benefits could be substantial: Automated Task Management: Your AI could proactively schedule routine maintenance like car oil changes or remind you of important appointments based on your calendar and past behavior. Personalized Planning: Planning complex events like travel for an out-of-town wedding could be handled end-to-end, including booking flights, reserving accommodation, and even ordering gifts from a registry. Proactive Assistance: The AI could anticipate your needs, such as pre-ordering the next book in a series you’re reading or reminding you about anniversaries with personalized gift suggestions based on past interactions. Enhanced Decision Support: With access to your entire life’s context, the AI could provide deeply personalized advice and insights, acting as a sophisticated co-pilot for navigating personal and professional challenges. This level of integration could make technology feel less like a tool and more like a seamless extension of your own capabilities. AI Data Privacy: The Disturbing Implications However, the idea of a single, centralized AI holding every piece of personal data raises profound questions about AI data privacy and security. The sheer volume and intimacy of the data involved create a massive potential target and a point of centralized control that many find deeply concerning. The primary worry revolves around trusting a large, for-profit technology company with such sensitive and comprehensive information. History shows that even companies founded with noble mottos can face issues: Past Corporate Behavior: Google, despite its early “don’t be evil” motto, has faced and lost lawsuits regarding anticompetitive practices, demonstrating that large companies can prioritize business interests in ways that might conflict with user privacy or open access. Potential for Manipulation and Bias: AI models can be influenced or trained to exhibit biases or adhere to specific agendas. Examples include Chinese chatbots complying with censorship or, more recently, xAI’s Grok unexpectedly discussing politically charged topics, which some attributed to intentional manipulation potentially linked to its founder’s views. Model Instability and Errors: Even the most advanced AI models are not infallible. They can sometimes “hallucinate” or generate incorrect, nonsensical, or even harmful information. A past instance saw ChatGPT becoming overly agreeable, even appearing to support problematic ideas, requiring a quick fix from OpenAI. Granting an AI access to your “whole life” context means entrusting it with the most intimate details of your existence. The potential for misuse, data breaches, or the application of opaque or biased reasoning on this data is significant. Considering OpenAI Plans and the Path Forward While Sam Altman’s comments outline a long-term vision, they also reflect the ongoing development of OpenAI plans for increased personalization and utility. Features like ChatGPT’s existing memory functions are early steps on this path. However, realizing the “whole life” vision necessitates addressing the monumental challenges related to data security, privacy guarantees, user control, and preventing misuse or bias at scale. The journey towards such a powerful personal AI assistant is fraught with both exciting possibilities and significant ethical and practical hurdles. The debate over how much data is too much data for a single entity to hold, and how trust can truly be built and maintained in AI systems, will only intensify as models become more integrated into the fabric of our lives. Ultimately, the future Altman describes could bring unparalleled convenience and insight. But given the track record of large tech companies and the inherent complexities of AI, it’s a future that requires careful consideration, robust safeguards, and a healthy dose of skepticism regarding who holds the keys to our digital selves.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holder MVRV Could Flag These Levels As Important In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about the trend in the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio of the Bitcoin short-term holders. The MVRV Ratio is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin Market Cap and Realized Cap. The former represents the value currently held by the investors as a whole, while the latter that initially invested by them. As such, this ratio tells us about the profit-loss situation of the network. Related Reading: This Late-Stage Bitcoin Bull Run Signal Hasn’t Shown Up Yet When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the average investor on the chain is holding a net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the threshold implies the dominance of loss among the holders. In the context of the current topic, the MVRV Ratio of only a specific part of the market is of interest: the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs refer to the Bitcoin investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. The members of this cohort tend not to be too resolute, so they often react to market happenings. In particular, whenever the profit held by them gets too high, a mass selloff from them can become probable, as they look to realize their gains. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio fell under the 1 mark earlier in the year as the asset’s price declined below the average cost basis of the group. With the latest recovery rally, the cryptocurrency has managed to break back above the line, putting STHs back into gains. So far, the MVRV Ratio has only reached the 1.09 mark, which isn’t too high when compared to past rallies. As such, it’s possible that the STHs may not be tempted to realize profits en masse just yet. In the chart, Adler Jr has highlighted two levels where profitability is high enough that significant selling pressure can indeed become likely to arise from this cohort: the 1.25 and 1.35 STH MVRV Ratios. At present, the former is situated at $118,000 and the latter at $128,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges—A Warning For Investors? It now remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will rally high enough to retest these levels—and if it does, whether the STH selloff will act as resistance.

Judge Torres denies key request,https://ambcrypto.com/ripple-sec-lawsuit-no-end-in-sight-as-judge-torres-denies-key-request/,"Judge Analisa Torres rejected the joint request by Ripple Labs and the SEC for a settlement motion. Policy watchers forecasted that a resolution was feasible in 4–5 weeks. The much-anticipated Ripple -SEC settlement has hit a slight roadblock. This followed a dismissal of a joint request for an indicative ruling by Judge Analisa Torres. She cited procedural errors for her dismissal, “If jurisdiction were restored to this Court, the Court would deny the parties’ motion as procedurally improper.” About a week ago, Ripple Labs and the SEC jointly requested that Judge Analisa Torres vacate a previous 2024 judgment and reduce the imposed fine from $125M to $50M. What’s next for the Ripple lawsuit? It’s worth pointing out that the Biden-era SEC appealed Judge Torres’ 2024 ruling on the sale of XRP on other exchanges being non-securities. In a rejoinder, Ripple filed a cross-appeal to address various issues raised by the regulator and challenge the $125 million penalty. Although the SEC withdrew its appeal in March, Ripple’s cross-appeal was still active, hence the need for an indicative ruling to advance the resolution. An indicative ruling refers to a court’s statement on its potential rule on a motion that falls within its purview. Reacting to the update, Ripple’s legal chief Stuart Alderoty clarified , “Nothing in today’s order changes Ripple’s wins (i.e. XRP is not a security, etc). This is about procedural concerns with the dismissal of Ripple’s cross-appeal.” He added that they would revisit the issue with the court. For his part, Fred Rispoli, a pro-crypto attorney, viewed Judge Torres’ rejection as a ‘waste’ of her time, five years on the case. But he noted that a resolution may take a month to achieve. “I do think that will get it done, but that’s going to take at least 2-3 weeks for Ripple and SEC to put together and file. Another week or two for the judge to rule.” Interestingly, the XRP market was positive despite the update, according to CoinGlass exchange netflow data. In the past 12 hours, nearly $50M worth of XRP (negative, red) were moved from exchanges for self-custody. Source: Coinglass When zoomed out on the 7-day period, over $270M XRP were withdrawn from exchanges, reflecting bullish expectations of future rallies. Likewise, Futures market retail activity was at a neutral level, a contrast to the ‘too many retail’ threshold hit during last year’s rally. Source: CryptoQuant Historically, a massive spike in retail has been used as a liquidity exit and potential ‘top’ indicator. Simply put, the current XRP retail status meant more growth could be feasible.

The bill, approved on May 15, sets the stage for the launch of the Marianas US Dollar (MUSD). What is MUSD? MUSD, short for the Marianas US Dollar, is a government-backed stablecoin set to be issued by the Municipality of Tinian and Aguiguan, a local government unit within the Northern Mariana Islands. It’s designed to be fully backed by US dollars and short-term Treasury bills, which would be held in a reserve maintained by the Tinian Municipal Treasury. The stablecoin will be issued, managed, and redeemed by the local government, effectively making it a digital representation of US fiat. According to details in the bill, MUSD will operate on the eCash blockchain, a network that originated as a fork of Bitcoin Cash and was formerly known as Bitcoin Cash ABC. In practical terms, MUSD is intended to function as a dollar-pegged token that residents and businesses can use for digital transactions within a regulated local framework. Supporters of the legislation believe the launch would boost economic activity on the island, particularly through sectors like online gaming, which the bill also authorises under a new licensing regime. Marianas Rai Corporation, a locally based technology firm, has been selected as the exclusive infrastructure provider for the stablecoin rollout. While technical specifics remain limited, the firm has confirmed it will manage the stablecoin’s issuance and tracking via blockchain smart contracts, offering transparency and auditability. Unlike commercial stablecoins issued by private companies, MUSD is positioned as a fully public-sector initiative. The Tinian government will retain control of the reserves, token supply, and regulatory oversight. Legal hurdles along the way Since its introduction, the legislation has had a rocky journey through the Islands’ legislature, with progress stalling after Governor Arnold Palacios vetoed the bill in April. Palacios raised concerns over what he called “several legal issues,” arguing the proposal lacked adequate enforcement provisions and could create regulatory gaps beyond Tinian’s jurisdiction. However, the bill was revived following pressure from lawmakers and public testimony in support of the measure. The Tinian delegation led the charge, pushing for an override that would allow the legislation to move forward despite the governor’s objections. On May 9, the territory’s Senate voted 7-1 to overturn the veto, and the House followed suit on May 15 with a 14-2 vote, officially clearing the way for the MUSD initiative to proceed. Northern Mariana Islands joins Wyoming, which has been working on its own government-backed stablecoin since 2023 under the Wyoming Stable Token Act. The state created a dedicated Stable Token Commission to oversee the rollout of the Wyoming Stable Token (WYST), which is backed by a combination of cash, US Treasuries, and repurchase agreements. Since then, Wyoming has been quietly building the technical foundations for WYST. The commission has partnered with LayerZero for cross-chain functionality and has tested the token across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Polygon.

On May 15, lawmakers in the Northern Mariana Islands House voted 14-2 to override Governor Arnold Palacios’ earlier veto of the bill. The House vote followed a May 9 decision by the territory’s Senate, which also overturned the veto with a 7-1 majority. The bill had originally passed unanimously through the Tinian delegation in March and was sent to the governor on March 12. The legislation authorizes the Municipality of Tinian and Aguiguan to issue a “Tinian Stable Token,” formally called the Marianas US Dollar (MUSD), backed by U.S. dollars and Treasury bills held in reserve by the local treasury. It also enables Tinian’s local government to issue licenses to internet casinos, tying the stablecoin rollout to a broader economic strategy aimed at revitalising the island’s struggling economy. The local government has partnered with Marianas Rai Corporation as its exclusive technology provider, with plans to deploy MUSD on the eCash blockchain, a fork of Bitcoin Cash ABC. You might also like: Senate stablecoin bill may return to vote after Trump-linked crypto dispute Supporters of the bill argue the initiative could bring much-needed revenue to Tinian without placing a financial burden on the government. Marianas Rai Corp. co-founder Vin Armani told lawmakers that the bill could “attract billions of dollars of investment and tax revenue” from the crypto sector. Clyde Norita, another executive at the firm, described the effort as a way to revive a “dying” local economy, saying the new digital industry could generate income without affecting the island’s culture, environment, or immigration status. Among lawmakers, Republican Representative Patrick San Nicolas, a member of the Tinian delegation, supported the bill as a way to break dependence on tourism and federal subsidies. “We need this legislation to unlock our potential,” he said during floor discussions, framing it as a path to self-sustaining revenue. Among the critics was Governor Palacios, who vetoed it over what he described as “several legal issues” and a lack of enforcement safeguards, and Independent Representative Marissa Flores, who criticized the bill’s ties to online casinos. “Every time we’re desperate, it always seems that we come back to casinos,” she said, and warned against making decisions out of fear or economic pressure, before the vote. If launched ahead of schedule, MUSD could become the first government-backed stablecoin issued by any U.S. public entity, beating out the state of Wyoming, which is working toward a similar goal by July 2025. Wyoming passed the Wyoming Stable Token Act in March 2023 and has been developing its own stablecoin backed by cash and government securities. The state’s Stable Token Commission is currently conducting cross-chain tests on platforms like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche, ahead of the expected launch window . However, at the national level, progress on stablecoin regulations has stalled. Two major federal bills, the GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act , have lost Democratic backing due to concerns over former President Donald Trump’s growing involvement in crypto.

In a new Bloomberg Television interview, Dimon says mounting uncertainty around tariffs and geopolitical tensions could increase inflation and slow down the economy. “I’m going to defer to our economists who give [a recession] about a 50% chance… If there’s a recession, I don’t know how big it will be or how long it will last. Hopefully we’ll avoid it, but I wouldn’t take it off the table at this point.” Dimon says economic uncertainty includes ongoing wars and conflicts around the world, as well as unresolved issues in the United States, such as a growing budget deficit and a tax bill winding its way through Congress. “Markets are quite unpredictable. I think there’s a lot of uncertainty out there that you can’t discount. You know, war in Ukraine, terror in the Middle East. You know, Iran. You know, huge deficits, our tax bill, which I would like to see a good tax bill pass, the tariffs, the reaction of countries to tariffs.” Dimon also says that the recent developments around President Donald Trump’s trade war are moving in the right direction, but still leaves many questions unanswered. “I think it’s the right thing to do, is to back off some of that stuff, to engage in conversation. I’m grateful they did the US-UK deal. You know, it’s an agreement in principle so there’s a lot of uncertainty still, and there’s a lot of uncertainty still in the China thing, but at least we started, and obviously it calms down the markets.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Daily active users in blockchain gaming declined by 10% in April 2025, dropping to 4.8 million unique active wallets, reaching the lowest level of user engagement the sector has seen so far this year. Data from DappRadar shows that web3 gaming’s share of the decentralized app industry also slipped, now tied with decentralized finance at 21% each, while artificial intelligence projects soared with a 16% market share. Investments in web3 | Source: DappRadar DappRadar’s blockchain analyst Sara Gherghelas noted that funding for blockchain gaming also saw a big decline, dropping nearly 70% from March to $21 million in April. However, some large ecosystem funds remain active. Arbitrum Gaming Ventures deployed its first $10 million from a $200 million fund, backing projects such as Wildcard, XAI Network, and Proof of Play. “April 2025’s investment activity in blockchain gaming and the metaverse almost fell flat, but there’s a reason to be cautiously optimistic. This month the total capital raised reached only $21 million, marking a 69% decrease from March.” Sara Gherghelas You might also like: AI dApps gain 26% in April, challenge DeFi and gaming for dominance As Gherghelas notes, investors are now “optimizing for sustainable models, player engagement, and actual retention, not just token hype,” what the analyst describes as the market’s “reset mode.” “Capital is harder to secure, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Weak projects are falling away, and funds are flowing into the builders who are quietly laying the groundwork for the next generation of blockchain games.” Sara Gherghelas Even with numbers going down, big-name gaming companies are still testing the waters with blockchain. It’s a mixed bag though — Sega dropped an NFT game called KAI: Battle of Three Kingdoms, but Square Enix bailed on Symbiogenesis after it flopped. Ubisoft’s still in the game, teaming up with Immutable for a Might & Magic blockchain card game coming later this year. According to Gherghelas, major publishers are still showing interest, but the ones actually getting somewhere are the ones teaming up with web3 native teams. She also points out the space is shifting — less focus on hypey token models, more on solid gameplay, interoperability, and “actual user retention.” Read more: South Korean gaming firm Nexon’s Nexpace secures listing on Binance Alpha",News|blockchain games|Gaming|Web3 gaming,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|ARB|BNB,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-05-16 09:19:04

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum had another impressive week with a 15% price increase after it managed to hold above $2,500, which is currently acting as a key support. As long as this level holds, buyers have a good chance to take the asset higher. The resistance is found at $2,870, which will likely put sell pressure on the price if it arrives there in the future. Considering that the recent rally was quite aggressive, it would be unlikely for ETH to continue up uninterrupted without a pullback. Looking ahead, Ethereum remains bullish, but the momentum has been decreasing lately. This is why a consolidation between $2,500 and $2,870 should be expected before the next attempt at higher levels. Chart by TradingView Ripple (XRP) XRP managed to move briefly above $2.6 this week, but sellers were quick to return at that key resistance and pushed the price back under $2.5 at the time of this post. Nevertheless, the asset closes the week with a 5% increase. With another higher high confirmed on the chart, XRP seems determined to get closer and closer to the $3 resistance, which acts as a magnet for the price. As long as the support at $2.3 holds, buyers have a good shot at that. Looking ahead, XRP wants to revisit $3. To be successful it will have to turn $2.6 into a key support. For now, this level still acts as a resistance, but will likely break if this bullish momentum persists. Chart by TradingView Cardano (ADA) ADA is found between two key levels: the support at $0.64 and the resistance at $0.9. So far, the price has failed to escape this large range and only managed to book a 2% increase this week. Cardano also entered a pullback after it reached $0.86, and sellers managed to take it down to $0.75, where buyers returned to defend the price. Despite this correction, ADA remains bullish with clear higher highs. The next push will likely test the resistance at $0.9 for the first time since March. Looking ahead, ADA’s uptrend continues, and its first major test is still to come. If buyers break above $0.9, then this coin has a good shot at reclaiming a price above $1, like it did in late 2024. Chart by TradingView Solana (SOL) After Solana touched the resistance at $186, the price entered a pullback, which is still ongoing at the time of this post. Still, SOL managed to secure a respectable 5% price increase this week. The pullback could continue for some time before buyers regain control. This can be seen on the momentum indicators, such as the MACD and RSI, which are currently falling. Until they reverse, the correction is likely to continue. Solana’s native token has rallied by 80% since its bottom at $95. Considering this recent performance, it’s possible SOL corrects to the $152 support before buyers dare to challenge the resistance at $186. Chart by TradingView Hype (HYPE) HYPE is the second-best performer on our list with an impressive gain of 10% this week. This has allowed the price to stay above the $24 support and grind higher with a clear target at $28. This latest push could be the last one before a major correction starts. This is likely considering that the last time HYPE visited $28, its price entered a sustained downtrend that saw it crash by 67%. If buyers initiate another leg-up, then the $28 resistance is a prime candidate. Looking ahead, HYPE can remain bullish until the $28 resistance is tested. At that point, it’s best to be cautious as bears could return to push this cryptocurrency into a major pullback, which hasn’t happened since early April.

It’s buzzing, and a major reason for the excitement isn’t just retail investors anymore. We’re seeing big players, the institutions, stepping into the ring. This shift towards significant institutional adoption is arguably one of the most transformative trends impacting the Bitcoin price and the broader crypto market today. It’s changing the game, adding a new layer of complexity and potential. What is Driving This Institutional Adoption in the Crypto Market? So, why are these large financial institutions, corporations, and asset managers suddenly so interested in the crypto market ? It’s not just a passing fad for them. Several factors are at play: Inflation Hedge: In a world grappling with inflation concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a potential store of value, a digital alternative to gold. Institutions are looking for assets that can preserve capital against depreciating fiat currencies. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a traditional portfolio can offer diversification benefits due to its low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds, although this correlation can change. Growing Legitimacy: As infrastructure improves (custody solutions, trading platforms) and regulatory clarity slowly emerges, the asset class becomes more palatable for compliance-conscious institutions. Digital Gold Narrative: The narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ resonates with institutions seeking a scarce, decentralized asset. Client Demand: Institutional clients are increasingly asking for exposure to digital assets, pushing firms to offer relevant products and services. This isn’t just theoretical; we’ve seen concrete examples. Firms like MicroStrategy have made substantial Bitcoin investment part of their corporate strategy, and asset managers are launching Bitcoin-focused funds and ETFs (where permitted). How Does Institutional Investment Affect Bitcoin Price? The entry of institutional capital has a profound impact on the Bitcoin price . Think about it: these aren’t individuals buying a few hundred dollars worth; they are often making multi-million or even multi-billion dollar purchases. This has several key effects: Increased Demand: Large buy orders absorb significant amounts of the available supply, putting upward pressure on the price. Reduced Volatility (Potentially): While counterintuitive, institutional holders often have longer investment horizons than retail traders. Their large, less frequent trades can potentially lead to periods of lower volatility compared to rapid retail trading. Enhanced Liquidity: More participants, especially large ones, can increase market depth and liquidity, making it easier to execute large trades without drastically moving the price. Market Sentiment: Institutional validation can boost confidence among both retail and other institutional investors, creating a positive feedback loop for the Bitcoin price . The sheer scale of institutional buying can dwarf retail activity, making their movements significant indicators for market watchers. It’s a powerful force reshaping the supply-demand dynamics. Key Players and Examples of Significant Bitcoin Investment When we talk about institutional adoption and Bitcoin investment , certain names come to mind. These entities have not only invested directly but have also paved the way for others. Some notable examples include: MicroStrategy: A business intelligence firm that has made accumulating Bitcoin a core part of its treasury reserve strategy. They hold tens of thousands of BTC. Grayscale Investments: Manages large cryptocurrency trusts, including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which allows institutional and accredited investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Tesla: The electric car manufacturer famously added a significant amount of Bitcoin to its balance sheet, although they have also sold portions at times. Square (now Block): Jack Dorsey’s payments company has also made notable Bitcoin purchases for its corporate treasury. Asset Managers: Firms like Fidelity, BlackRock, and others are exploring or launching crypto-related funds and services, indicating growing interest in facilitating Bitcoin investment for their clients. These are just a few examples, but they highlight the growing trend of corporations and financial giants allocating capital to Bitcoin and the wider crypto market . Challenges and Opportunities in Crypto Regulation While institutional adoption brings many positives, it also shines a brighter spotlight on the need for clearer crypto regulation . This remains one of the biggest hurdles and areas of uncertainty for both institutions and the market. Challenges include: Lack of Clarity: Different jurisdictions have varying approaches to classifying and regulating cryptocurrencies. Consumer Protection: Regulators are concerned with protecting investors from fraud and manipulation. Taxation: Complex rules surrounding the taxation of crypto assets. Security: Ensuring robust security measures against hacks and theft is paramount for large-scale holdings. However, evolving crypto regulation also presents opportunities. Clearer rules can provide the legal certainty that more conservative institutions require before making significant commitments. This could unlock even larger pools of capital and further legitimize the asset class, potentially having a stabilizing effect on the Bitcoin price in the long run. What Does This Mean for the Future of the Crypto Market? The increasing involvement of institutions is fundamentally changing the structure and dynamics of the crypto market . It suggests a maturation of the asset class beyond being solely a retail-driven phenomenon. Looking ahead, we might see: Greater integration of crypto into traditional financial systems. Development of more sophisticated financial products based on crypto assets. Increased focus on compliance and security standards across the industry. A potential shift in market dynamics as institutional influence grows relative to retail. While retail investors will always be a vital part of the crypto market , the institutional wave is bringing significant capital, expertise, and a demand for robust infrastructure that will shape its future trajectory. Conclusion: The Institutional Tide is Rising In summary, the rise of institutional adoption is a powerful force reshaping the landscape for the Bitcoin price and the entire crypto market . Driven by macro factors, diversification needs, and increasing legitimacy, large players are making significant Bitcoin investment moves. While challenges like navigating evolving crypto regulation remain, the benefits of increased liquidity, potential stability, and mainstream validation are undeniable. This trend isn’t just about big money entering the space; it’s about the gradual integration of a revolutionary asset class into the global financial system. Keep an eye on institutional flows – they are set to play an increasingly critical role in determining the future direction of the market.

At this point, one of the participants was Anthony Di Iorio, the co-founder of the largest altcoin Ethereum. Comparing Ethereum to Bitcoin (BTC), Anthony Di Iorio stated that Etheruem was designed as an alternative rather than a direct competitor to Bitcoin. Di Iorio, one of the eight co-founders of Ethereum, said that he met Vitalik Buterin and joined the Ethereum team thanks to his support for Bitcoin. Di Iorio, who still states that he is a big Bitcoin advocate, nevertheless claimed that Ethereum has a chance of eventually surpassing Bitcoin in terms of market value. “I believe Ethereum could surpass Bitcoin in terms of market cap. Because Ethereum creates so many use cases and value creation opportunities, I think ETH has the opportunity to outperform BTC because of these features.” *This is not investment advice.

One metric that’s quietly making noise is wallet growth, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leading in that category. With a steady increase in new holders, it’s becoming harder to ignore the protocol’s momentum. While others wait for a listing announcement to decide, informed buyers are already making moves — positioning before exposure spikes and market attention drives demand. With the token still available at just $0.025, MUTM is now being considered by many as one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy before it takes off. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Recent data shows that over 9,850 unique wallets are now holding MUTM, reflecting a growing belief in the project’s long-term viability. Unlike short-lived meme tokens that trend for a few days and fade out, Mutuum is building steadily — and that’s reflected in its presale traction, which has now raised over $8.5 million with more than 82% of Phase 4 completed. That kind of organic wallet expansion points to confidence among both small and mid-sized investors. It also indicates something even more important: people aren’t just buying MUTM, they’re holding it — a key behavior ahead of listing exposure and mainstream discovery. Mutuum Finance functions as a decentralized, non-custodial platform that allows users to engage in on-chain lending and borrowing of digital assets without intermediaries. But it offers more than a one-size-fits-all solution. The platform is structured around two distinct lending models — Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) — each catering to different types of users and assets. In the P2C model, users deposit their assets into a shared liquidity pool. Borrowers can access these pooled funds by locking up collateral, and interest rates automatically adjust based on utilization. This setup provides efficient capital access and passive income for lenders while maintaining liquidity for borrowers. The P2P model, on the other hand, supports direct agreements between users. This allows for custom loan terms and enables borrowing or lending of more volatile or niche assets that might not be supported in the standard pool — such as meme coins or emerging tokens. It’s a flexible framework that gives both retail and more advanced users control over how they engage with the protocol. Wallet expansion isn’t just a number — it’s a sign of belief. When users continue accumulating during the presale, it shows they’re not waiting for external validation. They understand what’s being built and are locking in positions ahead of price discovery. With the next presale phase pushing the token to $0.03 and a final launch price of $0.06, those who enter now are still early. But as buyer numbers grow and supply becomes more limited, that opportunity will naturally shrink. If you’re asking what crypto to invest in with both low entry and solid mechanics, MUTM checks every box. Scalability and user cost are critical in DeFi — and Mutuum is preparing accordingly. The platform is being developed on Layer 2 infrastructure, which reduces gas fees and improves transaction speed. For a borrowing and lending protocol, this is a strategic edge. It makes the platform accessible to more users, supports higher transaction volume, and ultimately helps grow on-chain activity — which feeds back into the protocol’s revenue cycle. The protocol uses a portion of the interest paid by borrowers to buy MUTM from the open market. These tokens are then distributed to participants, creating a direct link between usage and value. That structure rewards long-term engagement and reinforces healthy token economics. It’s one of the reasons analysts now include MUTM on their list of top new cryptocurrencies poised for breakout potential. Right now, MUTM is still under the radar. It hasn’t been listed, hasn’t run a flashy influencer campaign, and hasn’t made headlines — yet. But wallet activity says it all: more investors are securing positions, more capital is flowing in, and time is running out to enter before the market catches on. For those seeking a crypto investment backed by smart mechanics, flexible lending models, and growing real-user interest, Mutuum Finance is a name to know — and act on — before the next phase hits.

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has clarified that Japan will not accept any trade deal that fails to address the Trump administration’s 25% tariffs imposed on Japanese car imports. These tariffs have significantly impacted Japan’s automotive sector, a cornerstone of its export economy, contributing to a $63 billion trade surplus with the US. Japan, the US’s largest foreign investor and closest ally in Asia, is eager to strengthen ties with Washington. The Prime Minister initially prioritized securing a spot at the negotiating table before other countries. However, Tokyo officials highlight that a deal is now unlikely to be reached before the late July elections for Japan’s upper house of parliament, which are already anticipated to be challenging for Ishiba’s already unpopular government. Japan shifts stance on tariff talks, seeking a favorable deal Ryosei Akazawa, Japan’s minister of economy, led the country’s negotiators and met twice with the Trump administration’s representatives. Tokyo’s finance minister Katsunobu Kato also plans to talk separately with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent during a G7 meeting in Canada next week. Despite Japan’s strong desire to be the first country to begin tariff talks with Washington, the focus now is on ensuring a favorable deal, according to a Tokyo official with direct knowledge of the talks. Based on information from officials and analysts concerning Ishiba’s stance, he was forced to reconsider after facing pressure from business leaders and members of his own Liberal Democratic party to reject any deal that endangers the automotive industry or threatens domestic farmers. Japan’s initial stance is to remove all new US tariffs, including a 25% levy on imports of steel, aluminum, and automobiles and a 24% “reciprocal” tariff on other Japanese goods that has since been temporarily lowered to a 10% baseline level. One of Japan’s initial proposals was to tie percentage-point tariff reductions to the amount of Japanese business investment in the US. According to company and analyst estimates, the impact of US tariffs on the operating profits of Japan’s major automakers is expected to be around ¥2 trillion, worth about $13.7 billion, in the current fiscal year that ends in March of next year. However, actions like price increases may mitigate the impact. Japan’s economy contracted for the first time in a year in the first quarter. Japan presses for auto tariff relief According to a second Japanese official knowledgeable about the negotiations, the largest export market from Japan to the US is automobiles and auto parts. This implies that the auto tariff issue must be addressed during this US-Japan negotiation. The official believes that if the nation is not able to come to any consensus, it will not be able to make progress in this area. Among the best offers Tokyo could make to Washington are increased buys of American farm products, greater access to markets for American automobiles, and funds for a project to build a pipeline in Alaska for liquefied natural gas. Nicholas Smith, a Japan strategist at CLSA Securities, stated that Japan is now in a strong position. Shigeru Ishiba has his political career and that of his party to defend; he cannot just roll over. Smith added that cars comprised 81% of Japan’s trade surplus with the US in 2024. If he fails to win lower auto tariffs, PM Ishiba would be on a conveyor belt headed for revolving knives. However, Ishiba has said he will not cut Japan’s domestic agriculture sector, which employs many people, to accept lower auto tariffs. The extent of Japan’s influence in the White House was not known. Reliant on Washington for security, Tokyo had a goods trade surplus of over $60 billion with the US in the 2024-2025 fiscal year. Meanwhile, accusations from the Trump administration that Japan is intentionally undervaluing the yen have further complicated negotiations.

South Korea's National Pension Service (NPS), managing over $800 billion in assets, is exploring direct investments in Bitcoin. This shift follows recent legislation permitting national pension funds to invest in cryptocurrencies. Presidential candidates from both major parties have expressed support for integrating digital assets into public investment strategies. Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung has pledged to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs if elected, aiming to create a secure investment environment for younger generations. Currently, the NPS holds indirect crypto exposure through significant investments in companies like MicroStrategy and Coinbase. In 2024, it purchased $34 million worth of MicroStrategy shares, a firm known for its substantial Bitcoin holdings. Additionally, the NPS invested over $45 million in Coinbase shares, reflecting a growing institutional interest in the crypto sector. The move towards direct Bitcoin investment is also influenced by the increasing interest in cryptocurrencies among South Koreans, including older demographics. A recent survey indicated that 11% of crypto investors in South Korea are in their 60s, surpassing the 8% in their 50s, highlighting a broader acceptance of digital assets across age groups. While the NPS has not yet made direct Bitcoin purchases, the combination of legislative support, political backing, and shifting investor demographics suggests a significant step towards integrating cryptocurrencies into South Korea's national pension investment portfolio.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-05-16 09:25:42

Binance sparked speculation about a possible PI listing with a cryptic π-themed post, triggering excitement across the community. Shibarium’s marketing strategist, LUCIE, shared a personal story of being scammed, urging the Shiba Inu community to stay vigilant as fraudsters continue exploiting unsuspecting crypto users. What’s New Around Pi Network? The controversial crypto project made the headlines on May 8, teasing a mysterious announcement that would be released in the upcoming days. The community took this as a positive sign, with some expecting major news, such as PI’s listing on the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. The excitement also seems to have triggered a price rally for Pi Network’s native token, which surged by almost 200% at one point and jumped above $1.70 (the highest point observed in the past two months). On May 14, the team behind the project lifted the curtain, unveiling the launch of a $100 million initiative (held in PI and USD) to invest in startups and businesses that “advance the utility and real-adoption of PI.” The price of the underlying token dipped substantially following the announcement, reaching a local bottom of nearly $0.80. This appears to be a classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” case where the asset’s valuation climbs in anticipation of a certain disclosure, only to decline once the news becomes public. Meanwhile, Binance posted a cryptic message on its official X account that many community members view as a potential PI listing coming soon. The company presented its logo with mathematical symbols, one of which was the constant π. Many users pointed out the connection with the crypto project, whose native token has the same name. It is important to note that Binance issued a community voting in February to determine whether its users want to see PI available on the platform. The vast majority clicked the “yes” option, but the company has yet to respect their wish . Binance Flashes the Red Flag Approximately a week ago, the exchange warned its users about phishing scammers who present themselves as Binance staff on Telegram and other social platforms. Per the alert, fraudsters direct victims to designated links, which can later steal their credentials or 2FA codes. Binance advised people to be utterly cautious about suspicious messages and to double-check information before clicking on unfamiliar links. The company’s CEO shared the warning, saying: “We’re here 24/7, but your vigilance is the first line of defense.” Shiba Inu Also Sounded the Alarm Scams are a persistent and unpleasant part of the crypto space, and Binance isn’t the only entity to warn about such dangers. Most recently, LUCIE – Shibarium’s marketing strategist – revealed their personal encounter with bad actors years ago. The X user said the attack caused a huge trauma since wrongdoers managed to drain the victim’s wallet. LUCIE also stated that the person who carried out the scam was “so kind, so sympathetic” and an English native speaker, meaning that people can easily be tricked . In conclusion, Shibarium’s lead advised people to be careful and stay safe.

The post takes a critical and urgent tone, suggesting that the full scope of XRP’s significance has been deliberately concealed from the public. According to Pumpius, the theory is often dismissed outright, not due to lack of evidence, but because it strikes too close to an uncomfortable reality. He contends that XRP’s involvement in the financial reset is not hypothetical but already structurally embedded in global plans for economic transformation, particularly those discussed under the World Economic Forum (WEF) . WEF’s Great Reset $XRP Agenda There’s a theory so bold it gets dismissed instantly because it sounds too real to be allowed. The idea? XRP isn’t just part of the financial reset. It is the reset. Read this before they bury it. pic.twitter.com/AeGnkoPbLq — Pumpius (@pumpius) May 15, 2025 WEF Alignment and Ripple’s Quiet Integration The tweet frames the WEF’s “Great Reset” not as a distant policy initiative but as an ongoing and covert implementation. Citing slogans often associated with WEF narratives — such as “You’ll own nothing” and “A new global system” — Pumpius positions XRP as the underlying technology chosen to support the infrastructure of this emerging order. He emphasizes that while public messaging focuses on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria, green finance, and inclusivity, XRP has already been adopted behind the scenes. Pumpius notes Ripple’s ongoing participation in WEF summits and discussions around central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), cross-border settlements, carbon credits, and financial inclusion. He then asked: What if Ripple’s role at these events is not about persuading global actors to adopt XRP, but rather reflecting that those decisions have already been made? We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Not Just a Bridge: A Financial Replacement System Expanding on this idea, he states that XRP is not simply a bridge currency or an interoperable financial rail, but the chosen settlement protocol for a tokenized global economy. He describes it as a replacement for traditional U.S. dollar settlement systems, potentially functioning under a future regime of centralized, protocol-governed financial oversight. In his words, XRP has been “selected — quietly — as the backbone of a new, tokenized financial order.” He argues that this theory explains the series of setbacks XRP has faced, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple , as well as repeated dismissals of XRP in mainstream financial media. In Pumpius’s view, these actions were intended to suppress public enthusiasm, restrict widespread adoption, and eliminate the possibility of ordinary individuals profiting from XRP’s future role. He asserts that the public was never meant to understand or hold XRP, describing these efforts as an attempt to ensure “control without dilution.” The Unfolding Reset and the Timing of the “Switch Flip” The tweet also points to a “switch flip” after which Pumpius claims XRP’s role will become obvious and access to it will be highly restricted. At that point, individuals will be either fully priced out or subject to the system’s centralized structure. He concludes by stating that “The Great Reset isn’t coming. It’s already in code,” suggesting that the infrastructure, protocols, and global alignment have already been established. XRP, in his words, is “the rails,” and the responsibility of resisting the system now lies with the informed minority.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) has long dominated the meme coin conversation and remains one of the best cheap cryptocurrencies to buy now, especially with renewed developer activity and community-driven burn mechanisms pushing momentum. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is entering the scene, attracting attention for their innovative DeFi utility and ultra-low price. Currently priced at just $0.025, MUTM is attracting investors seeking low-risk, high-reward opportunities in the DeFi market. Over $8.3 million has been raised in its presale, indicating strong investor confidence. The project is in phase 4 of its presale which has already sold over 75% and attracted more than 9900 unique holders. With many seeking the next crypto to explode, the race between SHIB and MUTM is shaping up to be one of May’s top debates in crypto investing circles. Is Shiba Inu Still One of the Best Cheap Cryptocurrencies to Buy Now? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been gaining new momentum in May 2025, with its price remaining steady after a temporary dip and poised to breakout. Shiba Inu growing Shibarium activity and more utility for SHIB within DeFi applications is causing investors to revisit it as one of the best cheap cryptocurrencies to invest in today. For those looking to know who to invest in or what to invest in today for long-term gain, SHIB offers a healthy community, constant development, and good crypto sentiment. As meme coins surprise the market over and over, SHIB is as solidly on the scene as they ever have been, especially as an inexpensive option in a portfolio focused on the next big crypto. At the same time, others are also watching closely for potential emerging low-price players like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as part of a diversified approach. Presale Gaining Momentum: Mutuum Finance Leads the Charge Mutuum Finance presale is far more than 75% through Phase 4, and the momentum is intensifying. Those quick on the uptake can lock in a 20% profit when the next price tier comes into play. With demand comes increased anticipation of even more dramatic profits at launch. With sound tokenomics and practical DeFi applications, MUTM is shaping up fast to be a breakout player in the 2025 altcoin conversation. Mutuum Finance carries out a unique buy-and-distribute process, unlike other many other speculation tokens. By doing this the periodic purchasing of tokens from the market and providing them to the MUTM stakers helps sustain the model and brings long term participation and thus reduces supply. This structure should increase price rise and encourage constant use from users. mtToken System Unlocks Passive Yield With Full Liquidity Mutuum Finance brings a new innovation to mtToken features, the ability to earn yield from assets outside the normal procedure of locking them. Users are not staking, they can freely use their assets and earn passively as well, which is a valuable change to DeFi users who appreciate revenue and usability. In addition, borrowers are able to easily access USDT using the platform’s collateralized loan provision, conformed to given ratio patterns. For example, $7,000 of ETH collateral can be used to unlock $5,000 stablecoins, the process being carried out via open source smart contracts. Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a strong meme coin with community support, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as a top contender. With its innovative DeFi solutions and a price of just $0.025, MUTM has raised over $8.5 million in its presale, with Phase 4 already 75% sold out. The unique buy-and-distribute model and passive yield features set it apart, making it a potential breakout star for 2025. The clock is ticking, secure your MUTM tokens now before it’s too late.

MUTM stands out,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/16/best-crypto-to-invest-in-with-real-revenue-and-fair-launch-mutm-stands-out/,"In a market overflowing with coins launched overnight and fueled by short-lived hype, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find a cryptocurrency that’s actually built for the long haul. Many projects promise innovation, but few follow through with sustainable structures or real user value. That’s why a growing number of investors are shifting their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a project that’s gaining momentum not because of flashy headlines, but because of how it’s structured. Mutuum is positioning itself as a strong player with its well-structured presale, growing community of holders, and a transparent strategy that links token demand directly to real platform activity. For those evaluating what’s the best cryptocurrency to invest in — not just for a quick flip, but for long-term potential backed by actual revenue mechanics — MUTM is beginning to stand out as a rare opportunity before price discovery kicks in. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) At the heart of the platform is a lending and borrowing protocol that lets users earn passive income while maintaining full control over their digital assets. Depositors are rewarded based on real APY, which fluctuates according to the protocol’s usage and borrowing demand. When utilization rises — meaning more funds are borrowed from the liquidity pool — yields increase, giving lenders stronger returns. If demand slows down, APY adjusts accordingly, ensuring the system remains balanced. This kind of dynamic interest model keeps rewards tied to activity. This mechanism plays a key role in ensuring long-term stability, which is why many analysts focused on crypto investment are keeping a close eye on MUTM. Those looking to borrow on the platform are required to pledge digital assets as collateral to support their loan agreements. Each asset is assigned a specific Loan-to-Value ratio (LTV) based on its volatility and liquidity profile. This LTV determines how much a user can borrow relative to their deposited collateral — protecting the system from overexposure and ensuring responsible leverage. Take ETH as an example — it might let a borrower unlock up to 70% of its value in stablecoins, whereas assets with higher volatility would come with a more conservative borrowing limit. If the value of a borrower’s collateral begins to drop and their LTV exceeds the safe zone, they’ll be prompted to repay or top up their position — maintaining systemic health without centralized intervention. This transparent risk management model not only adds trust but also makes Mutuum’s borrowing system attractive to both cautious users and more experienced traders looking to deploy capital without triggering a taxable event. A share of the earnings from borrowing activity is directed toward purchasing MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens are then redistributed to engaged users — particularly those holding mtTokens, which track their contributions and entitle them to protocol-generated rewards. This treasury-backed redistribution system creates steady buy pressure that’s tied directly to usage. It doesn’t rely on token minting or emissions, and that distinction is a core reason why long-term holders are positioning ahead of the launch. Mutuum’s presale rollout is organized across 11 structured phases, designed to offer early buyers a clear entry while ensuring future price stability. The token is currently in Phase 4, with over 82% completed, more than $8.5 million raised, and 9,850+ holders already participating. The price remains locked at $0.025, but the next phase will bump it to $0.03, and the official listing price is confirmed at $0.06. This transparent approach — combined with working utilities and a limited supply — gives MUTM a fair launch profile that’s increasingly rare in today’s market. For those looking at what crypto to invest in now, timing is everything, and that clock is ticking. MUTM isn’t built to chase quick pumps. It’s structured to scale based on actual usage, protocol revenue, and sustainable mechanics. For investors searching for the best cryptocurrency to invest in before the wider market catches on, Mutuum Finance may be the most undervalued protocol with real upside potential — and this presale window could be the most strategic entry left.

Today, we’re diving deep into Decentralized Finance, or DeFi , a movement that’s not just changing how we think about money but is also poised to have a significant impact on traditional finance and reshape the landscape of crypto finance. What Exactly is Decentralized Finance (DeFi)? At its core, Decentralized finance is an umbrella term for financial applications built on blockchain technology, most notably Ethereum. Unlike traditional financial systems that rely on intermediaries like banks, brokers, and exchanges, DeFi aims to remove these gatekeepers, offering peer-to-peer transactions and services directly on the blockchain. Think of it as finance without borders, available to anyone with an internet connection. It’s about creating an open, transparent, and permissionless ecosystem for financial services. This includes everything from lending and borrowing to trading, insurance, and asset management. Exploring the Vast DeFi Potential The DeFi potential is immense because it offers solutions to many pain points in the existing financial system. By leveraging smart contracts – self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code – DeFi applications can automate processes, reduce costs, and increase speed. Here are some key areas where DeFi shows incredible promise: Accessibility: Millions of people globally are unbanked or underbanked. DeFi can provide them access to financial services without needing a traditional bank account. Transparency: Transactions and protocols operate on public blockchains, allowing anyone to audit the activity. Efficiency: Automation via smart contracts removes manual processes and reduces transaction times. Innovation: The open nature of DeFi allows for rapid experimentation and the creation of novel financial products and services that weren’t possible before. This isn’t just theoretical; we’re already seeing decentralized exchanges (DEXs) facilitating token swaps, lending protocols allowing users to earn interest or borrow assets, and yield farming strategies generating passive income. How is DeFi Challenging Traditional Finance? The rise of DeFi is creating a fascinating dynamic with Traditional finance . While not yet a direct replacement, DeFi is acting as a powerful disruptor and a source of inspiration for innovation within the legacy system. Here’s how: Competition in Services: DeFi protocols offer competitive rates for lending and borrowing, often better than traditional banks. DEXs challenge centralized exchanges and brokers. Disintermediation: By removing middlemen, DeFi reduces costs and complexity, pushing traditional institutions to rethink their value proposition. Tokenization of Assets: DeFi is pioneering the tokenization of real-world assets, making them more liquid and accessible for trading and investment, a concept traditional finance is now exploring. Faster Settlement: Blockchain-based settlements can be significantly faster than traditional systems, which can take days. Major financial institutions are watching DeFi closely, with some even exploring blockchain technology for their own operations, recognizing the efficiency and transparency benefits. The pressure is on for traditional finance to adapt and integrate aspects of this new paradigm. Navigating the World of Crypto Finance with DeFi For those already involved in Crypto finance , DeFi represents the next frontier. It moves beyond simple buying and selling of cryptocurrencies to using them as building blocks for complex financial activities. DeFi allows crypto holders to: Earn passive income by staking or lending their assets. Borrow stablecoins or other cryptocurrencies against their existing holdings without selling them. Trade assets directly from their wallet without needing a centralized exchange account. Participate in decentralized insurance pools or prediction markets. Access new investment opportunities like yield farming and liquidity providing. DeFi is essentially unlocking the full financial utility of cryptocurrencies, transforming them from speculative assets into productive capital within a new financial ecosystem. However, it’s crucial to understand that while the opportunities are vast, navigating DeFi requires technical understanding and awareness of the risks involved, such as smart contract bugs, impermanent loss in liquidity pools, and regulatory uncertainty. What Challenges Does DeFi Need to Overcome? Despite its promise, DeFi is still in its early stages and faces significant hurdles: Regulation: Governments worldwide are grappling with how to regulate decentralized protocols and assets, creating uncertainty. Security Risks: Smart contract vulnerabilities and protocol exploits can lead to significant financial losses for users. Auditing is crucial but not foolproof. Scalability: Some underlying blockchains struggle with high transaction volumes, leading to slow speeds and high fees (though Layer 2 solutions are addressing this). User Experience: DeFi interfaces can be complex and intimidating for newcomers compared to user-friendly traditional banking apps. Interoperability: Connecting different blockchains and traditional systems remains a challenge. Addressing these challenges is vital for DeFi to achieve mainstream adoption and fully realize its potential impact. Actionable Insights for Getting Involved Interested in exploring the world of DeFi? Here are a few steps you can take: Educate Yourself: Start by learning the basics of blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and how smart contracts work. Understand the specific protocols you’re interested in. Start Small: Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. Begin with smaller amounts to get comfortable with the platforms and processes. Understand the Risks: Be aware of potential hacks, scams, and market volatility. Not all DeFi projects are legitimate or secure. Use Reputable Protocols: Stick to well-established and audited protocols initially. Secure Your Wallet: Your private keys are your access to your funds. Use hardware wallets for significant amounts. Remember, the DeFi space is dynamic and moves quickly. Staying informed is key. The Road Ahead for DeFi and Traditional Finance The relationship between DeFi and traditional finance is likely to evolve from competition to potential collaboration or integration. We may see traditional institutions adopting blockchain technology, partnering with DeFi protocols, or creating hybrid models that combine the strengths of both worlds. The DeFi potential to reshape global finance is undeniable. While the journey is fraught with challenges and requires careful navigation, the innovation bubbling within this space is set to redefine accessibility, efficiency, and opportunity in the financial sector for years to come, impacting both traditional finance and the future of crypto finance. In conclusion, DeFi is far more than just a buzzword; it’s a revolutionary approach to finance that leverages blockchain to create open, accessible, and efficient systems. Its potential to disrupt traditional finance and unlock new possibilities within crypto finance is immense, though it requires careful understanding and risk management from participants. As the technology matures and regulatory clarity emerges, DeFi is set to play an increasingly significant role in the global economy.

After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alemán shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges—A Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alemán, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alemán’s analysis highlights how Bitcoin’s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alemán suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alemán’s observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market’s dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides. Shayan wrote: Based on this behavior, Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this pause, potentially leading to a fresh impulsive rally and new all-time highs in the mid-term.

HyperLiquid is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) . It has its own Layer 1 blockchain, and HYPE is its native token, which is used for staking, governance, and payments within the ecosystem. One of the key features of HyperLiquid, along with its high-speed platform, is that it offers crypto perpetual futures for trading by its users without the need to own the asset. The platform supports a number of cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to BTC, ETH, SUI, AVAX, and SOL, to name a few. Technically, the HyperLiquid blockchain is based on two protocols, namely HyperEVM and HyperBFT; combined, they help provide high-speed trading and Ethereum-based smart contracts with reliability. The HyperLiquid platform revolves around community participation, as token holders have voting rights to govern and influence developments taking place on the platform. On November 29, 2024, HyperLiquid conducted an airdrop of its native token, HYPE, but unlike other players, it was selective in allocating the airdrop to only 94,000 users with an average value of $45,000 to $50,000, making it one of the most worthy airdrops in crypto history. Let’s take a deep dive into what the future holds for the HYPE token in Cryptopolitan’s HyperLiquid price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

The indicator’s value has increased to index 73.44 in the day. This upward movement of the indicator’s curve confirms a rising buying momentum in the market. The bullish activities have been growing since yesterday, leading to a considerable gain. HYPE/USDT 4-hour chart analysis The four-hour price analysis of HyperLiquid referred to a slightly bearish observation. The HYPE/USD value has somewhat decreased to $26.83 in the past few hours as the selling pressure seems to be triggering. However, mild volatility levels signal a relatively lower chance of an approaching reversal. HYPE /USD 4-hour price chart The Bollinger Bands are widening, indicating a slight increase in the volatility, but it still remains on the milder edge. These conditions signal a lower market unpredictability. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to a $26.97 high, indicating the resistance threshold. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $23.85, securing the support. The RSI indicator is present within the neutral territory for now. Its value has shrunk to index 63.63 in the past four hours. The bears have been trying to return to the market since the last hours of the day. This has resulted in a small loss for the cryptocurrency.

The HYPE/USD value has been upgraded to a high of $26.83 in the past 24 hours. If analyzed from an overall lens, the currency has gained up to 10.04 percent of its value in the day. Technical indicators continue to showcase support for the buyers. The price charts also project a strong bullish market scenario. Why is HyperLiquid up? The cryptocurrency market is under a bullish spell, and HYPE is receiving the same sentiment. Moreover, it is encouraging that HYPE has been following a bullish price curve after April 7, 2025, over the larger picture. The HYPE price increased to $26.83 gaining 10.04% of its total value in the last few hours. Is HyperLiquid a Good Investment? HYPE has growing utility, and its Ethereum compatibility helps it steal a share of DeFi industry. While the technical analysis can change from bullish to bearish, price predictions paint a different picture. However, a risk analysis is recommended. Will HyperLiquid reach $50? The current price action does not justify predicting a $50 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that HYPE will reach above $50 by 2026. Can HyperLiquid Coin reach $100? According to HyperLiquid price prediction, HYPE price might surpass $100 in 2028. The highest price HYPE could attain that year is expected to be above $121. Will HyperLiquid reach $500? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, HyperLiquid may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will HyperLiquid reach $1000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, HyperLiquid is unlikely to reach $1000 before 2031. How high can HyperLiquid go? The highest expected price for HyperLiquid is $197.49, which it will achieve in 2031. Does HyperLiquid have a good long-term future? HyperLiquid is trading a bit lower than its December 2024 price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current price and a favorable future valuation of $197.49 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

HyperLiquid Historic Price Sentiment HyperLiquid price history The native token of HyperLiquid, called HYPE, was launched on November 29, 2024, through an airdrop targeted at a limited number of only 94,000 users. This was one of the most lucrative airdrops, with an average allocation of value of $45,000 to $50,000. HyperLiquid kept away from venture capitalists, who usually get most of the tokens in usual airdrops; rather, 76% of the supply was slated for user-centric initiatives. Usually, tokens dump after airdrops until the market momentum picks up, but HyperLiquid’s approach helped garner trust, and the token jumped from $4 to $35 from November 2024 to December 22, 2024. HyperLiquid’s market cap improved significantly during this period, reaching above $8 billion, as it received super positive market sentiment. In late December and early January 2025, the HYPE token corrected down to $20.24, shedding significant value as per crypto market data. Price stabilized through February as it traded in a range of $19.92 to $27.42 before taking a dive at the end of February. HYPE stumbled to $12.34 by mid-March, and it touched a low of $10.21 on April 7, 2025. The token saw nothing but improvement in the remainder of the month of April, and its price surged to $18.57 by the end of the month. In May 2025, HYPE keeps improving, trading near the range of $19.97 to $25.4, with space for further improvement.",Crypto Price Predictions|HYPE|Hyperliquid,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-16 09:35:00

What happened? And why does the company expect a $400M loss? Not three days after Coinbase became the first crypto company to enter the S&P 500 , it got hacked . Big time. The hackers bribed non-US (mainly India) Coinbase employees to hand over sensitive customer data (including names, dates of birth, and some banking information). They then asked the company for a $20M ransom to delete everything. What did Coinbase do? Well, what does the most influential US crypto company that safeguards most of the $122B Bitcoin ETF reserves do? It issued a $20M bounty for any information that leads to catching the cybercriminals, and promises to reimburse 100% of user losses, which are estimated to be in the range of $400 million. Still, the damage was done, and major cryptos fell like dominoes after the news hit the headlines. Ripple dropped by 6% , and Bitcoin is now $104K , down from $105K. This begs the question: is there a better way to safeguard your crypto? Yes, there is: non-custodial crypto wallets like Best Wallet . Read on to find out all the details of the Coinbase hack. Coinbase Hack: The What, How, Where, and Why The cybercrooks had what they thought to be an infallible, four-step process: Find employees and contractors based in India who had access to Coinbase’s outsourcing and support operations Bribe them to hand over customer data, expanding the database significantly over several months. Demand a ransom from Coinbase to delete the data or make it public if they don’t comply. Profit. Unfortunately for the hackers, less than 1% of Coinbase’s users were impacted. And the leaked information didn’t contain account passwords or, worse, seed phrases for the crypto holdings. So, in effect, the criminals’ leverage was paper-thin. Naturally, Coinbase did what Coinbase does – offer a guarantee to reimburse 100% of user losses and turn the $20M ransom against the hackers in the form of a bounty to catch them. Major cryptos (including some of the best altcoins ) lost some of their headwind the next day, on May 12. Bitcoin lost 3.96% (going from a daily high of $105,493 to $101,311) and Ethereum dumped by 3.9% (from $2,559 to $2,459). Overall, the total crypto market cap lost $100M following the Coinbase hack announcement. Although significant damage was done, things could have been a lot worse. Users could have had their seed phrases leaked, which would have put their assets at risk. And, depending on the potential extent of the losses ( the company estimates current losses at $400M ), Coinbase might not have been able to reimburse everything. The realization, I’m sure, leaves plenty to be desired from Coinbase clients and crypto exchange users. Which brings us to non-custodial crypto wallets, which are generally safer than custodial ones with exchanges, since you’re the one holding the keys. Best Wallet is one of the up-and-coming, which is currently undergoing a presale for the Best Wallet Token, its ecosystem token. Let’s see what that’s about. Own Your Crypto and Invest in Upcoming Presales with Best Wallet Best Wallet is an anonymous, non-custodial, and multi-chain crypto wallet that’s currently expanding its Web3 ecosystem. The best part about non-custodial wallets is that exchanges getting hacked, like it happened now with Coinbase or with Bybit and FTX in the past, will have zero impact on you. The wallet currently supports five blockchains: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Bitcoin, and Base. Support for over 60 chains is next on the roadmap, alongside advanced anti-fraud protection and the Best Card. Aside from that, you can buy, sell, swap, and stake crypto just like you would with other wallets like Metamask, Trustwallet, and Exodus. You also get cross-chain swaps and enhanced security from Fireblocks MPC (cloud backups). Best Wallet has been audited by Coinsult , and it has amassed over 63K followers on X . So, transparency, security, and community backing are all accounted for. You can gain further benefits, like reduced transaction fees and higher staking rewards, and chime in on development decisions by getting into the $BEST presale, which raised over $12M to date. The token is currently priced at $0.025035. So, $300 would get you 11,983 $BEST tokens, which you can stake for a 199% annual APY (35,829 tokens or $896 in one year). And consider that our $BEST price prediction sees $BEST increasing by 187% by the end of 2025 (from $0.025035 to $0.072). That could make your initial $300 worth $2,579 in less than seven months if you stake at the current APY. To buy Best Wallet Token , head to the presale site, connect your wallet (or use Best Wallet), and click ‘Buy.’ Simple, easy, and affordable. Are Non-Custodial Wallets the Future? The Coinbase hack isn’t the first or last crypto hack we’ll see. But it did happen to the most influential US crypto company, and the first crypto exchange to be listed on the S&P 500. So, while it does mean funds are still at risk if kept on exchanges, we don’t have to live with that. Best Wallet and Best Wallet Token are changing the narrative with self-custody and putting you in charge of your assets’ security. Non-custodial wallets could become the norm in a not-so-distant future if exchanges don’t shift their approach to security. Remember that investing in crypto presales is risky. The market is very volatile, and dumps can happen at a moment’s notice (like the Coinbase hack aftermath). Never invest more than you can afford, and always do your own research.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-16 09:35:47

In a recent YouTube broadcast , Celente, the founder of The Trends Journal , emphasized that the surge is being fueled not just by technical momentum, but also by deepening political alignment. “Everyone knows that we’ve been bullish on Bitcoin because the Trump team is all in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency field,” he said. “The prices are going to go up. All they’re interested in doing is making money.” Bitcoin is currently trading at $103,513, up 23% in the last month and more than 50% over the past year. The breakout past the six-figure threshold is not just a psychological milestone, it also signals broader macro conviction in Bitcoin’s role as a store of value, especially as global markets reassess risk and policy direction. Earlier this year, Celente pointed to the role of campaign financing in shaping Bitcoin’s trajectory. “ The Trump gang… gave him a lot of crypto . The crypto people gave him a lot of dough,” he stated in a prior episode of his show, suggesting that institutional players may be leveraging political alliances to create favorable regulatory headwinds. Celente weighs in on Gold Alongside Bitcoin, Celente remains optimistic about gold ’s performance. “Gold is up some 46 bucks as we go—$3,222 an ounce, down from its $3,500 high but still flying nice,” he said. “So we see it’s still going strong.” His thesis remains rooted in historical patterns: in periods of geopolitical uncertainty, de-dollarization, and distrust in centralized institutions, capital often rotates into hard and alternative assets. However, Celente’s optimism doesn’t extend across all markets. He continues to sound the alarm on the speculative frenzy surrounding AI equities, particularly those like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which have been driving the narrative around artificial intelligence’s market potential. “Nvidia stock is going back up because of the deal they just did over the Middle East with the Trump team,” Celente noted. “But we still say there’s going to be a dot-com bust, and China is going to lead the world in the AI development.” He has warned for some time now that the AI rally echoes the late-1990s dot-com bubble , marked by hype-driven valuations with insufficient fundamental grounding. While short-term catalysts like geopolitical partnerships and regional investment deals may buoy specific names, suggesting that the broader AI sector remains vulnerable to a sharp correction, especially as global competition intensifies.

While XRP continues to build on years of exposure and institutional speculation, MUTM is still trading at just $0.025, with a market presence that’s growing by the day. This early entry point — combined with a structured presale, real on-chain use cases, and a revenue model tied directly to lending activity — is what’s positioning Mutuum as the next big cryptocurrency to keep an eye on before it gains full market attention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance has already raised over $8.5 million, and the presale is now over 82% through Phase 4, with the next round set to increase the token’s price by 20% to $0.03. Nearly 9,850 holders have already joined the project, indicating growing support even before public exchange listings begin. Unlike many projects that lean heavily on marketing without delivering features, Mutuum has outlined a clear roadmap backed by transparent mechanics. The platform is designed to allow users to borrow and lend digital assets in a fully decentralized environment — without having to sell their holdings to unlock liquidity. At the core of Mutuum’s appeal is its real-yield approach. When borrowers use the protocol, a portion of the interest they pay is used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens are then redistributed to active participants, ensuring demand is linked to actual platform usage — not speculative inflation. This system also benefits those who deposit assets. Users receive mtTokens, which reflect their position within the protocol and increase in value as platform activity grows. It’s a feedback loop based on real economic activity — something rarely found in tokens at this price level. One of the platform’s key risk-management features is its Loan-to-Value (LTV) system. Each supported asset is assigned a specific LTV ratio that determines how much liquidity a borrower can access based on the collateral provided. This ensures the system remains stable and that overleveraged positions can’t distort the market. At the same time, lenders earn APY (Annual Percentage Yield) that shifts in real time, adapting to current borrowing demand within the protocol. If the borrowing pool becomes heavily utilized, yields rise, creating stronger incentives for depositors. This mechanism supports long-term protocol health and gives users meaningful returns based on actual activity — not temporary incentives. Adding to investor confidence, the team behind Mutuum Finance has confirmed that a beta version of the platform will launch at the same time the token is listed. That means users won’t have to wait months to engage with core features like lending, borrowing, or future stablecoin functionality. This launch-ready approach contrasts with many presale projects that go live without a usable product. For investors asking what crypto to invest in, this immediate access is a rare advantage. MUTM’s official listing price is set at $0.06, which is over twice the current presale value. But analysts believe that’s just a starting point. With working mechanics, treasury-backed token demand, and strong early adoption, projections suggest a move toward $1 and beyond over the long term is realistic. The real upside, however, lies in getting in before exposure drives prices out of reach. Let’s consider an example: A crypto investment of $4,000 at the current price of $0.025 positions the buyer for serious upside potential. When MUTM reaches $0.50, that position would be worth $80,000 — a 1,900% increase, driven not by hype but by infrastructure and token utility. As XRP enjoys another wave of interest at higher price levels, many investors are rebalancing their portfolios toward under-the-radar tokens that offer room to grow. For those scanning the space for the best cryptocurrency to invest in before price discovery, MUTM is emerging as a clear contender. The presale window is narrowing fast. Phase 5 is on the way, and once public trading begins, the narrative — and the price — could shift quickly. Mutuum Finance remains one of the top crypto options under $0.03 — though that opportunity is quickly fading.

If so, you’re likely familiar with the challenges high gas fees and network congestion can present. But big news is here! A significant Ethereum upgrade has just rolled out, promising to shake things up in a major way. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a development poised to impact everything from simple token swaps to complex DeFi strategies. For years, the Ethereum network has been the backbone of much of the DeFi ecosystem. Its smart contract capabilities enabled groundbreaking applications, but success brought scalability issues. High demand often translated into exorbitant gas fees , making smaller crypto transactions impractical for many users. This latest upgrade aims directly at these pain points, leveraging advancements in blockchain technology to create a more efficient and cost-effective network. What Does This Ethereum Upgrade Actually Do? At its core, this Ethereum upgrade introduces several key changes designed to improve scalability and reduce costs. While the technical details can get quite complex, the main takeaway is the implementation of ‘proto-danksharding’ (specifically, EIP-4844). This might sound technical, but think of it as a way for the network to handle and store data more efficiently. Here’s a simplified look at the core mechanics and benefits: Data Blobs: The upgrade introduces ‘blobs’ of data that can be attached to blocks. These blobs are separate from the main transaction data and are cheaper to process and store temporarily. Reduced Gas Fees: By offloading data into these cheaper blobs, layer-2 solutions (like rollups) can significantly reduce their operational costs. This cost saving is then passed down to the end-users in the form of much lower gas fees for transactions on these layer-2 networks. Increased Throughput Potential: While not full sharding, proto-danksharding lays the groundwork for future scalability improvements, allowing the network to handle a higher volume of data over time. Enhanced Blockchain Technology: This represents a significant evolution in Ethereum’s underlying blockchain technology , moving it closer to its long-term vision of a highly scalable and decentralized network. The primary impact is expected to be felt most strongly by users interacting with layer-2 DeFi protocols . These networks aggregate transactions off-chain and then post bundled data back to Ethereum. With cheaper data blobs, the cost of this bundling process plummets, leading to dramatically lower fees for layer-2 users. How Will This Affect Your Favorite DeFi Protocols? This is where the rubber meets the road for many users. Since a vast majority of popular DeFi protocols were originally built on or have expanded to Ethereum and its layer-2 networks, this upgrade has direct implications for how you use them. Think about activities like: Swapping tokens on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Providing liquidity to pools. Lending or borrowing assets. Minting or trading NFTs. Interacting with yield farming strategies. For users on layer-2 networks like Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, and Polygon zkEVM, the expectation is a noticeable reduction in the cost of performing these crypto transactions . This could make DeFi more accessible, especially for users with smaller amounts of capital, who were previously priced out by high fees on the Ethereum mainnet. While the direct impact on mainnet gas fees might be less immediate or dramatic compared to layer-2s, the overall increased efficiency and reduced congestion could have positive ripple effects across the entire ecosystem. Addressing Gas Fees: Is This the End of High Costs? The perennial problem of high gas fees has been a major hurdle for Ethereum’s mass adoption. This Ethereum upgrade is perhaps the most significant step taken so far to tackle this head-on, particularly for layer-2 users. Let’s be realistic: It might not be the absolute end of variable fees on Ethereum mainnet during peak congestion times. However, by drastically reducing the cost basis for layer-2s, the upgrade incentivizes more activity to move onto these scaling solutions. As more users and protocols migrate or expand to layer-2s, the load on the mainnet decreases, which could indirectly help stabilize or lower mainnet fees over time. The focus on data blobs is a clever way to reduce the most expensive part of layer-2 operations – posting transaction data back to Ethereum. This targeted approach is expected to deliver substantial savings, making frequent interactions with DeFi protocols much more affordable. The Future of Blockchain Technology and Crypto Transactions This Ethereum upgrade isn’t just about lower fees; it’s a crucial step in the evolution of blockchain technology itself. It demonstrates the network’s ability to adapt and implement complex changes to meet the growing demands of the decentralized world. The success of proto-danksharding sets the stage for future scaling upgrades, potentially leading to full sharding down the line. This phased approach allows the ecosystem to gradually adapt while continuously improving performance.

Yet, according to Jason Guthrie, head of product at asset manager WisdomTree, this lack of flash may actually signal a more mature and sustainable phase for the industry. Speaking at Consensus, Guthrie emphasized that despite the market’s strength, “there hasn’t been a really frothy use case that has typically driven these market cycles previously.” Instead, he pointed to the steady growth of blockchain-based companies and consistent innovation as healthier signs of progress than speculative fads. A New Type of Crypto Cycle Past bull runs have often been tied to explosive but short-lived trends. The 2017 ICO boom raised $4.9 billion, skyrocketing to $33.4 billion in 2018 before collapsing the following year. Similarly, the NFT frenzy saw its peak in 2022 , reaching $57.2 billion in trading volume and over 121 million sales. Both trends have since cooled considerably, with little lasting infrastructure built from the hype. “This time, we’ve continued to see the asset class gathering value,” Guthrie noted, highlighting growing client bases, increasing revenues, and long-term innovation. “We’re still healthy without one of those drivers — and that’s a really good sign.” The crypto market hit an all-time high capitalization of $3.71 trillion on December 9 last year, with several cryptocurrencies gaining significant value. However, this milestone wasn’t powered by speculative trends, but rather broader institutional and governmental interest — including treasuries like GameStop and possibly Ukraine exploring crypto adoption. Memecoins Still Flicker, but Fizzle Fast Although memecoins have remained a headline-grabbing element of the space, Guthrie believes they are less influential than before. A brief surge followed the January 18 launch of Donald Trump’s memecoin, with Pump.fun logging $3.3 billion in weekly trading volume. But the excitement faded quickly after numerous rug pulls — including the widely publicized collapse of Libra (LIBRA) — shook investor confidence. “There’s still a lot of innovation to do,” Guthrie concluded. “But the market feels more mature now — and that’s key for long-term sustainability.” The post Crypto Market Shows Signs of Maturity Amid Subdued Hype: WisdomTree Exec appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Market News|Crypto 2025|Crypto Market,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'The Coin Rise', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecoinrise,2025-05-16 09:44:54

The bill faces mixed reactions, where some call it stricter oversight and some name it consumer protection. After months of uncertainty and repeated delays, the U.S. Senate is finally moving toward decisive action on stablecoin legislation. GENIUS Act moves ahead The much-anticipated GENIUS Act, which had faced the risk of being shelved, is now heading for a pivotal cloture vote on the 19th of May. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, formally set the process in motion, signaling a critical step forward in shaping the country’s approach to stablecoin oversight. The renewed momentum has reignited national attention. Journalist Eleanor Terrett confirmed the official vote timeline in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), where she said , “[John Thune] has filed cloture on the GENIUS Act again with a vote scheduled for Monday evening.” Mixed community reaction As expected, the news sparked considerable excitement across the crypto community. For instance, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand acknowledged the positive response, noting the strong support for the Senate’s move. “I believe it is essential to the future of the U.S. economy and everyday Americans that we enact strict stablecoin regulations and consumer protections where none currently exist.” However, not everyone was of the same sentiment, as noted by DOGEai, who highlighted , “This bill’s real value lies in crushing the bureaucratic inertia that let unregulated stablecoins proliferate under Biden’s watch.” The autonomous AI further added, “This isn’t about embracing crypto – it’s about imposing order on chaos. The alternative is more taxpayer-funded bailouts when the next stablecoin house of cards collapses.” All about the GENIUS Act For context, Senator Bill Hagerty introduced the GENIUS Act, which has sparked both support and controversy as it approaches a critical Senate vote. The bill establishes a clear regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers in the U.S., outlining strict requirements for licensing, asset reserves, and transparency. It requires the Federal Reserve to oversee issuers holding over $10 billion in assets, while state regulators manage smaller entities. Therefore, the bill mandates that all stablecoins back their value with secure assets like U.S. dollars or Treasury bills. Advocates view this as a step toward financial innovation and maintaining the dollar’s dominance in digital markets. However, critics, such as Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley, have already condemned it as enabling what they call Trump’s “corrupt crypto empire.” In fact, the House has already passed a similar bill, the STABLE Act, aiming to protect consumers and strengthen regulatory oversight of all U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins, including major tokens like USDT and USDC. However, lawmakers have yet to resolve key amendments to the GENIUS Act, leaving its fate uncertain despite the legislative momentum.",News|News 1|Social|Stablecoins|Trading View|ambcrypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT|USDC,"{'name': 'AMB Crypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/ambcrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",ambcrypto,2025-05-16 09:45:12

If so, you’ve likely heard the buzz around the Solana ecosystem . Once a dark horse, Solana has rapidly emerged as a major player, challenging established blockchains with its innovative technology and burgeoning network of decentralized applications (dApps). But what exactly is driving this rapid expansion, and what does it mean for investors and users? What Makes the Solana Ecosystem Stand Out? At the heart of Solana’s success is its unique approach to blockchain scalability . Traditional blockchains often struggle with slow transaction speeds and high costs, especially under heavy load. Solana addresses this through several key innovations: Proof of History (PoH): This is a core innovation that creates a historical record of events, allowing for synchronized and efficient ordering of transactions without needing every node to agree in real-time. Tower BFT: A Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism optimized by PoH, enabling faster agreement among validators. Gulf Stream: A mempool-less transaction forwarding protocol that allows transactions to be processed before the next block is finalized. Sealevel: A parallel smart contracts runtime that allows for multiple smart contracts to execute concurrently. These technologies combine to give Solana a theoretical throughput of tens of thousands of transactions per second (TPS) with incredibly low transaction fees, a stark contrast to the congestion issues faced by some competitors. This high performance is a magnet for developers looking to build fast, low-cost applications. Exploring Key Solana dApps and Sectors The true measure of a blockchain’s health is the activity on its network. The Solana ecosystem is now home to a diverse and growing range of dApps across various sectors: Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): Platforms like Serum (though its future is uncertain post-FTX) and newer ones like Raydium and Orca have facilitated billions in trading volume, offering fast swaps and liquidity provision. Lending and Borrowing: Protocols such as Solend and Marginfi allow users to earn yield on their crypto assets or borrow against them. Liquid Staking: Services like Lido on Solana enable users to stake their SOL while receiving a liquid token (stSOL) that can be used in other DeFi protocols. NFTs and Gaming: Solana has become a popular chain for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) due to its low minting costs and fast transactions. Marketplaces like Magic Eden have seen significant volume. Web3 gaming projects are increasingly choosing Solana for its performance, allowing for more dynamic and complex in-game economies. Other Notable Areas: Decentralized Social Media Supply Chain Management Data Storage This expanding landscape of Solana dApps provides users with numerous opportunities to engage with decentralized technology, from trading and investing to gaming and collecting digital art. What’s Happening with the SOL Price? The performance of the native token, SOL price , is often seen as a reflection of the ecosystem’s health and future potential. SOL has experienced significant volatility, characteristic of the crypto market. It saw an astronomical rise during the 2021 bull run, driven by growing adoption and developer interest. However, it also faced sharp declines, notably impacted by the broader market downturns and specific events like the collapse of FTX, which had close ties to the Solana ecosystem. Currently, the SOL price is influenced by several factors: Factor Impact on SOL Price Overall Crypto Market Sentiment Major driver; bull markets tend to lift SOL, bear markets push it down. Growth of Solana Ecosystem (TVL, User Count) Positive; indicates utility and adoption. Network Performance and Stability Crucial; outages or bugs can negatively impact confidence and price. New dApp Launches and Innovation Positive; attracts users and capital. Regulatory News Can introduce uncertainty or positive clarity. While past performance is not indicative of future results, the underlying strength of the Solana ecosystem and its continued development are key considerations for anyone watching the SOL price . Challenges and Criticisms: Is Solana Unstoppable? Despite its impressive growth and technological prowess, Solana is not without its challenges and criticisms. A significant concern has been network stability. Solana has experienced several network outages or slowdowns, which can disrupt dApp usage and raise questions about its reliability compared to more battle-tested chains. Other points of discussion include: Centralization Concerns: Critics argue that the high hardware requirements for running a validator node lead to a more centralized network compared to others. Tokenomics: The distribution and inflation schedule of SOL have been points of analysis and debate within the community. Competition: The layer-1 blockchain space is fiercely competitive, with Ethereum (especially after its move to Proof of Stake), Polygon, Avalanche, and others constantly innovating. Addressing these issues is crucial for Solana’s long-term success and its ability to maintain its position as a leader in blockchain scalability and decentralized applications. Actionable Insights for Engaging with the Solana Ecosystem Interested in getting involved? Here are a few actionable insights: Do Your Research: Before investing in SOL or using any Solana dApps , thoroughly research the project, its team, and its tokenomics. Start Small: If you’re new to the ecosystem, begin with small amounts of capital to get comfortable with wallets (like Phantom or Solflare) and transaction processes. Explore DeFi Opportunities: Look into staking SOL for yield or providing liquidity on DEXs, but be aware of impermanent loss risks. Monitor Network Health: Stay informed about any network updates or potential stability issues. Understand the Risks: The crypto market is highly volatile. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Engaging with decentralized finance and other applications on Solana offers exciting possibilities, but diligence is key. The Future of the Solana Ecosystem The journey of the Solana ecosystem has been a roller coaster, marked by rapid innovation, significant adoption, and notable challenges. Its focus on blockchain scalability has attracted a vibrant community of developers and users, leading to an explosive growth in Solana dApps and influencing the SOL price . While hurdles remain, particularly regarding network stability and centralization, the ongoing development efforts and the potential for high-performance decentralized finance continue to position Solana as a blockchain platform to watch closely. Whether it can overcome its challenges and solidify its place among the top blockchains will depend on continued innovation, community support, and robust infrastructure development.

You get CoinFerenceX Dubai. On April 28, 2025, Dubai became the epicenter of a global shift. More than 2,500 founders, investors, creators, and rebels came together for something the industry had never seen before: a summit built by the community, for the community . No sponsored stages. No fluff. No hierarchy. Just raw conversations, real products, and a collective mission — to decentralize the summit of the decentralized world. Backed by Visionaries. Built with Purpose. This movement was fueled by the boldest players in Web3 — each one shaping the future in their own right: DecentDAO launched a platform to “tokenize everything” — a no-code, end-to-end stack that makes launching DAOs and tokens as easy as signing a transaction. With $DCNT at its core, Decent is rewriting the rules of on-chain entrepreneurship. Trustwise Bank is architecting the bridge between TradFi and Web3. With Swiss-grade security, compliant rails, and digital custody, Trustwise is what decentralized finance has been waiting for: infrastructure you can trust. Whale isn’t building games. They’re building an entire financial playground . From decentralized lotteries to immersive on-chain entertainment, Whale is where gaming meets DeFi’s future. M5DEX redefined what decentralized derivatives can be — offering pro-grade perpetuals with up to 100x leverage , deep liquidity, and self-custody, minus the CEX baggage. Intelchain merged AI + Blockchain + Big Data into a powerful new layer of decentralized intelligence. From autonomous dApps to DePIN systems, this is the frontier of smart, scalable infrastructure. Kaanch Network brought the muscle. A blazing-fast Layer 1 clocking 1.4 million TPS , 3,600+ validators, and 0.8s finality — tailor-made for RWA, DeFi, and Web3 scale. BrandPR is a leading PR and growth agency in Web3, helping protocols and founders shape narrative, build presence, and scale visibility across global markets.

In a dramatic comeback, with his name lighting up the LED boards during El Clásico, Hamaha celebrated his victory among eight elite traders. WhiteBIT, Europe’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by traffic and an official cryptocurrency partner of FC Barcelona, successfully hosted the first-ever International Crypto Trading Cup (ICTC 2025) on May 9-10. This global live-streamed tournament signified a major milestone toward establishing crypto trading as a competitive, spectator-worthy discipline on par with traditional esports. Max Hamaha grabbed the trophy after erasing his losses in a dramatic return. | Source: WhiteBIT This two-day event brought together eight of the world’s top crypto traders from across the globe to compete in real time on stage. Trading for six hours each day—twelve hours in total—they executed 269 trades, providing unprecedented insight into advanced trading strategies, risk management, and decision-making under pressure. Beyond the main stage, ICTC 2025 featured a total of 33 squads, the largest two with 369 and 298 members, and around 3,000 individual traders from around the world. Max Hamaha claimed victory after a dramatic comeback Ukrainian Max Hamaha emerged as the first-ever ICTC Champion after starting day one at the bottom of the rankings. His bold comeback on day two—driven by a high conviction long position on Ethereum—earned him a rPNL of 7,488.84 USDT and the top spot. He executed 47 total trades, the second-highest count in the competition, just behind Muslim Abdullayev (Mus_money_) from Kazakhstan, who made 49. Max shared: “Trading live on stage was an incredibly exciting experience—more intense and way more fun than trading at home. I had to adjust my usual approach to fit the tournament rules, but I still focused on active intraday trading with high leverage.” Max further said that he felt confident throughout, though the final minutes got nerve-wracking as others went all-in. He added “WhiteBIT is setting a new trend—competitive trading could easily go mainstream like esports. In a few years, I can see crypto trading tournaments rivaling Dota 2.” Max was joined on the podium by Dutch Merlijn The Trader with rPNL 6,745.96 USDT in second place, and another Ukrainian, Eugene Loza (EXCAVO) with rPNL 4,098.90 USDT in third. Meanwhile, Malik Roth Klindt Jensen (Coinvo) achieved the tournament’s single largest gain—a sharp 12,249 USDT profit on an ETH_PERP position. The tournament’s largest single loss, also on the ETH_PERP pair, totaled -10,725 USDT, underscoring the high-risk nature of trading. While traders did not use their personal funds, each was allocated 50,000 USDTB—WhiteBIT’s internal asset for futures trading—creating a powerful educational experience. ICTC winner takes the spotlight at El Clásico A highlight moment came when Hamaha’s name lit up the LED boards during El Clásico—the biggest football match between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid—marking the first time in history a trading competition winner was featured during one of the world’s most-watched sporting events. Beyond the competition, ICTC offered a rare look into professional trading techniques, as participants shared live screens and walked through their setups and decisions. One of ICTC’s hosts and market technician Marc Principato noted the educational value of seeing trades executed in real time: “The competition highlighted diverse trading styles, including standout performances such as Mauro Ciami’s aggressive ‘go big or go home’ strategy that dominated day one, and Merlin and Excavo’s high-risk overnight positions that paid off significantly on day two.” Mark added: “The lessons learned in this one of a kind event are priceless for aspiring and experienced traders alike. Putting your reputation on the line and showing the world your secrets is not something most professional traders are willing to do so watch carefully and take notes. From higher probability patterns to mean reversion tactics, you will come away with practical knowledge that you can incorporate into your own style now.” Speaking on the success of the inaugural event, Volodymyr Nosov, Founder and President of WhiteBIT Group, said: “With this tournament, we’re pioneering a new frontier. This is not just about trading—it’s about building community, sharing knowledge, and accelerating global adoption of blockchain. We’re building the infrastructure for the future. ICTC 2025 was a first step to understand what works, what our traders and audience want, and where we can go from here. Our goal is to make this a recurring, global event—bigger and better with each edition.” What’s next: ICTC 2026 registration is open WhiteBIT is already preparing for the next chapter. Registration for ICTC 2026 is now open, inviting new and experienced traders worldwide to compete, connect, and make history. As the lines continue to blur between finance, technology, and entertainment, ICTC 2025 stands as a clear signal of where the future of crypto trading is headed—interactive, competitive, and globally accessible.

With Japan offering clear regulatory support, this strategic alliance could become the biggest growth catalyst for XRP globally. Ripple and SBI Holdings: A Powerful Alliance SBI Holdings is Ripple’s biggest external stakeholder. SBI Remit , Japan’s largest money transfer company, already uses RippleNet for cross-border payments. SBI VC Trade , a regulated crypto exchange in Japan, provides both retail and institutional investors with direct access to XRP trading . SBI’s CEO, Yoshitaka Kitao , is a strong supporter of XRP. He has consistently praised XRP as the best digital asset for payments , reinforcing the company’s commitment to Ripple’s technology. SBI’s Plan to Make XRP the Default Bridge Currency A recent post on X by GA Spark revealed that SBI is considering using XRP as the default bridge currency in its payment systems. This move could drastically reduce transaction costs and settlement times across the banking and financial sector. Notably, the SBI Remit-RippleNet corridor already handles billions in remittance volume , and this new shift could accelerate XRP’s integration further. XRP Benefits from Japan’s Crypto-Friendly Regulations Unlike the U.S., Japan offers clear regulatory classification for XRP , recognizing it as a crypto asset —not a security. This eliminates legal uncertainty and creates a stable environment for companies like Ripple and SBI to build XRP-based solutions. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction: Expert Says ‘This Could Be the Next Bitcoin’ , Ripple-SBI Partnership Could Fuel XRP’s Global Expansion Crypto analysts, including GA Spark, believe that SBI is quietly laying the foundation for large-scale XRP utility across Asia.

The memecoin may be quietly setting the stage for a bear trap. Dogecoin [DOGE] is barking back into the spotlight. After soaring to a three-month high of $0.259 on the 11th of May, it’s pulled back nearly 14% in under a week, drawing attention from opportunistic traders. Over $14.17 million in long liquidations suggests bears are currently in control, aggressively hunting overleveraged longs. Still, the sharp correction may signal more than just weakness. Zooming in, this swift drawdown could be a classic bear trap setup as DOGE reloads for its next volatility spike. From bark to bite: DOGE shakes out the weak hands DOGE’s sharp double-digit pullback comes down to a mix of macro headwinds and on-chain dynamics. At the macro level, risk capital is playing musical chairs, flowing back into stocks and putting crypto in a “pause and digest” mode. Meanwhile, Bitcoin [BTC] is stuck in a tight range, keeping DOGE on a short leash. As AMBCrypto notes, this is a classic choppy setup. But where there’s volatility, there’s opportunity, and traders seem to be playing right along. On the 14th of May, DOGE’s new address count surged to 311,811, a six-month high, signaling renewed retail interest amid the shakeout. Source: Glassnode Additionally, Ali Martinez adds that DOGE’s structural demand remains rock solid, reinforcing AMBCrypto’s thesis: The memecoin still has plenty of bite despite the recent dip. Market psychology matters here. With conviction this strong, a retest of the $0.20 support looks off the table. Once macro FUD calms down, DOGE is primed to charge back toward $0.30, with FOMO ready to kick in and ignite a fresh rally. Bears on thin ice According to Coinglass, DOGE’s Open Interest (OI) ripped to $3.70 billion after reclaiming the $0.25 mark — levels last seen in early January. But less than a week later, OI bled out $1.05 billion, pointing to a textbook deleveraging event , putting pressure on DOGE’s short-term supply. Still, Binance’s DOGE/USDT order book reveals 75.8% long account dominance, signaling that bulls are reloading rather than retreating. On the flip side, aggregated exchange data reflects 52.51% short dominance — a classic overcrowded bearish positioning. Source: Coinglass This skew mirrors broader market FUD. However, if sentiment snaps bullish, it sets up the perfect storm for a short squeeze — with DOGE primed to capitalize on a bear trap rebound. Consequently, Dogecoin’s next move could catch everyone off guard — turning recent shakeouts into serious shake-ups. The current dip? Think of it as a golden entry point, with $0.30 firmly back on investors’ radar.",Dogecoin|Memecoins|News|News 1|Social|Trading View|ambcrypto,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'AMB Crypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/ambcrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",ambcrypto,2025-05-16 10:00:10

The hype burned bright and fast—memecoins and NFTs once powered crypto, stealing the spotlight in this realm. But, like a car running dry, the speculative fuel driving these cryptocurrencies has burned out. Could tokenized real-world assets take their place? In short, yes. As memecoins lose appeal and NFTs cool off, there is a vacuum in crypto for more grounded, plausible innovations—those that rethink value and link crypto to the real world. RWA will fill this space. You might also like: Transitioning to a divine economy: A vision for a new civilization | Opinion Even Solana ( SOL ), once a memecoin hotspot, is now quietly pivoting toward utility—with tokenized funds, debit cards, and institutional infrastructure like ETFs and RWAs onboarding becoming the new foundation beneath its playful surface. It’s a quieter force, yet one which is transformative: backed by intrinsic value, compatible with regulation, stable. The crypto is also powerful enough to extend beyond tech, linking to the real economy through tangible assets. This gives it the potential to drive the next wave of crypto adoption, quite literally making 2025 the year crypto got real. Powering crypto’s growth: Why RWAs? Memecoins are humorous, but they are also speculative digital assets that can swing wildly and lack intrinsic value. In contrast, we are seeing a shift in the crypto ecosystem away from flashy trends towards RWAs. They flip the playing field, and the reasons behind that are numerous. Real-world applications. As the name suggests, RWAs connect crypto to the real world; they embed physical value onto blockchains. Representing tangible assets—think real estate, infrastructure, commodities, or even records of deals—they ground crypto and connect it to the living, breathing economy. Tokenization will reach $2 trillion by 2030 , driven by stocks, real estate, bonds, and gold. Backed by intrinsic value. RWAs are physical, not just digital or speculative, assets. Their value is tied to these effects, making them more attractive in uncertain times. Familiar and stable. The crypto market can be highly volatile. RWAs, however, offer familiarity, stability, and regulatory compatibility. This promises to drive adoption amongst institutional investors. Changes across the RWA field We’re not the only ones taking note of the potential RWAs pose: major players are already experimenting with tokenizing assets, including firms like HSBC, Bank of America, and Visa. The range of these assets is in itself striking—U.S. Treasury bonds, commercial real estate, and carbon credits are all included in tokenization projects. The pull of RWAs is clear for all to see: improved liquidity in markets that have traditionally been opaque or illiquid, fractional ownership, and 24/7 trading. Secure RWA tokenization is made increasingly feasible by emerging blockchain infrastructure, like compliant smart contracts and decentralized oracles. Similarly, rapid changes are being made to regulatory frameworks worldwide, from the U.S. to the Middle East; this is providing clearer guidelines for asset-backed tokens in many jurisdictions. All of this means that change in the RWA sphere is happening widely and at pace. The tech is evolving in another direction still, towards democratizing developmental and environmental goals. Tokenized RWAs have the potential to transparently fund critical areas, such as affordable housing, agriculture, green infrastructure, and global development. This means that RWAs aren’t expected to be exclusive, but could have wider benefits. Agriculture stands out as a truly global industry—every nation, regardless of political or economic stance, participates in food production and trade. Tokenized RWAs in this space can streamline cross-border transactions and ultimately strengthen the global food supply chain. Looking forward: Hurdles faced by RWAs RWAs are emerging as a serious contender to drive the next wave of crypto adoption, marking a cultural and strategic shift in crypto from hype-driven speculation to down-to-earth, utility-focused applications. That’s not to say that there are no challenges in adopting RWAs. Legal uncertainty, valuation accuracy, and the need for cross-chain interoperability are all issues that must be resolved for the tech to be more widely accepted. RWAs also suffer from limitations in the ability to pair fiat into RWA products. Despite these hurdles, there’s no denying the fact that RWAs represent a seriously credible alternative to current cryptocurrencies. They offer a path for crypto to reconnect with real economic value and mainstream adoption, and it’s clear that major players are choosing this route. This is crypto’s grown-up phase As flashy trends fade, RWAs may become the foundation of a more mature, impactful crypto ecosystem. The crucial marker of RWAs is their ability to embed physical value onto blockchains—real estate, commodities, energy, infrastructure—giving RWAs massive leverage because they link crypto to things people can touch, measure, and regulate. The days of hype-first products are numbered. Useful, valuable, and understandable applications will drive the next wave of crypto adoption. RWAs offer exactly that—real utility tied to the real world. In the end, it’s not about turning everything into a token. It’s about turning the right things into tokens—and helping them move smarter, faster, and more freely than ever before.

The SEC and Ripple’s jointly submitted $50 million settlement request was rejected by Judge Analisa Torres on procedural grounds. While the rejection of the agreement request by the US judge raises questions about the legal status of XRP, Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty made an assessment of the decision. Stating that Judge Analisa Torres’ rejection decision will not affect the legal status of XRP, Ripple CLO said that the July 2023 decision that XRP is not a security is still valid. “Today's decision does not change Ripple's earnings (i.e., that XRP is not a security, etc.).” Despite the rejection from the court, he emphasized that Ripple and the SEC's agreement on the sale of XRP to the public is valid and they are still in harmony in resolving the matter. Stating that the court’s rejection decision was procedural, Ripple CLO said: “Ripple and the SEC fully agree to resolve this case and will revisit this matter with the court.” *This is not investment advice.

In a May 15 post on X, Euler Labs confirmed that sBUIDL, a token backed 1:1 by BlackRock’s BUIDL and issued by Securitize, is now live on the Euler protocol. This marks sBUIDL’s first direct integration with DeFi. The integration was curated by Re7 Labs and is live on Avalanche ( AVAX ). Users can now use sBUIDL as collateral to borrow USD Coin ( USDC ) or AUSD, while also earning AVAX incentives. 1/ A historic first in DeFi. BlackRock-backed sBUIDL, issued by @Securitize , is now live on Euler. It's sBUIDL's first ever direct DeFi integration. Curated by @Re7Labs on @Avax . pic.twitter.com/B7tTuGzqHL — Euler Labs (@eulerfinance) May 15, 2025 Euler, often described as a “lending super app,” gives institutions the tools to launch custom lending markets with full control over parameters like collateral requirements, liquidation settings, and access permissions. Euler’s modular architecture enables builders to combine various components to create new lending products, in contrast to traditional DeFi protocols that adhere to fixed models. Permitted markets, synthetic asset structures, and fixed-term loans are all supported by this flexibility. You might also like: BlackRock’s BUIDL surpasses $2.1 AUM on Ethereum, as risk-off sentiment rises Since its launch, Euler has drawn deposits totaling more than $900 million. The platform’s strength is its ability to support complex lending strategies, even though yield is still a major product drawing in users. Its design allows different vaults to interact seamlessly using the ERC4626 standard and Ethereum Vault Connector, creating a highly liquid network. Launched in March 2024, BlackRock’s BUIDL fund has rapidly expanded to $2.8 billion in assets, as per rwa.xyz data . The fund makes investments in U.S. Treasury bills, cash, and repos to maintain a steady $1 per token while paying dividends every day. It now spans several blockchains, including Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), and Arbitrum ( ARB ). Despite its size, BUIDL’s holder base remains small, with just 73 wallets as of recent data. But its entry into DeFi points to a growing movement to connect on-chain apps with traditional finance. The sBUIDL integration pushes DeFi toward greater institutional adoption by bringing real-world assets into lending and providing a new use case for BlackRock-backed assets in decentralized markets.

That said, the inverse of this is also true. Bitcoin continues to balk at the $104,000 resistance, and this has had the effect of putting the dampers on the rest of the market. Do memecoins $PEPE, $BONK, and $WIF still have a rally left in them? Signs are that $PEPE could be about to roll over Source: TradingView $PEPE was not only the leading memecoin over the previous week, but also the highest percentage climber for just about any of the top 100 cryptocurrencies. That said, the $PEPE price has come up against solid resistance. The current weekly candle has stopped short of the 0.382 Fibonacci level and is shaping to leave a longish wick to the upside, unless the bulls can do something about this over Friday and the weekend. Even if the bulls can turn the current weekly candle positive, the major horizontal resistance at $0.00001600 still remains an important barrier to upside continuation. Finally, the Stochastic RSI indicators are getting back to the top. If they start rolling over before $PEPE is able to surpass the all-time high, this whole rally could be a failed one. $BONK bulls must break back above major ascending trendline Source: TradingView The $BONK price has followed a nice rally thus far, with three higher highs and likely another higher low for this week. However, the price has run into the major horizontal resistance at $0.000025 and has been soundly rejected. The rejection has also taken the price below the bull market ascending trendline, but it is currently holding the strong horizontal support. Source: TradingView The weekly time frame gives a clear picture, and shows the importance of the bulls breaking through the ascending trendline. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart is showing that unless some kind of catalyst arrives soon, the indicators could roll over and head back down, potentially putting paid to any decent upside for the next few weeks. The writing may be on the wall for $WIF Source: TradingView $WIF is in a similar predicament. A good upside surge has come into heavy resistance levels and is looking like being rejected. Yes, there is the possibility that the Stochastic RSI indicators chop along the top for a while, but if a Bitcoin breakout does not happen over this weekend, the writing is probably on the wall for $WIF, and the next potential rally might have to wait several weeks for the Stochastic RSI to reset. Keep your eyes on Bitcoin (BTC) Finally, if Bitcoin (BTC) does succeed in breaking through its $104,000 major horizontal resistance, and goes on to surpass the all-time high, all bets are off. Memecoins would undoubtedly surge in this scenario. Bitcoin is definitely the one to watch. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

A person familiar with the matter said the attackers had constant access by bribing customer service representatives, eventually demanding a $20 million ransom. Culprits Bribed Foreign-Based Support Staff According to a Bloomberg report , the perpetrators targeted employees and contractors based outside the United States who were part of Coinbase’s business process outsourcing operations. By paying off a small group of insiders, they were able to get sensitive user information. The stolen data included names, birth dates, addresses, government-issued ID numbers, banking details, account balances, and creation dates. This information could be used to impersonate either Coinbase or its customers and potentially access other financial accounts. “It’s a major breach, the amount of personal information shared is staggering,” said Mike Dudas, managing partner at web3 firm 6MV and a victim of the attack. The source claimed that the hackers had access to user data since January, but Coinbase Chief Security Officer Philip Martin disputed this. He explained that once the firm was aware of the information sharing, permission was revoked, hence the culprits did not have constant access throughout the period. However, he acknowledged that there were multiple bribery incidents, with Coinbase first detecting signs of suspicious activity from the support agents months before the May 11 ransom demand. Following this, the implicated agents were immediately quarantined and fired. Details From the Breach The exchange disclosed the situation to the public in a Thursday announcement. In a blog post, it revealed that less than 1% of monthly transacting users were affected by the incident. The attackers aimed to build a list of customers to impersonate Coinbase and trick users into handing over their crypto assets. When the $20 million ransom demand was rejected, the bad actors increased their extortion attempts. The company clarified that login credentials, private keys, and Prime accounts were not compromised, and no customer wallets were accessed. In response to the breach, Coinbase has said it will reimburse any users who lost money and boost its internal security systems. It also announced plans to open a new U.S.-based customer support hub. In addition, the firm launched a $20 million bounty for information leading to the attackers’ arrest, tagged stolen funds for recovery, and is working with authorities to pursue criminal charges against the involved insiders. The incident adds to a growing list of cyberattacks targeting the industry. A recent report by Immunefi highlighted that crypto projects lost $92.5 million in April 2025 alone across 15 separate attacks. This figure is a 27.3% increase from the $72.6 million lost in April 2024, and more than double the $41.4 million recorded in March 2025.
