This surge highlights growing institutional interest and confidence in the crypto market, with Bitcoin leading the charge. CoinShares reveals that the year-to-date net inflows into crypto funds have reached $37 billion, while total assets under management (AUM) soared to a new high of $153 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s MVRV Metric Signals Market Heating Up—Here’s What Investors Should Know Bitcoin Takes The Lead, Altcoins Show Growth The recent inflows mark the seventh consecutive week of positive movements for global crypto investment products managed by leading firms such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and ProShares. A substantial portion of last week’s inflows, approximately $2.05 billion, originated from BlackRock’s IBIT product, underlining the dominance of US-based funds in the global space. These inflows outpaced the first-year debut of US gold ETFs, which attracted only $309 million. Bitcoin-based funds were at the forefront of the inflows, contributing $3 billion of the weekly total. This inflow coincided with Bitcoin’s continued price rally, drawing additional interest from institutional and retail investors. However, the higher prices also spurred a notable $10 million inflow into short-Bitcoin products, bringing the monthly figure for these products to $58 million — the highest since August 2022. While Bitcoin dominated, altcoins also attracted significant investment. Solana emerged as the second-most popular asset among institutional investors, with net weekly inflows of $16 million, surpassing Ethereum’s $2.8 million. Other altcoin-based funds also saw notable inflows, with XRP, Litecoin, and Chainlink attracting $15 million, $4.1 million, and $1.3 million, respectively. These inflows suggest growing confidence in the broader altcoin market, driven by price rallies and increasing adoption. Global Crypto Inflows And Regional Trends US-based funds’ dominance was evident in regional fund flows, accounting for $3.2 billion in net weekly inflows. However, this was slightly “offset” by outflows from European markets, including $84 million, $40 million, and $17 million from crypto investment products in Sweden, Germany, and Switzerland, respectively. Despite these regional outflows, the overall trend remains bullish, driven largely by institutional participation in the US market. Notably, CoinShares’s continuous inflows reflect a combination of factors, including the market’s positive sentiment regarding the bull run and the increasing acceptance of crypto as a legitimate asset class.

Chainlink Could Find Major Resistance At The $20 Level In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed how the resistance barriers for LINK are currently looking in terms of the on-chain cost basis distribution. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Smash $100,000? Rapid Stablecoin Exchange Inflows Continue Below is the chart from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shared by the analyst. It shows the amount of the asset acquired at each price range that Chainlink has visited in its history. As displayed in the graph, many Chainlink investors purchased their tokens inside the $18.4 to $26.3 range. More specifically, around 100,220 addresses acquired 57.2 million LINK at these price levels. In on-chain analysis, the potential of any price range to act as support or resistance is measured using the number of coins bought inside it. The reason behind this lies in investor psychology. Generally, holders consider their cost basis a special level since a retest of it can flip their profit-loss status. As such, they can be more prone to making panic moves when this retest happens. Investors carrying a loss before the retest may fear that the price would return shortly, so they could be tempted to sell and get their money back. Similarly, holders with their cost basis retested from above could decide to accumulate more, believing that the level will eventually become profitable again. Both of these effects aren’t consequential when the cost basis of a few investors gets retested. Still, in the scenario where many addresses have their cost basis in a tight range, the reaction produced from a retest may be big enough to cause visible fluctuations in the asset. Related Reading: 54% Of Bitcoin Supply Inactive Since 2 Years Despite 500% Price Jump The aforementioned Chainlink price range around the average value of $22 holds the cost basis of many investors, so it’s possible that LINK could find it hard to break through these levels. As Martinez has pointed out, however, if the cryptocurrency can clear this hurdle, it could potentially have an easy run up to a new ATH since not many investors currently have their acquisition level in the price range after the $22 demand zone. Regarding the ranges under the current price, there are a couple of hefty ones nearby, like $13 to $15 and $11 to $13. If the asset goes through a correction, these levels could potentially help cushion a fall. LINK Price Chainlink has witnessed a rally of almost 10% over the last 24 hours, taking its price to the $18.4 mark.

There was a break above a short-term bearish trend line with resistance at $94,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $95,750 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Corrects Gains Bitcoin price struggled to extend gains above the $98,800 and $99,000 levels. BTC started a downside correction below the $97,000 and $96,000 levels. It even dipped below $95,000. A low was formed at $92,550 and the price is now rising. There was a move above the $93,800 resistance level. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $98,880 swing high to the $92,550 low. Besides, there was a break above a short-term bearish trend line with resistance at $94,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin price is now trading below $96,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $95,200 level. The first key resistance is near the $95,750 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $98,880 swing high to the $92,550 low. A clear move above the $95,750 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $97,350. A close above the $97,350 resistance might initiate more gains. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $98,880 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $100,000 level. Another Dip In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $95,750 resistance zone, it could start another downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $93,800 level. The first major support is near the $92,500 level. The next support is now near the $90,000 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $88,000 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level.

The analyst identified a key driver behind ETH’s recent performance: a significant drop in government bond yields. As these yields decline, van de Poppe suggests that investor interest in riskier assets like Ethereum tends to increase, propelling prices higher. Related Reading: Historic Bitcoin Buy: MicroStrategy Adds 55,500 More BTC To Its Portfolio For $5.4 Billion Van de Poppe elaborated that the ongoing fluctuations in the yield markets could significantly impact Ethereum’s trajectory. With Labor Market Week approaching, he speculated that if economic indicators are weak, the Federal Reserve might implement more rate cuts. Such actions would likely lead to lower yields, further boosting Ethereum’s price. Another analyst, Jesse Olson, echoed this optimistic outlook, noting that Ethereum’s dominance over Bitcoin is showing signs of a bullish divergence. His analysis indicates that positive momentum could soon lead to significant buying opportunities for ETH. As a result of these developments, Trump’s crypto holdings have surged by nearly $1.6 million within the past 24 hours, reflecting the positive market sentiment surrounding Ethereum and other tokens in his portfolio. Major Investment From TRON Founder In a related development, crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun has emerged as a major investor in Trump’s World Liberty Financial, committing $30 million to the decentralized finance (DeFi) project. Sun, the founder of the TRON cryptocurrency, declared his support for Trump’s vision of turning the US into a blockchain hub. He noted, “TRON is committed to making America great again and leading innovation,” highlighting the project’s ambition to democratize financial services by eliminating intermediaries. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Predicts $3,700 Once ETH Breaks Through Resistance World Liberty Financial, which was launched shortly after Trump survived a second assassination attempt, aims to raise $300 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. However, the project has recently revealed that its WLF token offerings are primarily being marketed offshore, with only $30 million set aside for US investors. Once this threshold is met, the US offering will close, despite having a substantial amount of tokens still available for sale. Trump is also reportedly in discussions for the acquisition of the digital asset marketplace Bakkt Holdings Inc. through Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., which he controls. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,435, up 2.4% for the 24-hour period.

ETH is consolidating and might aim for a move above the $3,500 resistance. Ethereum started a fresh increase above the $3,320 and $3,400 levels. The price is trading above $3,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,400 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $3,485 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Holds Gains Above Support Ethereum price remained supported above $3,220 and started a fresh increase while Bitcoin corrected gains. ETH gained pace for a move above the $3,420 and $3,450 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above the $3,500 resistance. A high was formed at $3,545 and recently the price corrected some gains. There was a move below the $3,500 level. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,289 swing low to the $3,545 high. However, the bulls are active near the $3,400 level.

The first major resistance is near the $3,500 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,550. A clear move above the $3,550 resistance might send the price toward the $3,650 resistance. An upside break above the $3,650 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,720 resistance zone or even $3,880. Downsides Supported In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,500 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,420 level. The first major support sits near the $3,400 zone and the trend line. A clear move below the $3,400 support might push the price toward $3,350. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,285 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,220.

So far in November, Solana-based DEXes have recorded over $100 billion in trading volume, marking a major milestone for the ecosystem. Solana DeFi Ecosystem Gains Momentum, Outshines Ethereum DeFi Solana, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency with a reported market cap of $118.34 billion has been on a record-breaking price trajectory. Recently, the digital asset established a new all-time-high (ATH) of $263 after having hit as low as $8 at the peak of the FTX fiasco. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Bulls Stay in Control: Rally Far From Over? Now, the layer-1 blockchain has achieved another milestone as Solana-based DEXes surpassed $100 billion for the first time in monthly trading volume. According to data from DefiLlama, the 30-day cumulative trading volume recorded by Solana DEXes stands at $116.51 billion. In comparison, Ethereum mainnet-based DEXes saw $61.61 billion in trading volume during the same period. This means Solana’s DEX trading volume was more than double that of Ethereum’s. On a month-over-month (MoM) basis, Solana’s DEX volume surged over 100% from October, which stood at $52.5 billion. Meanwhile, the total value locked (TVL) in Solana’s DeFi ecosystem has increased to $9.30 billion, up from $6.23 billion a month ago. The unprecedented rise in Solana-based DEX trading volume can be attributed to several factors. These include the ongoing memecoin frenzy, the blockchain’s low transaction fees, and an intuitive user interface. It is worth highlighting that Solana’s TVL has yet to surpass its ATH TVL of $10.02 billion, which was recorded almost three years ago in November 2021. In January 2023, the blockchain’s TVL hit a low of $210 million, dragged down by the wider crypto bear market exacerbated by the downfall of FTX exchange. At the time of writing, $3.58 billion of Solana’s TVL is tied to the liquid staking protocol Jito, while Jupiter DEX holds $2.4 billion. Another prominent Solana-based DEX, Raydium, accounts for $2.37 billion of TVL. Where Is SOL Headed? Solana’s growing user adoption has played a crucial role in driving the recovery of its native token, SOL. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, SOL has gained over 157%, rising from $101 on January 1 to $263 on November 23. Related Reading: Solana Records New ATH After 3 Years: Is SOL Ready To Flip USDT? Despite such extraordinary returns, crypto experts remain bullish on SOL, expecting further gains for the digital asset. According to a recent analysis by Titan of Crypto, SOL may hit $400 as it appears to be breaking out from a prolonged cup-and-handle pattern. Additional bullish factors, such as the declining Bitcoin (BTC) dominance and the rising likelihood of a Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF), could further propel SOL to new highs. SOL trades at $248.31 at press time, up 0.5% in the past 24 hours.

The price is now trading near $1.450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $1.50 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair is showing positive signs and might eye a fresh increase above the $1.50 resistance. XRP Price Holds Gains XRP price formed a base above $1.30 and started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $1.350 and $1.42 resistance levels. It even pumped above the $1.45 level, beating Ethereum and Bitcoin in the past two sessions. The price spiked above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.6340 swing high to the $1.3007 low. However, the bears seem to be active near the $1.50 resistance zone. There is also a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $1.50 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading near $1.45 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1.4680 level. The first major resistance is near the $1.50 level. The next key resistance could be $1.550 or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.6340 swing high to the $1.3007 low. A clear move above the $1.550 resistance might send the price toward the $1.6350 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $1.680 resistance or even $1.6850 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $1.720 or $1.750. Are Dips Supported? If XRP fails to clear the $1.50 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction.

This pullback comes amid growing speculation about a possible correction following a massive three-week uptrend that saw the leading crypto surge by 40% after Donald Trump’s election on November 5. Bitcoin Price May Drop To $70,500 Market expert and technical analyst Rekt Capital recently voiced concerns on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), drawing parallels with historical price cycles. He highlighted that in the 2013 cycle, the Bitcoin price experienced six weeks of rising prices leading into what is known as “Price Discovery,” followed by its first major correction in Week 7. Similarly, in the 2017 cycle, a seven-week rally culminated in a significant retracement of 34% in Week 8. In the 2020/2021 cycle, Bitcoin rallied for six weeks before facing its first meaningful pullback of 16%.Currently, Rekt Capital notes that Bitcoin is in the fourth week of its current uptrend. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Predicts $3,700 Once ETH Breaks Through Resistance Based on these historical patterns, it suggests that the cryptocurrency may be poised for a retest of lower support levels within the next two to four weeks, aligning with the previous trends, where the average declines have been substantial. Considering the data from past corrections, the Bitcoin price could experience a 25% pullback, potentially bringing the price down to around $70,500—a level not seen since the election day. Who’s Selling Bitcoin? Contributing to the current pullback, data from on-chain market intelligence firm Glassnode reveals that long-term holders (LTHs) have significantly increased their selling activity, with a notable selling pressure recorded at -366,000 BTC per month—the highest level seen since April 2024. The analysis indicates that among long-term holders, the 6 to 12-month cohort is leading the charge, averaging 25,600 BTC sold per day. This group of investors has capitalized on the recent Bitcoin price surge, having acquired their coins at an average cost basis approximately 71% lower than the current market price, which hovers around $57,900.

With Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs just below $100,000, some investors may choose to take profits rather than ride out potential volatility. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at $94,000, recording a retracement of nearly 5% on the 24-hour time frame. For the time being, however, the Bitcoin price continues to post gains in all other time frames, with the year-to-date being the most notable with a 150% surge in that time period.

The Liquity Protocol team was among the first to embrace the idea of committed and verifiable on-chain value when they introduced Chicken Bonds in October 2022. It would be opportune for LQTY stakers to cultivate LUSD’s appeal alongside BOLD. “To some extent, liquidity can be considered a public good.” - Jonathan Kearns and Philip Lowe, Promoting Liquidity: Why and How?, Reserve Bank of Australia, Research Discussion Paper 2008-06, October 2008 Among the most promising innovations to look forward to in DeFi as we approach the end of the year and the start of 2025 are Liquity V2 ( LQTY-USD ) and its stablecoin, BOLD . In the past, I have written extensively about Liquity V1 and its stablecoin, LUSD ( LUSD-USD ), both of which were introduced on Ethereum in April 2021 as a way of offering DeFi users the opportunity to borrow stable value against their ETH holdings in an interest-free manner. LUSD has since set an example to be followed in its commitment to the foundational principles of crypto, and it is described as “the most decentralized stablecoin” by the independent stablecoin rating agency, Blue Chip . Who better than the Liquity Protocol team themselves to now apply the lessons learned from LUSD to advance innovation in the stablecoin market and better tackle the stablecoin trilemma ? Particularly, with its introduction of Protocol Incentivized Liquidity (PIL) , Liquity V2 can drive a positive flywheel that sustains BOLD’s liquidity to contribute to its broad accessibility and price stability as a top stablecoin across DeFi. In this blog post, I therefore propose how progress towards this seemingly insurmountable goal of cracking the stablecoin trilemma can, at the very least, be advanced with BOLD vis-a-vis the consideration of liquidity as a public good for its on-chain DEX pools. Ahead of its Time: Chicken Bonds as a Precursor to Memecoins “Market cap is definitely the most talked about data point when it comes to crypto...however, liquidity is more important because liquidity is a measure of the amount of money that is actually inside of the trading pools that you need to participate in if you want to buy or sell...” - Understanding Liquidity: The Master Metric for Memecoin Traders, Faceless Labs, YouTube, March 2024 Trends have come and gone across the crypto space over the years, and the more recent memecoin craze is quite likely yet another manifestation of that historic tendency. Nevertheless, it is at this point undeniable that memecoins have instilled the criticality of on-chain liquidity as an underlying metric by which crypto projects will be scrutizined moving forward by both newbies and seasoned market participants alike. In fact, popular token trackers such as DEX Tools now highlight burned LP tokens and locked liquidity, reflecting the importance of these figures to traders and users across DeFi. Correspondingly, on-chain liquidity lockers such as UNCX have increasingly grown in popularity across various chains. Interestingly, well before the memecoin hype, the Liquity Protocol team was among the first to embrace the idea of committed and verifiable on-chain value when they introduced Chicken Bonds in October 2022. Specifically, the Permanent Bucket in the Chicken Bonds setup represents a portion of a user’s bonded LUSD once chickening in that can then shift between Liquity’s Stability Pool and the Curve Pool for LUSD + 3CRV. As noted in the Chicken Bonds documentation, “The Permanent bucket can only increase…,” and even with the wind-down functionality built into the Chicken Bonds system, the value as represented by the Permanent Bucket is ultimately redeemable. However, with the rise of interest rates across global markets in recent years, LUSD struggled to sustain its demand versus other stablecoins offering more enticing yields to their holders. By extension, the demand for boosted LUSD (bLUSD) through the Chicken Bonds protocol took a hit. Nevertheless, we can build on the ingenuity that Chicken Bonds introduced as it relates to sustaining liquidity and as further validated by the growing popularity of memecoins when we look ahead and reflect on how BOLD can entrench itself as the stablecoin of choice across DeFi in the future. The BOLD and LUSD Flywheel Effect From the get-go, the onus will be on LQTY stakers to judiciously steer PIL to uphold BOLD’s value proposition as a premier on-chain stablecoin. Since 25% of Liquity V2’s protocol revenue will be directed to PIL, this represents an ongoing and notable sum of value to be apportioned in support of sustaining BOLD’s on-chain liquidity posture. It would seem sensible for LQTY stakers to commit to incentivizing a BOLD + LUSD pool with a portion of PIL, since this would foster a sustained demand for LUSD, which by extension would bolster the revenue from Liquity V1 for LQTY stakers, which they’ll be able to earn as incentives while simultaneously directing Liquity V2’s PIL. “A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990’s. I hope it’s obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them.” - Satoshi, Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency, February 2009 Aside from their own self-interest, LQTY stakers should also be compelled to perpetually incentivize a BOLD + LUSD pool with some of Liquity V2’s PIL because both are synergistic in representing decentralized and immutable attempts at offering stablecoins anchored to on-chain assets with varying degrees of risk, as BOLD will include staked ETH alongside ETH as collateral options, whereas LUSD is only borrowable against ETH itself. Moreover, since LUSD is not tied to off-chain assets and custodians, it is shielded from the “real world” counter-party risks that invariably would need to be accounted for by LQTY stakers in supporting pools of BOLD paired with more widely available yet centralized stablecoins such as USDC and USDT. This is self-evident from the precarious history of traditional financial institutions, as the Silicon Valley Bank fiasco in the Spring of 2023 most recently confirmed. Satoshi’s early elevator pitch for Bitcoin similarly cautioned against centrally controlled systems, and should be considered in this regard as well. In my estimation, there will remain an ongoing demand for LUSD as a stablecoin, as it offers an interest-free approach to borrowing against ETH for users who would continue to favor that, and since it continues to be minted , despite alternative stablecoin options offering better yields in the present high-interest rate macro environment. Assuming demand for LUSD is better upheld as a result of a BOLD + LUSD pool being continually incentivized vis-a-vis PIL from Liquity V2, this may also revive Chicken Bonds as a DeFi protocol and rejuvenate the utility of bLUSD, alongside LUSD and LQTY too, as collateral assets . Liquity as the Antithesis of a Liquidity Black Hole “Financial liquidity matters. In general market participants have a strong preference for trading in the most liquid markets... As important as the level of liquidity, is its uncertainty...” - Avinash Persaud, Liquidity Black Holes: what are they and how are they generated, April 2003 Considering the above, it would be opportune for LQTY stakers to cultivate LUSD’s appeal alongside BOLD. In so doing, the antithesis of a liquidity black hole could be spawned across the Liquity Protocol ecosystem at large, through an amount of BOLD from Liquity V2’s PIL being contributed to a permanently locked liquidity pool position alongside LUSD. To facilitate the creation and growth of such a permanently locked liquidity pool, a defined amount of LQTY could be sold from Liquity V1’s Community Reserve and/or the Liquity AG Endowment and then converted to LUSD. Then, a corresponding amount of BOLD could be allocated by LQTY stakers from PIL over some period of time and subsequently paired with the LUSD to initiate the locked pool. The locked BOLD + LUSD pool could be constructed vis-a-vis a UNCX liquidity locker for Uniswap V3, as this would enable concentrated liquidity within a defined and narrow price range around a dollar value, as the presumption is both BOLD and LUSD will trade roughly around a dollar each. Accordingly, the pool itself could then be further incentivized by LQTY stakers through PIL to attract individual users to provide liquidity on top of this baseline and continuous level of liquidity too. In this manner, the initiator of the locked BOLD + LUSD pool could collect the associated trading fees from Uniswap V3 and feed them back into the pool or use them for funding ecosystem growth initatives, as the UNCX locker for Uniswap V3 allows for the trading fees to separately be collected. Assuming the initiatior is Liquity AG, for example, it could then perhaps categorize the locked liquidity as falling under the Community Reserve, such that its trading fees can then be directed by LQTY stakers engaged in steering PIL for Liquity V2; a smart contract approach to managing this may also be explored, if possible. Full Circle Virtuous Cycle By extending the above-described locked liquidity model to Liquity V2’s licensed forks , LQTY stakers could also encourage aligned forks to initiate permanently locked positions and direct a baseline amount of their respective stablecoins to be paired with BOLD. As the initiators of the pools, the fork teams could similarly collect the corresponding trading fees and channel them back into their pools or use them for their distinct ecosystem’s growth purposes, assuming they use UNCX’s Uniswap V3 locker or a similar example. In approaching the build out of BOLD’s on-chain liquidity in such a manner, there would be both a certain and verifiable level of liquidity that is enabled to gradually increase over time. Forks could be incentivized to continue to support such permanently locked pools for their stablecoins even after the contractual end dates of their licenses pass, since LQTY stakers could show preference for routing PIL from Liquity V2 to such forks that remain supportive of the Liquity ecosystem as a whole. By extension, the demand and liquidity for such stablecoins would continue to be supported. Thus, through promoting a “give to receive” relationship with its fork partners via the use of PIL from Liquity V2 as leverage, LQTY stakers could anchor the Liquity brand as the hub around which DeFi’s premier stablecoins can ultimately grow and prosper together. This strategy may not solve the stablecoin trilemma in its entirety, but it would help to better address liquidity as a primary concern underlying the key question of price stability.

Why A Decline To $89,000 Is Possible",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-89000/,"The Bitcoin price could crash if it fails to hold key resistance levels. A crypto analyst has revealed that a decline to $89,000 was well within possibility, as sell-offs below the $100,000 mark have continued to hinder Bitcoin’s price upward momentum. Bitcoin Price Correction To $89,000 Possible On November 26, TradingView crypto analyst Pejman Zwin shared a detailed chart representing a technical analysis of Bitcoin‘s price movements in a 1-hour time frame. The Bitcoin price chart highlighted vital resistance lines, support zones, and technical indicators suggesting an impending crash. Related Reading: Dogecoin Extends Rally – Can This Lead To A Breakout Above $0.82? At the top of the price chart is a yellow zone identified as the Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ), where Bitcoin is expected to face significant resistance as it aims for the $100,000 milestone. The chart also highlights a horizontal resistance line of around $95,904, which Bitcoin previously struggled to break. At current resistance levels between $97,000 and $98,000, Zwin has indicated that if Bitcoin can successfully push above these thresholds, its price could rise significantly towards $100,000. On the other hand, Bitcoin could experience a massive price decline if it fails to reach the resistance levels mentioned above. The analyst’s price chart showcases green zones representing critical support cones where Bitcoin could bounce back if its price corrects. If Bitcoin drops below support levels between $95,600 and $92,000 and breaks the lower line of the ascending channel on its chart, Zwin has forecasted that its price could crash as low as $89,000 this bull cycle. The analyst describes this crash point as the “cumulative long liquidation leverage, where Bitcoin could see its price correcting between $91,000 and $89,000, representing an 8% to 10% crash for the pioneer cryptocurrency. Key Factors Pushing The BTC Price Upwards On the flip side, Zwin disclosed in his Bitcoin analysis report that the cryptocurrency is pumping again, driven by a wave of positive market sentiment sparked by recent developments in the crypto space that have been headlines. The analyst revealed that the news of the Chinese Court affirming the legality of Bitcoin and crypto ownership has been a key catalyst behind the sharp rise in the price of BTC. Related Reading: ETH/BTC’s 8-Year Cycle Chart Shows How High Ethereum Price Can Go This Cycle Additionally, Donald Trump‘s plans to appoint a White House crypto advisor have provided a significant boost to the BTC price, propelling it to current levels and enabling it to break through important resistance lines. Based on the above chart, Zwin reveals that Bitcoin has entered five new impulsive waves from the Elliott wave theory. This bullish development occurred after the cryptocurrency broke past key resistance lines. Moreover, Zwin’s Bitcoin price chart showcases a “Bump and Run Top Pattern,” with the cryptocurrency already completing the “Bump phase” and entering a “Run phase.” Taking this into consideration, the analyst has predicted that if Bitcoin can surge above $98,700, investors and market watchers should expect it to skyrocket to $100,000.
