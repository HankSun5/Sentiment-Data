This surge highlights growing institutional interest and confidence in the crypto market, with Bitcoin leading the charge. CoinShares reveals that the year-to-date net inflows into crypto funds have reached $37 billion, while total assets under management (AUM) soared to a new high of $153 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s MVRV Metric Signals Market Heating Up—Here’s What Investors Should Know Bitcoin Takes The Lead, Altcoins Show Growth The recent inflows mark the seventh consecutive week of positive movements for global crypto investment products managed by leading firms such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and ProShares. A substantial portion of last week’s inflows, approximately $2.05 billion, originated from BlackRock’s IBIT product, underlining the dominance of US-based funds in the global space. These inflows outpaced the first-year debut of US gold ETFs, which attracted only $309 million. Bitcoin-based funds were at the forefront of the inflows, contributing $3 billion of the weekly total. This inflow coincided with Bitcoin’s continued price rally, drawing additional interest from institutional and retail investors. However, the higher prices also spurred a notable $10 million inflow into short-Bitcoin products, bringing the monthly figure for these products to $58 million — the highest since August 2022. While Bitcoin dominated, altcoins also attracted significant investment. Solana emerged as the second-most popular asset among institutional investors, with net weekly inflows of $16 million, surpassing Ethereum’s $2.8 million. Other altcoin-based funds also saw notable inflows, with XRP, Litecoin, and Chainlink attracting $15 million, $4.1 million, and $1.3 million, respectively. These inflows suggest growing confidence in the broader altcoin market, driven by price rallies and increasing adoption. Global Crypto Inflows And Regional Trends US-based funds’ dominance was evident in regional fund flows, accounting for $3.2 billion in net weekly inflows. However, this was slightly “offset” by outflows from European markets, including $84 million, $40 million, and $17 million from crypto investment products in Sweden, Germany, and Switzerland, respectively. Despite these regional outflows, the overall trend remains bullish, driven largely by institutional participation in the US market. Notably, CoinShares’s continuous inflows reflect a combination of factors, including the market’s positive sentiment regarding the bull run and the increasing acceptance of crypto as a legitimate asset class.

Chainlink Could Find Major Resistance At The $20 Level In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed how the resistance barriers for LINK are currently looking in terms of the on-chain cost basis distribution. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Smash $100,000? Rapid Stablecoin Exchange Inflows Continue Below is the chart from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shared by the analyst. It shows the amount of the asset acquired at each price range that Chainlink has visited in its history. As displayed in the graph, many Chainlink investors purchased their tokens inside the $18.4 to $26.3 range. More specifically, around 100,220 addresses acquired 57.2 million LINK at these price levels. In on-chain analysis, the potential of any price range to act as support or resistance is measured using the number of coins bought inside it. The reason behind this lies in investor psychology. Generally, holders consider their cost basis a special level since a retest of it can flip their profit-loss status. As such, they can be more prone to making panic moves when this retest happens. Investors carrying a loss before the retest may fear that the price would return shortly, so they could be tempted to sell and get their money back. Similarly, holders with their cost basis retested from above could decide to accumulate more, believing that the level will eventually become profitable again. Both of these effects aren’t consequential when the cost basis of a few investors gets retested. Still, in the scenario where many addresses have their cost basis in a tight range, the reaction produced from a retest may be big enough to cause visible fluctuations in the asset. Related Reading: 54% Of Bitcoin Supply Inactive Since 2 Years Despite 500% Price Jump The aforementioned Chainlink price range around the average value of $22 holds the cost basis of many investors, so it’s possible that LINK could find it hard to break through these levels. As Martinez has pointed out, however, if the cryptocurrency can clear this hurdle, it could potentially have an easy run up to a new ATH since not many investors currently have their acquisition level in the price range after the $22 demand zone. Regarding the ranges under the current price, there are a couple of hefty ones nearby, like $13 to $15 and $11 to $13. If the asset goes through a correction, these levels could potentially help cushion a fall. LINK Price Chainlink has witnessed a rally of almost 10% over the last 24 hours, taking its price to the $18.4 mark.

There was a break above a short-term bearish trend line with resistance at $94,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $95,750 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Corrects Gains Bitcoin price struggled to extend gains above the $98,800 and $99,000 levels. BTC started a downside correction below the $97,000 and $96,000 levels. It even dipped below $95,000. A low was formed at $92,550 and the price is now rising. There was a move above the $93,800 resistance level. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $98,880 swing high to the $92,550 low. Besides, there was a break above a short-term bearish trend line with resistance at $94,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin price is now trading below $96,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $95,200 level. The first key resistance is near the $95,750 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $98,880 swing high to the $92,550 low. A clear move above the $95,750 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $97,350. A close above the $97,350 resistance might initiate more gains. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $98,880 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $100,000 level. Another Dip In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $95,750 resistance zone, it could start another downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $93,800 level. The first major support is near the $92,500 level. The next support is now near the $90,000 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $88,000 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level.
