This surge highlights growing institutional interest and confidence in the crypto market, with Bitcoin leading the charge. CoinShares reveals that the year-to-date net inflows into crypto funds have reached $37 billion, while total assets under management (AUM) soared to a new high of $153 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s MVRV Metric Signals Market Heating Up—Here’s What Investors Should Know Bitcoin Takes The Lead, Altcoins Show Growth The recent inflows mark the seventh consecutive week of positive movements for global crypto investment products managed by leading firms such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and ProShares. A substantial portion of last week’s inflows, approximately $2.05 billion, originated from BlackRock’s IBIT product, underlining the dominance of US-based funds in the global space. These inflows outpaced the first-year debut of US gold ETFs, which attracted only $309 million. Bitcoin-based funds were at the forefront of the inflows, contributing $3 billion of the weekly total. This inflow coincided with Bitcoin’s continued price rally, drawing additional interest from institutional and retail investors. However, the higher prices also spurred a notable $10 million inflow into short-Bitcoin products, bringing the monthly figure for these products to $58 million — the highest since August 2022. While Bitcoin dominated, altcoins also attracted significant investment. Solana emerged as the second-most popular asset among institutional investors, with net weekly inflows of $16 million, surpassing Ethereum’s $2.8 million. Other altcoin-based funds also saw notable inflows, with XRP, Litecoin, and Chainlink attracting $15 million, $4.1 million, and $1.3 million, respectively. These inflows suggest growing confidence in the broader altcoin market, driven by price rallies and increasing adoption. Global Crypto Inflows And Regional Trends US-based funds’ dominance was evident in regional fund flows, accounting for $3.2 billion in net weekly inflows. However, this was slightly “offset” by outflows from European markets, including $84 million, $40 million, and $17 million from crypto investment products in Sweden, Germany, and Switzerland, respectively. Despite these regional outflows, the overall trend remains bullish, driven largely by institutional participation in the US market. Notably, CoinShares’s continuous inflows reflect a combination of factors, including the market’s positive sentiment regarding the bull run and the increasing acceptance of crypto as a legitimate asset class.

Chainlink Could Find Major Resistance At The $20 Level In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed how the resistance barriers for LINK are currently looking in terms of the on-chain cost basis distribution. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Smash $100,000? Rapid Stablecoin Exchange Inflows Continue Below is the chart from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shared by the analyst. It shows the amount of the asset acquired at each price range that Chainlink has visited in its history. As displayed in the graph, many Chainlink investors purchased their tokens inside the $18.4 to $26.3 range. More specifically, around 100,220 addresses acquired 57.2 million LINK at these price levels. In on-chain analysis, the potential of any price range to act as support or resistance is measured using the number of coins bought inside it. The reason behind this lies in investor psychology. Generally, holders consider their cost basis a special level since a retest of it can flip their profit-loss status. As such, they can be more prone to making panic moves when this retest happens. Investors carrying a loss before the retest may fear that the price would return shortly, so they could be tempted to sell and get their money back. Similarly, holders with their cost basis retested from above could decide to accumulate more, believing that the level will eventually become profitable again. Both of these effects aren’t consequential when the cost basis of a few investors gets retested. Still, in the scenario where many addresses have their cost basis in a tight range, the reaction produced from a retest may be big enough to cause visible fluctuations in the asset. Related Reading: 54% Of Bitcoin Supply Inactive Since 2 Years Despite 500% Price Jump The aforementioned Chainlink price range around the average value of $22 holds the cost basis of many investors, so it’s possible that LINK could find it hard to break through these levels. As Martinez has pointed out, however, if the cryptocurrency can clear this hurdle, it could potentially have an easy run up to a new ATH since not many investors currently have their acquisition level in the price range after the $22 demand zone. Regarding the ranges under the current price, there are a couple of hefty ones nearby, like $13 to $15 and $11 to $13. If the asset goes through a correction, these levels could potentially help cushion a fall. LINK Price Chainlink has witnessed a rally of almost 10% over the last 24 hours, taking its price to the $18.4 mark.

There was a break above a short-term bearish trend line with resistance at $94,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $95,750 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Corrects Gains Bitcoin price struggled to extend gains above the $98,800 and $99,000 levels. BTC started a downside correction below the $97,000 and $96,000 levels. It even dipped below $95,000. A low was formed at $92,550 and the price is now rising. There was a move above the $93,800 resistance level. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $98,880 swing high to the $92,550 low. Besides, there was a break above a short-term bearish trend line with resistance at $94,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin price is now trading below $96,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $95,200 level. The first key resistance is near the $95,750 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $98,880 swing high to the $92,550 low. A clear move above the $95,750 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $97,350. A close above the $97,350 resistance might initiate more gains. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $98,880 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $100,000 level. Another Dip In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $95,750 resistance zone, it could start another downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $93,800 level. The first major support is near the $92,500 level. The next support is now near the $90,000 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $88,000 support in the near term.

Despite Bitcoin (BTC) being at the center of Trump’s presidential campaign, one notable asset among his holdings is Ethereum (ETH), of which he owns nearly 496 coins. This altcoin has been the standout performer among his investments, rising 38% over the past thirty days. Trump’s Crypto Holdings Shine Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe pointed out a bullish divergence on Ethereum’s daily chart, suggesting that the current market dynamics are ripe for further growth. The analyst identified a key driver behind ETH’s recent performance: a significant drop in government bond yields. As these yields decline, van de Poppe suggests that investor interest in riskier assets like Ethereum tends to increase, propelling prices higher. Related Reading: Historic Bitcoin Buy: MicroStrategy Adds 55,500 More BTC To Its Portfolio For $5.4 Billion Van de Poppe elaborated that the ongoing fluctuations in the yield markets could significantly impact Ethereum’s trajectory. With Labor Market Week approaching, he speculated that if economic indicators are weak, the Federal Reserve might implement more rate cuts. Such actions would likely lead to lower yields, further boosting Ethereum’s price. Another analyst, Jesse Olson, echoed this optimistic outlook, noting that Ethereum’s dominance over Bitcoin is showing signs of a bullish divergence. His analysis indicates that positive momentum could soon lead to significant buying opportunities for ETH. As a result of these developments, Trump’s crypto holdings have surged by nearly $1.6 million within the past 24 hours, reflecting the positive market sentiment surrounding Ethereum and other tokens in his portfolio. Major Investment From TRON Founder In a related development, crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun has emerged as a major investor in Trump’s World Liberty Financial, committing $30 million to the decentralized finance (DeFi) project. Sun, the founder of the TRON cryptocurrency, declared his support for Trump’s vision of turning the US into a blockchain hub. He noted, “TRON is committed to making America great again and leading innovation,” highlighting the project’s ambition to democratize financial services by eliminating intermediaries. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Predicts $3,700 Once ETH Breaks Through Resistance World Liberty Financial, which was launched shortly after Trump survived a second assassination attempt, aims to raise $300 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. However, the project has recently revealed that its WLF token offerings are primarily being marketed offshore, with only $30 million set aside for US investors. Once this threshold is met, the US offering will close, despite having a substantial amount of tokens still available for sale. Trump is also reportedly in discussions for the acquisition of the digital asset marketplace Bakkt Holdings Inc. through Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., which he controls. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,435, up 2.4% for the 24-hour period.

ETH is consolidating and might aim for a move above the $3,500 resistance. Ethereum started a fresh increase above the $3,320 and $3,400 levels. The price is trading above $3,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,400 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $3,485 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Holds Gains Above Support Ethereum price remained supported above $3,220 and started a fresh increase while Bitcoin corrected gains. ETH gained pace for a move above the $3,420 and $3,450 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above the $3,500 resistance. A high was formed at $3,545 and recently the price corrected some gains. There was a move below the $3,500 level. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,289 swing low to the $3,545 high. However, the bulls are active near the $3,400 level. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,400 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The trend line is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,289 swing low to the $3,545 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,485 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,500 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,550. A clear move above the $3,550 resistance might send the price toward the $3,650 resistance. An upside break above the $3,650 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,720 resistance zone or even $3,880. Downsides Supported In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,500 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,420 level. The first major support sits near the $3,400 zone and the trend line. A clear move below the $3,400 support might push the price toward $3,350. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,285 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,220. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

So far in November, Solana-based DEXes have recorded over $100 billion in trading volume, marking a major milestone for the ecosystem. Solana DeFi Ecosystem Gains Momentum, Outshines Ethereum DeFi Solana, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency with a reported market cap of $118.34 billion has been on a record-breaking price trajectory. Recently, the digital asset established a new all-time-high (ATH) of $263 after having hit as low as $8 at the peak of the FTX fiasco. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Bulls Stay in Control: Rally Far From Over? Now, the layer-1 blockchain has achieved another milestone as Solana-based DEXes surpassed $100 billion for the first time in monthly trading volume. According to data from DefiLlama, the 30-day cumulative trading volume recorded by Solana DEXes stands at $116.51 billion. In comparison, Ethereum mainnet-based DEXes saw $61.61 billion in trading volume during the same period. This means Solana’s DEX trading volume was more than double that of Ethereum’s. On a month-over-month (MoM) basis, Solana’s DEX volume surged over 100% from October, which stood at $52.5 billion. Meanwhile, the total value locked (TVL) in Solana’s DeFi ecosystem has increased to $9.30 billion, up from $6.23 billion a month ago. The unprecedented rise in Solana-based DEX trading volume can be attributed to several factors. These include the ongoing memecoin frenzy, the blockchain’s low transaction fees, and an intuitive user interface. It is worth highlighting that Solana’s TVL has yet to surpass its ATH TVL of $10.02 billion, which was recorded almost three years ago in November 2021. In January 2023, the blockchain’s TVL hit a low of $210 million, dragged down by the wider crypto bear market exacerbated by the downfall of FTX exchange. At the time of writing, $3.58 billion of Solana’s TVL is tied to the liquid staking protocol Jito, while Jupiter DEX holds $2.4 billion. Another prominent Solana-based DEX, Raydium, accounts for $2.37 billion of TVL. Where Is SOL Headed? Solana’s growing user adoption has played a crucial role in driving the recovery of its native token, SOL. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, SOL has gained over 157%, rising from $101 on January 1 to $263 on November 23. Related Reading: Solana Records New ATH After 3 Years: Is SOL Ready To Flip USDT? Despite such extraordinary returns, crypto experts remain bullish on SOL, expecting further gains for the digital asset. According to a recent analysis by Titan of Crypto, SOL may hit $400 as it appears to be breaking out from a prolonged cup-and-handle pattern. Additional bullish factors, such as the declining Bitcoin (BTC) dominance and the rising likelihood of a Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF), could further propel SOL to new highs. SOL trades at $248.31 at press time, up 0.5% in the past 24 hours.

The price must clear the $1.50 resistance zone to start a fresh increase in the near term. XRP price is attempting a fresh increase from the $1.300 level. The price is now trading near $1.450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $1.50 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair is showing positive signs and might eye a fresh increase above the $1.50 resistance. XRP Price Holds Gains XRP price formed a base above $1.30 and started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $1.350 and $1.42 resistance levels. It even pumped above the $1.45 level, beating Ethereum and Bitcoin in the past two sessions. The price spiked above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.6340 swing high to the $1.3007 low. However, the bears seem to be active near the $1.50 resistance zone. There is also a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $1.50 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading near $1.45 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1.4680 level. The first major resistance is near the $1.50 level. The next key resistance could be $1.550 or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.6340 swing high to the $1.3007 low. A clear move above the $1.550 resistance might send the price toward the $1.6350 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $1.680 resistance or even $1.6850 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $1.720 or $1.750. Are Dips Supported? If XRP fails to clear the $1.50 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $1.400 level and the triangle’s lower trend line. The next major support is near the $1.380 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $1.380 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $1.3200 support. The next major support sits near the $1.2650 zone.
