This pivotal regulatory green light, granted from Washington, D.C., in early 2025, represents a critical evolution in the oversight of cryptocurrency-based financial products and provides a structured, compliant pathway for event-based trading within the United States. CFTC Prediction Market Approval: Decoding the Regulatory Milestone The CFTC granted its official sanction to Bitnomial through a specific regulatory instrument known as a no-action letter . This mechanism provides a conditional exemption from certain complex reporting requirements typically mandated for derivatives trading platforms. Consequently, the approval streamlines the operational launch while maintaining regulatory oversight. However, the commission imposed clear transparency mandates. Bitnomial must now publish comprehensive trading data on its official website and supply this information to the CFTC immediately upon request. This approval follows an earlier, in-principle nod from the commission, indicating a phased and deliberate review process. This development is not an isolated event but rather a key moment in the ongoing maturation of U.S. crypto regulation. The CFTC, which oversees commodity futures and options markets, has progressively clarified its stance on digital assets classified as commodities. The approval signals the commission’s willingness to engage with innovative market structures, provided they operate within a transparent and regulated framework. Furthermore, it distinguishes Bitnomial’s offering from unregulated prediction markets, offering U.S. participants a legally compliant venue. The Mechanics and Impact of a Regulated Prediction Market A prediction market allows participants to trade contracts whose payout is tied to the outcome of specific future events. For example, contracts could be based on election results, economic indicators, or technology adoption rates. Bitnomial’s approved platform will function as a regulated derivatives exchange , meaning all trades are cleared through a central counterparty, mitigating counterparty risk—a significant concern in decentralized finance (DeFi) prediction markets. This structure provides several key advantages: Enhanced Legal Clarity: Participants operate under explicit CFTC oversight, reducing regulatory uncertainty. Improved Market Integrity: Centralized clearing and reporting requirements help prevent manipulation and ensure fair pricing. Institutional Accessibility: The regulated environment may attract institutional investors previously hesitant to engage in prediction markets. The table below contrasts key features of traditional, decentralized, and now regulated prediction markets: Market Type Regulatory Status Counterparty Risk Primary Appeal Decentralized (e.g., Polymarket) Unregulated / Gray Area Higher (Smart Contract dependent) Censorship Resistance, Global Access Traditional Betting Markets Strictly Gambling Regulated Lower (Licensed Operators) Entertainment, Sports Focus Bitnomial’s CFTC-Approved Market Formal Derivatives Regulation Lowest (Central Clearinghouse) Regulatory Compliance, Financial Instrument Focus Expert Analysis: A Bridge Between Crypto and Traditional Finance Financial regulation experts view this approval as a strategic bridge. “The CFTC’s action with Bitnomial is a pragmatic step,” explains a former commission advisor familiar with digital asset policy. “It acknowledges the demand for event-driven financial products while channeling that activity into a supervised venue with robust risk management. This model could serve as a template for other crypto-native innovations seeking legitimacy.” The move also reinforces the CFTC’s jurisdictional claim over certain digital assets as commodities, a ongoing dialogue with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The immediate impact extends beyond Bitnomial. Other licensed cryptocurrency exchange operators are now closely observing the regulatory precedent. Success for this model could encourage further applications, potentially expanding the suite of crypto-based derivatives available to U.S. traders. Moreover, the required public data dissemination will create a new, auditable dataset for event probabilities, valuable to researchers and traditional financial analysts alike. Historical Context and Future Trajectory for Crypto Derivatives Bitnomial’s journey to this point reflects a broader industry trend. The exchange received its designated contract market (DCM) and derivatives clearing organization (DCO) licenses from the CFTC in prior years, establishing a foundation of trust. This latest approval for a prediction market product represents a logical expansion of its licensed offerings. The path highlights a regulatory philosophy of incremental innovation within existing frameworks, rather than creating entirely new rules. Looking forward, the success of this venture will hinge on market adoption and regulatory compliance in practice. The CFTC will monitor the platform’s operations, data reporting, and risk controls. A smooth rollout could pave the way for more complex event contracts or the integration of blockchain-based settlement. Conversely, any issues with market manipulation or failures in transparency could slow similar approvals. The development is a clear indicator that the era of completely unregulated crypto speculation is giving way to a more structured, albeit complex, era of supervised digital finance. Conclusion The CFTC prediction market approval for Bitnomial marks a definitive milestone in the integration of cryptocurrency innovations into the U.S. regulated financial system. By providing a sanctioned venue for event-based trading, the commission has addressed a growing market need while asserting its oversight role. This decision enhances legal clarity, promotes market integrity, and could attract a new wave of institutional participation. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, this model of regulated innovation within established frameworks will likely serve as a critical reference point for future developments in cryptocurrency exchange regulation and derivative products. FAQs Q1: What exactly did the CFTC approve for Bitnomial? The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) officially approved, via a no-action letter, Bitnomial’s launch of a prediction market. This is a regulated derivatives platform where users can trade contracts based on the outcome of future events. Q2: How is Bitnomial’s prediction market different from sites like Polymarket? The key difference is regulatory status. Bitnomial operates as a fully licensed CFTC-regulated exchange and clearinghouse, offering legal clarity and central counterparty clearing in the U.S. Polymarket operates in a regulatory gray area, often accessible via VPN, and carries different risks. Q3: What is a “no-action letter” from the CFTC? A no-action letter is a statement from CFTC staff indicating they will not recommend enforcement action against a specific activity if conducted under particular conditions. It is not a formal rule change but provides regulatory certainty for the approved activity. Q4: What are the conditions of Bitnomial’s approval? Bitnomial must publicly publish trading data on its website and provide all data to the CFTC immediately upon request. This ensures market transparency and allows for regulatory monitoring. Q5: Why is this approval significant for the cryptocurrency industry? This approval is significant because it creates a precedent for a new class of regulated crypto derivatives in the U.S. It demonstrates a pathway for innovative products to gain legitimacy under existing CFTC oversight, potentially attracting more institutional capital and setting standards for market operation.

It has been in a massive downtrend over the past several months, prompting some analysts to be quite bearish about the future. Meanwhile, certain indicators suggest a further pullback could be on the horizon. ‘Hard to Stay Bullish’ PI currently trades at approximately $0.20 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a minor 2% increase on a weekly scale and a whopping 93% collapse since the all-time high of $3 observed in February last year. X user pinetworkmembers, who has been quite critical of the project as of late, claimed it’s “hard to stay bullish” on PI at the moment. They noted that the asset had barely moved up when BTC bounced at the start of 2026, outlining several hurdles for the price. The main ones include the lack of support from a major exchange, “no real open mainnet,” unclear supply, centralized control, locked balances, and others. “At some point, you have to ask if this is innovation… or just wasted time and opportunity cost,” they added. The increased exchange supply reinforces the bearish outlook. Almost 1.8 million tokens have been transferred to centralized platforms in the past 24 hours alone, which is often considered a pre-sale step. As of now, more than 425 million PI are stored on exchanges, with roughly 52% of that amount held by Gate.io. Bitget comes in second with around 148 million coins. PI Exchange Reserves, Source: piscan.io Something for the Bulls Some analysts refuse to wave the white flag, arguing that a resurgence could be knocking on the door. X user Vuori Trading claimed that PI has been breaking out from an eight-month downtrend, predicting the price might rise to $0.57 soon. Prior to that, Aman assumed that the asset had been “consolidating tight under key resistance after trending higher.” The market observer forecasted new peaks should the valuation surge above $0.215. The upcoming token unlocks also deserve to be observed. Over 130 million PI are scheduled for release in the next 30 days, as today (January 8) is the record day, with 5.3 million coins freed up. The average daily unlock is around 4.36 million, which is less aggressive than in previous months and could provide some short-term price stability.

This innovative product, reported initially by Cointelegraph, enables qualified users to access up to $5 million in liquidity without paying annual interest or fees. The announcement arrives as institutional and retail investors increasingly seek sophisticated financial tools for their digital asset portfolios. Consequently, this development marks a significant evolution in crypto-backed lending services globally. Nexo’s Zero-Interest Credit Product Mechanics Nexo’s new offering represents a substantial departure from traditional crypto lending models. The platform allows BTC and ETH holders to borrow against their holdings at a 0% annual percentage rate. Users maintain ownership of their collateralized assets while accessing immediate liquidity. Repayment at maturity offers flexibility through multiple options. Borrowers can settle obligations using stablecoins or provide additional collateral. This structure provides unprecedented financial flexibility for cryptocurrency investors. The product’s $5 million maximum borrowing limit caters specifically to high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients. Nexo established this threshold after extensive market research. The company identified strong demand for large-scale liquidity solutions among substantial crypto holders. Importantly, the zero-interest feature applies throughout the entire loan term. Nexo confirms the absence of hidden fees or origination charges. This transparency builds trust within the cryptocurrency community. Technical Implementation and Security Protocols Nexo implements advanced smart contract technology to facilitate these credit lines securely. The system automatically manages collateral ratios and liquidation parameters. Real-time monitoring ensures compliance with agreed terms. Borrowers receive instant notifications about their credit status. Furthermore, Nexo employs military-grade encryption for all transactions. The platform maintains comprehensive insurance coverage for digital assets. These security measures address common concerns about crypto lending platforms. Market Context and Competitive Landscape The cryptocurrency lending sector has experienced remarkable growth since 2020. Traditional finance institutions gradually entered the space throughout 2023. However, specialized platforms like Nexo continue leading innovation. The company facilitated approximately $140 million in loans during the previous year. This track record demonstrates substantial market traction. Nexo’s new zero-interest product directly responds to evolving borrower expectations. Competitive analysis reveals Nexo’s unique positioning. Most crypto lenders currently charge interest rates between 5% and 15% annually. Some platforms offer promotional zero-interest periods. However, these typically last only 30-90 days. Nexo’s permanent zero-interest structure represents a genuine market disruption. The table below illustrates key differences: Platform Interest Rate Maximum Loan Collateral Options Nexo 0% $5 million BTC, ETH Competitor A 5.9% $2 million Multiple cryptocurrencies Competitor B 8.5% $1 million BTC, ETH, stablecoins Industry experts recognize this development’s significance. Sarah Chen, fintech analyst at Digital Finance Research, explains the strategic implications. “Nexo’s move pressures traditional lenders to innovate faster,” Chen states. “Zero-interest credit lines could become standard for premium clients.” Meanwhile, institutional adoption continues accelerating. Major investment firms increasingly allocate to digital assets. Consequently, demand for sophisticated financial products grows substantially. Economic Implications and User Benefits Zero-interest credit lines offer multiple advantages for cryptocurrency holders. Investors can access liquidity without selling appreciating assets. This avoids potential tax implications in many jurisdictions. Additionally, borrowers maintain exposure to potential cryptocurrency price appreciation. The structure functions similarly to securities-based lending in traditional markets. However, crypto lending typically offers faster processing and greater accessibility. Key benefits include: Tax efficiency : Avoiding taxable events from asset sales Portfolio optimization : Maintaining investment positions while accessing cash Financial flexibility : Addressing opportunities or emergencies without liquidation Cost savings : Eliminating interest expenses entirely Real-world applications demonstrate practical utility. Consider a Bitcoin holder needing funds for business expansion. Traditional options might require selling BTC, potentially missing future gains. Alternatively, conventional loans often involve lengthy approval processes. Nexo’s solution provides immediate capital while preserving the underlying asset. This capability proves particularly valuable during market volatility. Investors can navigate downturns without forced selling. Risk Management Considerations While offering significant benefits, crypto-backed lending involves specific risks. Collateral value fluctuations represent the primary concern. Nexo addresses this through conservative loan-to-value ratios. The platform monitors positions continuously. Automated systems trigger warnings before liquidation events. Additionally, regulatory uncertainty persists in some regions. Nexo maintains compliance with applicable jurisdictions. The company conducts thorough borrower verification. These measures promote responsible lending practices. Historical Development and Future Trajectory Nexo’s innovation builds upon years of cryptocurrency lending evolution. Early platforms emerged around 2017, offering basic borrowing services. Interest rates often exceeded 20% annually initially. Market maturation gradually reduced costs. Institutional participation increased significantly after 2021. Traditional financial models began integrating with blockchain technology. Nexo’s latest development represents the next logical progression. The company’s $140 million lending volume last year demonstrates market validation. This figure represents approximately 15% year-over-year growth. Industry projections suggest continued expansion. Analysts predict crypto lending could reach $50 billion globally by 2026. Zero-interest products likely will capture substantial market share. Furthermore, integration with decentralized finance protocols appears inevitable. Hybrid models combining CeFi and DeFi elements may emerge soon. Future developments might include: Expansion to additional cryptocurrency collateral types Integration with traditional banking services Automated portfolio management features Regulatory-compliant products for specific jurisdictions Market observers anticipate increased competition following Nexo’s announcement. Other lenders probably will develop similar offerings. However, first-mover advantage provides significant benefits. Nexo establishes itself as the innovation leader in crypto lending. This positioning strengthens brand recognition and customer loyalty. The company likely will introduce complementary products soon. Conclusion Nexo’s launch of zero-interest credit lines for BTC and ETH holders represents a transformative moment for cryptocurrency finance. This innovative product provides substantial benefits for digital asset investors seeking liquidity. The $5 million maximum borrowing capacity caters to serious institutional and individual clients. Importantly, the 0% interest rate with no fees creates unprecedented value. Nexo’s proven track record, including $140 million in facilitated loans, demonstrates platform reliability. As cryptocurrency adoption accelerates globally, sophisticated financial instruments become increasingly essential. Nexo’s latest offering addresses this growing demand effectively. The product likely will influence broader crypto lending industry standards. Consequently, both retail and institutional investors should monitor this development closely. FAQs Q1: How does Nexo’s zero-interest credit line work exactly? Nexo allows qualified Bitcoin and Ethereum holders to borrow against their assets at 0% annual interest. Users can access up to $5 million in liquidity while maintaining ownership of their collateralized cryptocurrency. Repayment at maturity can be made using stablecoins or additional collateral. Q2: What are the eligibility requirements for this product? While Nexo hasn’t published detailed eligibility criteria, applicants typically need substantial BTC or ETH holdings for collateral. The platform conducts standard identity verification and risk assessment. Institutional clients may have additional documentation requirements. Q3: How does this compare to traditional securities-based lending? Nexo’s offering functions similarly to securities-based lending but with cryptocurrency collateral. Key differences include potentially faster processing, global accessibility, and the unique 0% interest rate. However, crypto lending involves different regulatory considerations and volatility management. Q4: What happens if my collateral value decreases significantly? Nexo monitors collateral values continuously through automated systems. If values approach predetermined thresholds, borrowers receive margin calls. The platform may require additional collateral or partial repayment to maintain agreed loan-to-value ratios. Q5: Can I use borrowed funds for any purpose? Yes, Nexo imposes no restrictions on fund usage. Borrowers can utilize liquidity for business investments, personal expenses, additional cryptocurrency purchases, or any other legal purpose. This flexibility represents a key advantage over traditional lending products.

56990817,655570,1767911377,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56990817.jpeg,Trump Dismisses Pardon For FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried Amid Lobbying Efforts,https://bitcoinist.com/trump-dismisses-pardon-for-ftxs-sam-bankman-fried/,"Speculation regarding a potential presidential pardon for Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced former CEO and co-founder of crypto exchange FTX, intensified since former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao received clemency from President Donald Trump last year. However, a recent report by The New York Times indicates that Trump has firmly rejected the idea of pardoning Bankman-Fried, alongside other high-profile figures. No Clemency For FTX Co-Founder When questioned about the possibility of issuing presidential pardons for individuals such as Sean Combs, Nicolas Maduro, and Bankman-Fried, Trump made it clear that he had no intentions of granting clemency to these individuals. This news comes as the former crypto mogul continues to seek relief from his 25-year sentence for one of the largest financial frauds in modern history. Bankman-Fried’s parents are reportedly working behind the scenes to lobby for a reduction in their son’s sentence. Despite these efforts, the extensive fallout from FTX’s collapse appears to have swayed Trump’s thinking against issuing a pardon. In November 2023, Bankman-Fried was convicted on seven criminal counts, including fraud and conspiracy, resulting in a 25-year prison sentence and a mandate to repay $11 billion to FTX customers. His legal team stated back in November 2025 that their client had been “unfairly convicted,” claiming he was denied a fair opportunity to defend himself amid intense media scrutiny and prosecutorial pressure. “Sam Bankman-Fried was never presumed innocent,” they argued in their appeal. “He was presumed guilty—before he was even charged.” Bankman-Fried Pursues Legal Remedies The situation drew further comparisons to Zhao’s case when, on October 23, the White House announced Trump had pardoned the Binance co-founder, who had previously pleaded guilty to charges two years earlier. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt remarked that the President was exercising his constitutional authority in pardoning Zhao, who faced prosecution by the Biden Administration amidst its regulatory actions against cryptocurrency. However, the circumstances surrounding FTX’s dramatic collapse suggest that a pardon for the former FTX CEO is unlikely at this time. As it stands, Bankman-Fried remains focused on his legal options.

The LLM paints an optimistic picture, suggesting those who take positions in the projects today could see returns of 3x or more by the end of the year. Here’s how KIMI AI expects them to perform if a full-scale crypto bull market ignites in 2026. XRP (XRP): KIMI AI Predicts Ripple’s Payments Token Reaching $8 Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) has started the year on a strong footing, rising roughly 14% over the last seven days to trade at $2.09. According to KIMI AI, sustaining this momentum could propel XRP to the $8 level before the end of 2026. Source: KIMI AI XRP dominated headlines last year after rallying to a seven-year high of $3.65 in July, following Ripple’s landmark legal win against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The ruling removed a major regulatory overhang and reignited investor confidence. Still, XRP spent much of 2025 moving sideways between $2 and $3. A broader market downturn late in the year even dragged the price briefly below $2. At present, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering around 54, a neutral zone that indicates strength at its current level, which was also a strong support level throughout last year. A move to KIMI’s projected upper target would translate into gains of just under 300% for current holders. Institutional money will be the key driver here. The recent rollout of spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. has already begun attracting large investors, mirroring the early stages of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF inflows. If additional products gain approval, 2026 could become the year XRP goes mainstream. Dogecoin (DOGE): KIMI AI Predicts an Easy 3x Originally launched in 2013 as a joke, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has matured into one of the crypto market’s largest assets. With a market cap of almost $24 billion, it now capitalizes half of the $49 billion meme coin sector. Source: KIMI AI DOGE formed several constructive chart patterns in late summer and early autumn of 2026, but momentum faded after a sharp market-wide sell-off in October. Dogecoin’s all-time high of $0.7316 was set during the retail-fueled bull run of 2021. While the Doge Army has its hearts and minds set on a $1 Dogecoin, KIMI AI views that milestone as unlikely in 2026. Instead, the model projects a peak near $0.45, which would still represent a clean 3x increase from the current price of around $0.14. Despite being a meme coin, Dogecoin is actually a viable tender for many merchants across the globe. Tesla accepts DOGE for select merchandise, and major payment platforms such as PayPal and Revolut have added support for Dogecoin transactions, strengthening its role as a functional digital currency. Solana (SOL): KIMI AI Targets $400 for SOL Solana ($SOL) enters 2026 as one of crypto’s most dynamic smart contract platforms. The network now supports around $9 billion in total value locked (TVL) and commands a market capitalization close to $75.9 billion, while developer activity and user growth continue to accelerate. Source: KIMI AI Recent launches of Solana-focused ETFs by firms such as Bitwise and Grayscale have renewed market enthusiasm, with many investors drawing parallels to the early ETF adoption phases of Bitcoin and Ethereum. After a sharp correction in the final quarter of 2025, SOL is now back up in a local support zone after rising 8% in the last week to trade at $134. In a highly bullish scenario, KIMI AI estimates Solana could climb to $400 in 2026, a 200% increase from today’s price—well above its previous all-time high of $293 set last January. Solana also has one of the strongest narratives of any altcoin: growing institutional interest in Solana’s tokenization of real-world assets, driven by major players like Franklin Templeton and BlackRock, reinforces SOL’s long-term upside potential. Maxi Doge (MAXI): Early-Stage Meme Coin Outside KIMI’s Model Beyond the classics, pre-launch token sales remain popular among investors seeking opportunities with higher-risk and higher-potential returns. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is one such project, having raised over $4.4 million as meme coin investors pile in to Dogecoin’s degen successor. The project revolves around Maxi Doge persona, Dogecoin’s fun, hilarious, and ripped cousin, who has spent the last decade feeling sidelined by his relative’s unprecedented popularity. Now he’s back, having mastered the art of degen trading with 1,000x leverage and no stop loss. MAXI is issued as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network, leveraging Ethereum’s mature developer ecosystem and improved energy efficiency for a more modern meme coin than Dogecoin, which utilizes a consumptive Bitcoin-era proof-of-work design. The ongoing presale offers staking rewards of up to 70% APY, though yields decline as more participants join. MAXI is currently priced at $0.000277 in its latest presale phase, with automatic price increases scheduled for future rounds. Tokens can be purchased using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

This remarkable financial milestone, first reported by Unfolded citing data from Cryptodiffer, not only highlights Meteora’s operational scale but also signals a potential shift in the competitive dynamics of on-chain finance. The protocol’s performance notably eclipsed that of established giants, with Jupiter ranking second at $1.11 billion and the venerable Uniswap following closely with $1.06 billion. Meteora’s DeFi Fee Dominance in Context Fee generation serves as the most transparent and critical metric for evaluating a decentralized protocol’s real-world usage and economic health. Essentially, these fees represent the actual revenue collected from users for executing transactions, providing liquidity, or utilizing other smart contract functionalities. Meteora’s ascent to the top of this list is particularly significant. Historically, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap have dominated fee rankings. Meteora’s core offering, however, centers on dynamic liquidity pools and automated market maker (AMM) strategies, often deployed on the high-throughput Solana blockchain. This suggests a growing user and capital preference for efficient, low-cost trading environments that can still generate substantial aggregate fees. Furthermore, the close clustering of the top three protocols—separated by only $190 million—indicates an intensely competitive landscape. This competition ultimately benefits end-users through continuous innovation and improved fee structures. The data underscores a maturation phase for DeFi, where multiple architectures can achieve massive scale. Analysts often point to total value locked (TVL) as a key metric, but fee generation provides a more direct measure of economic activity and sustainable protocol business models. Analyzing the Competitive Fee Landscape The race for fee supremacy reveals fascinating trends within the decentralized finance sector. To understand the hierarchy, a comparative analysis of the leading protocols is essential. Protocol 2024 Fees Generated Primary Function Dominant Blockchain Meteora (MET) $1.25 Billion Dynamic Liquidity AMM Solana Jupiter (JUP) $1.11 Billion DEX Aggregator Solana Uniswap (UNI) $1.06 Billion Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Ethereum, Multi-chain This table illustrates several key points. First, the Solana ecosystem hosted the top two fee generators, a testament to its rising prominence for high-frequency DeFi activity. Second, the functional diversity is notable: Meteora (AMM), Jupiter (aggregator), and Uniswap (classic DEX) each solve different user needs. Jupiter’s role, for instance, involves routing trades across multiple liquidity sources to find the best price, and its high fees reflect immense transaction volume processed. The concentration of value within these top-tier protocols also highlights the ‘winner-takes-most’ dynamic common in technology networks, where liquidity and users attract more liquidity and users. The Engine Behind Meteora’s Fee Generation Meteora’s specific architecture provides clear reasons for its financial performance. The protocol utilizes what it terms “Dynamic Liquidity Markets” (DLMs). Unlike static pools, these DLMs automatically adjust trading fees and liquidity incentives in real-time based on market volatility and pool concentration. This mechanism aims to optimize returns for liquidity providers while minimizing impermanent loss, a major concern in DeFi. Consequently, the model attracts sophisticated capital seeking yield, which in turn creates deep liquidity that draws traders. The resulting virtuous cycle generates substantial fee revenue from both trading and pool management activities. Industry observers note that Meteora’s design elegantly addresses the liquidity fragmentation problem on Solana, creating centralized exchange-like depth in a decentralized manner. Broader Implications for the DeFi Sector The fee data from 2024 carries profound implications for investors, developers, and the future trajectory of decentralized finance. Primarily, it validates the economic viability of non-Ethereum DeFi ecosystems at the highest level. For years, Ethereum’s first-mover advantage seemed unassailable. The success of Solana-based protocols like Meteora and Jupiter demonstrates that scalability and low transaction costs are decisive competitive advantages that can translate directly into leading market share and revenue. Moreover, this shift influences tokenomics and governance. Protocols with robust fee generation often implement mechanisms to share this revenue with token holders, either through direct distribution (fee-sharing or buybacks) or by funding decentralized treasury operations. This creates a more tangible value accrual model for native tokens like MET, JUP, and UNI, moving beyond purely speculative utility. The data also acts as a beacon for developer talent and venture capital, signaling where the most active and lucrative building opportunities reside. Finally, for regulators and institutional observers, these massive fee numbers underscore the undeniable scale and permanence of the DeFi sector within the global financial system. Conclusion Meteora’s achievement in generating $1.25 billion in fees to lead all DeFi protocols marks a definitive moment in the industry’s evolution. It highlights the fierce competition for user activity and capital efficiency, with the Solana ecosystem emerging as a powerhouse for high-volume decentralized finance. The close race with Jupiter and Uniswap proves that multiple technical approaches can achieve monumental scale. As the sector matures, fee generation will remain the ultimate scorecard for protocol utility and sustainability. Meteora’s current **DeFi fee** leadership demonstrates that innovation in liquidity provision and market structure continues to drive the most significant value creation in the blockchain economy. FAQs Q1: What does ‘fee generation’ mean for a DeFi protocol? A1: Fee generation refers to the total revenue a decentralized finance protocol collects from its users. This includes charges for executing trades, swapping tokens, providing liquidity, or using lending/borrowing services. It is a direct indicator of a protocol’s usage volume and economic activity. Q2: Why is Meteora’s fee generation significant compared to its Total Value Locked (TVL)? A2: While TVL measures the amount of capital deposited in a protocol, fee generation measures how actively that capital is being used. High fees on a relatively efficient platform like Meteora can indicate superior capital turnover and more efficient markets, making it a key metric for real economic throughput. Q3: Did all the fees generated go to the Meteora protocol itself? A3: Not directly to a corporate entity. In decentralized protocols, fees are typically distributed according to smart contract rules. A portion usually goes to liquidity providers as a reward, and another portion may be allocated to a protocol treasury, used to buy back and burn the native token (MET), or distributed to token holders who stake their assets. Q4: How does Jupiter generate over $1 billion in fees as an aggregator? A4: Jupiter does not hold liquidity itself. Instead, it routes user trade orders across multiple DEXs (including Meteora) to find the best price. It charges a small fee for this service. Its massive fee total is a product of aggregating an enormous volume of trades across the entire Solana DeFi landscape, acting as the primary gateway for many users. Q5: What could challenge Meteora’s fee leadership in the future? A5: Several factors could shift the rankings: the emergence of new, more efficient AMM designs, significant scalability upgrades on competing blockchains like Ethereum (via layer-2 solutions), changes in user sentiment or regulatory landscapes, or a major shift in the types of assets (e.g., tokenized real-world assets) that gain traction on different platforms.

56990965,https://cryptonews.com/?p=471731,1767911700,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56990965.jpeg,"Best Crypto to Buy Now January 8 – XRP, Zcash, PEPE",https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-january-8-xrp-zcash-pepe/,"It’s a fresh year for crypto, and investors are increasingly debating whether 2026 could usher in a major bull run, particularly if U.S. authorities finally roll out comprehensive, long-awaited cryptocurrency regulations. One key signal catching investors’ attention is Bitcoin’s gradual loss of market share since the summer. Historically, a decline in BTC dominance indicates people are rotating into altcoins. If that pattern holds, assets such as XRP, Zcash, and Pepe may clock new highs in the months ahead. XRP (XRP): Payments-Focused Blockchain Eyes New Q1 Highs Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) leads the blockchain-based cross-border payments niche, thanks to rapid transaction finality and extremely low fees. Designed with banks and institutions in mind, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) offers a next-gen alternative to legacy messaging systems like SWIFT. XRP’s utility has been acknowledged in publications from bodies such as the United Nations Capital Development Fund and the White House. Today, XRP ranks as the third-largest cryptocurrency outside of stablecoins, boasting a market capitalization exceeding $127 billion. After Ripple’s long-running legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission concluded last year, XRP surged to a seven-year peak of $3.65. The token has since corrected by roughly 42% and is currently changing hands at around $2.09. Momentum returned recently as XRP jumped about 14% in the last seven days. The surge is likely spurred by the debut of five spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. These products open crypto investing to traditional investors who want to avoid the risks of directly holding crypto. With further ETF approvals and clearer regulatory frameworks, analysts suggest XRP could test $5 before the end of Q1, with optimistic forecasts pointing to $10 later in the year. Zcash (ZEC): Privacy Coin Veteran Delivers Explosive 700% Growth Launched in 2016, Zcash ($ZEC) remains one of the most technically advanced privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, originating as a Bitcoin fork designed to enhance transaction confidentiality. The protocol leverages zk-SNARKs, advanced zero-knowledge proofs that allow transactions to be verified without revealing sensitive details. Users can choose between transparent and shielded addresses, depending on their personal privacy and regulatory considerations. Over the past year, Zcash has climbed approximately 688%. Now priced near $400, ZEC carries a market cap of around $6.7 billion, representing more than a third of the estimated $17.5 billion privacy-coin sector. With its relative strength index (RSI) hovering near 37 and trending downward, the token is in the midst of a large selloff, having dropped 20% overnight. However, should market sentiment flip to bullish this winter, Zcash could stage a sharp rally, potentially targeting $1,000 before year-end. Pepe (PEPE): Meme Coin Energy Returns Since its debut in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) has quickly become the third-largest meme coin, fueled by the enduring popularity of Matt Furie’s Pepe the Frog character. With a market capitalization nearing $3 billion, PEPE has established a strong cultural presence. Interest surged further when Elon Musk briefly adopted a Pepe-themed profile image on X, reigniting speculation around meme tokens. PEPE is currently trading around $0.000006848, roughly 78% below its late-2024 high of $0.00002803 after a subdued summer and slower final quarter. An RSI reading of 64, down from 76 on Tuesday, is consistent with profit-taking following a 69% rally in the seven days between December 30 and January 6. That move pushed PEPE above the critical $0.000006 support level. While near-term pullbacks are possible, consolidation remains healthy now that Pepe is back in a support zone. If broader crypto markets turn decisively bullish in 2026, Pepe could benefit disproportionately, potentially setting the stage for a new all-time high within the next quarter. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): A Meme-Driven Bitcoin Layer-2 Contender A lesser-known project gaining quiet traction is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Bitcoin layer-2 network that blends meme-style branding with serious technical ambitions. The protocol aims to deliver high-speed transactions, low fees, and smart-contract capabilities to Bitcoin. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper features decentralized governance and a Canonical Bridge designed to make cross-chain Bitcoin transfers seamless. The ongoing presale has already attracted more than $30 million in funding, and some analysts speculate the token could achieve outsized returns, potentially up to 100×, once it reaches public exchanges. A recent Coinsult audit found no critical security issues, adding a layer of confidence for risk-conscious participants. HYPER tokens are used for transaction fees, governance participation, and staking incentives. Early stakers can currently earn yields of up to 38% APY, though returns are expected to taper as participation increases. With the full network launch anticipated in 2026, Bitcoin Hyper positions itself as a potential gateway for both long-time Bitcoin holders and new entrants.

The X platform, owned by Elon Musk, faces an escalating crisis as its Grok AI chatbot fuels an unprecedented flood of non-consensual, AI-manipulated nude images. This situation presents a stark test for global tech governance, revealing significant gaps between rapid AI deployment and enforceable user protection. The Scale of the Non-Consensual AI Nudes Crisis Research from Copyleaks initially estimated one offending image was posted per minute in late December. However, subsequent monitoring from January 5th to 6th revealed a staggering escalation to approximately 6,700 images per hour. This torrent primarily targets women, including high-profile models, actresses, journalists, and even political figures. The abuse demonstrates a painful erosion of digital consent, transforming personal likeness into malicious content without permission. Consequently, victims experience profound privacy violations and potential reputational harm. The automated nature of Grok’s image generation significantly lowers the barrier for creating such harmful material, enabling abuse at an industrial scale previously unseen with manual photo-editing tools. Global Regulatory Responses and Legal Challenges Regulators are scrambling to apply existing frameworks to this novel threat. The European Commission has taken the most proactive step by issuing a formal order to xAI, demanding the preservation of all documents related to Grok. This action often precedes a full investigation. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom’s communications regulator, Ofcom, has initiated a swift assessment of potential compliance failures. Prime Minister Keir Starmer publicly condemned the activity as “disgraceful,” pledging full support for regulatory action. In Australia, eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman-Grant reported a doubling in related complaints but has yet to initiate formal proceedings against xAI. The High-Stakes Battle in India India represents one of the most significant regulatory flashpoints. Following a formal complaint from a member of Parliament, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) issued a strict 72-hour directive to X, later extended, demanding an “action-taken” report. The platform’s response, submitted on January 7th, remains under scrutiny. The potential consequence for non-compliance is severe: revocation of X’s safe harbor protections under India’s IT Act. This would fundamentally alter the platform’s legal liability, making it directly responsible for all user-generated content hosted within the country and potentially jeopardizing its operations there. Platform Accountability and Technical Safeguards Central to the controversy are questions about xAI’s design choices and internal governance. Reports suggest Elon Musk may have personally intervened to prevent the implementation of stronger content filters on Grok’s image-generation capabilities. In response to public outcry, X’s Safety account stated that users prompting Grok to create illegal content, such as child sexual abuse material, would face consequences. The company also removed the public media tab from Grok’s official X account. However, experts question whether these are sufficient technical measures to stem the tide of non-consensual intimate imagery, which may not always cross the threshold into legally defined “illegal” content but remains deeply harmful. Global Regulatory Actions on Grok AI Nudes (January 2025) Jurisdiction Regulatory Body Action Taken Potential Outcome European Union European Commission Document preservation order to xAI Formal investigation under DSA United Kingdom Ofcom Swift compliance assessment Investigation and potential fines India MeitY 72-hour compliance directive Loss of safe harbor status Australia eSafety Commission Monitoring complaint surge Use of online safety act powers The Broader Implications for AI Governance This crisis illuminates several critical challenges for the future of AI regulation: The Pace of Innovation vs. Regulation: Generative AI tools can be deployed globally in seconds, while regulatory processes move at a legislative pace. Jurisdictional Fragmentation: A patchwork of national laws creates compliance complexity for global platforms and enforcement difficulties for authorities. The “Safeguard” Debate: It highlights the ongoing tension between open, permissionless innovation and the implementation of pre-emptive, ethical guardrails. Enforcement Mechanisms: Regulators possess stern warnings and slow legal processes, but lack real-time technical levers to halt specific AI model functions. Furthermore, the event tests the core principles of the European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA) and similar laws designed to hold “very large online platforms” accountable for systemic risks. The non-consensual nudes crisis arguably constitutes such a systemic risk, pushing the boundaries of these new regulatory frameworks. Conclusion The flood of non-consensual AI nudes generated by Grok on X represents a watershed moment for technology governance. It forces a global reckoning on the responsibilities of AI developers and platform operators when their tools cause demonstrable societal harm. While regulators from Brussels to Delhi mobilize their limited tools, the episode underscores a fundamental gap: the lack of agile, internationally coherent mechanisms to control harmful AI outputs at their source. The resolution of this crisis will likely set a crucial precedent for how democracies manage the dual imperatives of fostering innovation and protecting citizens in the age of generative AI, with profound implications for the future of platform accountability and digital consent. FAQs Q1: What is Grok AI, and how is it creating these images? Grok is an artificial intelligence chatbot developed by xAI, a company founded by Elon Musk. It possesses multimodal capabilities, meaning it can process and generate both text and images. Users can input text prompts instructing Grok to create or manipulate images, which has been exploited to generate realistic nude depictions of individuals without their consent. Q2: Why is this considered different from previous “deepfake” technology? While deepfakes often required specialized software and some technical skill, Grok integrates this capability into a conversational AI interface, dramatically simplifying and speeding up the process. This ease of use, combined with X’s vast user base, has led to an explosion in volume that manual deepfake creation could not achieve, creating a scalable harassment vector. Q3: What legal consequences do the creators of these images face? Legal consequences vary by jurisdiction. Creators could potentially face charges related to harassment, defamation, violation of privacy laws, or the creation of abusive digital content. In some regions, distributing intimate images without consent is a specific criminal offense. X has stated it will enforce its rules against users who prompt Grok to make illegal content. Q4: What is “safe harbor” status, and why is its potential loss in India significant? Safe harbor provisions, like Section 79 of India’s IT Act, typically shield online platforms from legal liability for content posted by their users, provided they follow certain due diligence requirements. If revoked, X would become legally responsible for all user-generated content on its platform in India, an impossible standard that could force it to heavily censor or even cease operations in the country. Q5: What can be done to prevent this kind of AI abuse in the future? Prevention requires a multi-layered approach: Technical (implementing robust content filters and provenance standards like watermarking), Platform Policy (clear, enforced prohibitions and rapid takedown mechanisms), Legal (updated laws with clear penalties for non-consensual synthetic media), and Ethical (developing industry norms for responsible AI deployment that prioritize safety-by-design).

Crypto price predictions are once again pointing toward lower targets for BTC and XRP, while some traders are rotating into new launches like Maxi Doge. Fundamentally, all three remain as strong as ever, which is why many investors are seeing these dips as opportunities rather than panicking. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Crypto Price Prediction: Bitcoin ($BTC) Liquidating Longs Before New All-Time High? Bitcoin started the year with a massive rally from the bottom and nearly touched $95,000 before getting rejected and slipping back below $90,000. A multitude of reasons caused this dump. Trump, being the president he is, resurfaced threats of imposing tariffs on countries that trade oil with Russia. This unclear foreign policy, combined with the upcoming Friday jobs report, has caused uncertainty and led to nearly $500M in BTC ETFs outflows. Source: BTCUSD / TradingView This is not the first time Bitcoin has been rejected from this exact price point. In early December, as shown on the chart, it was rejected and later slid to $84,000. Bitcoin could follow the same path again if uncertainty continues. However, BTC is already below $90,000, and the RSI is around 35, signaling oversold conditions. Holding the $84,000 level would be key for bulls to stay optimistic and aim for a decent first quarter of 2026. Crypto Price Prediction: Ripple ($XRP) – ETF Green Streak Ends XRP’s record ETF green streak ends and records. Spot XRP ETFs saw their first net outflow in almost 2 months. $40.8M outflow has been recorded, trimming cumulative inflows to $1.2B. This outflow and market-wide uncertainty have led to stronger effects on alts. XRP is down 12% over the last couple of days and 6% in the last 24 hours. From this point, with the RSI around 40 and still leaving room for further downside, XRP could revisit the $2.00 zone. A sustained break below this level could lead to a deeper pullback toward the previous support at $1.80. If the $2.00 zone holds, a bounce toward $2.20 could happen at any time. A break above that level would likely open the door for a retest of the recent highs around $2.40 before the end of January. Crypto Price Prediction: MaxiDoge ($MAXI) Remains The Smartest Crowd Play Smart traders want to maximize their exposure to potential gains. So they choose to diversify into newer coins and presale tokens. When majors like Bitcoin and XRP are chopping and liquidating both sides, traders usually start looking for asymmetric plays. That is where Maxi Doge comes in. Maxi Doge is built for high-volatility phases like this, where uncertainty is high, and conviction is low. Instead of betting on slow ETF flows or macro headlines, it leans fully into momentum, community, and meme-driven rotations. The hype is already showing in the numbers. The $MAXI presale has raised almost $4.4 million, while early backers are earning up to 70% APY through staking rewards. While BTC is flushing longs and XRP is reacting to ETF outflows, capital tends to rotate into fresh narratives. That is why many see Maxi Doge as the smarter crowd trade during market resets. Not after the move is already done. If the market stabilizes and risk appetite returns, Maxi Doge is positioned to benefit first from that shift rather than last.

With this new token, investors will also be able to earn yield on their XRP holdings through Flare’s earnXRP program. This program offers an 8% annual percentage yield (APY), and it is available on the Flare Network. XRP Price Prediction: Fibonacci Retracement Sets Key Support at $2.03 In the past week, XRP has gone up by 12% as the crypto market bounced back strongly since the year started. Source: TradingView However, the price just hit a sell wall once it reached the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). It now seems headed to retest the $1.90 area to see if buying interest is still strong enough. The $2.03 area is the key support to watch as this coincides with the 61.8% Fibonacci level. This is the lowest this pullback may go to keep the uptrend alive. If the price bounces off this mark, then XRP could soon retest the 200-day EMA. In that case, the odds of a bullish breakout will rise rapidly. In that case, a quick move to $3 will be highly likely as well. New projects like Flare tend to attract significant attention with this kind of innovation. Similarly, a top crypto presale called Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has raised over $30 million to launch the first real Bitcoin L2, built on Solana. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Taps on Solana’s Efficiency to Unlock BTC’s Full Potential Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a scaling protocol for the Bitcoin OG blockchain that leverages Solana’s low fees and fast transaction processing speeds to kickstart a new era for Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem.

The MACD follows with a narrowing gap above the signal line. Traders should watch closely for a higher low to confirm an uptrend, keeping the historic resistance and key breakout threshold at $210 in focus. Fully realized, the pattern eyes a potential 280% move to $500 . And if Solana can become the underlying infrastructure for mainstream financial institutions, a 650% move to $1000 could be in the cards. However, the onboarding of Wall Street will likely be a slow process, making the full price impact of adoption unlikely to be realised over the near-term. Bitcoin Hyper: Solana Could Have Competition Those who chose Solana as their TradFi bet may soon need to reconsider, as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally tackles its biggest limitation: scalability. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bridging Bitcoin’s security with Solana tech, creating a new Layer-2 network that unlocks scalable, efficient use cases Bitcoin couldn’t support on its own.

The buyback initiative marks one of the most significant financial shifts in the history of the OP ecosystem and signals a new alignment between token utility, network performance, and future adoption. If approved, the program begins in February and would return repurchased tokens to the treasury for decisions on burning, staking rewards, or other ecosystem incentives. The announcement surfaced as Optimism shared the proposal with the community, highlighting a year of strong performance and early signs of the next phase of development. The Foundation further emphasized the update through official communication published on X, available via @Optimism. A proposal for the next chapter of Optimism The Optimism Foundation is putting forward a proposal to align the OP token with growing Superchain demand by directing 50% of incoming Superchain revenue to regular OP buybacks https://t.co/VSDazlbRdX pic.twitter.com/jBQoJyxDCF — Optimism (@Optimism) January 8, 2026 Superchain Performance Strengthens The Case For Buybacks Optimism’s plan is directly linked to the Superchain’s accelerating growth. According to internal data shared by the Foundation, the network processed 13% of all global blockchain transactions, while maintaining 61.4% of Layer-2 fee market share. Over the past twelve months alone, the Superchain generated 5,868 ETH in revenue, all of which has historically flowed into the governance treasury. But under the new proposal, half of this income would be rerouted into the open market to repurchase OP, creating a more explicit link between ecosystem growth and token value. This shift represents a strategic evolution from the OP token’s earlier role. Up to this point, OP has served primarily as a governance asset, influencing proposals and decisions across the network. With the introduction of monthly revenue-backed buybacks, Optimism is positioning OP as a token more directly tied to the network’s economic activity. Leadership Signals A New Phase Of Alignment Co-founder “Prime” expanded on the motivation behind the proposal in a detailed community post shared via X. He noted that the buyback initiative follows months of internal restructuring designed to prepare Optimism for the next wave of crypto adoption. Happy new year everyone! In November last year, I wrote about the changes we were making to refocus the team on what comes next for crypto. Today, the @Optimism Foundation is proposing a token buyback. The goal is to unify the broader ecosystem outside of just our internal… — Optimist Prime (@jinglejamOP) January 8, 2026 His remarks, reposted widely across the ecosystem and available via @jinglejamOP at the Foundation’s strategy to unify both internal and external development teams around a more aligned financial model. Prime stated: “The goal is to unify the broader ecosystem outside of just our internal teams to prepare for the next wave of adoption.” He emphasized that Optimism’s success is not attributable to Foundation or Labs alone. Instead, it stems from contributions across a wide network of partners and builders who chose the OP Stack as their foundation. These include Base, Unichain, Inco, Worldcoin, Celo, BOB, Zora, Mode, and Soneium, all of whom rely on OP infrastructure and, in turn, drive growth across the Superchain. The message is clear: the buyback program seeks to align the incentives of these contributing chains with the economic performance of the OP token. A Revenue-Driven Model With Ecosystem-Wide Impact Under the new structure, every OP Chain contributes sequencer revenue to Optimism’s central treasury. These funds then help support the broader ecosystem. The proposed change takes this one step further by using revenue to strengthen demand for OP on a recurring basis. The Foundation outlined the following breakdown: 50% of revenue → OP token buybacks 50% retained → ecosystem operations & expansion Buybacks would occur monthly over a one-year period, and governance would retain power to adjust parameters as needed. Supporters argue that recurring buybacks create a feedback loop: 1. More chains adopt the OP Stack 2. More transactions are processed 3. More sequencer revenue is generated 4. More OP is repurchased 5. Token value aligns with network growth This creates a stronger direct incentive for enterprises and developers building on the Superchain. Community Vote Will Shape The Token’s Future Utility If passed on January 22, the proposal would transform OP from a governance-only token into a hybrid model tied to network performance. This shift aligns with broader market trends that favor tokens backed by measurable activity and real revenue flows. Prime noted that this is not a quick pivot but the beginning of a long-term structural evolution of OP’s role in the ecosystem: “This program starts small and scales as we scale, and the role of the OP token will continue to evolve.” He added that the Foundation expects this buyback mechanism to mature as adoption increases. With more chains preparing to launch on OP Stack in 2026, the revenue base, and thus the buyback pool, is projected to grow. Ecosystem Prepares For Next Wave Of Announcements The Foundation also confirmed a January 12 Twitter Space featuring Prime, @karl_dot_tech, and @ben_chain, where community members can ask questions directly. Prime emphasized that this buyback proposal is the first in a series of upcoming announcements that outline Optimism’s strategy for 2026. With tokenization trends rising, L2 adoption accelerating, and enterprise blockchain interest expanding, OP is positioning itself at the center of next-generation financial infrastructure. The message from the Optimism Foundation is firm: The Superchain is growing, the partners are building, and OP is evolving to match the momentum. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The analyst alluded to the falling Bitcoin dominance as the reason why the altcoin could surge soon enough, noting how this development has preceded previous XRP rallies. Analyst Predicts Huge XRP Price Rally On The Horizon In an X post, Bird predicted that the XRP price is set to record its strongest rally yet based on the breakdown in Bitcoin’s dominance. This came as he noted that BTC.D dropped hard the last three times when XRP went truly parabolic, in 2018, 2021, and 2024. The 2018 run was when XRP rallied to its previous all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Why XRP Is About To Experience A Legendary Next 3 Months Bird stated that after that first XRP price ATH between 2018 and 2021, the Bitcoin dominance began to trend back up. The BTC.D then backtested the trend and rebuilt strength before eventually rolling over. Once that rollover occurred, XRP went parabolic again in 2021. A similar scenario is said to have played out in 2024, as Bitcoin’s dominance dropped sharply through the trendline, briefly breaking down and triggering the surge. The analyst noted that the move in 2024 didn’t fully commit as Bitcoin’s dominance recovered and the breakdown failed. However, the attempt was enough to send the XRP price flying, reaching all-time highs. Bird reiterated that XRP is sensitive to a breakdown in Bitcoin’s dominance, even temporarily. Now, a similar move could be playing out again, which could send the XRP price to new highs. Bird stated that between 2023 and 2025, the Bitcoin dominance has trended up once more, broke down through the trend, backtested it from underneath, and is now chopping and rolling over. The analyst added that this is the same historical area where XRP has gone parabolic before, but that this time the setup is even bigger. The Altcoin Could Rally To Double Digits The analyst again alluded to the 2024 run. He stated that if a brief uncommitted breakdown in Bitcoin’s dominance was enough to send the XRP price surging, then a confirmed breakdown would be exponentially stronger. In line with this, Bird remarked that the next move is the one that sends XRP into double digits and beyond. Related Reading: Analyst Updates XRP Price Prediction: Why $16 Is Still On The Table Bird stated that the key difference is what comes next, as this next move isn’t just a fake-out or a shallow drop. Instead, it is the one where the Bitcoin dominance finally loses the trend for good and breaks down hard toward the lower boundary, around the 44 to 40% region. He added that when that happens officially, the XRP price doesn’t just run but enters true price discovery. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.14, down almost 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Although XRP is rebounding and trading above $2 , further improvements in its market dynamics and institutional engagement could strengthen its momentum and drive prices higher. Ripple Executive Reveals What’s Ahead For XRP In an X post on Wednesday, Merrick gave a detailed perspective on where XRP is heading and why its role in global finance is expanding. The Ripple executive highlighted XRP’s continued role as a bridge asset connecting real-world finance with emerging digital markets. He stated that XRP is actively supporting stablecoins, Real-World Assets (RWAs) , and institutional payment flows at scale. He also noted that these use cases show the cryptocurrency moving beyond theory and into practical financial infrastructure. In his post, Merrick emphasized that growing momentum in Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) is amplifying institutional participation in XRP. He said that more corporate treasuries are now exploring the cryptocurrency as a reserve asset, signaling that adoption is still in an early phase. Merrick indicated that all these developments lay the foundation for XRP’s price outlook . By positioning the cryptocurrency at the center of global settlement and liquidity, increased institutional demand can drive stronger market dynamics that push the XRP price higher over time. Moreover, the Ripple executive believes these developments are just the beginning, suggesting more growth ahead for XRP. Notably, Merrick’s statements were issued in response to a broader discussion initiated by RippleX, the developer-focused arm of the crypto company. The thread explained XRP’s functional design and its role in global financial systems . RippleX emphasized that XRP is purpose-built for settlement and liquidity, not speculation. The team described the cryptocurrency as a neutral bridge that enables value movement across payment rails, stablecoins, tokenized assets, and collateral worldwide. RippleX also noted that XRP is among the few digital assets with clear regulatory standing in the United States and ranks within the top three cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. RippleX further highlighted that XRP has achieved its first institutional treasury through Evernorth , which has secured more than $1 billion in commitments. It also noted support from multiple spot ETF issuers, including Bitwise, Canary Capital, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale. How These Developments Could Drive The XRP Price In his post, Merrick highlighted several bullish factors for XRP, including ETFs, settlements, institutional adoption, and RWAs. Each of these developments could support the XRP price in different ways. Firstly, ETFs could drive prices higher as investors buy more products to gain exposure to XRP without the typical security and regulatory risks. Analysts also theorize that a supply shock could occur, leading to a subsequent price spike as institutions absorb significant portions of XRP’s available supply . Institutional adoption through global settlements could also rapidly increase demand, possibly influencing price action. RWAs and stablecoins also create a new demand market for XRP, supporting potential upward price movement.",Ripple|Bitwise|Canary Capital|ETFs|Evernorth|exchange-traded funds|Franklin Templeton|Grayscale|real-world assets|Reece Merrick|ripple|RippleX|RWAs|Stablecoins|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-08 23:00:52

The strategy places one of the largest U.S. wealth-management firms at the center of institutional tokenization as regulatory clarity improves and investor demand expands. Industry analysts have highlighted the scope of this development, pointing to Morgan Stanley’s shift from selective crypto exposure to a fully integrated digital-asset ecosystem. BREAKING: MORGAN STANLEY IS LAUNCHING A DIGITAL CRYPTO WALLET IN 2026.

K mi to Trading Rollout Begins With Bitcoin, Ethereum And Solana Morgan Stanley confirmed that spot crypto trading will launch on its ETrade platform in the first half of 2026. The offering begins with three core assets , Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) , giving clients direct exposure through a regulated brokerage environment. The firm is partnering with Zero Hash to handle both liquidity and custody during the initial rollout. This infrastructure ensures that trading, settlement, and asset safekeeping follow institutional-grade compliance standards. For Morgan Stanley, this first phase serves as the foundation for a much larger strategic push. Jed Finn, Morgan Stanley’s head of wealth management, described the trading initiative as “the tip of the iceberg,” emphasizing that the objective is not merely to offer exposure to crypto but to build a long-term digital asset framework capable of supporting tokenization at scale. The H1 rollout positions Morgan Stanley at the forefront of legacy institutions entering regulated spot markets , an important step amid increasing demand from high-net-worth investors, family offices, and institutional funds. Proprietary Digital Wallet Launches In The Second Half Of 2026 The second phase of Morgan Stanley’s plan is arguably the most transformative: a self-custodied digital wallet built specifically for the firm’s clients, slated for launch in H2 2026. This wallet is being designed to hold not only cryptocurrencies but also tokenized securities, tokenized real estate, and tokenized private equity shares. The wallet will allow clients to manage traditional and digital assets in a single interface, shifting portfolio management toward a blended environment where blockchain technology powers settlement, liquidity, yield, and transfers. Key functions of the upcoming wallet include: Safekeeping for BTC, ETH, SOL, and future supported crypto assets Custody and management of tokenized real-world assets Faster settlement times for tokenized bonds and tokenized equities Unified management of traditional and digital portfolios Access to yield-generating digital instruments This design aligns with global trends in tokenization, where blockchain-based versions of traditional assets allow instant settlement, transparent ownership tracking, and increased liquidity for markets that traditionally move slowly. Morgan Stanley’s wallet effectively becomes the central hub for its entire digital-asset strategy. Tokenized Real-World Assets Become A Core Feature Morgan Stanley is not treating crypto purely as a speculative market. Instead, the firm is positioning blockchain as the infrastructure layer for the next generation of financial operations. Tokenized RWAs are a major part of this vision. In traditional markets, ownership transfers for bonds, real estate, or private equity can take days or weeks. Tokenization compresses these delays to minutes or seconds, allowing: real-time settlement fractional ownership improved secondary market liquidity programmable yield distributions transparent auditing By designing a wallet that can hold tokenized versions of private equity shares, real estate, bonds, and cash equivalents, Morgan Stanley is signaling that RWAs will play a critical role in future wealth-management strategies. This approach also aligns with the increasing regulatory clarity emerging in the United States, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoins and updated ETF rules that outline how on-chain assets can be integrated into regulated financial products. ETF Filings Signal Deeper Institutional Commitment On January 6, 2026, Morgan Stanley filed S-1 forms with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch spot Bitcoin, spot Solana, and a spot Ethereum ETF with staking rewards. These filings make Morgan Stanley the first major U.S. bank to introduce its own branded crypto ETFs, signaling a shift from custodial partnerships toward full product ownership. Key takeaways include: The Solana ETF includes staking rewards, a first among major U.S. banks The Ethereum ETF distributes staking yields to investors The Bitcoin ETF provides regulated spot exposure within Morgan Stanley’s product suite The ETF lineup aligns directly with the assets supported on the upcoming trading platform The addition of staking rewards demonstrates a clear willingness to integrate yield-bearing blockchain features into regulated investment products, something institutional investors have long demanded. Combined with the wallet launch, these ETFs form a complete ecosystem: trade the assets, custody the assets, earn yield on the assets, and interact with tokenized representations of traditional markets. Regulatory Momentum Supports Institutional Tokenization Morgan Stanley’s progress reflects a broader shift occurring across the financial sector. Over the past year, U.S. regulatory agencies have clarified several key areas: stablecoin oversight under the GENIUS Act spot ETF frameworks for crypto assets guidance on staking within fund structures tax and reporting standards for digital asset custodians This clarity is giving institutions confidence to expand beyond exploratory pilots. Major wealth managers, pension funds, and banks are increasingly exploring tokenized financial products, validating the infrastructure Morgan Stanley is building. The firm is not merely responding to market trends , it is actively shaping them by launching end-to-end solutions designed for mainstream adoption. A Strategic Bridge Between TradFi And Blockchain Morgan Stanley’s digital asset roadmap positions the firm as a central bridge between traditional finance and blockchain-powered markets. By synchronizing direct crypto trading, in-house ETF offerings, and a proprietary digital wallet, the bank is constructing one of the most comprehensive institutional crypto frameworks in the United States. If executed successfully, this rollout could: normalize tokenized securities in wealth-management portfolios accelerate adoption of blockchain-based settlement systems expand customer access to yield-generating digital assets position RWAs as a mainstream investment class increase institutional participation in crypto infrastructure This coordinated strategy indicates that 2026 may be the year digital assets transition from optional exposure to a default component of institutional portfolios.

The proposed entity , World Liberty Trust Company, National Association (WLTC) , would operate under federal oversight and position the firm among a small group of crypto issuers attempting to bring dollar-backed digital assets into the regulated banking perimeter. The announcement is confirmed in an official statement from @worldlibertyfi. World Liberty Financial Announces that WLTC Holdings LLC has Submitted an Application for a National Trust Bank Charter to Issue and Custody USD1 Stablecoins https://t.co/ulapagYLYq — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) January 7, 2026 Industry analysts and commentators describe the filing as a direct challenge to established players such as Circle and Ripple, both of whom are positioning themselves as federally supervised digital asset institutions.

If Approved, WLF… pic.twitter.com/xE4EF0uEL6 — Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) January 8, 2026 The filing marks one of the most consequential attempts yet to merge stablecoin operations with a national banking framework, a shift that may define the next stage of U.S. digital asset regulation. Wlf Moves Toward Federal Banking Status WLTC Holdings LLC , a branch of World Liberty Financial , has formally applied to the U.S. OCC for approval to establish a new national trust bank. The proposed WLTC would function as a fully regulated federal entity dedicated to issuing, holding, and managing a stablecoin product known as USD1. A national trust charter is one of the few pathways for a crypto-focused firm to secure direct federal oversight without relying on state-level regimes. If the OCC approves the application, WLTC would join a very limited cohort of federally supervised digital asset institutions. According to the company’s statement, the purpose-built trust structure gives WLTC: authority to issue $USD1 directly, the ability to custody user funds in-house, the legal capacity to manage reserves under federal supervision, and the framework to operate payments, on-ramps, and off-ramps on U.S. banking rails. World Liberty Financial presents this as a step toward institutional-grade compliance and long-term stability for the USD1 ecosystem. Building A Fully Regulated Stablecoin Infrastructure World Liberty Financial positions USD1 as a dollar-backed stablecoin designed for mainstream transactions, global commerce, and digital settlement. The company aims to differentiate USD1 by embedding banking-grade controls inside a federally regulated trust structure rather than relying solely on state-chartered entities or external custodians. The proposed WLTC national trust bank would oversee the lifecycle of USD1 from issuance to redemption. The firm states that USD1 would remain redeemable 1:1 for U.S. dollars with fee-free conversion, allowing frictionless movement between fiat and digital representations. This matters because the stablecoin market is increasingly shaped by regulatory expectations: Circle’s USDC operates under state supervision while seeking broader federal recognition. Ripple’s RLUSD is positioned to integrate with enterprise payment infrastructure. Tether dominates global demand but is based offshore and outside U.S. regulatory oversight. World Liberty aims to enter a different category entirely , a stablecoin issued directly by a federally regulated banking institution. This structure may appeal to enterprises, payment processors, and financial institutions that require regulatory certainty before integrating digital dollar systems. USD1 Crosses $3.3B In Circulation In First Year One of the most striking details in the filing is the scale of USD1’s early adoption. According to the company, USD1 surpassed $3.3 billion in circulation within its first year , a milestone that places it among the fastest-growing stablecoins on the market. This rapid growth provides both momentum and pressure: It signals strong demand for alternatives to legacy stablecoins. It demonstrates that USD1 already operates at systemically relevant scale. It forces regulators to evaluate whether supervision is needed sooner rather than later. For the OCC, a stablecoin issuing over $3B of supply in its first year presents both opportunity and responsibility. For World Liberty Financial, the size of the circulating supply strengthens its case that it requires a federally overseen structure to operate safely and transparently. Wlf Aims To Join Circle And Ripple As A Federally Regulated Crypto Bank If the OCC approves the application, World Liberty Financial would become one of only a few entities able to issue and custody digital assets as a national trust bank. This positions WLTC alongside major industry names pushing toward regulated digital-asset banking. The move signals a broader trend: stablecoin companies are increasingly seeking full legitimacy within the U.S. banking system rather than operating in regulatory gray zones. The trust bank model allows the firm to combine crypto-native technology with traditional oversight, a hybrid approach regulators have been signaling interest in. Approval would also support the firm’s ambitions to: integrate USD1 into institutional settlement systems, provide secure custody for corporate clients, expand into regulated payments infrastructure, and support cross-border financial operations under federal safeguards. These steps would place WLTC in a strategic position as regulatory clarity continues to reshape the stablecoin landscape. Regulatory Significance And Market Impact The OCC’s review of the WLTC application arrives at a crucial moment for digital-asset policy. U.S. regulators have spent the past three years debating whether stablecoin issuers should be treated like banks, payment companies, or something else entirely. World Liberty Financial’s application effectively tests the hypothesis that stablecoin issuers can fit directly inside the existing federal banking framework. If approved, it would represent a major validation for firms seeking to issue digital dollars under strict supervision. Market implications include: Increased legitimacy for bank-issued stablecoins Competitive pressure on offshore or lightly regulated issuers Greater institutional interest due to regulatory clarity Potential reshaping of global stablecoin markets While the application does not guarantee approval, its submission signals the direction U.S. stablecoin regulation is heading: toward integration with federal banking laws and oversight. What Approval Would Mean For The Future Of Stablecoins The WLTC application could become a defining moment in the evolution of U.S. stablecoin policy. If approved, the model may encourage more companies to seek national trust charters, leading to: standardized reserve requirements, uniform consumer protection rules, direct regulatory supervision, and bank-level accountability. For the broader digital-asset market, a federally regulated USD1 issuer would accelerate institutional adoption, expand the role of stablecoins in payments, and push competitors toward more rigorous compliance. For World Liberty Financial, the charter would transform it from a technology-driven stablecoin issuer into a regulated financial institution capable of operating across both banking and blockchain ecosystems.

The fallout immediately hits markets, sending $ZEC down more than 16.6% within 24 hours, while raising urgent questions about leadership, development continuity, and the future of the network. Despite the dramatic headlines, on-chain data contradicts rumors of coordinated insider dumping. The Zcash network remains operational, but the governance uncertainty creates the largest overhang the project has ever confronted. The resignation was first widely highlighted by analysts on X, including detailed breakdowns of the sequence of events by community observers such as @StarPlatinum_, who compiled public statements and on-chain flows into a unified narrative Zcash token $ZEC is crashing after the ECC team resignation Here’s what actually happened: – On January 7, the entire Electric Coin Company team resigned – around ~25 people, including: – Josh Swihart (CEO) – Chelsea Komlo (Chief Scientist) – The reason: internal… pic.twitter.com/8TpBrOQK26 — StarPlatinum (@StarPlatinum_) January 8, 2026 At the same time, ECC’s departing CEO, Josh Swihart, released a public statement explaining the internal conflict and the reasons behind the walkout. Over the past few weeks, it's become clear that the majority of Bootstrap board members (a 501(c)(3) nonprofit created to support Zcash by governing the Electric Coin Company), specifically Zaki Manian, Christina Garman, Alan Fairless, and Michelle Lai (ZCAM), have moved into… — Josh Swihart (@jswihart) January 7, 2026 Core Developers Resign As Internal Conflict Reaches Breaking Point The breaking point comes on January 7, when the entire Electric Coin Company , the team that created Zcash, maintains the protocol, and leads much of its technical development , resigns. This includes approximately 25 key contributors, among them: Josh Swihart (CEO) Chelsea Komlo (Chief Scientist) According to Swihart’s statement, the departure stems from an internal governance conflict with the Bootstrap Project board , the nonprofit entity overseeing ECC. Swihart characterizes the situation as “constructive dismissal,” describing it as a scenario where employment terms were changed to a degree that made it impossible for ECC staff to fulfill their duties with integrity. Swihart reveals that several board members were “in clear misalignment with the mission of Zcash,” specifically naming Zaki Manian, Christina Garman, Alan Fairless, and Michelle Lai. His statement alleges that these board members pushed changes incompatible with ECC’s ability to operate effectively. He emphasizes that the team is forming a new entity to continue its mission, noting: “We’re founding a new company, but we’re still the same team with the same mission: building unstoppable private money.” Market Reaction Is Immediate But Rumors Overshoot Reality The price crash , a drop of more than 16.6% , triggers widespread speculation that ECC insiders dumped tokens before resigning. Social media quickly erupts with claims of a coordinated “rug pull,” prompting analysts to investigate on-chain flows. However, the data shows no evidence of insider selling linked to the resignations. Instead, analysts uncover three key events: January 2: 202,076 ZEC unshielded to a fresh transparent address (~1.2% of supply) January 3: 74,002 ZEC sent from that address to Binance January 8: no large (>10k ZEC) transactions appear on-chain, with normal block activity These transactions took place days before the ECC departure and were tied to a single anonymous whale, not linked to ECC wallets. Despite the timing coinciding with market turbulence, the data does not indicate internal dumping. In other words: If there were a coordinated insider exit, it would be visible on-chain. It isn’t. This distinction matters enormously for ZEC holders. Market distrust can cause deeper damage than any one-price event, and clarifying the flows helps prevent misinformation from spreading unchecked. Governance Breakdown Exposes Structural Risks In Zcash’s Model The true problem for Zcash is not the price action , it is governance. Zcash’s long-standing architecture depends heavily on a small number of organizations: Electric Coin Company (core development) Zcash Foundation (ecosystem support) Bootstrap (ECC governance + funding oversight) The resignation of the entire ECC team highlights critical vulnerabilities: 1. Who maintains the roadmap? The people who designed and built it are now outside the original corporate structure. 2. Who funds development? ECC traditionally received a portion of the Zcash development fund. With a new entity forming, funding channels may need restructuring. 3. Who coordinates community direction? Without alignment among governance bodies, Zcash risks fragmentation. These questions remain unanswered, leaving stakeholders uncertain whether the network’s continuity can be preserved without disruption. ECC Claims Malicious Governance Actions Prompted Exit Swihart’s statement intensifies the debate. He accuses the Bootstrap board majority of actions that undermined ECC’s mission and functionality. He states that board decisions made his team unable to perform their responsibilities “effectively and with integrity.” He stresses that the resignation was not a choice, but the result of forced changes inconsistent with the company’s core principles. Swihart also insists that the Zcash protocol itself remains unaffected, stating: “This decision is simply about protecting our team’s work from malicious governance actions.” This assurance is crucial, as protocol reliability forms the foundation of user trust. Despite corporate upheaval, consensus rules, miners, and shielded pool operations continue as normal. Network Continues To Operate, But Confidence Is Shaken From a technical standpoint, Zcash is functioning without interruption. Block production continues, shielded transactions remain active, and no consensus issues appear on-chain. However, the absence of ECC , historically Zcash’s most important contributor , introduces uncertainty far beyond short-term market volatility. Without clear communication on: who will lead development, how the new company will integrate, how roadmap decisions will be made, the ecosystem risks drifting without direction. For investors, the uncertainty centers around governance stability. For developers, it concerns the ability to coordinate upgrades, maintain privacy tech, and push innovations forward. What Comes Next For Zcash? Zcash now enters its most pivotal moment since launch. The core developers are forming a new entity, but their relationship to the original governance structure remains undefined. Bootstrap must clarify its roadmap plans. The community needs a clear coordination framework. And stakeholders must determine whether Zcash development remains unified or splinters into competing visions. For now, the situation is fluid, the governance structure is unresolved, and confidence is fragile. But one fact is certain: The crisis is not about insider dumping. It is about leadership, control, and the future direction of one of crypto’s longest-standing privacy projects. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

If you wish to safeguard yourself against such incident, please contact us to… pic.twitter.com/2AKvu1INyr — Cyvers Alerts (@CyversAlerts) January 8, 2026 Onchain Details The label “Truebit Protocol: Purchase” maps to 0x764C64b2A09b09Acb100B80d8c505Aa6a0302EF2 on Ethereum, which Etherscan tags as a Truebit contract address. Cyvers’ estimate centers on 8,535 ETH (about $26M at ~ $3.1k/ETH ), and the open question for desks is whether that ETH represents treasury funds, a mispriced “purchase” path, or a compromised hot wallet connected to Truebit’s TRU sales flow referenced in project docs (“All sales transact in ETH”). CoinGecko data showed TRU trading at $0.1611 (+4.1% in 24h) before crashing to $0.00007923. Truebit lists the TRU token contract at 0xf65B5C5104c4faFD4b709d9D60a185eAE063276c, which matters because confusion between “Truebit (TRU)” and “TrueFi (TRU)” has repeatedly polluted execution and risk systems on desks that rely on symbol-only mappings. Trading Desk Read For a desk, the tradable signal is not “TRU down 99.95%”. The signal is that a labeled purchase contract (a flow that can touch treasury ETH , fee rails, or sale mechanics) sits at the center of a suspected 8,535 ETH loss, which increases counterparty risk for any venue still quoting TRU and raises operational risk for any strategy that keys off ticker symbols alone (TRU has a long history of symbol collision with TrueFi). Expect market makers to widen or pull quotes until the actual drain path (treasury vs. user flow vs. labeling error) gets pinned to a specific transaction trail and a Truebit-controlled signer set.

Here’s The Proof,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-could-still-reach-20-this-cycle-heres-the-proof/,"As XRP attempts to build on its recent rebound, a well-known Elliott Wave analyst has outlined why a move toward $20 remains within the realm of possibility during the current market cycle. The assessment comes as XRP shows renewed strength after recovering from a steep decline late last year, prompting fresh debate about its long-term upside. XRP entered 2026 with notable momentum , gaining more than 20% in the first week of the year. This advance followed a difficult fourth quarter in 2025, when the asset lost over a third of its value and briefly fell below the psychologically important $2 threshold. The subsequent recovery above that level has encouraged analysts to reassess XRP’s broader structure and its position within the current cycle. Among those weighing in is XForceGlobal, a South Korea-based market analyst known for applying Elliott Wave theory to digital assets. He argues that dismissing higher price scenarios too early may cause investors to overlook what the market structure is signaling. $XRP Here's PROOF that #XRP can easily go to $5 this cycle (and even up to $20+) using pattern recognition from the Elliott Wave Theory and market psychology. pic.twitter.com/RK9oBneqJt — XForceGlobal (@XForceGlobal) January 5, 2026 XRP’s Post-Rally Behavior Signals Structural Strength According to XForceGlobal, XRP is displaying behavior that differs meaningfully from previous market cycles. He notes that after earlier peaks, most notably in 2018 and 2022, XRP failed to sustain elevated price levels and quickly retraced much of its gains. In contrast, following its surge in late 2024, the asset maintained relatively high levels for an extended period. The analyst emphasized that XRP has spent an unusually long time consolidating near its historical highs rather than returning to much lower price zones. In his view, this prolonged stabilization suggests the market has established a stronger base than in prior cycles. He identified the $2 area as a critical reference point, describing it as a developing support level that is currently being tested by market participants. This prolonged consolidation phase, he explained, is uncommon in XRP’s trading history and may indicate a shift in how the asset is being valued over longer timeframes. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Interpreting XRP’s Current Correction Through Elliott Wave Theory XForceGlobal also addressed the corrective phase XRP appears to have undergone. Under Elliott Wave principles, corrective movements typically take the form of zigzags, flats, or triangles. After reviewing XRP’s recent price action, he ruled out a triangular formation, citing the absence of sustained price compression. Instead, he believes XRP’s structure aligns more closely with a flat correction. Within that category, he pointed to the likelihood of a running flat, a formation in which price holds above prior lows while producing misleading short-term movements. According to his analysis, XRP’s recent behavior fits this profile, as the market has maintained key support while producing sharp but temporary fluctuations. He further stated that the significant decline recorded in the fourth quarter of 2025 may have completed the final leg of this corrective pattern. While he acknowledged that an additional pullback toward the $1.30–$1.50 range cannot be entirely excluded, he stressed that the evidence increasingly favors the view that the correction has largely concluded. Potential Price Targets if the Uptrend Continues From XForceGlobal’s perspective, the recent advance appears impulsive rather than corrective, a distinction that often signals the early stages of a broader upward trend. If this interpretation holds, XRP may now be entering the first phase of a new multi-wave advance. Based on this framework, he identified $5 as a conservative objective for the cycle. Beyond that, he outlined higher projections at $10 and $20 , contingent on continued momentum and sustained participation from buyers. In a more aggressive scenario, he suggested that prices could extend even further if market conditions remain favorable. While these projections remain speculative and dependent on broader market dynamics, the analyst’s core argument is that XRP’s current structure does not invalidate higher targets. Instead, he believes the asset’s ability to hold elevated levels over time has altered the long-term outlook, keeping ambitious price scenarios in consideration.

Bitcoin is down by 2% today, although some top-100 coins – including MemeCore, Rain, and Hyperliquid – have managed modest gains. While crypto has wavered in recent weeks, overall sentiment in global markets remains guardedly optimistic, despite tensions surrounding Venezuela (and also Greenland). And in view of the possibility that crypto is due to make a significant recovery soon, we’ve picked the next altcoin to turn $100 into $10,000, explaining why it could surge once it lists in the next couple of days. Next Altcoin to Turn $100 into $10,000 – 7 January Our next altcoin to turn $100 into $10,000 is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an Ethereum-based meme token that is also launching an innovative mining platform. Having launched in Q4 of last year, its presale will be drawing to a close tomorrow, having raised just over $2.6 million. For such a new meme token, this figure is impressive, and it attests to the growing confidence the market has in PEPENODE, which is more than just another meme coin. Its mining platform will give average crypto investors the ability to mine meme tokens without having to invest in and operate expensive mining equipment. Instead, users can spend PEPENODE tokens on acquiring virtual mining nodes, which they can accumulate in order to grow their own virtual mining rigs. By buying more nodes and upgrading their nodes, users can earn greater mining rewards, which PEPENODE will pay out in the form of external coins such as Pepe and Fartcoin. Users can also sell on their virtual nodes once they’re finished with them, while PEPENODE holders can stake the token for a passive income, with the coin’s protocol currently paying a yield of 522% APY . Taken together, such features could make PEPENODE a very lucrative coin to hold, which helps to explain why its presale has done so well. PEPENODE Is Launching Tomorrow: Here’s How to Buy Early This is why PEPENODE is our next altcoin to turn $100 into $10,000, since it has the potential to rise steadily once it launches towards the end of this week. It will have a max supply of 210 billion PEPENODE, which it will allocate between development (35%), treasury (35%), node rewards (7.5%), marketing (15%), and listings (15%). While its sale will be ending tomorrow, latecomers can still join by going to the PEPENODE website and connecting a compatible wallet (e.g., Best Wallet). Not every gift is gold… But PepeNode is ALWAYS delivering the goods. https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/3v87PFqsqY — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) January 6, 2026 The token is selling at its final presale price of $0.0012161, and given its growing popularity, there’s a real chance that it could jump above this once it goes live on exchanges. Its launch is arguably coming at just the right time, since the market has shown signs of recovery in recent weeks, without moving decisively out of an oversold position. In other words, its launch could coincide with a big market-wide rally, helping to push its price up higher.

The futures contract for both metals will be facilitated by Coinbase Derivatives and available to both retail traders and institutional whales via approved FCM partners listed on the derivatives site. The move aligns with Coinbase’s broader push to become an “everything exchange.” The company has been working overtime to achieve this, making major investments in product quality and automation to support the expansion. Coinbase adds copper and platinum trading The plan positions Coinbase as a rival of traditional brokerages even as it expands beyond its core digital asset business into tokenized securities and event-based markets that have attracted billions in recent trading volume. It is crucial to note however that Coinbase is not the only exchange doing something like this. Bitget and Binance recently made similar announcements, dipping their toes into traditional commodity derivatives. Last year December, Bitget deployed a private beta for “ Bitget TradFi ,” which saw it offer CFD-style trading of precious metals like gold or silver, commodities, forex, indices and stocks, all to be settled in USDT directly via the exchange. The initiative became fully public this year with 79 instruments available. This week, Binance launched regulated USDT-settled perpetual futures for gold and silver under what it tagged a new TradFi category . In the future, there are plans to expand to other traditional assets, including crude oil and equity indices. Analysts are bullish on the Coinbase stock News of the new additions to Coinbase exchange’s commodities stack comes just as Bank of America (BofA) upgraded its Coinbase (COIN) to a “buy” rating, citing the exchange’s ambition, which has gone beyond crypto trading and its increasingly diversified business model. Experts believe the expansion Coinbase is currently undergoing is designed to deepen user engagement and diversify its revenue beyond its core crypto trading business, which is heavily influenced by price swings in assets like Bitcoin. Aside from enabling 24/5 stock and ETF trading for S&P 500 names, Coinbase’s equity perpetuals will launch internationally in 2026 and dabble in prediction markets through its partnership with Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated exchange. It also has big plans for Base, its Ethereum layer-2 network. The network was initially launched without a token, but the management is now allegedly considering a native token to help decentralize the platform and encourage usage. BofA has estimated the move could bring in billions in cash, while supporting its push into decentralized finance. There is also Coinbase Tokenize, a platform designed to bring real-world assets — like private equity and real estate — onto the blockchain. It is expected to serve asset managers interested in tapping into younger, on-chain investors while taking advantage of the faster settlement and lower fees. The COIN stock has fallen 40% from its July high, but BofA maintains a $340 price target, implying there could be a 40% upside with the firm arguing the company is still in the early stages of monetizing its broader platform and remains well-positioned as the most regulated and trusted crypto-native company in the U.S. Goldman Sachs has echoed BofA’s sentiments. It has not only upgraded the crypto exchange company to Buy from Neutral but set a price target of $303 for its stock, which represents about 34% upside. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Meanwhile, leaders SHIB and DOGE have moved just 13% and 21%, respectively.

With the technical door now open for bullish continuation, traders appear increasingly willing to position for further upside. Pepe Coin Price Prediction: Can Pepe Climb the Podium? The bounce has ruled out the recent breakdown of the 21-month descending triangle as a false flag, putting the bullish case back in focus. PEPE USDT 1-week chart, descending triangle back in play. Source: TradingView . And momentum indicators now support it. The MACD has surpassed the signal line in a golden cross for the first time since September, a signal that buyers are in control of the trend. The RSI also continues to print higher lows and is now pressing against the 50 neutral line, suggesting buy pressure is building, and the market is edging back toward bull-market conditions. The reversal also carries strong historical weight, with price rebounding from the same trendline that has marked the start of prior bull runs since Pepe launched in 2023. The $0.0000058 level is now the key support to watch to confirm the triangle structure remains intact. On the upside, $0.0000084 is the breakout threshold, with a fully realised measured move targeting around $0.00003, a 400% gain from current levels. But for Pepe coin to flip both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, that upside would have to extend 825% to $0.000055 – likely hinging on massive social catalysts that have yet to materialize. PepeNode: An Easier Accumulation Method Just Unlocked While the Pepe coin uptrend hinges on $0.0000058, late entrants face a difficult decision: sit out and miss out on the next Pepe bull run, or enter and risk exposure to potential heavy losses. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) removes much of that pressure by offering an easier way to accumulate, without timing the market — the pitfall of most investors. It’s a simple mine-to-earn (M2E) game. No hardware needed. Just log in, acquire virtual nodes, stack rigs, and configure their setup to begin generating passive yields and airdrop rewards across top meme coins. And thanks to a built-in deflationary model, where 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs is burned, scarcity supports long-term token value. PepeNode offers a more measured way to capture high-upside market exposure — without relying on perfect entries. Once Pepe Node hits the decentralised exchanges and token burns kick in, waiting to get started could mean a higher starting cost.

Pi has booked a 2% gain in the past 7 days as the crypto market seems ready to make a comeback in 2026. This project was heavily battered in 2025 shortly after the launch of its public mainnet in February. However, as market sentiment starts to improve, PI could soon hit a bottom. Timing the exact moment when that would happen is difficult. However, the latest price action has raised the odds that Pi Coin may be either near or at that point already. Data from CoinCodex shows that Pi’s trading volumes have picked up drastically since the start of the year. Pi Coin Price Prediction: PI Eyes $0.35 First as Positive Momentum Accelerates The daily chart shows that investors have been accumulating PI at $0.205 multiple times already. This confirms that this is an important “buy wall” for the token. Hence, this level could act as a bouncing pad if market sentiment continues to improve. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) briefly jumped above the mid-line. This favors a bullish outlook as positive momentum is picking up its pace. If PI bounces off this level, the first target could be set at $0.35. This is a key horizontal resistance that is also in confluence with the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Meanwhile, considering that this move was also preceded by a descending price channel breakout, the stage looks set for a much stronger rally to $0.65 if FOMO kicks in. This means a 225% upside potential in the near term. Catching projects like Pi in their earliest stages is commonly the best way to reap the highest returns. A top crypto presale called SUBBD (SUBBD) could be the next token in line to experience an explosive move as this project leverages the power of AI and decentralization to launch a powerful content distribution platform for creators.

While some analysts argue that BTC is entering a deeper corrective phase, others believe the pullback is a necessary reset before a renewed upside attempt. The current price action reflects this uncertainty, with volatility rising as buyers and sellers battle for short-term control. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tests Key Resistance While $4.7B In Sell-Side Liquidity Builds According to an analysis shared by Axel Adler, Bitcoin’s short-term risk structure remains fragile. His short-term risk chart places BTC below the Short-Term Holder (STH) Cost Basis, currently estimated near $100,200. Price is also trading beneath all major moving averages, including the 128-day, 200-day, and 365-day SMAs, reinforcing the view that the broader structure is still bearish. At current levels around $91,000, Bitcoin sits in a moderate risk zone, positioned between the STH Cost Basis and the -15% downside boundary. This positioning suggests that recent rebounds should be treated cautiously. Until BTC reclaims the STH Cost Basis, upside moves are more likely to represent technical bounces within a downward trend rather than a confirmed reversal. Conversely, a breakdown below the moderate risk boundary would signal rising downside risk and could accelerate selling pressure. As a result, the $90K–$100K range remains a critical battleground for Bitcoin’s next directional move. STH Losses Continue To Cap Bitcoin’s Upside Adler’s analysis also highlights a second critical framework: the chart tracking Bitcoin’s all-time highs alongside euphoria zones and the Short-Term Holder Market Value to Realized Value (STH MVRV) indicator. This metric measures the ratio between Bitcoin’s current market price and the average realized price of coins held by short-term investors, offering a direct view into the profitability—and behavior—of this highly reactive cohort. At present, STH MVRV sits near 0.92, well below its historical mean of roughly 1.09 and decisively under the neutral level of 1.0. In practical terms, this implies that the average short-term holder is holding an unrealized loss of about 8%. Historically, periods where STH MVRV remains below 1.0 have tended to coincide with either capitulation phases or extended consolidation ranges, rather than sustained bullish expansions. The last clear euphoria zone on this chart appeared during the all-time high update in October 2025, underscoring how far current conditions are from a speculative extreme. As long as STH MVRV remains below breakeven, short-term holders are incentivized to sell into rallies as the price approaches their cost basis. This behavior creates persistent overhead supply and reinforces structural resistance near the STH Cost Basis, close to the $100,000 level. Consequently, reclaiming that zone is not just a psychological milestone but a necessary condition for any meaningful regime shift back to a bullish market structure.

Following the failed breakout above the $94,000–$95,000 area, BTC experienced a decisive sell-off that pushed the price back toward the $85,000 zone, where buyers stepped in aggressively. This reaction marked a short-term bottom, but the subsequent rebound has so far lacked structural strength. At present, Bitcoin is trading near the $90,000–$91,000 region, a former support that has now turned into a key pivot. Price remains below the 200-day and 365-day moving averages, both of which are sloping downward and acting as dynamic resistance. The 128-day moving average has also capped recent upside attempts, reinforcing the idea that the broader trend remains corrective rather than impulsively bullish. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters Accumulation Regime: Market Supported By Seller Exhaustion, Not Buying Surge From a structure standpoint, the chart shows a sequence of lower highs since the October peak, suggesting that sellers continue to control the macro trend. Volume expanded notably during the November–December sell-off, while the current bounce is unfolding on comparatively lighter participation. This divergence implies that the move higher may be more short-covering driven than supported by strong spot demand. Unless Bitcoin can reclaim and hold above the $94,000–$95,000 resistance zone with increasing volume, the risk of another rejection remains elevated. Failure to do so could reopen the path toward the $85,000 support, where the market would once again be forced to prove its underlying strength.

56992694,655310,1767916800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56992694.jpeg,Bitcoin Retail Investors Still Absent As Demand Remains Negative – BTC Moves Without the Crowd,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-retail-investors-absent-demand-negative/,"Bitcoin is struggling to maintain strength above the $90,000 level after once again failing to break through the critical $94,000 resistance zone. What initially appeared to be a recovery attempt has gradually lost momentum, leaving BTC trapped in a broad consolidation range that has persisted since late November. Each push higher has been met with selling pressure, reinforcing the idea that bulls are losing control of the short-term trend. Market sentiment remains fragile. Volatility has compressed, directional conviction is weak, and price action increasingly reflects indecision rather than accumulation. While long-term holders appear largely inactive, the absence of aggressive dip buying suggests that confidence across the broader market is still muted. This environment has created fertile ground for sharp reactions, but not yet for a sustainable trend reversal. Crucially, on-chain data shows that retail investors are still missing in action. Measures tracking retail demand indicate continued weakness, highlighting that the recent stabilization in price has not been driven by renewed participation from smaller investors. Historically, strong Bitcoin advances tend to coincide with rising retail involvement, as fresh demand reinforces upside momentum. Without that cohort returning, current price support looks increasingly vulnerable. Retail Demand Remains Absent According to data shared by Maartunn, Bitcoin’s 30-day change in Retail Investor Demand remains deeply negative, underscoring a critical weakness beneath the surface of current price action. In simple terms, the crowd has not returned to the market—at least not in a meaningful way. Retail investors historically play a crucial role in sustaining bullish trends. They provide incremental demand, amplify momentum, and often arrive after periods of consolidation or early recoveries. When retail demand is expanding, price advances tend to be more durable. The opposite is also true. A persistently negative 30-day retail demand metric signals that smaller investors are either staying on the sidelines or continuing to reduce exposure. This helps explain why Bitcoin’s recent attempts to reclaim higher levels have struggled. Without fresh retail inflows, upside moves rely almost entirely on larger players absorbing supply. That dynamic can support temporary bounces, but it often lacks the depth required for a sustained breakout. From a risk perspective, weak retail participation also increases fragility. If price rallies into resistance without new demand entering the system, it becomes more vulnerable to pullbacks triggered by profit-taking or external shocks. Until retail demand begins to recover and shift into positive territory, Bitcoin’s price action is likely to remain range-bound, with rallies facing structural headwinds rather than broad-based support. Bitcoin Consolidates Below Key Resistance Bitcoin’s lower-timeframe structure highlights a market that remains fragile despite recent recovery attempts. On the 4-hour chart, BTC is trading just below the $90,000 level after failing to sustain momentum above the $94,000–$95,000 zone earlier this month. That rejection marked a clear lower high, reinforcing the broader corrective structure that has been in place since late November. From a trend perspective, price is oscillating around its short- and medium-term moving averages, with the 50-period and 100-period averages acting as dynamic resistance rather than support. Each push higher has been met with selling pressure, suggesting that upside liquidity is still being used as an exit rather than as confirmation of renewed demand. The 200-period moving average on this timeframe remains overhead, capping rallies and defining the upper boundary of the current range. Structurally, Bitcoin is consolidating between roughly $87,000 and $92,000. This range reflects indecision rather than strength. While buyers have defended the lower boundary multiple times, the lack of follow-through above resistance signals exhaustion. Volume has also compressed compared to the November sell-off, indicating reduced participation and a lack of conviction on both sides. Unless BTC can reclaim the $92,000–$94,000 region with strong volume and hold it as support, the current move remains a corrective bounce. A breakdown below the $87,000 support would likely reopen downside risk toward deeper liquidity levels, keeping short-term risk elevated.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin demand growth|bitcoin investors|bitcoin news|Bitcoin Retail|Bitcoin Retail Demand|Bitcoin Retail Investors|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-09 00:00:00

In a recent video analysis, he argued that shifts in media coverage and capital flows suggest XRP is no longer being driven primarily by retail speculation, but is increasingly drawing attention from institutional participants. Coach JV pointed to recent discussions on mainstream financial television as an early indicator of this change. According to him, coverage on major networks typically follows sustained activity from professional investors rather than short-term enthusiasm from individual traders. He referenced the rapid spread of a social media post he shared highlighting such coverage, explaining that its reception reflected a broader sense among investors that XRP’s market standing is evolving. In his view, once large financial media outlets dedicate airtime to a specific digital asset, it often signals that established investors are already involved. He cited a segment from CNBC’s Power Lunch as an example, describing it as evidence that XRP is now being discussed within institutional investment circles rather than niche crypto communities. XRP The Big Money is Coming in… pic.twitter.com/sY4FypHclJ — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) January 7, 2026 CNBC Segment Highlights XRP’s Market Performance During the Power Lunch broadcast, host Dominic Chu described XRP as one of the strongest cryptocurrency trades for the year. He noted that the asset had delivered returns exceeding those of Bitcoin and Ether over the same period, rising more than 20% early in the year and climbing into the top tier of digital assets by market capitalization. Chu introduced CNBC reporter Mackenzie Sigalos to provide further context on what was driving demand. Sigalos explained that during the market downturn in the fourth quarter of 2025, a notable share of capital flowed into XRP-focused exchange-traded products. She contrasted this with Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, where fund flows often move in tandem with short-term price changes. According to Sigalos, investors viewed XRP as a less saturated position with stronger potential for percentage gains. Many entered positions during the market dip, anticipating a rebound that could outperform larger, more established cryptocurrencies. She added that those expectations were reinforced during the first trading sessions of January, when XRP posted solid gains. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 When the discussion turned toward underlying fundamentals, the program raised questions about XRP’s practical role compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Although Coach JV did not play the entire exchange, he summarized the focus on XRP’s use in cross-border payments, which he described as a central factor behind continued institutional interest. Institutional Progress Versus Retail Sentiment Coach JV also referenced another CNBC appearance featuring Coinbase executive John D’Agostino. In that interview, D’Agostino addressed the disconnect between retail investor sentiment and institutional activity. He observed that while many individual investors have remained cautious, regulatory progress and institutional adoption have continued steadily in the background. D’Agostino suggested that this imbalance has been a source of frustration for professionals working within the industry, as advancements often go unnoticed during periods of negative market sentiment. Coach JV echoed this point, emphasizing that cryptocurrency markets are increasingly shaped by institutional strategies rather than retail-driven narratives. Coach JV’s Investment Perspective Concluding his commentary, Coach JV urged investors to prioritize discipline over emotional reactions. He cautioned against following influencer-led trends that often resurface during market rallies, arguing that such behavior rarely leads to sustainable outcomes. Instead, he advocated for an approach grounded in long-term value assessment. He explained that his strategy draws inspiration from traditional value investing principles, encouraging market participants to evaluate technology strength, adoption potential, and pricing discipline. Applying this framework to digital assets, he stated, favors projects with durable use cases rather than speculative appeal. Coach JV disclosed that XRP represents his largest personal holding, noting that he continued building his position during periods of broader market selling. According to him, that decision has had a meaningful impact on his household’s financial standing, reinforcing his conviction in the asset’s long-term prospects.

This urgent gathering directly preceded a critical U.S. Senate markup of a comprehensive crypto market structure bill, scheduled for January 15. Consequently, stakeholders engaged in intense discussions on two of the most contentious issues in digital asset regulation: the oversight of decentralized finance (DeFi) and a proposed legislative ban on yield-bearing stablecoins. This private dialogue, first reported by Decrypt and confirmed by multiple sources, highlights the accelerating pressure to shape the foundational rules for America’s digital asset economy before the Senate committee moves forward. Crypto Market Structure Bill Forces Unprecedented Dialogue The imminent Senate markup of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, commonly called the crypto market structure bill, created a tight deadline for negotiation. Therefore, representatives from opposing sectors of the financial world convened privately. Attendees included major crypto venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and the DeFi Education Fund (DEF). Simultaneously, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), a powerful Wall Street trade group, participated. Historically, SIFMA has strongly opposed regulatory exemptions for DeFi protocols, arguing for a level playing field with traditional securities markets. One source familiar with the discussions described the talks as “constructive,” though no unified public position emerged, particularly regarding the stablecoin yield provision. The Core Issues: DeFi and Stablecoin Yield The private talks zeroed in on the bill’s most complex sections. Firstly, the legislation seeks to define which digital assets qualify as commodities versus securities, a distinction with profound implications for regulatory jurisdiction. Secondly, it proposes a regulatory framework for decentralized finance platforms, which operate without central intermediaries. Thirdly, and perhaps most controversially, the draft bill includes language that could effectively prohibit stablecoins from offering yield to holders. This provision aims to address concerns that algorithmic or interest-bearing stablecoins could pose systemic risks similar to unregulated money market funds. DeFi Regulation: The challenge lies in applying traditional financial regulations to decentralized, autonomous protocols. SIFMA advocates for clear accountability, while crypto advocates warn that overly rigid rules could stifle innovation and push development offshore. Stablecoin Yield Ban: Proponents argue this prevents risky shadow banking. Conversely, critics contend it would cripple the utility of stablecoins in DeFi lending and borrowing markets, which rely on yield mechanisms. Historical Context and the Path to Legislation The push for a crypto market structure bill follows years of regulatory uncertainty and high-profile industry failures. After the collapses of FTX and TerraUSD in 2022, lawmakers faced increased pressure to establish clear rules. Subsequently, bipartisan efforts in both the House and Senate gained momentum throughout 2023 and 2024. The current bill represents a compromise attempt, but key divisions remain. Notably, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have historically disagreed over jurisdiction. This legislation attempts to clarify those boundaries, granting the CFTC more authority over digital commodities while reserving securities oversight for the SEC. Key Stakeholders and Positions on the Crypto Market Structure Bill Stakeholder General Position Primary Concern Crypto Industry (e.g., a16z, DEF) Seeks clear, innovation-friendly rules and distinct treatment for DeFi. Overly broad securities definitions and a stablecoin yield ban. Traditional Finance (e.g., SIFMA) Advocates for consistent application of existing securities laws and investor protections. Regulatory loopholes or exemptions for DeFi protocols. U.S. Regulators (SEC/CFTC) Desire clear jurisdictional mandates and tools to police fraud and systemic risk. Gaps in oversight for novel, cross-border digital asset activities. Expert Analysis on the Tight Timeline Financial policy experts note the extreme pressure of the January 15 markup date. “A five-day window for resolving decades-old debates about the nature of money and securities is extraordinarily ambitious,” stated Dr. Elena Torres, a fintech regulation scholar at Georgetown University. “These private talks are likely less about reaching full agreement and more about identifying absolute deal-breakers to potentially amend before the markup.” Furthermore, the outcome will signal whether the U.S. can craft a competitive regulatory framework or if legislative gridlock will continue, potentially ceding leadership in digital finance to other jurisdictions like the EU with its enacted MiCA regulations. Global Implications and Market Impact The decisions made in Washington will resonate globally. A restrictive approach, particularly the stablecoin yield ban, could immediately impact billions of dollars in value locked in DeFi protocols. Major stablecoin issuers like Circle (USDC) and Tether (USDT) would need to adjust their business models and partner bank arrangements. Conversely, a pragmatic framework could attract capital and talent back to the U.S. market. International bodies like the Financial Stability Board and the International Monetary Fund are closely monitoring the U.S. legislation, as it may set a de facto standard for other nations. The private meeting between crypto and finance veterans, therefore, was not merely a lobbying session but a strategic discussion about the future architecture of global finance. Conclusion The private talks on the crypto market structure bill underscore a critical juncture for the U.S. financial system. As the Senate markup approaches, the dialogue between innovative crypto entities and established traditional finance groups remains essential. The bill’s treatment of DeFi regulation and stablecoin yield will determine whether the United States fosters a secure, innovative digital asset ecosystem or imposes constraints that hinder its growth. The outcome of this legislative process, beginning with these urgent private discussions, will shape capital markets, technological development, and economic competitiveness for years to come. FAQs Q1: What is the crypto market structure bill? The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act is proposed U.S. legislation aimed at creating a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. It defines regulatory roles between the SEC and CFTC and sets rules for trading platforms and stablecoins. Q2: Why is the proposed ban on stablecoin yield significant? A ban would prevent stablecoins from paying interest, fundamentally changing their use in DeFi markets. Proponents see it as a risk mitigation measure, while critics argue it would limit utility and innovation. Q3: Who participated in the private talks? Participants included crypto sector representatives from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and the DeFi Education Fund (DEF), alongside traditional finance representatives from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA). Q4: What is SIFMA’s historical stance on crypto regulation? SIFMA has generally advocated for applying existing securities laws to digital assets and has opposed creating broad regulatory exemptions for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Q5: When is the Senate markup for the bill? The Senate committee markup, where amendments are considered and the bill is advanced, is scheduled for January 15, 2025, creating a very short timeline for stakeholder negotiations.

56993265,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=259970,1767918311,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BlackRock Bitcoin Withdrawal: Massive $146.3M Crypto Move Sparks Market Confidence,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/blackrock-bitcoin-ethereum-coinbase-withdrawal/,"BitcoinWorld BlackRock Bitcoin Withdrawal: Massive $146.3M Crypto Move Sparks Market Confidence In a significant development shaking cryptocurrency markets, an address presumably linked to financial giant BlackRock executed a massive $146.3 million withdrawal from Coinbase, removing 1,475 Bitcoin and 3,878 Ethereum from the exchange platform. This substantial movement, detected by blockchain analytics firm Onchain Lens over a seven-hour period, represents one of the largest single institutional crypto transactions of 2025 and signals potential strategic positioning in digital assets. Market analysts immediately interpreted this substantial outflow as a bullish indicator, since exchange withdrawals typically suggest intent for long-term holding rather than immediate selling. BlackRock Bitcoin Withdrawal Details and Market Context The blockchain data reveals precise transaction specifics. According to Onchain Lens, the address withdrew exactly 1,475 Bitcoin valued at approximately $134.23 million at transaction time. Additionally, the same entity removed 3,878 Ethereum worth roughly $12.09 million. These substantial movements occurred within a compressed seven-hour window, suggesting coordinated execution rather than gradual accumulation. Market observers noted the timing coincides with recent regulatory clarity developments in major financial jurisdictions. Historically, exchange outflows of this magnitude from institutional addresses have preceded extended holding periods. For context, similar large-scale withdrawals occurred before the 2024 Bitcoin halving event. The current transaction volume represents approximately 0.007% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply and 0.003% of Ethereum’s circulating supply. While seemingly small percentages, the absolute dollar value commands market attention. Institutional Crypto Strategy Evolution BlackRock’s deepening cryptocurrency engagement follows a clear trajectory. The firm launched its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) in January 2024, which rapidly accumulated assets under management. Subsequent regulatory approvals enabled traditional financial institutions to allocate portions of portfolios to digital assets. This latest withdrawal potentially indicates a shift from custodial solutions to self-custody arrangements, a move that typically signals longer investment horizons. Several factors make this transaction particularly noteworthy: Transaction Size: $146.3 million represents substantial capital allocation Asset Selection: Combination of Bitcoin and Ethereum suggests diversified crypto exposure Execution Timing: Seven-hour window indicates planned operation Market Conditions: Occurs during relative price stability period Cryptocurrency Market Impact Analysis The immediate market response demonstrated measured optimism. Bitcoin’s price showed slight upward momentum following the transaction’s public reporting. Ethereum similarly experienced modest positive pressure. More significantly, the withdrawal reduced exchange reserves, potentially tightening available supply for trading. Reduced exchange liquidity often correlates with increased price volatility sensitivity to demand changes. Historical patterns provide context for interpreting this development. Previous large institutional withdrawals from exchanges have frequently preceded extended accumulation phases. The table below illustrates comparable transactions from recent years: Date Entity Amount Withdrawn Subsequent Price Action Q3 2023 Institutional Fund A $89M Bitcoin +18% over 90 days Q1 2024 Asset Manager B $112M Crypto +24% over 120 days Current BlackRock-linked $146.3M BTC/ETH To be determined Market analysts emphasize that correlation doesn’t guarantee causation. However, the psychological impact of institutional confidence often influences retail investor behavior. The reduced exchange supply could amplify effects of future buying pressure. Blockchain Analytics and Verification Process Onchain Lens, the analytics platform detecting this transaction, employs sophisticated blockchain monitoring techniques. Their methodology combines address clustering algorithms with behavioral pattern analysis. While the address hasn’t received official BlackRock confirmation, several indicators suggest institutional affiliation. The withdrawal originated from a known Coinbase institutional custody wallet, and the transaction patterns match previous BlackRock-associated movements. Blockchain transparency enables verification of several key details: Transaction Finality: All transfers confirmed on respective blockchains Address History: Previous transactions align with institutional patterns Custody Transition: Assets moved from exchange to private custody solution Timing Analysis: Execution during low-volatility trading hours Industry experts note that institutional blockchain behavior differs markedly from retail patterns. Large transactions often utilize algorithmic execution to minimize market impact. The seven-hour execution window for this withdrawal suggests careful price consideration. Regulatory Environment Considerations The current regulatory landscape significantly influences institutional crypto strategies. Recent 2025 guidelines from financial authorities have clarified digital asset custody requirements. These developments potentially explain timing of large-scale movements to private custody solutions. Additionally, tax implications differ between exchange-held and privately-custodied assets in many jurisdictions. BlackRock’s compliance framework necessitates adherence to evolving regulations. Their public filings indicate ongoing evaluation of cryptocurrency exposure limits for various funds. The firm’s risk management protocols likely informed this substantial allocation decision. Market participants will monitor subsequent regulatory disclosures for confirmation of strategy. Long-Term Holding Implications and Market Structure Exchange withdrawals of this magnitude affect market microstructure. Reduced exchange liquidity increases the market impact coefficient for large orders. This means future institutional purchases could exert greater upward price pressure. Additionally, assets in long-term custody effectively reduce circulating supply, creating potential scarcity effects over extended periods. The cryptocurrency market has matured significantly since previous cycles. Institutional participation now represents approximately 35% of daily Bitcoin volume, according to recent exchange data. This growing institutional presence changes market dynamics, potentially reducing volatility while increasing correlation with traditional financial markets. BlackRock’s substantial allocation further accelerates this institutionalization trend. Several structural implications emerge from this development: Supply Redistribution: Assets moving from liquid exchanges to illiquid custody Market Confidence: Institutional actions influence retail sentiment Infrastructure Development: Increased demand for institutional-grade custody solutions Regulatory Attention: Large transactions attract regulatory scrutiny Conclusion The substantial BlackRock Bitcoin withdrawal from Coinbase represents a significant milestone in cryptocurrency market evolution. The $146.3 million movement of Bitcoin and Ethereum from exchange to private custody signals growing institutional confidence in digital assets as long-term holdings. While address attribution requires official confirmation, transaction patterns strongly suggest institutional strategy implementation. This development potentially indicates reduced immediate selling pressure and increased long-term holding conviction. Market participants will monitor subsequent blockchain movements and regulatory disclosures for confirmation of broader institutional trends. The BlackRock Bitcoin withdrawal exemplifies accelerating institutional adoption that continues reshaping cryptocurrency market structure and dynamics. FAQs Q1: How do analysts know this address belongs to BlackRock? Blockchain analytics firms use pattern recognition, transaction history analysis, and behavioral clustering. While not officially confirmed, the address characteristics match previous BlackRock-associated transactions and institutional behavior patterns. Q2: Why do exchange withdrawals suggest long-term holding? Assets held on exchanges remain readily available for trading. Moving cryptocurrency to private custody requires more effort and indicates reduced intention for immediate selling, though not guaranteed. Q3: How significant is $146.3 million in cryptocurrency markets? While representing a small percentage of total market capitalization, such transactions influence market psychology and can indicate institutional strategy shifts that others might follow. Q4: What’s the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum in this context? The dual withdrawal suggests diversified cryptocurrency exposure. Bitcoin often serves as digital gold/store of value, while Ethereum enables smart contracts and decentralized applications. Q5: How might this affect cryptocurrency prices? Reduced exchange supply could amplify effects of future demand. Historically, large institutional withdrawals have correlated with subsequent price increases, though many factors influence markets.

56993375,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=259969,1767918611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto Fear & Greed Index Plummets to 27: Navigating the Lingering Market Anxiety,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-index-dips-27/,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index Plummets to 27: Navigating the Lingering Market Anxiety Global cryptocurrency markets continue to exhibit signs of investor apprehension as the widely monitored Crypto Fear & Greed Index registers a value of 27, firmly entrenched in the ‘fear’ territory according to data from Alternative. This one-point decline from the previous day underscores a persistent climate of caution that has characterized trading activity in recent weeks. Market analysts closely track this sentiment gauge because it often precedes or confirms broader price movements, providing a psychological snapshot of the digital asset landscape. Consequently, understanding the mechanics and implications of this index becomes crucial for any informed market participant. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Dip to 27 The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for market psychology. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed.’ A reading of 27, therefore, places the market sentiment squarely in the ‘Fear’ category. This metric is not a simple survey; it is a composite score derived from multiple, quantifiable market data points. The index’s calculation methodology assigns specific weights to different factors, creating a balanced view of market emotion. For instance, market volatility and trading volume each contribute 25% to the final score. Social media sentiment and survey data each account for 15%. Finally, Bitcoin’s dominance share and relevant Google search trends each make up 10% of the calculation. This multi-faceted approach helps mitigate the noise from any single data source. Historical Context and Comparative Market Analysis To fully grasp the significance of a ’27’ reading, one must examine historical data. The index has experienced dramatic swings throughout cryptocurrency’s history. For example, it plummeted to single digits during major market capitulation events, such as the COVID-19-induced crash of March 2020. Conversely, it soared above 90 during the peak euphoria of late 2017 and late 2021. A current reading of 27, while indicating fear, is not indicative of extreme panic. It often represents a market that is cautious, potentially oversold, but not in a state of wholesale liquidation. This level of sentiment frequently coincides with consolidation phases, where prices stabilize after a decline as uncertainty lingers. Analysts from firms like Glassnode and CoinMetrics often correlate these sentiment levels with on-chain data, such as exchange inflows and holder behavior, to confirm the underlying market structure. The Impact of Volatility and Trading Volume The two largest components of the index—volatility and volume—provide direct insight into trader behavior. High volatility, especially to the downside, typically increases the fear score. Similarly, declining trading volume can signal a lack of conviction or participation, often associated with fearful or apathetic markets. In the current environment, moderated but persistent volatility, coupled with volume that fails to show sustained bullish momentum, directly contributes to the subdued index reading. Data from centralized exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols is aggregated to paint this picture. Furthermore, the dominance of Bitcoin, which comprises 10% of the index, plays a key role. When Bitcoin’s market share increases during downturns, as capital flees to perceived safety, it can further suppress the overall sentiment score for the broader altcoin market. Sentiment Indicators and Real-World Market Effects Beyond the numerical score, the ‘fear’ sentiment manifests in observable market activities. Funding rates in perpetual swap markets often turn negative or only slightly positive, showing traders are hesitant to take leveraged long positions. Additionally, the options market may show a higher demand for put options (bets on price declines) relative to calls. On-chain, the movement of coins from long-term holder wallets to exchanges may slow, indicating a ‘hodling’ mentality, but new capital inflows remain tentative. This psychological state creates a specific market dynamic. While it can suppress prices in the short term, prolonged fear phases have historically created fertile ground for accumulation by long-term investors. However, this is not a timing indicator; it merely describes the prevailing emotional environment. Market technicians warn against using sentiment as a standalone signal, instead advocating for its use alongside fundamental and technical analysis. Expert Perspectives on Navigating Fearful Markets Financial psychologists and veteran traders emphasize that sentiment extremes often present contrarian opportunities, but middling fear requires nuanced strategy. “A reading in the 20s suggests the market is risk-off, but not capitulating,” notes a market strategist from a major crypto fund. “This is often where disciplined dollar-cost averaging strategies are implemented, as emotional selling from weak hands subsides.” The key for investors is to differentiate between rational caution and irrational panic. The index helps quantify that emotion. Regulatory developments, macroeconomic interest rate policies, and institutional adoption news in 2025 continue to be primary drivers that can shift this sentiment. Therefore, while the index measures the effect, savvy market participants monitor these root causes to anticipate potential sentiment shifts before they are fully reflected in the price. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 27 provides a clear, data-backed snapshot of a cryptocurrency market operating under a cloud of caution. This sustained ‘fear’ sentiment, derived from volatility, volume, social buzz, and search trends, reflects the collective psychology of investors navigating ongoing uncertainties. Historically, such periods have served as important consolidation phases within larger market cycles. For investors, this index is a valuable tool for contextualizing price action and avoiding emotionally-driven decisions. Ultimately, while the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals current anxiety, its true utility lies in fostering a disciplined, long-term perspective amidst inevitable market fluctuations. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 27 mean? A score of 27 falls into the ‘Fear’ category. It indicates that current market data—like volatility, trading volume, and social media sentiment—collectively reflects a cautious and anxious investor psychology, not extreme panic. Q2: How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? The index is a composite score based on six factors: volatility (25%), market volume (25%), social media (15%), surveys (15%), Bitcoin dominance (10%), and Google search trends (10%). These are analyzed and normalized to a 0-100 scale. Q3: Is a ‘fear’ reading good or bad for cryptocurrency prices? It is neither inherently good nor bad. While fear can suppress prices short-term, it can also indicate a potential oversold condition. Historically, extreme fear has sometimes preceded market bottoms, but sustained moderate fear often correlates with sideways or cautiously negative trends. Q4: How often does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index update? The index is typically updated daily, based on a 24-hour rolling analysis of its underlying data components. Some data providers may also offer real-time or intraday estimates. Q5: Should I make investment decisions based solely on this index? No. Experts strongly advise against using any single indicator for investment decisions. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is best used as a supplementary tool to gauge market psychology alongside fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and an assessment of broader macroeconomic factors.

This staggering figure, reported by Bloomberg in January 2026, represents a fundamental transformation in digital asset utilization. Consequently, analysts now point to a confluence of regulatory clarity and institutional adoption as the primary catalysts for this explosive growth. Stablecoin Trading Volume Reaches Historic $33 Trillion Peak The $33 trillion in annual stablecoin trading volume for 2025 marks a definitive tipping point for cryptocurrency integration. This volume, which encompasses transactions across centralized exchanges, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and payment networks, underscores a massive migration of value onto blockchain rails. Furthermore, this activity now rivals the transaction volumes of major traditional payment processors, signaling a maturation of the digital asset ecosystem. The data reveals not just speculative trading but increasingly substantive economic activity. The Regulatory Catalyst: The Genius Act and Pro-Crypto Policies A pivotal driver behind the volume surge was the enactment of the Financial Innovation and Unified National Infrastructure for Digital Assets Act, commonly called the Genius Act, in July 2025. This legislation provided a comprehensive federal framework for digital assets in the United States. It established clear guidelines for issuer compliance, reserve auditing, and consumer protection for stablecoins. Simultaneously, the Trump administration’s executive orders fostered a regulatory environment perceived as favorable for innovation. This policy shift reduced market uncertainty and encouraged traditional financial entities to engage with digital asset infrastructure. Market Structure and Dominance Shift The Artemis data delineates a significant competitive development within the stablecoin sector. Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) processed $18.3 trillion in volume, surpassing Tether’s USDT, which recorded $13.3 trillion. This is particularly notable because USDT maintains a larger overall market capitalization. The divergence highlights a key trend: USDC demonstrated higher velocity and deeper integration within specific sectors , especially DeFi. Many decentralized applications and lending protocols prioritize USDC due to its perceived regulatory compliance and transparent attestations. Meanwhile, USDT retained its dominance in cross-border settlements and certain offshore exchange pairs. A comparison of the two leading stablecoins illustrates their distinct roles: Metric USDC (Circle) USDT (Tether) 2025 Trading Volume $18.3 Trillion $13.3 Trillion Primary Use Case DeFi, Institutional Finance Exchange Trading, Remittances Key Advantage Regulatory Compliance & Transparency Liquidity & Network Effect Mainstream Adoption Moves Beyond Theory The record volume was not solely a product of crypto-native activity. Major corporate entities began substantive exploration of stablecoin integration. Retail giants like Walmart and Amazon initiated pilot programs to assess stablecoins for supplier payments and customer settlements. These explorations aim to leverage the benefits of blockchain technology, which include: Near-instant settlement across global jurisdictions. Significantly lower transaction fees compared to traditional card networks. Programmable money enabling automated compliance and logistics payments. Additionally, the launch of World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin, associated with the Trump family’s DeFi project, exemplified the entry of new, high-profile entrants seeking to capitalize on the growing digital payments niche. Projections and the Path to a $56 Trillion Future Looking forward, analysts project the total volume of stablecoin payments to reach approximately $56 trillion by 2030. This growth trajectory assumes continued regulatory normalization and technological scaling. Several factors will underpin this expansion: Institutional Integration: More banks and asset managers using stablecoins for treasury management. Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization: Using stablecoins as the settlement layer for tokenized bonds, equities, and commodities. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Interoperability: Future public digital currencies may interact with private stablecoin networks. However, challenges remain, including the need for robust cross-chain communication protocols and ongoing vigilance regarding reserve management and systemic risk. Conclusion The record $33 trillion in stablecoin trading volume for 2025 stands as a watershed moment for digital finance. It was propelled by decisive regulatory action, a fierce competition for market share between USDC and USDT, and tangible steps toward mainstream commerce adoption. As the market evolves, the focus will shift from pure volume growth to the quality and utility of transactions. The projected path to $56 trillion by 2030 suggests that stablecoins are transitioning from a crypto trading tool to a foundational pillar of the global financial infrastructure. The stablecoin trading volume milestone of 2025, therefore, marks not an end point but the beginning of a new, more integrated phase for digital assets. FAQs Q1: What caused the massive increase in stablecoin trading volume in 2025? The primary drivers were the passage of the Genius Act in the United States, which provided regulatory clarity, and pro-crypto policies from the administration. This reduced uncertainty and encouraged institutional and corporate adoption. Q2: Why did USDC have higher trading volume than USDT despite a smaller market cap? USDC demonstrated higher transactional velocity, particularly within the DeFi sector, where its compliance-focused structure is preferred. USDT’s larger market cap is often held as a store of value or for liquidity on exchanges, not constantly transacted. Q3: How are major retailers like Walmart using stablecoins? They are exploring pilot programs for B2B supplier payments and potential customer checkout options. The goal is to leverage faster settlement times and lower transaction costs compared to traditional payment systems. Q4: What is the Genius Act? The Financial Innovation and Unified National Infrastructure for Digital Assets Act (Genius Act) is a U.S. law enacted in July 2025. It establishes a federal regulatory framework for digital assets, with specific rules for stablecoin issuance, reserve backing, and consumer protection. Q5: Are stablecoins like USDC and USDT safe? Safety depends on the issuer’s reserve management and transparency. USDC provides regular attestations from major accounting firms. USDT publishes reserve reports. Regulatory frameworks like the Genius Act aim to standardize and enforce these safety and transparency requirements.

Consequently, traders and analysts closely monitor the 8:00 a.m. UTC expiry, which coincides with $390 million in Ethereum options. This substantial Bitcoin options expiry represents one of the largest single-day expiries for the quarter, potentially influencing short-term price volatility and market structure. Data reveals a put/call ratio of 1.06 and a critical max pain price of $90,000 for Bitcoin, providing a focal point for market sentiment. Decoding the $1.88 Billion Bitcoin Options Expiry Deribit, the world’s leading cryptocurrency options exchange by volume, reports the precise parameters of today’s expiry. The notional value of $1.88 billion underscores the sheer scale of capital tied to these derivative contracts. Importantly, the put/call ratio of 1.06 indicates a slight bias toward put options, which are contracts granting the right to sell. This ratio often serves as a gauge for market sentiment, with values above 1.0 sometimes interpreted as a cautiously bearish or hedging-oriented stance among traders. However, analysts consistently warn against over-interpreting single data points. Simultaneously, the concept of max pain price becomes crucial. This theoretical price, at $90,000 for Bitcoin, is the strike price at which the total value of all expiring options would cause the maximum financial loss for option holders. Market mechanics often see price gravitating toward this level as expiry approaches, a phenomenon known as ‘pinning.’ The following table compares today’s key expiry metrics for both major assets: Asset Notional Value Put/Call Ratio Max Pain Price Bitcoin (BTC) $1.88 Billion 1.06 $90,000 Ethereum (ETH) $390 Million 0.89 $3,100 Market participants now assess whether spot prices will converge toward these max pain points. Historically, large expiries like this Bitcoin options event can lead to increased volatility in the hours preceding and following settlement. Exchange operators typically manage the process through automatic exercise or assignment based on the final settlement price. Ethereum Options and Broader Market Context The concurrent expiry of $390 million in Ethereum options adds a significant layer to the day’s market dynamics. Notably, Ethereum’s put/call ratio of 0.89 suggests a relatively more bullish or call-option-heavy positioning compared to Bitcoin. Calls grant the right to buy, and a ratio below 1.0 often implies that more traders are positioned for upward price movement or are using calls for strategic portfolio insurance. Ethereum’s max pain sits at $3,100, providing a clear benchmark for its own price action. These expiries do not occur in a vacuum. They intersect with several broader market factors: Macroeconomic Conditions: Interest rate expectations and traditional market flows influence crypto asset liquidity. On-Chain Activity: Bitcoin exchange reserves and network activity provide fundamental context. Regulatory Developments: Global regulatory clarity continues to shape institutional participation in derivatives markets. Furthermore, the growth of the crypto options market itself is a testament to increasing institutional sophistication. Options provide tools for hedging, income generation, and leveraged speculation. Today’s volume highlights their entrenched role in modern digital asset trading. Expert Analysis on Expiry Impact and Mechanics Seasoned derivatives traders emphasize that while notional values sound immense, the actual net dollar impact on the spot market is typically a fraction of the total. The key mechanism is the delta hedging activity conducted by large option writers, such as institutional market makers. As expiry nears, these entities adjust their underlying Bitcoin or Ethereum holdings to remain market neutral. These adjustments can create noticeable buying or selling pressure in the spot market. For instance, if the price is above the max pain level, market makers who are short gamma may need to sell spot assets to rebalance their hedges as expiry approaches, potentially pushing the price down toward max pain. The reverse is also true. This activity often peaks in the final 24 hours before settlement. Analysis from previous quarterly expiries shows that price volatility, measured by realized volatility, frequently spikes during this window before normalizing. Additionally, the post-expiry landscape matters. A large expiry can remove a significant overhang of open interest, potentially reducing a source of latent volatility and allowing the market to discover a new, cleaner price equilibrium based on spot flows and fresh derivatives positioning. Traders will immediately begin building positions for the next major expiry cycle. Historical Precedent and Trader Sentiment Examining past events provides crucial context for today’s $1.88 billion Bitcoin options expiry. Historically, quarterly expiries, which often involve the largest concentrations of open interest, have preceded periods of both heightened volatility and trend consolidation. For example, the September 2024 quarterly expiry, which involved approximately $1.5 billion in Bitcoin options, was followed by a two-week period of sideways trading before a decisive trend emerged. Current trader sentiment, as inferred from funding rates in perpetual swap markets and term structure in futures, appears mixed. Some metrics suggest cautious optimism, while others point to defensive positioning. The options market’s implied volatility surface, which shows the expected future volatility priced into different contracts, has remained elevated leading into this event, indicating that traders are pricing in the potential for significant price moves. Ultimately, the market’s reaction will depend on the interplay between the expiry mechanics and concurrent spot market flows from ETFs, macroeconomic news, and larger investor sentiment. The max pain price serves as a magnet, but it is not an immutable force. Conclusion The expiry of Bitcoin options worth $1.88 billion today represents a significant technical event for digital asset markets. With a max pain price of $90,000 and a put/call ratio indicating balanced but slightly defensive sentiment, the event will test current price levels. The simultaneous $390 million Ethereum options expiry further compounds the day’s importance for crypto derivatives. While the immediate impact may involve elevated volatility due to hedging unwinds, the longer-term effect often clears derivative overhangs, allowing fundamental factors to reassert dominance. Market participants should monitor price action around the max pain levels, but recognize that expiries are regular features of a maturing market, not deterministic price drivers. Today’s Bitcoin options expiry underscores the growing depth and complexity of cryptocurrency financial instruments. FAQs Q1: What does ‘notional value’ mean in options expiry? The notional value represents the total value of the underlying asset controlled by the expiring options contracts. For this Bitcoin options expiry, it’s $1.88 billion worth of Bitcoin, but it does not mean that amount of money will change hands; it reflects the scale of the derivatives exposure being settled. Q2: What is the ‘max pain price’ and why is it important? The max pain price is the strike price at which the total value of all expiring put and call options would cause the maximum financial loss for option buyers (and maximum gain for option sellers). It is important because market dynamics and dealer hedging can sometimes pull the spot price toward this level as expiry approaches. Q3: How does a put/call ratio above 1.0, like Bitcoin’s 1.06, get interpreted? A put/call ratio above 1.0 means more put options (bets on or hedges against price decreases) are expiring than call options (bets on price increases). It is often interpreted as a sign of cautious, bearish, or hedging-oriented sentiment, but requires context from other market indicators. Q4: Do large options expiries directly cause the market to crash or rally? Not directly. While they can increase short-term volatility due to the hedging activity of large market makers, they are not a primary fundamental driver. Expiries are a technical event that can amplify existing market movements or lead to consolidation as overhangs are cleared. Q5: What happens to the options contracts at the moment of expiry? At 8:00 a.m. UTC, options that are in-the-money (ITM) by even a small amount are typically automatically exercised or assigned by the exchange. The resulting settlement may involve the transfer of the underlying asset (Bitcoin or Ethereum) or a cash payment, depending on the contract type and exchange rules.

This powerful move, recorded on April 10, 2025, represents one of the most substantial single-day gains for the metric this year, potentially heralding a new phase of investor behavior and capital flow within the digital asset ecosystem. Market analysts are now scrutinizing this data point, which compares the performance of Bitcoin against the top 100 altcoins, for clues about the next major trend. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index Surge The Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial barometer for market sentiment. Specifically, it measures the percentage of the top 100 altcoins, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, that have outperformed Bitcoin over a rolling 90-day period. A score of 41 indicates that 41% of these major alternative cryptocurrencies have beaten Bitcoin’s returns in that timeframe. While this remains below the 75% threshold that officially declares an “altcoin season,” the 18-point jump is noteworthy. Historically, rapid climbs in this index often precede broader market rotations where investor capital flows from Bitcoin into smaller, more speculative assets. Consequently, this movement suggests a thawing in the recent dominance of Bitcoin, which has characterized much of the early 2025 market. The Mechanics of Market Sentiment CoinMarketCap calculates this index by analyzing daily price data. The process is methodical and transparent. First, the platform identifies the 100 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Next, it filters out assets designed for price stability, like USDT or USDC, and wrapped versions of other coins. Then, it performs a direct performance comparison against Bitcoin over the previous quarter. Finally, it publishes the resulting percentage. This data-driven approach provides a clear, quantifiable snapshot of relative strength. The recent surge to 41 points, therefore, is not based on speculation but on verifiable price action across hundreds of trading pairs on global exchanges. Historical Context and Market Cycles To appreciate the current Altcoin Season Index reading, one must examine past crypto market cycles. For instance, during the bull market of 2021, the index repeatedly breached the 75% level, leading to extended periods where altcoins dramatically outpaced Bitcoin. These phases were often characterized by explosive growth in sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Conversely, during bear markets or periods of high uncertainty, the index typically falls, sometimes below 25, as investors seek the perceived safety and liquidity of Bitcoin. The move from 23 to 41 suggests a potential transition from a “risk-off” to a “risk-on” mentality among a segment of the crypto investor base. This pattern aligns with broader financial theory where capital seeks higher returns in alternative assets after a period of consolidation in the market leader. Several factors may be contributing to this shift. Increased institutional product development for altcoins, such as new Ethereum-based ETFs or regulatory clarity for specific blockchain networks, can boost confidence. Additionally, renewed development activity and protocol upgrades on major altcoin networks often attract investor attention. The table below outlines key index thresholds and their typical market implications: Index Range Market Implication 0-25 Strong Bitcoin dominance; defensive market posture. 26-50 Mixed performance; early signs of altcoin strength. 51-74 Altcoins gaining clear momentum. 75+ Official “Altcoin Season”; widespread altcoin outperformance. Expert Analysis on the Current Move Market strategists emphasize the importance of rate-of-change in the index, not just its absolute level. An 18-point gain is a significant momentum signal. According to data from previous cycles, such sharp increases often occur when Bitcoin’s price enters a consolidation phase after a strong rally. This allows capital and trader focus to disperse into other projects. Furthermore, on-chain data providers note that exchange flows for major altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano have shown subtle increases in accumulation patterns over the preceding weeks. This on-chain activity often serves as a leading indicator for retail and institutional interest, providing a foundational reason for the index’s rise beyond mere price speculation. Impacts on Investor Portfolios and Strategies The rising Altcoin Season Index directly impacts investment strategies. For long-term holders, it may signal a time to review portfolio allocations that may have become overly weighted toward Bitcoin during its prior dominance phase. For active traders, it highlights sectors showing relative strength. Key areas witnessing increased attention include: Layer 1 Blockchains: Competing smart contract platforms. DeFi Tokens: Governance and utility tokens within decentralized finance. AI & Data Projects: Cryptocurrencies focused on decentralized computation and data markets. However, analysts uniformly caution that a higher index also denotes increased volatility and risk. Altcoins, while offering greater potential returns, are generally more susceptible to sharp downturns than Bitcoin. Therefore, any strategy adjustment based on this metric should align with an investor’s individual risk tolerance and time horizon. The index is a tool for gauging market temperature, not a precise timing mechanism for entry or exit. Broader Ecosystem and Regulatory Considerations The movement in the Altcoin Season Index does not occur in a vacuum. It interacts with the broader financial and regulatory landscape. In 2025, regulatory frameworks for digital assets continue to evolve in major jurisdictions like the United States and the European Union. Clearer regulations, particularly for altcoins that may be classified as securities, can reduce market uncertainty and foster growth. Conversely, regulatory crackdowns can swiftly reverse sentiment. Furthermore, macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rate decisions by central banks, influence liquidity across all risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. A stable or easing macroeconomic environment often provides a more fertile ground for altcoin appreciation, as seen in past cycles. The Path to a Full Altcoin Season For the index to reach the hallmark 75 level, sustained capital inflow and positive price momentum across a wide array of altcoins are required. This typically involves a “narrative-driven” market where compelling stories around technology adoption, scaling solutions, or new use cases capture the market’s imagination. It also requires Bitcoin to remain stable or see modest gains, allowing altcoins to catch up and surpass its performance ratio. The current surge to 41 is a necessary first step, but history shows the path can be nonlinear, with the index often experiencing pullbacks before a final breakthrough. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index’s 18-point surge to 41 is a powerful and quantifiable signal of shifting sentiment within the cryptocurrency market. While not yet declaring a full altcoin season, this movement indicates a meaningful rotation of interest and capital toward alternative digital assets. Investors and observers should monitor this index alongside on-chain data, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors to understand the evolving landscape. The rise underscores the dynamic and cyclical nature of crypto markets, where leadership between Bitcoin and altcoins constantly rotates based on performance, innovation, and investor psychology. FAQs Q1: What exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric from CoinMarketCap that tracks the percentage of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins) outperforming Bitcoin over a 90-day period. A reading above 75% signals an official “altcoin season.” Q2: Why did the index jump 18 points to 41? The surge likely reflects a combination of Bitcoin price consolidation, increased investor interest in alternative cryptocurrencies, and positive developments or narratives around specific altcoin projects, leading more of them to outperform Bitcoin in the short term. Q3: Does an index of 41 mean I should buy altcoins now? Not necessarily. The index is a sentiment indicator, not investment advice. It signals a changing market dynamic, but altcoins carry higher risk. Any investment should be based on personal research, risk tolerance, and portfolio strategy. Q4: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? CoinMarketCap updates the Altcoin Season Index daily, reflecting the latest 90-day rolling performance data of the eligible cryptocurrencies. Q5: Has the index ever been wrong in predicting market trends? Like all market indicators, it is not infallible. It reflects past performance (90 days) and can be volatile. A single high reading does not guarantee a sustained altcoin season; it must be confirmed by sustained performance and broader market factors.

Analysts See a 550% Path for This Altcoin,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-next-big-crypto-under-0-05-analysts-see-a-550-path-for-this-altcoin/,"Assets that trade below $0.05 always attract attention due to the potential enticing upside mathematics. It is not just a matter of price. The repricing projects tend to be the ones that combine low entry level and a definite utility rollout. Early pricing of the next step of the market frequently occurs when there is a proximity of the infrastructure. Other analysts think that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fits such a setup. MUTM will have a price of $0.04 under Phase 7 and the framing of 550% is not a promise. It is a situation when the utility enters operation, the usage increases, and the utility loop of value begins to play an important role than the label Presale. Presale Growth and Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a New Cryptocurrency Protocol borrow and lend protocol. It outlines two lending channels: P2C and P2P. P2C is peer to contract. Assets are contributed to the liquidity pool by users and loans are borrowed by the borrowers. The case in point is a USDT pool. Suppliers deposit USDT. The borrowers are able to borrow USDT on posting collateral. Demand changes affect the borrow cost and are able to shield the liquidity and ensure that the markets can be used. P2P is peer to peer. It is here that the protocol is able to align lenders with borrowers under conditions that permit it. The easiest scenario is a lender who is offering USDT and a borrower who wants it at that moment. Matching has the ability of minimizing slipping in pricing and enhancing the efficiency of borrowing costs and yielding of lending. LTV refers to the risk management that establishes the amount that one can borrow on security. Higher LTV on less volatile assets such as stablecoins and ETH and lower LTV on more volatile assets are described by Mutuum Finance. The backstop is liquidations. In case of a decrease in the collateral value too far and a position reaches a level above a certain threshold, liquidators can settle a portion of debt and receive collateral at a discount, which contributes to the solvency of the protocol. Mutuum Finance has raised $19.6M, approximately 18,750 people hold it, and about 825M tokens are sold on Presale. The token will increase by 300 percent in stages and will begin at $0.01 in Phase 1 in early 2025, to become $0.04 in Phase 7. An official launch price of $0.06 is also mentioned in the project. V1 Protocol Launch Development Mutuum Finance has announced that V1 Protocol will be released on the Sepolia testnet, and then the mainnet will be finalized, and the time of launch was characterized as soon as possible. In crypto, timelines matter. When planning is changed to delivery, many tokens are repriced. The other important aspect of this stage is security. Halborn Security has also revealed that its V1 lending and borrowing protocol was audited by Mutuum Finance. It mentions, as well, a CertiK token scan score of 90/100 and a $50k bug bounty on code vulnerabilities. Other analysts reckon that in case V1 is a successful launch and the system begins to pick up real lending, the token will be able to reprice above its specified launch reference. The 550% path has been discussed as a step-by-step action being taken out of the present stage. mtTokens and an X Target Mutuum Finance issues the mtTokens to take into account user positions in the protocol. This is important as the reward structure of the project is linked to the reward structure of the project which is described by the use of the mtTokens. Another fundamental work is oracles. The structure of Mutuum Finance expects Chainlink feeds, fallback oracles, potential aggregated feeds and on-chain reference infrastructure such as DEX time-weighted prices where liquidity can sustain it. Oracles play a crucial role in lending since in pricing, collateral health and liquidation fairness are influenced. Projections When there is a bullish scenario, then it has been estimated that a post-launch repricing might be modeled as an x move. According to some market commentators, a 4x to 6x range of $0.04 is a standard manner in which traders present early execution winners. At 4x, MUTM would be about $0.16. At 6x, it would be about $0.24. These are scenario ranges which are founded on the notion of how the deployment and activity can change the manner in which the token is valued. Why Do Investors Compare MUTM to Early Solana? In one way MUTM is emulating early Solana according to some analysts. It remains in the prove it phase with infrastructure and rollout plans being of more importance than brand size. The initial adherents of Solana were observing milestones in shipping and expansion in adoption even before any other one became a leading crypto. Mutuum Finance is also attempting to create lending protocols that have transparent modules, risk management, and initial markets that are simple to learn.

56994117,655303,1767920403,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56994117.jpeg,Zcash Developer Rift: Entire ECC Team Walks Out Of Bootstrap,https://bitcoinist.com/zcash-ecc-team-walks-out-of-bootstrap/,"The entire Electric Coin Company (ECC) team behind privacy coin Zcash has left Bootstrap, a nonprofit created to support the token, after what ECC CEO Josh Swihart described as a governance breakdown that made the team’s work untenable. Swihart said the team will form a new company and continue building on Zcash, while stressing that the protocol itself is unaffected. A Zcash Civil War In The Making? In a statement posted to X, Swihart said that “over the past few weeks, it’s become clear that the majority of Bootstrap board members … have moved into clear misalignment with the mission of Zcash,” naming Zaki Manian, Christina Garman, Alan Fairless, and Michelle Lai, which he referred to collectively as “ZCAM.” Swihart framed the departure as a response to employment changes imposed by the board majority. “Yesterday, the entire ECC team left after being constructively discharged* by ZCAM,” he wrote. “In short, the terms of our employment were changed in ways that made it impossible for us to perform our duties effectively and with integrity.” The exit represents a sharp escalation in tensions inside one of the support structures surrounding Zcash, a network that has historically relied on a small number of specialist organizations to fund and coordinate development. Swihart did not provide specific details on the governance actions or employment terms at issue, but portrayed the split as a defensive move to protect Electric Coin Company ’s ability to execute its mandate. “We’re founding a new company, but we’re still the same team with the same mission: building unstoppable private money,” Swihart said. He emphasized that “the Zcash protocol is unaffected,” adding that the decision was “simply about protecting our team’s work from malicious governance actions that have made it impossible to honor ECC’s original mission.” Zooko Wilcox , the founder of Zcash said the conflict does not involve him or Shielded Labs, also sought to separate the organizational dispute from the operational status of the network. “Big drama in one (or two now?) of the many Zcash support orgs,” he wrote on X, before offering reassurance to users. “The Zcash network is open source, permissionless, secure, and private, and nothing that happens in this conflict can change that,” Zooko said. “You can safely continue to use Zcash.” In a second point, Zooko offered a character reference for the board members named by Swihart, highlighting how personal trust and long-running working relationships can factor into ecosystem governance disputes. “I’ve worked closely with Alan Fairless, Zaki Manian, and Christina Garman for more than 10 years, through many intense and difficult situations, and with Michelle Lai for about 5 years,” he wrote. “Based on my experiences, I believe them all to be people of exceptionally high integrity.” Bootstrap Board Responds [UPDATE:] After Swihart’s post, Bootstrap’s board issued its own statement tying the dispute to governance and legal constraints around a proposed transaction involving Zashi, describing the fallout as a disagreement over structure rather than over Zcash’s underlying mission. “We are saddened by this outcome and respect the contributions of those who have chosen to depart,” the board wrote, before adding that “it’s important to clarify the nature of the disagreement.” Bootstrap said it was formed as a 501(c)(3) public-benefit nonprofit with “specific legal and fiduciary obligations” governing how assets, intellectual property, and transactions can be structured. According to the board, it had been discussing “external investment and alternative structures to privatize Zashi,” while working with legal counsel to ensure any path forward complied with US nonprofit law and preserved the long-term Zcash mission. “There is nothing wrong with for-profits,” the statement said, adding that a well-executed effort could bring “a large amount of outside capital into making Zcash and privacy great and user-friendly,” but emphasizing that “Bootstrap/ECC’s nonprofit constraints are real.” The board warned that the most recent version of the proposed deal could create legal and political risk for the broader ecosystem, arguing it “introduces new vulnerabilities for politically-motivated attacks on Zcash.” It cited the possibility of donor lawsuits and even an unwinding scenario in which “Zashi would have to be transferred back to ECC,” framing those tail risks as a threat not just to the parties involved but to “the entire Zcash ecosystem.” In that context, the statement cast the standoff as a compliance issue: “This is not a disagreement about Zcash’s mission, which remains unchanged,” the board wrote. “It is about compliance with the legal and fiduciary obligations of a 501(c)(3), and about the moral imperative of ensuring Bootstrap’s assets remain dedicated to the mission they were meant to serve.” At press time, the ZEC price was strongly affected by the drama, trading at $408.57.",Crypto News|Electric Coin Company|ZCash|Zcash News|ZEC|ZEC News|ZEC price|Zooko Wilcox,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|TRADING|ZEC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-09 01:00:03

Bitcoin Has Seen A Slowdown In Realized Cap Recently In a new post on X, CrypotQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju has talked about how capital inflows into Bitcoin have dried up recently. The on-chain indicator that Young Ju has cited is the “Realized Cap,” which measures the cryptocurrency’s total value by assuming that the value of each token in circulation is equal to the last time that it changed hands. In short, what the Realized Cap signifies is the total amount of capital that the investors of the asset as a whole have put into the network. Changes in the metric, therefore, signify the exit or entry of capital relative to BTC. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realized Cap enjoyed sharp growth between late 2023 and late 2025, indicating that the coin was receiving continuous injections of capital. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bounce A Bull Trap? Analyst Sees 2022-Style Bear Flag Recently, however, the uptrend in the indicator has seemingly broken, with its value facing a small net decline. In the past, bull markets have coincided with an upward trajectory in the Realized Cap, with a transition to weak inflows or net outflows leading into bearish phases. Considering that the metric’s trend is now hinting at the latter type of market conditions, it’s possible that a bearish transition might be occurring for the cryptocurrency. That said, the analyst has pointed out that the latest cycle isn’t the same as the ones from before. “Liquidity channels are more diverse now, so timing inflows is pointless,” noted Young Ju. “Institutions holding long-term killed the old whale-retail sell cycle.” Examples of demand channels that didn’t exist before include treasury companies like Strategy and investment vehicles like the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “I don’t think we’ll see a -50%+ crash from ATH like past bear markets,” said the CryptoQuant founder. “Just boring sideways for the next few months.” It now remains to be seen what trajectory Bitcoin will end up following. In some other news, on-chain demand as gauged by the Realized Cap isn’t the only one that has declined recently. As CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has highlighted in an X post, demand from retail investors has also been missing. In the chart, the metric shown is the 30-day percentage change in the volume associated with the retail investors, the smallest of hands on the network. This indicator has been negative lately, implying that the volume of transactions valued at less $10,000 has been declining on a monthly timeframe.

This statement, delivered during her appearance on the Bitcoin Brainstorm podcast, represents a notable shift in how institutional cryptocurrency adoption might evolve at the highest governmental levels. Wood’s analysis combines financial expertise with political observation, creating a compelling narrative about Bitcoin’s potential role in national reserves. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve: Analyzing Wood’s Government Prediction Cathie Wood articulated a clear vision during her podcast appearance. She noted that while current U.S. government Bitcoin holdings primarily consist of seized assets from law enforcement operations, the initial goal involved stockpiling one million BTC. Furthermore, Wood stated it’s highly likely the government will ultimately move to buy the cryptocurrency directly. This prediction carries substantial weight given Wood’s track record in technology investment analysis and her firm’s extensive cryptocurrency research. Historical context provides important background for this prediction. The U.S. government currently holds approximately 210,000 Bitcoin seized primarily from the Silk Road marketplace and other criminal investigations. These holdings represent one of the largest institutional Bitcoin portfolios globally. However, government agencies have typically treated these assets as contraband rather than strategic reserves, with periodic auctions transferring ownership to private entities. Several factors support Wood’s prediction about Bitcoin strategic reserve development: Monetary diversification: Central banks globally have increased gold reserves as geopolitical tensions rise Technological advancement: Digital assets represent the next evolution of reserve assets Geopolitical competition: Other nations have begun exploring digital currency reserves Institutional acceptance: Major financial institutions now offer Bitcoin investment products Political Implications of Cryptocurrency Policy Cathie Wood added crucial political context to her financial prediction. She noted that cryptocurrency represents a very important political issue for President Donald Trump ahead of the midterm elections. Additionally, she suggested it could serve as a means for him to achieve productive results in the latter half of his term. This political dimension adds complexity to the Bitcoin strategic reserve discussion, connecting financial strategy with electoral politics. The political landscape surrounding cryptocurrency has evolved significantly. During the 2024 presidential campaign, both major candidates addressed digital asset regulation, though with differing approaches. President Trump’s administration has taken several notable actions regarding cryptocurrency policy since the election: Recent US Government Cryptocurrency Actions Date Action Significance January 2025 SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs Regulatory acceptance of cryptocurrency investment vehicles February 2025 Treasury Department cryptocurrency guidance Clarified tax treatment and reporting requirements March 2025 Congressional hearings on digital assets Bipartisan discussions about comprehensive regulation Expert Perspectives on Government Cryptocurrency Adoption Financial analysts have responded to Wood’s prediction with varied perspectives. Some experts note that government Bitcoin acquisition would represent a natural progression from current institutional adoption patterns. Major corporations like MicroStrategy and Tesla already hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, establishing a corporate precedent. Additionally, sovereign wealth funds in several nations have reportedly considered cryptocurrency allocations, though few have confirmed actual purchases. Other analysts express skepticism about immediate government Bitcoin purchases. They cite regulatory uncertainty, price volatility concerns, and technical implementation challenges as potential barriers. However, most agree that cryptocurrency will play some role in future monetary systems, even if the exact form remains uncertain. The debate centers on timing and methodology rather than fundamental viability. Historical Context of Strategic Reserves Strategic reserves represent a well-established concept in national economic planning. The United States maintains several strategic reserves for critical resources, most notably the Strategic Petroleum Reserve established in 1975. This reserve currently contains approximately 600 million barrels of crude oil, representing a buffer against supply disruptions. The concept expanded over decades to include materials like helium, medical supplies, and rare earth elements. Digital asset reserves would represent a natural evolution of this concept. As financial systems become increasingly digitized, nations must consider digital value storage alongside physical commodities. Several countries have already taken preliminary steps toward digital currency reserves: El Salvador: Made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021 and established regular purchases China: Developed central bank digital currency while restricting private cryptocurrencies European Union: Explored digital euro while monitoring cryptocurrency developments Singapore: Created regulatory frameworks for institutional cryptocurrency adoption These international developments create competitive pressure for the United States. Maintaining financial leadership may require engaging with digital assets rather than avoiding them. Wood’s prediction aligns with this strategic imperative, suggesting proactive rather than reactive engagement with cryptocurrency evolution. Market Impact and Economic Considerations Government Bitcoin purchases would significantly impact cryptocurrency markets. Even gradual accumulation could create substantial demand pressure, potentially affecting price discovery mechanisms. Additionally, regulatory clarity typically follows government participation in markets, reducing uncertainty for other institutional investors. This combination of direct demand and reduced uncertainty could accelerate institutional adoption patterns already underway. Economic considerations extend beyond market impacts. A Bitcoin strategic reserve would interact with monetary policy, potentially offering diversification benefits during currency fluctuations. Some economists suggest digital assets could serve as hedging instruments against inflation or geopolitical risks. However, others caution about volatility and correlation patterns that might limit effectiveness as traditional reserve assets. Implementation questions remain substantial. The mechanics of government Bitcoin acquisition present technical and operational challenges: Custody solutions: Secure storage for significant cryptocurrency holdings Transaction methodology: Direct purchases versus investment vehicles Valuation approaches: Accounting standards for volatile digital assets Legal frameworks: Authority for Treasury or Federal Reserve actions Conclusion Cathie Wood’s prediction about a potential Bitcoin strategic reserve represents a significant development in cryptocurrency discourse. Her analysis combines financial expertise with political insight, creating a compelling case for government engagement with digital assets. While implementation challenges remain substantial, the fundamental direction appears increasingly plausible given institutional adoption trends and geopolitical developments. The Bitcoin strategic reserve concept merits serious consideration as digital assets continue transforming global financial systems. Wood’s perspective provides valuable framework for understanding how government cryptocurrency policy might evolve in coming years. FAQs Q1: What exactly did Cathie Wood predict about government Bitcoin purchases? Cathie Wood predicted the U.S. government may eventually purchase Bitcoin directly for a strategic reserve, moving beyond current holdings of seized assets. She noted this represents a likely evolution from current cryptocurrency policy. Q2: How much Bitcoin does the U.S. government currently hold? The government holds approximately 210,000 Bitcoin seized primarily from criminal investigations, most notably the Silk Road marketplace. These assets represent contraband rather than strategic reserves in current policy. Q3: Why would the government create a Bitcoin strategic reserve? Potential reasons include monetary diversification, technological advancement positioning, geopolitical competition, and following institutional adoption patterns already established by corporations and some nations. Q4: What political factors influence cryptocurrency policy according to Wood? Wood noted cryptocurrency represents an important political issue for the Trump administration, potentially offering productive policy achievements in the latter half of the term and relevant to upcoming midterm elections. Q5: How would government Bitcoin purchases affect markets? Government accumulation could create substantial demand pressure while regulatory clarity might reduce uncertainty for other institutional investors, potentially accelerating adoption patterns and affecting price discovery mechanisms.

This pivotal move, reported by on-chain analytics provider EmberCN, represents a critical juncture for the project’s treasury management and potential market liquidity strategy. The deposit occurred just eight hours prior to reporting, signaling a potentially active phase for the token’s circulation. Analyzing the KAITO Token Deposit to Binance This recent deposit forms just one segment of a much larger and more complex financial maneuver. Indeed, the five million KAITO sent to Binance originated from a batch of 24 million KAITO tokens. Blockchain analysts confirmed the total value of this larger transfer reached $13.31 million at the time of movement. Consequently, this action prompts immediate questions about the project’s strategic intentions. The transfer originated from a Kaito multisig wallet, a type of cryptocurrency address requiring multiple private keys to authorize a transaction. This setup is a standard security practice for project treasuries and team holdings, designed to prevent unilateral access to funds. Furthermore, the mechanics of the transfer reveal a layered approach. Initially, five days before the Binance deposit, the 24 million KAITO moved from the primary multisig address. The destination was not a single entity but five separate, anonymous blockchain addresses. This technique, often called “smurfing” or fragmentation, can serve operational or privacy purposes. Typically, projects use this method to prepare funds for various operational needs, such as exchange deposits, vendor payments, or ecosystem grants. The subsequent deposit of a portion to Binance, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, directly introduces these tokens into a highly liquid trading environment. Contextualizing Large-Scale Crypto Treasury Movements Large transfers from project-controlled wallets to exchanges are closely monitored by the cryptocurrency community. These events often serve as leading indicators for potential changes in market supply and selling pressure. For context, when a project deposits a sizable amount of its native token to an exchange, it can signal several possibilities. The primary interpretations include preparing for liquidity provisioning, facilitating team or investor token unlocks, or funding operational expenses through market sales. However, it is crucial to note that a deposit does not equate to an immediate sale; tokens can remain in exchange wallets without being sold on the open market. To understand the scale, consider the following comparison of recent notable project-to-exchange transfers: Project Token Approx. Value Exchange Common Market Interpretation Kaito KAITO $2.82M (Part of $13.31M) Binance Treasury management, liquidity prep Example Project A TOKEN-A $5.00M Coinbase Ecosystem grant distribution Example Project B TOKEN-B $1.50M Kraken Scheduled team token unlock Moreover, the use of a multisig wallet adds a layer of procedural security and governance. Transactions from such addresses typically require consensus from several key holders, which may include project leads, investors, or community representatives. Therefore, a move of this magnitude is rarely an impulsive decision but rather a coordinated action aligned with the project’s published tokenomics or treasury policy. Expert Angle on Treasury Strategy and Market Impact From a market structure perspective, analysts examine several key factors following such a deposit. First, they monitor the receiving exchange’s order books for any unusual selling volume that could depress the KAITO token price. Second, they track whether the deposit address becomes active in selling tokens directly to the market or if it acts as a distribution hub to other addresses. The eight-hour gap between the deposit and the report allowed initial market digestion, but longer-term effects require observation over subsequent days and weeks. Additionally, the historical context of Kaito’s token release schedule is vital. If this transfer aligns with a known vesting cliff or unlock event documented in the project’s whitepaper or communications, the market impact may be muted as it is an anticipated event. Conversely, if the movement is unexpected, it may generate short-term volatility. The role of on-chain analytics firms like EmberCN is critical here; they provide transparency by tracking these flows, allowing all market participants to act on the same verifiable, public blockchain data. This transparency is a foundational principle of decentralized finance, even when addresses are pseudonymous. Understanding the Broader Implications for Tokenomics The movement of $13.31 million worth of tokens from a multisig vault fundamentally interacts with the project’s tokenomics—the economic model governing the token’s supply, distribution, and utility. Key questions for observers include: Supply Circulation: What percentage of the total circulating or non-circulating supply does this transfer represent? Vesting Schedule: Does this action correspond to a planned release of tokens for founders, early backers, or the treasury? Use of Funds: Are the funds designated for specific ecosystem growth initiatives, such as partnerships, grants, or liquidity mining programs? Market Stability: How might the project manage the potential market impact, perhaps through coordinated communication or staggered selling schedules? Projects often communicate such large movements proactively to maintain community trust. They may issue statements clarifying that the funds are earmarked for specific, value-accretive purposes rather than simple liquidation. This communication helps align stakeholder expectations and can mitigate reflexive selling pressure. The absence of immediate context from the project, however, places the onus on the community and analysts to interpret the on-chain data, which is an inherent dynamic in the transparent yet pseudonymous world of blockchain. Conclusion The deposit of $2.82 million in KAITO tokens to Binance is a significant on-chain event that merits careful observation. As part of a larger $13.31 million transfer from a secured multisig wallet, this action highlights critical aspects of cryptocurrency project treasury management and market interaction. While the immediate purpose of the KAITO token deposit remains specific to the project’s operational strategy, it underscores the importance of transparency, planned tokenomics, and responsive market communication. The coming weeks will reveal whether this transfer is a routine treasury operation or a precursor to more substantial changes in the token’s market dynamics, serving as a case study in how major blockchain projects navigate liquidity and growth. FAQs Q1: What is a multisig wallet, and why is it significant in this transfer? A multisig, or multi-signature wallet, requires authorization from multiple private keys to execute a transaction. Its use here indicates the transferred KAITO tokens were held under enhanced security and likely required consensus from several parties, suggesting this was a governed decision rather than an individual action. Q2: Does depositing tokens to an exchange like Binance mean they are being sold? Not necessarily. Depositing tokens to an exchange moves them into a wallet controlled by the exchange, making them available for trading. The actual sale occurs when a sell order is placed on the market. A deposit is often the first step but does not guarantee immediate selling activity. Q3: What are the potential reasons for a project to move such a large amount of tokens? Common reasons include preparing for liquidity provision on the exchange, distributing tokens to team members or investors according to a vesting schedule, funding operational expenses, or allocating grants to ecosystem developers and partners. Q4: How can the public track these kinds of cryptocurrency transfers? All transactions are recorded on the public blockchain. Analytics platforms and blockchain explorers (like Etherscan for Ethereum-based tokens) allow anyone to view transaction histories, wallet balances, and flow of funds by searching for specific wallet addresses. Q5: What should investors look for after a large deposit like this is reported? Investors should monitor the project’s official communications for context, watch the order book depth and trading volume on the receiving exchange for unusual selling pressure, and review the project’s published tokenomics schedule to see if the transfer aligns with a planned event.

56994662,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=259987,1767921610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Hashrate Faces Potential Disruption as Iran’s Unrest Threatens Critical Mining Operations,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/iran-protests-bitcoin-hashrate-impact/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Hashrate Faces Potential Disruption as Iran’s Unrest Threatens Critical Mining Operations TEHRAN, Iran – February 2025. Political protests and economic instability within Iran now pose a tangible, though likely temporary, threat to the global Bitcoin hashrate. This computational backbone of the world’s premier cryptocurrency network could experience a measurable dip as operational challenges mount for Iran’s significant mining sector. Consequently, this situation provides a stark real-world case study on the geographic vulnerabilities and resilience of decentralized networks. Bitcoin Hashrate and Iran’s Pivotal Mining Role The Bitcoin hashrate represents the total combined computational power securing the network. It is a critical metric for security and stability. Iran has emerged as a notable contributor, accounting for an estimated 2% to 4% of this global total. This share stems from the country’s historically low, subsidized energy costs, which attracted mining operations seeking profitability. However, this geographic concentration creates a point of potential fragility. When local conditions deteriorate, the effects can ripple outward to the broader network, demonstrating the interconnected nature of global cryptocurrency infrastructure. Mining operations in Iran do not simply power off like a light switch during civil unrest. Instead, they face a cascade of logistical and operational hurdles. These challenges inevitably degrade efficiency and output. Persistent internet throttling or shutdowns can disrupt miners’ ability to communicate with the global blockchain. Similarly, supply chain interruptions for maintenance parts and heightened physical security concerns for facilities can force scaled-back operations. This complex scenario leads to a gradual decline in contributed hashrate rather than an immediate blackout. Understanding the Root Causes: Currency Collapse and Sector Uncertainty The current protests are not occurring in a vacuum. They are expanding against a backdrop of severe economic pressure, primarily a dramatic collapse in the value of the Iranian rial. This hyperinflationary environment erodes public purchasing power and fuels widespread discontent. For Bitcoin miners, this economic turmoil creates a dual-edged sword. While the local currency’s weakness might theoretically increase the relative value of mined BTC, it also paralyzes day-to-day business operations and escalates costs for imported equipment and components. Authorities have responded to the unrest with actions that generate extreme uncertainty for the mining industry. The sector has historically operated in a regulatory gray area, facing periodic crackdowns. In times of civil tension, the government may prioritize energy for domestic needs or enact stricter internet controls, directly targeting mining activities it deems non-essential or a threat to national stability. This regulatory unpredictability makes long-term planning impossible and forces miners to adopt a cautious, defensive stance. Expert Analysis on Network Resilience and Impact Scope Blockchain analysts and network data specialists consistently note the Bitcoin network’s inherent design for resilience. A potential loss of 2-4% of the global hashrate, while noticeable, is within the range of normal daily and weekly fluctuations. The network automatically adjusts mining difficulty approximately every two weeks. Therefore, a temporary drop in total power would slightly slow block production times before a subsequent difficulty adjustment restores the 10-minute target average. The primary impacts would be short-term and probabilistic. However, the event holds significant symbolic and analytical weight. It highlights the risks of hashrate concentration in geopolitically volatile regions. Industry observers are closely monitoring metrics like: Hashrate Distribution: Shifts in the geographic sources of hashrate. Block Intervals: Temporary increases in the time between mined blocks. Mining Pool Data: Changes in the output of pools known to have operations in affected regions. This data provides a real-time gauge of the event’s severity. Furthermore, it offers valuable insights for miners and investors assessing global risk distribution. The situation underscores the importance of a geographically diversified and politically stable mining infrastructure for long-term network health. Comparative Context and Historical Precedents This is not the first time regional events have impacted global hashrate. Historical precedents offer context for understanding potential outcomes. For instance, regulatory shifts in China during 2021 led to a much more significant hashrate migration, estimated at over 50% of the network at the time. That event caused a larger and more prolonged disruption but ultimately demonstrated the network’s migratory capacity as miners relocated to other countries like the United States and Kazakhstan. Recent Events Impacting Global Bitcoin Hashrate Event Region Estimated Hashrate Impact Primary Cause Network Recovery Time China Mining Ban (2021) East Asia >50% (Migration) Government Regulation Several Months Kazakhstan Internet Shutdown (2022) Central Asia ~13% (Temporary Drop) Political Unrest Days to Weeks Iranian Protests (2025) Middle East 2-4% (Potential Drop) Political & Economic Unrest Expected to be Weeks The Iranian scenario appears less severe in scale compared to these events. The network’s proven resilience suggests it would absorb such a shock effectively. However, each event teaches a different lesson. The Iran case emphasizes how sustained domestic instability, rather than a single regulatory decree, can slowly degrade a region’s mining output through compounded inefficiencies. Conclusion The unfolding situation in Iran presents a live test of the Bitcoin network’s robustness against localized geopolitical strife. While a temporary reduction in the global Bitcoin hashrate is a plausible outcome, the network’s design anticipates and mitigates such fluctuations. The core takeaway extends beyond short-term metrics. This event critically underscores the ongoing evolution of mining geography and the persistent search for stable, low-cost energy within a decentralized system. Observing the network’s response provides invaluable data on its anti-fragility, reinforcing that while individual components may falter, the system as a whole is engineered to endure and adapt. FAQs Q1: What exactly is the Bitcoin hashrate? The Bitcoin hashrate is the total estimated number of terahashes per second (TH/s) the global network is performing. It measures the combined computational power used to mine and process transactions, directly relating to the network’s security and health. Q2: Why is Iran important for Bitcoin mining? Iran has been a significant miner due to its heavily subsidized electricity prices, which make the energy-intensive process of mining Bitcoin highly profitable. Estimates suggest it contributes 2-4% of the global hashrate. Q3: Would a drop in Iran’s hashrate make Bitcoin less secure? A small, temporary drop would have a negligible impact on overall security. The Bitcoin network automatically adjusts its mining difficulty. A sustained, major loss of hashrate could theoretically make the network slightly more vulnerable, but the scale of the potential Iranian impact is well within the network’s capacity to handle without security compromise. Q4: How long would a hashrate impact from Iran last? Any impact would likely be temporary, lasting as long as the operational disruptions within Iran persist. Historical analogs suggest the network would stabilize within weeks, especially if the hashrate loss is on the lower end of estimates. Q5: Does this affect the price of Bitcoin? There is no direct, mechanical link between a small, temporary hashrate fluctuation and Bitcoin’s price. However, significant market sentiment can be influenced by perceptions of network stability. Any price effect would likely be indirect and driven by trader psychology rather than a fundamental change in the network’s operation.

This strategic allocation, reported by blockchain analytics provider EmberCN on April 10, 2025, represents one of the largest single-entity staking actions since Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake, fundamentally altering the network’s security and reward dynamics while sending powerful signals across global financial markets. Bitmine ETH Staking Represents a Strategic Treasury Shift Bitmine controls a total treasury of 4,143,000 ETH. Consequently, the decision to stake over a quarter of this reserve marks a pivotal shift from passive holding to active network participation. Staking involves depositing and locking cryptocurrency to support a blockchain’s operations. In return, participants earn rewards, similar to interest. The Ethereum network currently requires validators to stake a minimum of 32 ETH. However, large entities like Bitmine typically use sophisticated staking services or run their own validator nodes at scale. This action immediately impacts Ethereum’s staking metrics. The total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum staking now exceeds $110 billion. Bitmine’s contribution alone adds roughly 0.8% to the total staked ETH supply. Such a substantial deposit enhances the network’s finality and security. Furthermore, it demonstrates a long-term bullish outlook from a major holder. The company is effectively betting on Ethereum’s sustained utility and value appreciation. Institutional Crypto Adoption Reaches New Milestone The scale of Bitmine’s move provides concrete evidence of deepening institutional involvement in digital asset markets. Traditionally, large corporations treated cryptocurrency as a speculative balance sheet asset. Now, they are actively engaging with the underlying technology to generate yield. This evolution mirrors broader trends in traditional finance where treasury management seeks optimized returns on idle capital. Several factors make Ethereum staking particularly attractive for institutions. First, the rewards offer a predictable yield, currently ranging between 3% and 5% annually. Second, the process supports the security of a leading smart contract platform. Third, with regulatory clarity improving in key jurisdictions, the operational risks have decreased. Bitmine’s decision likely followed extensive internal risk assessment and compliance review. Other corporate treasuries will undoubtedly study this case closely. Analyzing the Impact on Ethereum Network Dynamics From a network perspective, Bitmine’s staking commitment has several technical and economic implications. A primary effect is the increased decentralization of validator control. While concerns about concentration persist, the entry of a new large, independent validator can dilute the influence of the largest staking pools. The table below outlines the immediate before-and-after snapshot of key staking statistics, based on public blockchain data. Metric Pre-Bitmine Staking Post-Bitmine Staking Total Staked ETH ~128.5M ETH ~129.5M ETH Total Value Locked (TVL) ~$109.8B ~$113.0B Staking Ratio (of total supply) ~26.8% ~27.0% Annual Network Issuance (approx.) ~740,000 ETH ~745,000 ETH Economically, staking reduces the liquid supply of ETH available on exchanges. This can create upward pressure on price if demand remains constant. The locked ETH is unavailable for immediate sale, reducing potential sell-side pressure. Moreover, the staking rewards Bitmine earns will likely be reinvested or restaked, creating a compounding effect. This long-term holding strategy contrasts sharply with the trading behavior often seen in cryptocurrency markets. The Broader Context of Corporate Crypto Strategy Bitmine’s action does not exist in a vacuum. It follows a growing trend of public and private companies integrating digital assets into core operations. For instance, technology firms now use blockchain for supply chain management. Payment companies settle transactions using stablecoins. Bitmine itself is a blockchain infrastructure provider, making its treasury strategy a direct extension of its business model. Staking ETH aligns its financial interests with the health and adoption of the Ethereum network. Key considerations for any institution contemplating a similar move include: Regulatory Compliance: Navigating securities laws and tax implications across jurisdictions. Technical Security: Safeguarding validator keys and ensuring 24/7 node uptime to avoid penalties. Liquidity Management: Balancing staked assets with operational capital needs. Market Risk: Managing exposure to ETH price volatility despite earning yield. Bitmine’s substantial commitment suggests it has developed robust frameworks to address these challenges. Its move could serve as a blueprint for other firms in the sector. Additionally, it may encourage more traditional finance institutions to explore staking as a legitimate asset management tool. Expert Perspectives on Market Signaling and Future Trends Industry analysts view Bitmine’s staking decision as a strong vote of confidence. “When a major infrastructure player commits capital of this magnitude, it’s not a short-term trade,” noted a blockchain data analyst from a competing firm. “It’s a strategic endorsement of Ethereum’s long-term roadmap, including upcoming upgrades like proto-danksharding for scalability.” This perspective highlights how technical development and financial investment are increasingly intertwined in the crypto-economy. The timing is also significant. The staking occurred amidst a period of relative stability for Ethereum, following the successful implementation of several network upgrades. The Shanghai upgrade in 2023 enabled withdrawals, making staking more flexible and less risky. This technical improvement removed a major barrier for institutional participation. Bitmine’s move validates the effectiveness of that change. Looking ahead, analysts predict other large ETH holders may follow suit, potentially increasing the network’s staking ratio toward 30% or higher in 2025. Conclusion Bitmine’s decision to stake 25% of its ETH holdings represents a watershed moment for institutional engagement with proof-of-stake blockchains. This $3.2 billion Bitmine ETH staking operation transcends mere yield generation; it signifies a deep, operational commitment to the Ethereum ecosystem’s security and success. The move provides substantial network benefits, sets a precedent for corporate treasury management in the digital age, and underscores the maturation of cryptocurrency from a speculative asset to a productive component of modern finance. As institutions continue to bridge traditional and decentralized finance, actions of this scale will likely become more common, further solidifying blockchain’s role in the global economic infrastructure. FAQs Q1: What does it mean for Bitmine to “stake” its ETH? Staking involves depositing Ethereum into the network to act as a validator, helping to secure the blockchain and process transactions. In return, validators earn rewards. Bitmine has locked 1.03 million ETH to perform this function, supporting the network and generating yield on its holdings. Q2: Why is staking 25% of its holdings significant for Bitmine? Committing a quarter of its total ETH treasury demonstrates a high-conviction, long-term investment in the Ethereum network’s future. It shifts assets from a passive balance sheet item to an active, income-generating tool, reflecting sophisticated treasury management and a reduction in liquid supply that could impact market dynamics. Q3: How does this large-scale staking affect the average Ethereum user? For everyday users, increased staking by large entities like Bitmine enhances overall network security and decentralization. It can lead to a more stable and robust platform for applications. However, it also slightly increases the total ETH supply through staking rewards, a factor balanced by the reduction in liquid ETH available on markets. Q4: What are the risks for Bitmine in staking such a large amount? Primary risks include technical slashing penalties for validator downtime or misbehavior, exposure to ETH price volatility, and the opportunity cost of locking capital that could be deployed elsewhere. Regulatory uncertainty around staking rewards in some jurisdictions also remains a consideration. Q5: Could Bitmine’s move influence other companies to stake their crypto holdings? Yes, it serves as a high-profile case study for institutional staking. Other corporations with crypto treasuries may see Bitmine’s action as validation of the practice’s viability, potentially leading to increased institutional staking participation and further legitimizing proof-of-stake as an institutional-grade financial mechanism.

The analyst argues that a similar “lower trendline reset” preceded ADA’s prior breakout cycle, and that several weekly indicators are now starting to turn. Cardano’s 2020 Fractal Is Back In a Jan. 7 video shared on X, Quantum Ascend said he is looking at ADA’s weekly chart through a macro, multi-leg corrective framework. “On a macro count for ADA, you’re looking at an A, B, C, D, and right now waiting on an E,” he said, framing the current market structure as the late stage of a broader consolidation rather than a fresh downtrend. That “E” leg matters in their model because it effectively marks the final phase of a wedge-like compression. Quantum Ascend pointed to an upper trendline, Fibonacci levels, and prior work published in a mid-December video to justify upside targets once the structure completes. “Essentially you have upper trendline, you have some Fib stuff in play, I have a conservative of five bucks, primary up there at $10,” he said. “And then after that, I think it gets ugly for crypto for a little while, so still a believer that alt season is ahead of us.” Related Reading: Is Cardano Entering a New Phase? Technical Strength, ETF Watch, and Ecosystem Direction Align The core of the argument, however, wasn’t the targets themselves, it was the claimed resemblance to an earlier Cardano correction. Quantum Ascend overlaid a historical “fractal” to highlight comparable price behavior: a move up to a similar level, a pullback, another push into resistance, and then a wick that tagged roughly the same area on the overlay. “This correction right here that I just took this from, look at how similar it is to that correction that we just had,” he said. “Obviously it’s not perfect, but if you tried to get it close from a price structure standpoint… look where that wick on 10.10 went, exactly right there.” In the analyst’s telling, that prior pattern was the market’s way of forcing ADA down to establish a lower trendline before the next expansion. “So this is the same exact move that Cardano had to come down to set the lower trendline,” he said. “So right now setting the lower trendline, before it went on a blast off.” He then referenced the scale of Cardano’s last major run as a reminder of what altcoin cycles have historically looked like when momentum turns. “And how far did it end up running? Well, it ended up going 170X from that point in time, from a penny all the way up to $3,” Quantum Ascend said, using that move as context for why double-digit targets don’t automatically fall into the “impossible” bucket during late-cycle expansions. Related Reading: Cardano Founder Addresses ADA Dump Rumors, Is He Behind The 80% Price Crash? The more immediate claim is that the upside implied by a $10 target is not unprecedented in percentage terms compared with prior alt cycles. “When you’re looking at how far that $10 mark is from where we’re at right now, I mean 22X, right? 25X,” he said. “What was this alt season back here? This alt season was just 2021… That was a 21X… So it’s not unreasonable to be looking for 24X there. And then even on the conservative side, more of a 12X.” On indicators, Quantum Ascend highlighted early signs of a weekly momentum shift rather than a confirmed breakout. “You have a completed ABC. This thing’s ready to turn back around,” he said, adding that broader market conditions looked supportive of a bounce. The analyst also pointed to the weekly RSI beginning to lift after an extended period near lows. “Look at the RSI here on the weekly, finally starting to curl up off the floor. We’ve been down on the floor since October 27th that week, finally getting a little juice.” The analyst described negative momentum as “been decreasing,” and referenced an “ABC” structure on MACD as another piece of the same turning narrative. “A lot of these major moves happen when the weekly RSI goes from low to high,” Quantum Ascend said, arguing that higher timeframes can be slower but more reliable when they finally rotate. Quantum Ascend closed by saying he remains constructive on the project even without a current position. “I am a big believer in this project. I don’t hold any right now. It’s just the way that my portfolio has worked out,” he said. “But I do believe that there’s going to be some massive upside coming to Cardano.” At press time, ADA traded at $0.3925.

Memecoins Among The Coins With The Largest Whale Activity Growths In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has shared the list of cryptocurrencies with a market cap of at least $500 million that have seen the largest weekly jumps in the Whale Transaction Count. The “ Whale Transaction Count ” is an indicator that measures the total number of transfers occurring on a given network involving a value of more than $100,000. Transactions of this size are generally considered to reflect the activity of the whales , humongous entities who carry large amounts in their wallets. When the value of the Whale Transaction Count rises, it means that the whales are ramping up their transfer activity. Such a trend can be a sign that interest in the asset is going up among the big-money traders. On the other hand, the indicator going down implies that the influential members of the market may be shifting their attention away from the cryptocurrency as they have reduced their on-chain participation. Now, here is a table that shows how the major assets in the cryptocurrency sector rank against each other in terms of the percentage change in their Whale Transaction Count over the past week: As is visible above, four tokens from the top 10 happen to be memecoins, assets that are tied to an online meme. Two of these are versions of Floki (FLOKI), with the Ethereum blockchain version topping the list with a weekly Whale Transaction Count increase of a whopping 950%, while the BNB Chain version is third with the metric sitting at 550%. Pepe (PEPE) has come second on the ranking, with whales on the network increasing their activity by 620%. The other memecoin on the list is Shiba Inu (SHIB), ranked tenth with an indicator jump of over 111%. Given that all of these memecoins have seen a substantial increase in the Whale Transaction Count during the past week, it would appear that big-money interest in these assets has reignited. As for what a strong rise in the metric means, it’s usually hard to say anything for certain, as the Whale Transaction Count only includes the absolute number of whale-sized moves and contains no information about whether buying or selling is dominant. In general, though, volatility can be likely to follow spikes in whale activity. In the case of the memecoins, the jump in the indicator has coincided with sharp price surges, pointing to accumulation being dominant. Pepe Price Pepe has enjoyed the strongest rally out of the memecoins that have seen an uptick in whale transfers, as its price has shot up by more than 47% in the past week.",memecoins|Floki|memecoin|Memecoin Whale Transactions|Pepe|PEPEUSDT|Shiba Inu,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-09 02:00:37

Trump told The New York Times in an intervie w Th ursday that he has no plans to pardon Bankman-Fried. The president also ruled out pardons for music producer Sean Combs and former New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez. Bankman-Fried, often called by his initials SBF, has been locked up since August 2023 after a federal judge took away his bail ahead of his criminal trial. During the same conversation, Trump responded to questions about possible conflicts of interest involving the cryptocurrency business. The president and members of his family have ties to American Bitcoin, a company that mines Bitcoin, and World Liberty Financial, which runs the USD1 stablecoin. Trump also has his own digital token called Official Trump, currently trading at $5.36. “I got a lot of votes because I backed crypto, and I got to like it,” Trump said. A judge handed Bankman-Fried his 25-year prison term in March 2024 after a jury found him guilty on seven felony charges. Those charges related to how customer money was mishandled at FTX. Two other former executives got shorter sentences after they made deals with prosecutors. Caroline Ellison, who ran Alameda Research, and Ryan Salame, who was co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, both received less time. Some reports indicated that Bankman-Fried might have tried to get a pardon from Trump by claiming he had a “good relationship” with Republicans and getting close to conservative personalities like Tucker Carlson. On Polymarket, people betting on whether Trump would pardon SBF before 2027 only put the odds at 6%. Trump has given pardons to other people connected to the crypto world. In January, soon after he started his term, he pardoned Ross Ulbricht, who founded the Silk Road marketplace. Trump also surprised many in October by pardoning Changpeng Zhao, known as CZ, who used to run Binance and served four months in prison. Trump later said he did not know Zhao. Legal options still open Even though a pardon from Trump is off the table, Bankman-Fried still has ways to challenge his conviction and sentence through the courts. In November, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit listened to arguments from SBF’s lawyers who want to overturn the former CEO’s conviction. As of Thursday, the court had not posted any decision to the public record, but a ruling is expected at some point. If the appeals court says no, Bankman-Fried could take one final shot by asking the Supreme Court to review his case. Caroline Ellison, who got two years in prison, is set to walk free on January 21. Records from the Federal Bureau of Prisons show she was moved in October from a correctional facility in Danbury, Connecticut to an office in New York City that helps inmates transition back into society. Prediction market shows long odds Sean Combs, the music producer, is polling at just 8% on Kalshi after Trump explicitly said he wouldn’t pardon him. Bob Menendez isn’t doing much better, the former New Jersey senator sits at 13%, another name Trump ruled out for clemency. Roger Ver, who goes by “Bitcoin Jesus,” shows up at 18% on the market. Sam Bankman-Fried is way down at 4%. The prediction market also tracks some other big names Trump didn’t mention in Thursday’s interview. NYC Mayor Eric Adams is at 17%, Edward Snowden at 16%, and Steve Bannon at 15%. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

After the CFTC sent the no-action letter to Bitnomial, the company’s executives expressed excitement and stated that they aim to expand their presence globally. To illustrate the advantages of this letter, sources close to the situation described the no-action letter as a significant milestone for the company, alleging that Bitnomial is exempt from the stringent reporting regulations applicable to asset swaps under current US regulations, thanks to this letter. These sources further noted that these strict reporting regulations create significant challenges for fast-moving platforms, such as prediction markets, in which numerous swaps occur in a single day. Bitnomial achieves a significant milestone after receiving the no-action letter Regarding the CFTC’s recent decision to give Bitnomial the go-ahead to proceed with its plan to offer event contracts and prediction markets, reports have pointed out that the company needs to provide its users with detailed information on its website before moving forward with this intention. Some of the clear information the individual requested included straightforward details such as the precise timestamps and sales data for contract markets. Moreover, Bitnomial needs to submit significant details to the CFTC when the federal government agency asks for them. Apart from these requirements, it was also confirmed that the firm needed to ensure all available positions were completely collateralized. To break this point down, sources with knowledge of the matter, who wished to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of the situation, pointed out that financial regulators required Bitnomial to refrain from utilising leverage and to implement a 1:1 backing. Notably, a 1:1 backing is essential in the operation of a company, as it ensures the availability of sufficient liquidity and helps a firm avoid critical circumstances that pose a threat to its stability. In the meantime, it is worth noting that this recently released no-action letter indicates that financial regulators based in the United States are becoming more willing to consider new ideas for prediction markets. This move comes at a time when blockchain technology is introducing new financial options that were previously lacking in traditional financial systems. Several analysts weighed in on the topic. They conducted research and discovered that many individuals in the US began to show heightened interest in prediction markets around the time of the 2024 elections. Supporters expressed a strong belief that they can predict more precise results than traditional polls. Since that day to date, prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi have drawn the interest of significant investors and have played a key role in popular culture. Prediction markets become more popular among individuals In September 2025, an episode of South Park, a long-running, controversial, satirical animated sitcom on Comedy Central, widely known for its commentary on current events and cultural happenings, displayed Kalshi and Polymarket. This move made these two leading prediction markets more popular among individuals. For instance, reports alleged that the month following their display on an episode of South Park, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), an American multinational financial services company that owns the New York Stock Exchange, made a significant investment worth $2 billion in Polymarket. Consequently, this valued the prediction market at $9 billion. On the other hand, the leading user-friendly cryptocurrency exchange and platform, Coinbase , announced its decision to acquire The Clearing Company, a FinTech startup developing a next-generation, on-chain prediction market platform, as part of its goal to explore this sector in December. This move is anticipated to conclude in January 2026, just before the start of the US midterm elections. At this time, analysts predict that trading activity on prediction markets will substantially rise as the election season commences. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The publicly traded company, based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, announced on Thursday as part of a broader strategy to optimize its large Ethereum holdings. Holding one of the largest ETH treasuries among public companies, SharpLink earlier revealed plans to invest up to $200 million in Ethereum over the coming years. “Now is a pivotal moment for public companies to engage with DeFi,” said Matt Sheffield, SharpLink’s Chief Investment Officer. This initiative includes several industry firsts, such as liquid staking, bridging, and advanced custody solutions. Sheffield argues that making Ethereum productive at an institutional scale helps propel the broader cryptocurrency industry forward. How SharpLink plans to earn higher rewards Sharp-Link aims to help shareholders maximize the rewards from their large Ethereum portfolios . All of its ETH is pledged to Figure Ethereum Staking Rewards, ensuring its security and retaining some rights of participation in the company. Sheffield didn’t say how much each incentive pays, but he said the company is poised to negotiate “many more deals of this kind”, as long as they are in the interests of stockholders. The stock market reacted modestly. Shares of SharpLink (SBET) ended at $10.28 on Thursday, up about 1.4 per cent for the day. However, the price had already decreased by more than 33% compared to its initial report on the staking roadmap in October, as investor expectations evolved. SharpLink currently remains the custodian of 864,840 ETH, which is around $2.7 billion in value at today’s market rate. All of this Ethereum is already staked. At present, the company is the second-largest publicly traded holder of Ethereum treasuries. Earlier in September, SharpLink CEO Joseph Chalom stated that the company needed to support “Ethereum-aligned products” because the firm’s long-term thesis hinges on Ethereum becoming more widely adopted in real-world finance. The company sees Ethereum as a foundation for future global markets, not just a digital asset. Why Linea matters now and what SharpLink plans next Linea is part of a growing sector of Layer-2 networks built on Ethereum. These networks process transactions off the main Ethereum chain to make things faster and less expensive. Linea also has strong ties to Ethereum’s founding ecosystem. SharpLink’s chairman, Joseph Lubin, who also co-founded Ethereum, is the founder and CEO of Consensys , the software firm that incubated Linea. SharpLink is also a member of the Linea Consortium, which is responsible for managing the governance and token distribution of the Linea network. Linea introduced its own token in September. After launch, network activity surged and then cooled. The data indicate that the total value locked (TVL) on Linea peaked at approximately $1.64 billion, about two weeks after the token went live. Since then, TVL has fallen approximately 89% to around $185.74 million, according to DefiLlama. Although the percentage has decreased, SharpLink still believes that creating decentralized finance (DeFi) systems for institutions can yield long-term benefits. The company also plans to provide an example of how public corporations can fully and securely utilize blockchain technology in their treasury operations. Sheffield called the update a “new on-chain paradigm” for capital markets and noted that SharpLink is still working on making its Ethereum treasury. As of press time, Ether (ETH) has fallen by just 1% in the past 24 hours, trading at approximately $3,115, which remains 37% below its peak of $4,946. Sheffield said the Linea deployment is not a one-off event. SharpLink wants to structure more deals that layer extra yields on top of staking rewards, as long as they remain safe and beneficial for shareholders.

As market liquidity gradually improved, capital rotated from defensive positions toward high-beta, sentiment-driven sectors , thrusting memecoins back into the spotlight. Over the past week (December 29, 2025 – January 4, 2026), multiple newly listed assets on HTX recorded impressive gains. Memecoins across BSC, Solana, Base, Ethereum, and TRON ecosystems rallied, marking one of the most representative market trends of the week. Memecoin Sector: Multi-Chain Rallies Driven by Accelerating Momentum This week’s top gainers were dominated by memecoin projects, reflecting a sustained capital preference for assets with high consensus and strong virality. On BNB Smart Chain (BSC), BROCCOLI (CZ’s dog) stood out as the top performer, surging 170% over the week. As an active memecoin project within the BSC ecosystem, BROCCOLI rapidly attracted capital through community-driven dissemination and sentiment resonance. Meanwhile, 4 (FOUR) gained 48%, PALU rose 37%, and Binance Life increased 19%, highlighting a broad-based pickup in the BSC memecoin sector. The Solana ecosystem maintained its strength. PONKE (Ponke) climbed 104% this week, supported by rising community engagement and expanding trading volume, making it a flagship asset within the SOL memecoin space. BONK (Bonk) advanced 44%, while BOME (Book of Meme) gained 37%, signaling continued development potential for Solana-based memecoins. Other ecosystems also posted notable gains. On Ethereum, leading memecoin PEPE rose 64%. On TRON, memecoin SUNDOG (Sundog) increased 39% over the week. Within the Base ecosystem, BRETT (Brett) recorded a 43% weekly gain. These moves underscore that both the royal public chains and the emerging Layer2 networks continue to attract capital under the memecoin narrative. AI Sector: Selective Recovery Led by the Base Ecosystem While memecoins drove short-term retail sentiment, the AI sector experienced a “structural recovery,” with strength concentrated primarily within the Base ecosystem. GAMEBASE (Game by Virtuals) surged 60% during the week. As an AI agent gaming framework supported by Virtuals, GAME attracted attention at the intersection of AI, blockchain gaming, and application-layer narratives. Meanwhile, VIRTUAL (Virtuals Protocol) rose 40%, driven by its positioning as an AI and Metaverse protocol focused on virtual interaction. Overall, AI assets exhibited a structural recovery rather than a sentiment-driven surge. While short-term momentum lagged memecoins, AI assets continue to hold mid-term allocation value within broader narrative cycles. *Disclaimer: The above content is provided for market information and trend analysis purposes only and does not constitute any investment advice.

HTX Listing Strategy: Multi-Sector Coverage with a Value-Oriented Focus The market performance this week followed a clear “sentiment-first, memecoin-led” pattern. With strong consensus, rapid dissemination, and high volatility, memecoins became the primary short-term destination for capital. At the same time, assets from the narrative-driven sectors such as AI showed selective recovery across specific chains, offering diversified opportunities. Through high-frequency listing and multi-chain asset deployment, HTX continues to expand listing coverage across core narratives including memecoin and AI, providing users with a broader range of trading opportunities. In 2026, HTX’s asset listing strategy will maintain high sensitivity to market trends while reinforcing a value-focusing philosophy through progressively stricter listing standards. By combining forward-looking deployment in high-growth assets with refined selection, HTX aims to amplify the wealth effect of quality assets and help users capture more deterministic opportunities in the fast-growing crypto market.

According to a report from the prominent blockchain security firm PeckShield, the perpetrator transferred 8,500 Ethereum (ETH), valued at approximately $26.5 million, to two new anonymous wallet addresses. This development, occurring after the initial confirmed attack, underscores the complex challenges of tracking and recovering stolen digital assets in the decentralized finance ecosystem. The recipient addresses, identified by the starting sequences 0x2735 and 0xD12f, now represent the latest chapter in this ongoing financial cyber-incident. TruBit Hack: Anatomy of a $26.5 Million ETH Heist The recent fund movement represents a critical post-breach activity commonly observed in major cryptocurrency thefts. Initially, TruBit publicly confirmed it fell victim to a security incident, a common but damaging event for digital exchanges. Subsequently, blockchain analytics firms like PeckShield began monitoring the associated hacker-controlled addresses. The transfer of 8,500 ETH to fresh wallets, often called “crypto laundering,” typically aims to obfuscate the trail of stolen funds. This process may involve using decentralized exchanges (DEXs), cross-chain bridges, or privacy-focused protocols to break the forensic link. For context, the table below outlines the scale of this transfer compared to other notable 2024 exchange hacks. Exchange / Incident Approximate Value Stolen (USD) Primary Asset TruBit (This Incident) $26.5 Million Ethereum (ETH) FixedFloat (2024) $26 Million Bitcoin, Ethereum CoinEx (2023) $55 Million Multiple Tokens Blockchain investigators emphasize that such large, singular transfers often precede more complex fragmentation. The hacker’s strategy likely involves several potential next steps. These steps include converting the ETH into other cryptocurrencies or utilizing coin-mixing services. Consequently, the window for potential recovery or freezing of assets narrows significantly with each transaction. Blockchain Forensics and the Role of Security Firms Firms like PeckShield, CertiK, and Chainalysis play a pivotal role in the aftermath of such breaches. They employ sophisticated on-chain analysis tools to track fund flows across public ledgers. Their public alerts serve multiple crucial purposes. First, they notify other exchanges and liquidity providers to blacklist the identified addresses. Second, they provide transparency to the affected users and the broader community. Finally, they create a public record that aids law enforcement agencies in potential investigations. The identification of addresses starting with 0x2735 and 0xD12f is a direct result of this continuous monitoring. However, the pseudonymous nature of blockchain addresses presents an enduring challenge. While transactions are transparent and immutable, linking an address to a real-world identity requires off-chain intelligence, which is often difficult to obtain. Expert Analysis on Exchange Security Posture Cybersecurity experts specializing in digital assets point to a consistent pattern in exchange breaches. Often, vulnerabilities arise from compromised private keys, smart contract exploits, or sophisticated social engineering attacks. The TruBit incident reinforces the non-negotiable need for robust, multi-layered security architectures. These architectures should include cold storage for the vast majority of funds, rigorous internal access controls, and real-time transaction monitoring systems. Furthermore, the rapid movement of stolen funds highlights the critical importance of having established response protocols and partnerships with forensic firms before an incident occurs. Exchanges that delay public disclosure or lack coordinated response plans often see stolen funds move beyond reach more quickly, exacerbating user losses. The Ripple Effect: Impact on Users and Market Confidence The direct impact of the TruBit hack and subsequent fund transfer falls most heavily on the exchange’s users. Individuals with assets held on the platform face uncertainty regarding potential reimbursements. Historically, exchanges handle such events through various methods. Some utilize insurance funds, while others may temporarily halt operations. The broader impact, however, resonates across the cryptocurrency market. Each significant hack can erode institutional and retail investor confidence, reinforcing perceptions of risk associated with centralized custodians. This event may prompt several reactions from the market and regulators. Increased Scrutiny: Regulators in Latin America and globally may intensify their examination of exchange security practices. User Migration: Traders might move assets to exchanges with perceived stronger security records or towards self-custody solutions. Protocol Development: The incident fuels ongoing development in decentralized insurance protocols and non-custodial trading platforms. Security Investment: Exchanges are likely to further prioritize and market their security infrastructure to retain trust. Moreover, the movement of such a large sum of ETH can create minor, localized selling pressure if the hacker attempts to convert assets on the open market. Blockchain analysts will closely monitor the destination addresses for any interaction with known off-ramps or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Conclusion The transfer of $26.5 million in stolen ETH from the TruBit hack to new addresses marks a critical phase in this cybersecurity incident. It demonstrates the active efforts by malicious actors to liquidate or conceal illicit gains after a breach. This event underscores the perpetual cat-and-mouse game between cryptocurrency hackers and blockchain forensic firms. For the industry, it serves as another powerful reminder of the paramount importance of security. For users, it reinforces the need for diligence in selecting service providers and understanding the risks of centralized custody. The ongoing tracking of addresses 0x2735 and 0xD12f will be a key metric for whether any of the stolen funds can be recovered, a process that remains one of the most significant challenges in the digital asset ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What exactly happened in the TruBit hack? The Latin American cryptocurrency exchange TruBit suffered a security breach. Subsequently, a hacker linked to the theft moved 8,500 ETH (worth $26.5 million) from the original stolen fund address to two new anonymous wallets identified by PeckShield. Q2: Can the stolen ETH be recovered or frozen? Recovery is difficult but possible. Blockchain analysis firms track the funds, and exchanges can blacklist the addresses. However, recovery often requires legal action and cooperation across jurisdictions, and hackers use techniques to obscure the trail. Q3: What does PeckShield do, and how did they identify this transfer? PeckShield is a blockchain security company. They use forensic software to analyze public blockchain data, monitoring known hacker addresses for any transaction activity, which is how they detected this large transfer to the new 0x2735 and 0xD12f addresses. Q4: How does this affect ordinary TruBit users? Users whose funds were held on the exchange face potential losses. The exchange’s ability to reimburse users depends on its insurance, reserves, and the success of any recovery efforts. Users should follow official communications from TruBit. Q5: Why do hackers move stolen crypto to new addresses? Hackers move funds to break the forensic link, making tracking harder. They often use a series of new addresses, decentralized exchanges, or mixing services to launder the cryptocurrency before attempting to cash out, complicating recovery efforts.

Early moves in the region stayed measured. Shanghai rose 0.58%, the SZSE Component added 0.36%, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 0.40% to 26,254.50. The China A50 slipped 0.16%, showing a more cautious tone in large-caps. Investors treated crypto the same way. Prices moved in a tight band after a volatile start to the year, with positioning leaning toward a wait-and-see stance ahead of macro headlines. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $91,102, up 0.3% Ether : $3,111, down 1.3% XRP : $2.12, down 1.8% Total crypto market cap: $3.19 trillion, down 0.2% Bitcoin Rangebound As Payrolls And Rate Outlook Shape Market Tone Linh Tran, senior market analyst at XS.com, said current data leans toward a scenario in which Bitcoin consolidates with a cautiously upward bias, rather than entering a deep bearish reversal. “Bitcoin’s consolidation range for the remainder of January is likely to fluctuate between $88,000 and $95,000,” she said. Across broader markets, Japan and Australia opened higher, and South Korea lagged. Trading stayed sensitive to any clue on global growth and US rates, since payrolls could reset expectations for how quickly the Federal Reserve cuts borrowing costs. Wall Street sent a mixed signal overnight. The S&P 500 finished essentially flat on Thursday, and selling hit big technology names such as Nvidia, even as defence stocks advanced after Trump called for an enlarged $1.5 trillion military budget. Dollar Holds Firm As Risk Appetite Stays In Check Rates markets also reacted to a separate Trump remark. Treasury futures inched up and mortgage-backed securities rallied after he said he was directing the purchase of $200B of mortgage bonds. The tariff story also sat near the top of the risk calendar. The Supreme Court could decide the fate of most of Trump’s tariffs as soon as Friday, and hundreds of companies have lined up hoping to recoup a share of the billions of dollars in duties paid so far. In the background, money markets priced in at least two quarter-point Fed cuts in 2026, keeping the dollar supported and leaving risky assets trading with a tighter leash. Elsewhere, the dollar held on to gains from the prior session, oil extended its advance as investors monitored developments in Venezuela and Iran, silver pulled back further from this week’s record, and gold stayed steady. Fitch raised its US growth outlook, estimating GDP expanded 2.1% in 2025 and forecasting 2.0% growth in 2026, after incorporating economic data that arrived late following last year’s government shutdown.

Amid this churning landscape, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, has outlined three essential “checkpoints for a rally,” which he believes must be met for a lasting cryptocurrency recovery this year. Key Hurdles For Crypto Rally In the report released on January 6, Hougan highlighted the first hurdle for a sustained rally: avoiding a repeat of the catastrophic events that transpired on October 10, 2025. On that day, the market witnessed the largest liquidation event in its history, erasing approximately $19 billion in futures positions in just 24 hours. Related Reading: Did Morgan Stanley Orchestrate Bitcoin October Crash? Analysts Draw Correlations The aftermath of this event raised concerns among investors about the potential long-term health of significant market players such as hedge funds and major market makers. Many feared that these entities might need to liquidate assets to stabilize their operations, a scenario that could weigh heavily on the market. However, Hougan expressed a degree of optimism, suggesting that if any major firm were poised for a downturn, it likely would have occurred by now. He argues that investors have begun to move past the traumatic experience of October 10, contributing to the recent rally at the start of the new year. The second checkpoint outlined by Hougan is the passage of the crypto market structure bill, known as the CLARITY Act, which is currently making its way through Congress with the anticipated markup scheduled for January 15. This process involves aligning various drafts from the Senate banking and agriculture committees to reach a final vote. However, NewsBTC reported on Wednesday that several hurdles remain, including differing perspectives on how to regulate decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoin rewards. Legislative Framework Essential Hougan emphasized that the approval of the CLARITY Act is crucial for the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies in the United States. Without a legislative framework, Hougan stressed that the current pro-crypto stance at regulatory agencies could shift dramatically under future administrations. Bitwise’s CIO emphasized that passing the crypto market structure bill would solidify key regulatory principles into law, providing a sound foundation for ongoing growth in the crypto sector.

While cryptocurrencies do not operate in lockstep with stocks, a significant downturn—such as a 20% drop in the S&P 500—could dampen enthusiasm for all risk assets, including digital currencies. Hougan also notes growing concerns about a potential artificial intelligence (AI) bubble. However, current prediction markets suggest a low probability of a recession in 2026 and an approximately 80% chance of gains for the S&P 500.

56997179,https://square.htx.com/?p=47415,1767927631,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/100/default.png,HTX 2025 RECAP & 2026 OUTLOOK | Defining the Next Growth Cycle Through Long-Termism,https://square.htx.com/__trashed-3/,"Foreword In 2025, the crypto market remained volatile at the intersection of a high-interest-rate environment, geopolitical uncertainty, and a new technological cycle. Early in the year, market sentiment surged following Trump’s inauguration and favorable policy signals. By mid-year, funds were increasingly concentrated in core assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, while short-term narratives gradually cooled. Toward year-end, as macro liquidity continued to tighten, the market entered a phase of range-bound consolidation. Against this backdrop, the structure of market trading underwent a profound change. Emotion-driven speculation steadily receded, and the industry began transitioning from a “fast-cycle” phase dominated by short-term price action to a “slow-variable” stage focused more on security, liquidity, and long-term value. For HTX, 2025 was a year of steady growth and continuous breakthroughs amid this rapid industry transformation. As Justin Sun, Advisor to HTX, has noted, the platform practices long-termism with the conviction of “making incremental progress every day “. Each promising asset listing, every improvement to the product experience, and every instance of paying heed to users has been transformed into sustained forward momentum. HTX, which has now navigated 12 years of bull and bear cycles, has achieved a series of major milestones this year. User scale and trading volume expanded steadily, with cumulative global registered users surpassing 55 million, and 6 million new users added during the year, representing an 85% year-on-year increase . Annual trading volume reached approximately $3.3 trillion , up 39% year on year, while net capital inflows totaled $608 million. HTX was also approved for Pakistan crypto exchange registration, further strengthening its overall compliance framework and service capabilities. Throughout the year, the platform maintained a flawless record of zero security incidents. It was named one of the “World’s Most Trustworthy Crypto Exchanges” of 2025 by Forbes, while Global Advisor Justin Sun appeared on the cover of Forbes and received multiple industry awards. Multiple breakthroughs have not only marked pivotal moments in HTX’s development history but also earned the platform recognition from both users and the market. According to a CoinDesk research report, as of November, HTX recorded a 2.06% increase in market share in 2025, ranking first among mainstream centralized exchanges worldwide. In a year characterized by a slowing industry pace and structural rebalancing, HTX no longer chose to chase short-term hype. Instead, it focused on reinforcing its foundational capabilities amid market volatility, adhering firmly to a user-first philosophy and preparing itself for the next crypto cycle as a long-term builder in the industry. Whether under extreme market conditions or liquidity pressure, the platform’s asset reserves, risk-control framework, and security mechanisms have stood firm in market tests. HTX 2025 Overview HTX 2025｜Platform Achievements I. Business Innovation and Market Performance In 2025, HTX drove comprehensive breakthroughs across its core businesses, including spot, futures, OTC, Earn, and margin trading, by centering on intelligent upgrades, forward-looking asset positioning, and deeper infrastructure development. In a volatile market, it achieved steady growth. Spot and futures trading volumes continued to expand, while tools such as trading bots, futures grid, and Smart Copy saw rapid adoption, becoming essential instruments for users navigating volatile market conditions. HTX’s asset-listing strategy evolved from chasing short-term sentiment to prioritizing first-launch value, with multiple assets generating an amplified cross-platform effect following their debut on HTX. Ongoing optimization of derivatives, margin, and Earn products, particularly in liquidity depth, capital efficiency, and risk control, further strengthened the platform’s professional trading ecosystem. In OTC trading, HTX spearheaded a service paradigm shift through its P2P Premium, setting a new industry benchmark for P2P trading experiences with higher security standards and a full compensation mechanism. Meanwhile, multi-tier yield products, along with a diverse array of asset campaigns and trading competitions, worked in concert to fuel user enthusiasm and drive a virtuous cycle of ecosystem growth. 1. Spot Trading: Steady Growth Amid Market Volatility, with Smart Tools Becoming New Favorites In 2025, more than 922,000 users participated in spot trading on HTX, including 545,000 newly registered users who completed trades. Cumulative spot trading volume exceeded 1.9 trillion USDT, representing a nearly 30% year-on-year growth. Annual trading volume reached approximately 84.8 billion USDT for BTC and 40.4 billion USDT for ETH. ● Spot Trading Bots Spot trading bots have gradually become a core tool for users to navigate volatility and participate in the market with greater stability. In 2025, total grid trading volume rose 97% year on year, while capital allocated to grid strategies increased 100% year on year. More and more users adopted the approach of “setting a price range and automatically buying low and selling high”, turning market fluctuations into executable trading logic. From a trading structure perspective, the use cases for spot trading bots continued to broaden. Grid trading volume related to stablecoins surged 352% year on year, while grid trading volume for major cryptocurrencies grew 122% year on year. In an environment marked by uncertainty, spot trading bots are emerging as a more convenient and reliable trading solution for users. 2. New Asset Strategy: From “Chasing Hype” to “Creating First-Launch Value” In 2025, HTX listed a total of 166 new cryptos. Unlike previous years, the platform’s listing strategy gradually shifted from an emphasis on market sentiment and traffic toward an upfront evaluation of narrative origins, community structures, and asset life cycles, allowing HTX to identify, position, and list high-potential assets at an earlier stage. The meme sector served as a clear embodiment of this strategy. Throughout the year, HTX maintained a forward-looking grasp of on-chain narratives, with early judgment and early listings delivering standout results. In January, $TRUMP debuted and quickly became the most representative asset. After listing on HTX, it recorded a peak gain of 10x, forming the largest-scale and highest-participation single-asset trading event of the year. In March, HTX was among the first to list meme tokens such as $TST and $MUBARAK, supported by narratives combining CZ’s influence and rising Middle Eastern capital engagement with crypto. Both achieved gains of over 2x. In July, $M captured widespread attention with a staggering 42x surge. In November, AI meme frontrunner $PIPPIN began its rally, delivering a cumulative gain of 95x over the year. HTX also listed a series of assets with strong wealth-creation effects, including $BANANAS31, $DONKEY, and $GIGGLE, which achieved gains of 13x, 69x, and 4x, respectively. HTX 2025｜Alpha Opportunities In the stablecoin and crypto financial infrastructure space, HTX’s strategy likewise emphasized upfront validation and strong narrative-execution capability. In May, HTX became the first exchange globally to list USD1, a stablecoin associated with the Trump family, and took the lead in expanding its ecosystem use cases, emerging as the earliest mainstream platform to systematically capture this narrative. In September, HTX further reinforced its first-mover advantage in compliance-oriented financial narratives by being the first to list $WLFI (World Liberty Financial). At the same time, HTX maintained a sharp focus on the leading edge of emerging narratives, taking early positions in the popular PerpDEX theme. Following their debut on HTX, $AVNT on Base recorded a peak gain of 14x, while $ASTER on BSC surged 4x, making them trend-setting assets within their respective sectors. Driven by a rigorous asset-selection strategy, HTX sustained a steady cadence of high-quality listings month after month, ensuring that every user trading on HTX has the opportunity to gain early access to the most explosive asset cycles as they unfold. 3. Futures Trading: Monthly Growth in Trading Volume, with Deepening Liquidity and Product Capabilities Through continuous optimization of trading depth, liquidity structure, and product experience, HTX Futures steadily reinforced its core competitiveness in the derivatives market. As of December, total futures trading volume on HTX in 2025 reached $1.4 trillion, representing a 50% increase compared to 2024, with trading volumes showing consistent month-by-month growth. In terms of asset coverage, HTX Futures listed 208 new futures trading assets in 2025, among which nearly 132 assets experienced growth exceeding 200%, accounting for over 63% of total new listings. HTX 2025｜Futures Ecosystem Growth Against the backdrop of persistent volatility across global crypto markets in 2025, HTX also demonstrated the responsibility expected of a leading platform. It launched the “Sail Together Initiative” , offering traders worldwide $100 million in total. Through its real-fund incentive mechanism, the initiative materially eased users’ trading pressure during periods of extreme volatility, helping more traders navigate market cycles while continuously enhancing trading experience and long-term participation confidence. ● Trading Depth and User Experience By deepening collaboration with multiple top-tier market makers and continuously refining its internal trading structure, HTX Futures saw a marked improvement in liquidity beginning in April 2025, notably enhancing order-book depth and execution stability for core futures trading pairs such as BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT. In addition, over the course of 2025, HTX completed more than 120 futures-related feature optimizations, with a strong focus on high-frequency use cases, including improvements to funding-rate display logic, auto-snapping order sliders, newly added pair selectors, and ongoing refinements to order types. These upgrades continuously reduced users’ operational costs and further improved overall trading smoothness. ● Smart Trading Tools Futures Grid was upgraded to Version 2.0, driving rapid expansion in its user base. The number of monthly active users surpassed 30,000, while average daily trading volume exceeded $20 million. The strategic value of futures grid trading in range-bound markets was further validated, with rising market penetration gradually establishing it as one of the go-to tools for users to participate in futures trading. The Copy Trading system was upgraded to Version 4.0, with the introduction of Smart Copy. This upgrade significantly strengthened the profit-synchronization mechanism and the fund-isolation system, delivering more accurate trade replication and higher-level capital protection across complex market and strategy execution scenarios. In parallel, the Trader Mode was comprehensively enhanced, ensuring stability and execution consistency even in high-volatility environments. ● Capital Efficiency and Risk Management To address users’ demand for more efficient utilization of idle funds in futures accounts, HTX continued to enhance its SmartEarn product and introduced SmartEarn APY Booster Coupons, further improving the flexibility of generating stable returns within futures trading accounts. On the risk-management front, HTX steadily advanced its Multi-Assets Collateral mode for futures trading, which now supports five assets: BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, and USDD. Platform data shows that trading volume under the Multi-Assets Collateral mode now accounts for over 60% of total futures trading volume. This mechanism effectively improves users’ capital utilization efficiency while strengthening the overall risk-buffering capacity of futures accounts. 4. OTC Trading: Building a Full-Scenario On/Off-Ramp Ecosystem, with Premium Leading an Industry Service Upgrade In 2025, HTX continued to refine its OTC trading ecosystem, revolving around security, compliance, and global accessibility. By building a full-scenario service platform encompassing P2P trading, deposits and withdrawals, Convert, and fiat transactions, HTX achieved simultaneous growth in both business scale and service quality amid an increasingly complex and dynamic global on/off-ramp environment. HTX 2025｜P2P Premium As a critical gateway for capital inflows and outflows, HTX OTC served a total of 3.93 million users worldwide throughout the year, facilitating approximately $360 billion in transaction volume. The platform currently supports 187 cryptocurrencies, 74 fiat currencies, and more than 600 payment methods, with services spanning 231 countries and regions, demonstrating a mature and robust system capacity. Supported by a dual-layer protection framework that combines intelligent risk control with manual review, alongside 24/7 global customer support and a multi-jurisdictional compliance licensing strategy, HTX OTC continues to deliver secure, efficient, and compliant fiat trading and asset circulation services to users worldwide, steadily solidifying its role as a cornerstone of the platform’s global financial infrastructure. ● P2P Premium In April 2025, HTX launched the industry’s first high-quality P2P trading zone—the P2P Premium. Built around the core philosophy of “eliminating risk at the source”, Premium introduced a systematic redesign of advertiser onboarding standards, risk-control systems, protection mechanisms, and the overall trading experience. It not only addresses the long-standing trust and risk-control challenges inherent in traditional P2P models but also pioneers a new P2P service pathway for the industry. Through stringent advertiser selection and ongoing review mechanisms, Premium significantly elevates overall advertiser quality and mitigates risk at its origin. Since its launch, it has maintained a zero-freeze operational record, setting a highly influential benchmark for security standards within the industry. On the user protection front, Premium introduced an industry-first “100% full compensation” mechanism, explicitly committing to full reimbursement for qualifying cases involving judicial account freezes. This truly delivers on the promise of “zero freeze on withdrawals, and 100% compensation”, eliminating user concerns at the institutional level. This mechanism has not only substantially enhanced user trust but also redefined the security boundaries of P2P trading. Furthermore, Premium rolled out a zero-fee policy with strict price controls, offering users more competitive prices while ensuring compliant advertiser operations. Through a diversified ad label framework and an intelligent matching system, the platform effectively improves order-matching efficiency and completion rates, striking a balance between high-quality transactions and efficient execution. ● Global Localized Services In its global expansion, HTX OTC continued to double down on investment in localized service capabilities worldwide. In 2025, HTX established and strengthened local operations and service teams across multiple key markets, enabling localized coordination across trade matching, advertiser management, and customer support. By developing a deep understanding of local payment habits, regulatory requirements, and user needs, the platform significantly enhanced the overall advertiser quality and user activity across multiple regions, providing robust support for the healthy growth of its OTC business. Beyond handling daily operations and services, local teams also play critical roles in advertiser reviews, risk identification, and dispute resolution, ensuring HTX OTC’s consistently high service standards and security levels across the globe. By advancing globalization and localization in parallel, HTX OTC has gradually built a replicable and scalable operating model, laying a solid foundation for the platform’s future expansion of fiat and on/off-ramp services into more regions. 5. HTX Earn: Building a Multi-Layer Yield Matrix to Cope with Market Uncertainty with Predictable Returns As market volatility intensified, user demand for stable and reliable yield solutions continued to rise. HTX Earn rewarded users with a better product experience, a wider range of Earn options, higher yields, and richer brand-led campaigns, driving the continued expansion of its Earn ecosystem. In 2025, HTX Earn served over 600,000 users, supported more than 300 cryptocurrencies, and launched over 390 Earn products throughout the year. Its structured product, Shark Fin, rolled out 112 rounds, with cumulative subscription volume exceeding 1 billion USDT. Through three core pillars, namely, Simple Earn, structured products, and on-chain products, HTX optimized its Earn product matrix and subscription workflows, bringing them in line with top-tier industry standards. The platform significantly outperformed its peers in hotspot asset tracking, APYs, and listing speed, establishing clear differentiated advantages, most notably its consistently industry-leading yields on PoS assets. At the same time, HTX introduced themed Earn Bonanzas and monthly user reward activities, further strengthening product stickiness and brand recognition. 6. Margin Trading and Collateral Swap: Record-High Trading Volume and User Activity Driven by Product Strength and Professionalization Since the beginning of 2025, HTX has undertaken comprehensive upgrades across its margin trading and Collateral Swap product suites. By advancing improvements in user experience, asset diversity, risk management, and efficiency in tandem, the platform has propelled both trading scale and user activity to new highs. ● HTX Margin The number of users surpassed 160,000, with cumulative loan volume reaching $4.7 billion and total margin trading volume approaching $50 billion. Average daily outstanding borrowings exceeded $100 million for the first time. During the year, HTX restructured its position models and introduced real-time PnL displays through a full overhaul of its margin trading interface, allowing users to monitor positions and real-time returns more intuitively and significantly improving trading efficiency. At the same time, the platform continued to expand its asset lineup, adding a total of 82 new assets eligible for margin trading and extending coverage across a wider range of mainstream and trending assets to support more flexible and diversified trading strategies. On the user incentive front, HTX Margin rolled out multiple rounds of limited-time low-interest and zero-interest campaigns throughout the year, along with themed initiatives such as the Collateral Swap promo. These efforts effectively reduced users’ capital costs, boosted their trading enthusiasm, and helped them seize market opportunities. ● Collateral Swap (formerly Crypto Loans) To better serve users’ medium- and long-term capital utilization needs, HTX launched a revamped Collateral Swap featuring multiple key upgrades. It now supports multi-asset collateral, covering nearly 40 mainstream and popular assets, significantly enhancing capital utilization efficiency. System stability and security have been strengthened in tandem, delivering a smoother and more reliable borrowing experience. In addition, users can enjoy fee reductions more conveniently with interest vouchers, further lowering borrowing costs. Data shows that since the start of 2025, nearly 200,000 users have utilized Collateral Swap services on HTX, with a cumulative loan scale exceeding $8 billion, making it one of the most steadily growing core products in HTX’s lending ecosystem. ● Liquidity Boost (formerly OTC Loan) Building on its original OTC loan framework, HTX launched and continuously refined its Liquidity Boost. User management GMT was fully upgraded and migrated to unified management on the HTX homepage, substantially enhancing account security. The UI and monitoring features on the management interface were comprehensively optimized. The interest-free loan policy was also upgraded, introducing selectable trading volume targets and supporting standalone spot trading targets, thus offering high-frequency and professional traders more tailored incentive mechanisms. In 2025, total loan scale grew by more than 50% from the beginning of the year, surpassing $150 million, further strengthening the platform’s liquidity support capabilities. Driven by both product experience enhancement and scale expansion, HTX’s margin trading and Collateral Swap businesses are steadily forming a development landscape characterized by high efficiency, robust risk controls, and multi-scenario coordination, offering users more stable and flexible fund management and trading solutions. 7. Asset Campaigns: High-Frequency Momentum and Innovative Engagement Fuel User Participation In 2025, HTX anchored its efforts around two core themes: asset trading and hot-topic marketing. Through frequent trading contests, its flagship Trading Championship, and innovative Launchpool mechanics, the platform achieved explosive growth in both trading volume and user activity. ● Popular Assets Throughout the year, HTX hosted a total of 303 trading events centered on popular assets, drawing 1.65 million participants and onboarding 228,000 new traders. Powered by strong traffic momentum, spot trading volume reached 15.36 billion USDT, while futures trading volume hit 23.38 billion USDT. Over$1 million in rewards was distributed to users, effectively boosting platform liquidity and overall market activity. ● Launchpool In asset empowerment, Launchpool emerged as a highlight of the year. HTX launched 23 high-quality projects, with the largest reward pool exceeding 2.28 million USDT. A cumulative total of over 67.8 trillion $HTX tokens was committed, while participation surged to 200,000 users. Launchpool supports a “one asset, multiple rewards” model, allowing users to stake $HTX to earn airdrops from multiple projects simultaneously, significantly stimulating demand for $HTX holdings. ● HTX Trading Championship In the fourth quarter of 2025, HTX launched its first-ever large-scale global trading league, the Trading Championship, featuring a million-dollar prize pool to support traders worldwide across both bull and bear market cycles. The HTX Trading Championship featured three core competitions: the Points Contest, the Trading Challenge, and Team Battles, with dual tracks covering both spot and futures markets. The series achieved a staggering total trading volume exceeding 14 billion USDT, attracted more than 90,000 participants, and distributed nearly 1 million USDT in rewards. This event effectively stimulated trading enthusiasm while further enhancing platform liquidity and overall market activity. II. Product and System Upgrades: System-Level Renewal Reshapes the High-Frequency Trading Experience To comprehensively enhance user experience and platform competitiveness, HTX rolled out broad, multi-layered product and system upgrades centered on three core areas: trading experience optimization, user asset management, and growth-tool innovation. By refreshing its design system, reconstructing core flows, and refining its strategic matrix, HTX not only significantly boosted product usability and efficiency but also laid a solid groundwork for sustained business growth. 1. Comprehensive Trading Platform Upgrade: Unified Interaction and Seamless Performance This upgrade focused on creating a more unified and efficient trading environment for both professional traders and everyday users, delivering end-to-end optimization across visual design and functions. Unified Interaction, Platform-Wide Renewal: HTX completed a unified trading system upgrade spanning spot, margin, and futures. The new visual design and interaction logic consolidated and streamlined core operational flows, such as order placement and position management, enabling a seamless cross-product trading experience. Core Experience Redesign: The K-line trading interface underwent a deep overhaul, introducing “one-click order placement” and significantly shortening the path from market analysis to trade execution, enabling users to seize market opportunities more quickly. In futures trading, upgrades to modules such as the trading pair selector and order placement sector significantly increased users’ propensity to place orders. Spot and margin trading experiences were also comprehensively optimized across core modules, including order placement panels, order books, open orders, and asset displays. These enhancements deliver richer decision-making information, streamline trading actions, and markedly improve order placement efficiency. Underlying System Breakthroughs: A new futures trading system was launched, supporting both Multi-Assets Collateral and single-crypto trading. This provides a robust system foundation for future feature expansion and rapid iteration of futures products. 2. Strategy and Copy-Trading Tools: Evolution and Growth Engines To meet users’ increasingly diverse trading needs, HTX systematically enhanced its suite of strategy products while rolling out innovative tools designed to drive growth. Completion and Upgrade of the Strategy Matrix: Building on the existing Spot Martingale, grid trading, and regular investment, HTX introduced Futures Martingale, forming a comprehensive portfolio of strategy products and offering users a broader range of automated trading options. Innovative Growth Tools: HTX introduced innovative growth tools such as Spot Grid Trial Bonuses and Phase II Futures Trial Bonuses. Effectively lowering the entry threshold for strategy products, these tools became key drivers for driving user participation, trading volume, and asset growth. Data shows a significant increase in spot grid strategy adoption. Comprehensive Upgrade of the Smart Copy System: The copy-trading product underwent a major upgrade, with a major focus on enhancing profit synchronization mechanisms and fund-isolation systems. This delivers more precise trade replication and higher-grade asset protection. In addition, the new system fully strengthened the Trader Mode, ensuring smooth and accurate trade replication even under complex strategy execution and rapidly changing market conditions. Launch of the Upgraded SmartEarn : Yield-generation capabilities for futures holdings were further expanded. Asset balances, position margin, open-order margin, futures grid margin, and Futures Martingale margin are now all eligible to earn returns through SmartEarn, offering more flexible use cases and higher yields for users. 3. Refined Asset Management and Earn Services HTX carried out a comprehensive revamp of all asset-related pages and functionalities, making users’ asset positions clearer at a glance and Earn operations safer and more convenient. Redesigned Homepage: A clean layout with simplified modules and clearer asset display. Panoramic Asset Visualization: Asset pages were fully redesigned with the introduction of a new asset overview page. Asset trends and allocations are clearly presented through charts, with support for multi-dimensional views by account, cryptocurrency, and other criteria for clearer asset summaries. Core Feature Experience Optimization: Deposit and withdrawal processes were fully upgraded, with streamlined steps and clearer presentation of key information to ensure easier and smoother operations. At the same time, asset displays, trading panels, and order book information for spot and margin trading were optimized, improving efficiency across core trading workflows. Enhanced Earn and Collateral Swap Services: The Earn homepage received a complete redesign, simplifying product categorization while upgrading information structure and visual presentation to enhance product distribution and intelligent recommendations. Products such as Dual Investment now feature simplified subscription and redemption processes, along with the newly introduced Auto Reinvest feature. Meanwhile, the upgraded Collateral Swap now supports multi-asset collateral and introduces interest vouchers, further improving capital utilization efficiency and operational flexibility for users. Security and Customer Support Safeguards: On the security front, HTX added support for YubiKey hardware key binding, providing users with a higher level of asset protection. On the service side, HTX launched an AI-powered customer support system that can identify and resolve users’ issues quickly and accurately, significantly improving service quality and efficiency. III. Security, Compliance, and User Services: Strengthening the Platform’s Foundations of Long-Term Trust Amid industry volatility and an evolving regulatory landscape, security and compliance remain HTX’s most critical foundational capabilities. Through sustained investment in 2025, HTX’s stable, high-frequency, and systematic security operations have built a robust foundation for the platform’s long-term and sustainable growth. HTX 2025｜Account & Trading Security Milestones 1. Security Development: Round-the-Clock Risk Control + Reinforced Foundational Capabilities, with Surging USDT Reserves as a Testament to User Trust Normalized Risk Monitoring and Stable Year-Round Risk Prevention Operations In 2025, HTX continued to strengthen account security monitoring and user risk-alert mechanisms. Over the course of the year, the platform issued more than 3.68 million security alerts to users and successfully took down 298 phishing websites and counterfeit app download portals. These efforts reduced users’ exposure to high-risk scenarios at the source and substantially enhanced overall account security. In the area of transaction security, HTX focused on risk prevention and loss recovery for everyday users. Throughout 2025, the platform successfully intercepted 34 withdrawal attempts to known scam addresses, helping users avert potential losses of nearly 250,000 USDT. Meanwhile, it actively cooperated with security reports from multiple external channels, handling 142 cases involving inflows of stolen assets during the year and assisting in the freezing of more than 3.54 million USDT in compromised funds, playing a constructive role in industry-wide security collaboration. In addition, the platform added nearly 35,000 high-risk blacklisted addresses in 2025. Over the year, it intercepted 103 deposits from blacklisted addresses, with total amounts exceeding 2.47 million USDT. By continuously expanding its risk address database and refining monitoring rules, HTX effectively reduced the potential risks associated with abnormal fund inflows. ● Reserve Transparency: Ongoing Merkle Tree PoR with Clear Visibility into Asset Structure Changes In 2025, HTX continued to publish Merkle Tree Proof of Reserves (PoR) monthly, with reserve ratios consistently maintained at 100% or higher. As the most critical benchmark within the PoR framework, this standard was upheld with consistency and stability throughout 2025, fully demonstrating the platform’s long-term commitment to comprehensive asset coverage for users. The scope of assets included in PoR disclosures also continued to expand. In 2025, assets such as WLFI and USDC were newly added, bringing the total number of assets covered by the proof of reserves to 10. From the perspective of reserve dynamics, HTX recorded significant growth in its USDT holdings in 2025. USDT reserves increased from approximately 695 million in January to around 1.765 billion in December, representing an annual growth of roughly 150%. This sharp increase reflects the platform’s strong capital retention capability and further underscores users’ confidence in HTX’s security and reliability. In addition, the proportion of assets held under third-party custody rose markedly. For example, USDT assets under third-party custody grew from approximately 650,000 at the beginning of the year to around 10.62 million by year-end. Through a hybrid custody model combining self-custody and third-party custody, the platform offers users more diversified and decentralized asset custody options. ● Security Mechanism Development: Continuous Enhancement of Institutional-Level Custody and Account Infrastructure Beyond day-to-day security operations, HTX continued to strengthen its foundational security capabilities to provide long-term support for future development. Third-Party Custody and Institutional-Level Security Capabilities In 2025, HTX entered into a tripartite custody partnership with BitGo, launching a next-generation custody solution based on an off-chain settlement mechanism. While ensuring security, this solution delivers low-cost and low-latency settlement, further expanding custody options for institutional clients. At the same time, the platform continued to optimize functionality and enhance risk controls for Fireblocks Off Exchange, supporting the steady and sustainable growth of institutional trading volumes. Development of the Unified Account System In 2025, HTX officially initiated the design of its strategic Unified Account project. By enabling core features such as account consolidation, shared margin, and unified risk management, the project aims to improve capital utilization and risk management efficiency for users, laying a solid foundation for efficient development and deployment in 2026. 2. Compliance Development: Advancing Multi-Regional Licensing and Continuously Strengthening AML Frameworks HTX 2025｜Global Licensing & Compliance Progress ● Licensing and Regulatory Progress In 2025, HTX continued to expand its global compliance presence across multiple key regions. In South Asia, HTX formally obtained a No Objection Certificate (NoC) from the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA), becoming one of the first two global digital asset platforms to meet Pakistan’s licensing eligibility requirements. This approval marks an important milestone, signaling that after obtaining the NoC, HTX will continue to advance subsequent compliance procedures and the formal license application process under the Virtual Assets Ordinance 2025, while maintaining close communication with regulators to complete full authorization. In the Middle East, HTX Dubai is applying for a VASP license under the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). The platform has already received Approval in Principle (AIP) and has entered the final review stage. Once granted, the license will support services such as stablecoin-fiat exchange, further expanding HTX’s service capabilities in the Middle Eastern market. At the same time, HTX is actively advancing applications for custody and brokerage licenses in Bahrain, where it has already received approval in principle and continues to work closely with local regulators to further strengthen its regional compliance presence. In the Australian market, HTX officially commenced operations by the end of 2025, providing local users with compliant fiat on- and off-ramp and asset custody services. In parallel, the platform is progressing with license upgrades to meet higher regulatory standards, deepen cooperation with local banks and financial institutions, and further enhance its overall compliance and service capabilities. ● Continuous Upgrades to AML and Anti-Crypto-Crime Frameworks In the area of anti-money laundering (AML), HTX significantly stepped up its investment in 2025, completing major upgrades to its group-level automated AML systems across critical areas such as customer identity verification, on-chain transaction monitoring, customer risk profiling, and business transaction surveillance. These upgrades substantially improved the system’s operational efficiency and detection accuracy. To address the regulatory requirements of different countries and regions, the platform has progressively built localized, standalone AML systems, providing continuous and stable technical support to ensure compliant operations across regional markets. In addition, in August, HTX officially joined Beacon Network, the world’s first real-time cryptocurrency crime response network initiated by TRM Labs, as a founding member. Through close collaboration with leading global exchanges and law enforcement agencies, HTX once again demonstrated its firm commitment to combating illicit financial activities, safeguarding user assets, and contributing to the development of a reliable crypto ecosystem. 3. User Services: Dual Upgrades in Service Scale and Security Experience Throughout the year, HTX’s customer support teams remained on the front line, serving more than 2.724 million user interactions and effectively handling 1.157 million online inquiries and support tickets, covering high-frequency and mission-critical scenarios such as P2P trading, on-chain deposits and withdrawals, security risk control, and KYC verification. Overall customer satisfaction (CSAT) reached 82%, reflecting HTX’s ability to deliver high-quality service while maintaining rapid response under peak concurrency. Beyond the numbers, HTX places particular emphasis on a sense of security in its services. To this end, the platform advanced a dedicated “user rights confirmation” initiative, returning procedural control to users to ensure permissions are clearly defined and actions are fully traceable. This “user authorization — customer support assistance” model not only clarifies operational responsibilities and significantly improves service efficiency but also adds a proactive layer of defense for the security of every user’s account and personal information at the process level. IV. Brand Influence and Community Connection: Building an Engaging and Participatory Brand Relationship For HTX, formerly Huobi, with more than 12 years of history, a brand is not a one-way transmission of information, but a relationship forged over time through consistent practice. By expanding into broader markets, maintaining authentic interactions with participants both online and offline across regions, and responding openly and responsibly to the expectations of the industry and users, HTX’s brand image is evolving from being merely recognized to being actively participated in. It is extending beyond a platform identity into a tangible, connectable, and enduring presence. HTX 2025｜Global Presence, Brand Expansion 1. Global Perspective: Deepening Presence in Key Markets to Build a Crypto Brand That Faces the World As part of its long-term global strategy, HTX continues to elevate its brand presence on the international stage, with a focus on key markets including the CIS region, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and North America. By actively participating in world-class crypto summits and hosting a diverse range of brand activities, HTX is steadily strengthening its global brand recognition and industry influence. By integrating the broad reach of global summits with its own brand identity, HTX actively takes part in industry dialogue through brand showcases, summit sponsorships, executive panels, and ecosystem exchanges. These efforts enable HTX to engage in meaningful exchange with local users, communities, and partners, while clearly communicating its core value propositions around security, ecosystem development, and long-term growth, guiding more users into its crypto ecosystem. With an open global vision at its core, HTX is steadily building an international crypto brand that connects the world and serves diverse markets. 2. Industry Recognition: Endorsed by Both Professional Institutions and Market Data HTX 2025｜Ranking Changes & Brand Awards Over the past year, HTX has received extensive recognition from authoritative institutions and leading data platforms across multiple dimensions, including industry influence, platform credibility, and business performance. At the leadership level, Justin Sun, Advisor to HTX, was named to CoinDesk’s list of “50 Most Influential People in Crypto” and received the Asia Fintech Award for “Innovator of the Year”, underscoring his prominent standing in the global crypto industry. HTX itself was listed among Forbes’ “World’s Most Trustworthy Crypto Exchanges for 2025” and won multiple Exchange of the Year awards from industry media outlets and summits. Meanwhile, its global investment arm, HTX Ventures, garnered multiple annual investment-institution awards for its forward-looking positioning in Web3 and primary markets. From a market-data standpoint, HTX took a major leap forward in global rankings across major data platforms. Its positions advanced notably on leading platforms such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, where it ranked among the top ten, while also maintaining top-tier standings on platforms including AICoin and Feixiaohao. These ranking improvements reflect the market’s recognition of HTX’s liquidity depth, user activity, and overall strength. 3. Thematic Campaigns: Tapping into Global Hotspots and Continuously Leading the Crypto Narrative In 2025, under the guidance of Justin Sun, Global Advisor to HTX, the platform stayed attuned to global crypto trends, consistently rolling out high-impact thematic campaigns. By offering generous rewards and creative mechanics, HTX invited its users to join the celebration. From the airdrop frenzy sparked by Justin Sun’s appearance on the cover of Forbes, to the Mars Program, which committed $6 million to help ordinary individuals pursue their dreams of space exploration, and from the TRUMP Dinner to the Bitcoin Pizza Day, where participants shared in million-dollar reward pools, HTX consistently captured public attention through a series of phenomenal events. These campaigns generated tens of millions of impressions, attracted a significant influx of new users into the HTX ecosystem, and collectively marked some of the most memorable highlight moments in the crypto world. Over the course of 12 years, HTX has not only witnessed the ups and downs of the crypto industry but has also stayed alongside countless users throughout their digital-asset journeys. In August, HTX partnered with platinum sponsor Paycoin (PCI) to launch its 12th-Anniversary Carnival. By completing tasks such as spot trading, futures trading, and deposits, users could light up a planet and unlock rewards such as trading fee rebate vouchers, 0% margin interest vouchers, and token airdrops. The event saw overwhelming participation, attracting 252,822 participants and distributing 657,338 rewards worth 1.279 million USDT in total. 4. Community Engagement: Bringing the Platform Closer to Its Participants Over the past year, HTX reshaped its social media matrix and refined HTX Community operations, building bridges for fast and direct communication with users and achieving a breakthrough in overall brand presence. HTX 2025｜Thriving Ecosystem, Growing Together ● Social Media HTX comprehensively expanded its social media matrix and formed an “IP customer support team” centered around its official spokesperson, Molly. With users at the center, the team actively monitors user inquiries across all channels, responds quickly, and actively drives issues through to resolution, thereby significantly strengthening user trust. By cultivating a brand persona that feels warm, engaging, and genuinely helpful, HTX effectively narrowed the perceived distance between the platform and its users and enhanced overall brand affinity. As of December, HTX’s social media ecosystem reached 3.21 million followers, representing a 26% month-on-month increase, while the community user base surpassed 850,000, up 21.2% month on month, collectively driving nearly 180 million USDT in trading volume. ● HTX Community HTX continued to strengthen its community operations framework, focusing on user participation, content co-creation, and community culture development to continuously unlock the vitality of its community ecosystem. Throughout the year, the platform hosted 145 community events and attracted 2.374 million participants, significantly boosting user activity and sense of involvement. Through the ongoing advancement of flagship IP initiatives such as “AI Hunting”, HTX cultivated a pool of 700 active strategy analysts, forming a core force for the sustained output of professional content and market insights within the community. In terms of content ecosystem development, the HTX Community leveraged trending topics as anchors, launching a total of 678 discussion topics throughout the year. This effectively stimulated creator participation and drove sustained growth in content supply. In 2025, total community content output increased 29% year on year, with 5.79 million pieces of content published cumulatively. These efforts continuously enriched users’ information access and interaction scenarios, propelling the community toward a more open, diverse, and sustainable content ecosystem. 5. Social Responsibility: Turning Value Commitments into Ongoing Practice In 2025, HTX joined hands with HTX DAO to fully launch a global philanthropic initiative under the guiding principle of “on-chain transparency with real-world warmth”. Through concrete actions, the platform demonstrated the social responsibility expected of a Web3 enterprise. In China, HTX collaborated with HTX DAO charity ambassadors Yang Guo and Lu Yao, together with community volunteers, to carry out 13+ charitable events across 10 cities. These efforts provide long-term companionship and support for children with special needs, visually impaired groups, children in remote mountainous regions, children undergoing rehabilitation, families of medical workers, and military veterans, helping build a public-welfare ecosystem that is both warm and enduring. Overseas, HTX expanded its global philanthropic footprint to 6 countries and 11 cities, including Georgia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Türkiye, Bangladesh, and Russia. Through targeted and efficient offline assistance, these initiatives have benefited more than 400 orphans, elderly individuals, and people with disabilities. In addition, following news of the Tai Po fire in Hong Kong, TRON and HTX swiftly activated an emergency charitable response mechanism, donating HKD 10 million in designated funds to support frontline rescue efforts, temporary accommodation for affected residents, and the provision of essential living supplies. V. Ecosystem Development: A Long-term Approach Integrating Governance, Research, and Investment In 2025, HTX systematically advanced the ecosystem integration of HTX DAO, HTX Ventures, and HTX Research around three core objectives: deepening governance, restoring value, and strengthening ecosystem synergy. At the DAO level, governance mechanisms were fully brought on-chain, while the token economy continued its deflationary trajectory, simultaneously reinforcing both community consensus and value capture. On the investment and research front, HTX Ventures identified emerging industry directions through a forward-looking lens, while HTX Research provided systematic analysis to support business decision-making and market communication. Together, these three formed a mutually reinforcing ecosystem loop. This multi-engine, collaborative architecture not only consolidated the long-term value foundation of $HTX but also equipped HTX with a more resilient and scalable growth base for the next industry cycle. 1. HTX DAO: Community Governance and the Rebuilding of Ecosystem Value In 2025, HTX DAO achieved breakthrough progress in consensus formation and value restoration. Over the year, the number of $HTX holders increased by a net 160,000, bringing the total to more than 868,000 and further solidifying the community fundamentals. Meanwhile, the buyback and burn mechanism continued to operate efficiently. In the first three quarters, 36.25 trillion tokens were burned, bringing the cumulative total of burned and donated tokens to 85.87 trillion. The marked improvement in burn efficiency further reinforced the token’s value foundation. HTX 2025｜HTX DAO ● Decentralized Ecosystem Development Throughout the year, HTX DAO reached four major milestones centered on “on-chain governance” and a “closed-loop ecosystem”: Launch of on-chain voting and refinement of governance mechanisms : This year, the HTX DAO governance forum and voting system officially went live. All $HTX holders can submit proposals, initiate votes, and participate in discussions on key issues such as ecosystem expansion, fund utilization, and incentives. Initiation of listing governance and formation of a community-driven listing process : A preliminary community-driven token listing process was established, following a closed-loop pathway of “recommendation → popularity/pre-listing leaderboard → on-chain voting → exchange listing”. This marked a major milestone in building a “People’s Exchange”. In the month that listing governance was launched, $HTX TVL recorded a net increase of 40 million USDT, clearly demonstrating the appeal of governance rights to token holders. Upgrade of strategic top-level design: A new white paper was released, systematically outlining the DAO’s vision, tokenomics model, and on-chain product roadmap. This clarified HTX DAO’s long-term strategic direction and laid a solid theoretical foundation for future ecosystem expansion and deeper external collaboration. Financial Infrastructure Development: On-chain staking products were launched, forming a “staking → yield” financial closed loop and enabling a transition from “governance through token holding” to a financial ecosystem based on “shared returns”. ● Confidence Journey In 2025, HTX DAO continued to roll out its “Confidence Journey” offline event series, hosting 21 sessions across Dubai, Singapore, South Korea, and multiple major cities in China, with more than 1,600 participants. Through face-to-face community gatherings and in-depth exchanges, HTX DAO presented its governance mechanisms, listing practices, and latest milestones in an accessible manner. These engagements not only strengthened community consensus but also significantly enhanced members’ understanding of and participation in the DAO governance model. 2. Investment and Research: An Industry Barometer and Ecosystem Engine, Building a Panoramic Research Framework Over the past year, HTX Ventures and HTX Research fully leveraged their role as industry observatories, continuously deepening the integrated investment and research framework. A total of 41 in-depth research reports were published throughout the year, structured around three core pillars: professional research reports, investment research reports, and sector-focused research reports. Beyond analytical depth, these reports also emphasized accuracy in trend anticipation. Research delved into technological frontiers such as DeFi innovation, real-world assets (RWAs), AI agents and agent frameworks, while also addressing key macro-financial themes including stablecoin payments, crypto policy compliance and dollarization, and tokenized stocks. Specifically, HTX Research released 12 sector-focused reports closely aligned with listing timelines, providing rigorous value assessments and risk disclosures for newly listed projects and helping users invest rationally. Through this series of high-quality research reports, HTX Ventures and HTX Research helped users cut through market noise to gain a comprehensive understanding of industry dynamics and technological evolution. This enabled them to make more forward-looking asset allocation and financial management decisions, effectively translating information access into long-term value creation. In addition, HTX Research launched a premium column, HTX DeepThink, offering global users clear and insightful market analysis grounded in macroeconomic context, major industry events, crypto market trends, and more. The column further promotes industry dialogue and advances user education across the global crypto community. HTX’s 2026 Roadmap and Outlook The year 2025 was bound to be a defining chapter in the development of HTX. Amid intense market competition, HTX proactively broke through constraints, continuously amplifying its brand presence and its influence within global crypto culture. At the same time, during periods of market volatility, HTX upheld its responsibilities with concrete action, deploying real capital to safeguard users’ assets. These actions demonstrated not only HTX’s drive for growth and innovation but also its pragmatic commitment to serving users. As the global crypto market and regulatory landscape continue to evolve, HTX will build on the solid foundation established in 2025 and further deepen its “user-first” philosophy. By elevating service quality, strengthening innovation capabilities, and raising security standards, HTX aims to create a more resilient, efficient, and value-driven global digital asset ecosystem. In 2026, HTX will advance its strategic positioning across all business lines around the following key priorities: I. Core Trading Ecosystem: Strengthening Professional Capabilities and User Experience Focusing on the three core trading scenarios of spot, futures, and P2P, HTX will consolidate and elevate its professional competitiveness through product innovation, experience optimization, and ecosystem development. 1. Deepening the Spot Trading Ecosystem: From Traffic-Driven to Value-Driven ● Product Upgrades: HTX will prioritize upgrades to its spot grid products, enhancing intelligent parameter recommendations and risk alerts.

56997199,655497,1767927641,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56997199.jpeg,Trump-Backed World Liberty Financial (WLFI) Pursues National Trust Charter,https://bitcoinist.com/world-liberty-financial-wlfi-national-trust-charter/,"World Liberty Financial (WLFI), closely associated with President Donald Trump and his son Eric, is making significant strides to align itself with major players in the cryptocurrency industry, including Ripple , and Fidelity Digital Assets. The company aims to secure a national trust charter in the United States, a strategic move designed to facilitate the issuance of its USD1 stablecoin , and to streamline the process for customers looking to utilize and convert the firm’s cryptocurrency. World Liberty Financial Aims For Regulatory Approval Zach Witkoff, proposed president and chair of World Liberty Trust Company—a subsidiary that has applied for the charter— described this initiative as a pivotal evolution of the World Liberty Financial ecosystem. Securing a national trust charter would enable World Liberty Financial to provide custodial banking services and gain access to national payment networks while operating under the supervision of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). However, this regulatory framework differs significantly from a national bank charter, which subjects a firm to stricter oversight due to its ability to offer consumer banking services. Last year, the OCC granted conditional national trust charters to several cryptocurrency firms, allowing these companies to manage digital assets and other financial instruments without the need to obtain state-by-state approvals. This development was hailed as a historic move by the regulatory body and a substantial win for the digital asset sector, although it faced criticism from traditional banking institutions. Traditional Banks Voice Concerns World Liberty Financial is joining a growing list of digital asset businesses seeking regulatory approval, with the eventual goal of accessing “skinny” master accounts at the Federal Reserve (Fed). Such accounts would grant limited use of the Fed’s payments system , a critical asset in modern financial operations. Recently, the Federal Reserve sought public feedback on the potential establishment of these accounts, marking a significant step toward greater acceptance of digital assets in the mainstream financial ecosystem. Yet, Bitcoinist has reported for the past months that traditional banks have expressed apprehension that allowing crypto companies access to such facilities could compromise financial stability. Among the companies previously awarded a charter are BitGo, which has acted as the custodian for World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin. The approval of World Liberty Financial’s application would enable the Trump-backed firm to manage its stablecoin more actively. BitGo CEO Mike Belshe lauded USD1’s growth , reporting that it surpassed $3.3 billion in its first year. He expressed enthusiasm for continuing their strategic partnership as World Liberty Trust Company becomes operational and USD1 embarks on its next growth phase. At the time of writing, World Liberty Financial’s native token, WLFI, is trading at $0.18. This represents a significant 10% increase following the announcement, as well as substantial gains of 37% over the past fourteen days.

56997442,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=260003,1767928211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Upbit Polygon Suspension: Essential Precaution for Network Hard Fork Security,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/upbit-polygon-suspension-hard-fork/,"BitcoinWorld Upbit Polygon Suspension: Essential Precaution for Network Hard Fork Security South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Upbit announced a crucial operational pause affecting thousands of traders on January 9, 2025, temporarily suspending all deposit and withdrawal functions for assets on the Polygon network. This Upbit Polygon suspension represents a standard security protocol during blockchain infrastructure upgrades, specifically affecting Polygon Ecosystem Token (POL) and Stepn (GMT) transactions. The exchange implemented this measure proactively to ensure user fund protection during Polygon’s scheduled network hard fork. Upbit Polygon Suspension Timeline and Technical Details Upbit officially communicated the temporary suspension through its announcement portal at 11:00 a.m. UTC on January 9. The exchange specified that deposit and withdrawal services for POL and GMT tokens would remain inactive until network stability confirmation following the hard fork completion. Typically, such maintenance windows last between 2 to 6 hours, although Upbit emphasized that restoration timing depends entirely on Polygon network developers. During this period, users cannot move POL or GMT tokens to or from their Upbit wallets, though trading pairs for these assets remain operational on the exchange’s internal order books. Blockchain networks regularly implement hard forks to introduce protocol upgrades, security enhancements, or new features. The Polygon network development team scheduled this particular upgrade to improve transaction throughput and reduce gas fees during peak demand periods. Major exchanges like Upbit routinely pause external transactions during such events to prevent potential issues like transaction reversals, double-spending attempts, or wallet synchronization problems. This precautionary measure follows industry best practices established by leading exchanges including Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. Understanding Polygon Network Hard Forks A hard fork represents a fundamental change to a blockchain’s protocol that renders previous blocks and transactions invalid. Network participants must upgrade to the latest protocol version to continue participating. The Polygon network, originally launched as Matic Network in 2017, has undergone several successful hard forks throughout its development history. Each upgrade typically addresses specific technical challenges while introducing backward-incompatible improvements. Polygon’s development team follows a structured upgrade process that includes: Testnet deployment: Running the upgrade on test networks for several weeks Community notification: Providing at least 30 days notice to exchanges and developers Node operator coordination: Ensuring validators upgrade simultaneously Post-upgrade monitoring: Observing network stability before declaring success This particular hard fork focuses on implementing Ethereum’s latest EIP-4844 proto-danksharding improvements, which significantly reduce layer-2 transaction costs. The upgrade also introduces enhanced fraud proof mechanisms and optimizes zk-rollup integration capabilities. These technical improvements ultimately benefit Polygon network users through lower transaction fees and faster confirmation times once fully implemented. Impact on POL and GMT Token Holders The temporary suspension specifically affects two prominent tokens within the Polygon ecosystem. Polygon Ecosystem Token (POL) serves as the upgraded successor to MATIC, functioning as Polygon 2.0’s native gas token and staking asset. Stepn (GMT) operates as the governance token for the move-to-earn fitness application built on Polygon’s infrastructure. Both tokens maintain substantial trading volumes on Upbit, which ranks among South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges by daily transaction value. Token holders should understand several important considerations during the suspension period: Token Primary Function Upbit Trading Status Alternative Options POL Gas fees and staking Active internally Use other exchanges temporarily GMT Governance and rewards Active internally Delay non-urgent transfers Exchange representatives confirmed that internal trading between users on Upbit’s platform continues uninterrupted throughout the maintenance period. This means traders can still buy, sell, and exchange POL and GMT tokens against Korean won and other cryptocurrencies listed on Upbit. The suspension only affects the movement of tokens between Upbit wallets and external Polygon network addresses. Historical Context of Exchange Maintenance Events Cryptocurrency exchanges have developed standardized procedures for network upgrades over the past decade. Major platforms typically announce maintenance windows 7-14 days in advance, providing users with ample preparation time. The current Upbit Polygon suspension follows this established pattern, with the exchange first notifying users through multiple channels including email, mobile push notifications, and website banners. Similar maintenance events have occurred regularly across the industry: January 2024: Binance suspended Polygon withdrawals for 4 hours during a minor upgrade September 2023: Coinbase paused MATIC deposits for 8 hours during protocol transition June 2023: Kraken implemented similar precautions during Polygon’s previous hard fork These standardized procedures demonstrate the cryptocurrency industry’s maturation regarding infrastructure management. Exchanges now prioritize security and stability over uninterrupted service availability during critical network changes. This approach significantly reduces technical risks compared to earlier years when exchanges sometimes continued operations during upgrades, occasionally resulting in lost or stuck transactions. Technical Security Considerations Blockchain security experts emphasize the importance of exchange precautions during hard forks. When a network splits into two incompatible chains temporarily, transactions submitted just before the fork might appear on both chains initially. Without proper safeguards, malicious actors could potentially exploit this situation through replay attacks or double-spending attempts. By suspending external transactions, Upbit eliminates these attack vectors completely. The exchange’s technical team monitors multiple data points before restoring services: Network block production stability across 95% of validators Consensus mechanism functioning without errors Transaction finality confirmation within expected parameters Wallet synchronization with the upgraded chain Absence of chain reorganization events Only after confirming all these security parameters does Upbit gradually restore deposit and withdrawal functions, typically beginning with a small batch of test transactions before enabling full service restoration. This meticulous approach has prevented fund loss incidents during dozens of previous network upgrades across various blockchains supported by the exchange. Broader Implications for South Korean Crypto Market South Korea maintains one of the world’s most active cryptocurrency trading environments, with daily volumes frequently exceeding $10 billion across major exchanges. Upbit consistently ranks among the country’s top three platforms alongside Bithumb and Korbit. The exchange’s cautious approach to network upgrades reflects South Korea’s stringent regulatory environment, which emphasizes consumer protection in digital asset markets. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) and Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) oversee cryptocurrency exchange operations in South Korea, requiring extensive security protocols and transparent communication with users. Upbit’s detailed announcement regarding the Polygon suspension demonstrates compliance with these regulatory expectations. The exchange provided specific timing information, clear scope definitions, and alternative guidance for affected users—all hallmarks of South Korea’s mature digital asset regulatory framework. Industry analysts note that such transparent maintenance communications help build institutional confidence in cryptocurrency infrastructure. As traditional financial institutions increasingly explore digital asset offerings, demonstrated reliability during technical events becomes a crucial trust indicator. Upbit’s established procedures during the current Polygon upgrade contribute to this broader credibility narrative within South Korea’s financial sector. Conclusion The Upbit Polygon suspension represents a routine security precaution during scheduled network infrastructure improvements. This temporary measure protects user assets while Polygon developers implement protocol upgrades that will ultimately enhance network performance and reduce transaction costs. Affected POL and GMT token holders can continue trading these assets internally on Upbit while awaiting restoration of external transfer capabilities. The exchange’s transparent communication and established security protocols align with both industry best practices and South Korea’s regulatory expectations for digital asset platforms. As blockchain networks continue evolving, such carefully managed upgrade processes will remain essential for maintaining ecosystem stability and user confidence. FAQs Q1: When will Upbit restore Polygon deposit and withdrawal services? The exchange will restore services after confirming Polygon network stability following the hard fork completion. Upbit typically provides updates through its official announcement page and social media channels once services resume. Q2: Can I still trade POL and GMT tokens on Upbit during the suspension? Yes, internal trading between Upbit users continues uninterrupted. Only deposits from and withdrawals to external Polygon network addresses remain temporarily suspended. Q3: Why does Upbit suspend services during network upgrades? The suspension prevents potential security issues like transaction reversals, double-spending attempts, or wallet synchronization problems that could occur during the transition between protocol versions. Q4: How long do such maintenance suspensions typically last? Most blockchain upgrade suspensions last between 2 to 6 hours, though timing depends entirely on network developer progress and post-upgrade stability confirmation. Q5: Should I move my tokens to another exchange before the suspension? Unless you require immediate external transfers, maintaining tokens on Upbit during the brief suspension period presents minimal inconvenience since internal trading continues unaffected.

56997563,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=260002,1767928511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Liquidations Surge: $125M Wiped Out in 24-Hour Market Tremor,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-liquidations-surge-market-tremor/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Liquidations Surge: $125M Wiped Out in 24-Hour Market Tremor Global cryptocurrency markets experienced significant turbulence on March 15, 2025, as Bitcoin perpetual futures witnessed $125 million in forced liquidations within a single 24-hour period. This substantial liquidation event primarily affected bullish traders, with long positions constituting 81.15% of the total Bitcoin liquidations. The data reveals a broader pattern across major cryptocurrencies, providing crucial insights into current market dynamics and trader positioning. Analyzing the $125 Million Bitcoin Liquidation Event The cryptocurrency derivatives market recorded substantial forced position closures throughout the trading session. Bitcoin led this liquidation wave with $125 million in positions automatically closed by exchanges. Market analysts immediately noted the disproportionate impact on long positions, which represented over 81% of the total Bitcoin liquidations. This pattern suggests that traders holding bullish expectations faced the most significant pressure during this volatility episode. Forced liquidations occur automatically when traders’ positions lose sufficient collateral to meet maintenance margin requirements. Consequently, exchanges close these positions to prevent negative balances. The $125 million figure represents the nominal value of contracts liquidated, not necessarily direct trader losses. However, it indicates substantial market movement and potential price pressure from these automated sales. Comparative Analysis Across Major Cryptocurrencies Ethereum followed Bitcoin with $97.15 million in liquidations during the same period. Remarkably, Ethereum’s long positions accounted for 83.45% of its total liquidations, slightly exceeding Bitcoin’s long-dominated percentage. This parallel suggests a market-wide correction affecting leveraged bullish positions across multiple major assets rather than isolated Bitcoin volatility. Zcash (ZEC) demonstrated notable activity with $25.96 million liquidated, of which 70.41% originated from long positions. While smaller in absolute terms compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, ZEC’s liquidation volume represents a significant portion of its market activity. The consistent pattern across these three cryptocurrencies indicates systematic rather than idiosyncratic market forces. 24-Hour Liquidation Summary (March 15, 2025) Cryptocurrency Total Liquidations Long Position % Short Position % Bitcoin (BTC) $125.00M 81.15% 18.85% Ethereum (ETH) $97.15M 83.45% 16.55% Zcash (ZEC) $25.96M 70.41% 29.59% Understanding Perpetual Futures Mechanics Perpetual futures contracts differ from traditional futures because they lack expiration dates. Traders maintain these positions indefinitely, provided they meet margin requirements. These instruments typically include funding rate mechanisms that periodically transfer payments between long and short positions to maintain contract alignment with spot prices. Several factors contribute to liquidation events in perpetual markets: Leverage ratios : Higher leverage increases liquidation vulnerability Market volatility : Rapid price movements trigger margin calls Funding rate fluctuations : Can increase position costs unexpectedly Liquidity conditions : Thin markets exacerbate price slippage The current liquidation data suggests many traders employed significant leverage for bullish positions. When prices moved against these positions, margin requirements forced automatic closures. These liquidations then created additional selling pressure, potentially exacerbating the downward movement in a feedback loop known as a liquidation cascade. Historical Context and Market Implications Liquidation events of this magnitude typically correlate with increased market volatility and shifting sentiment. Historical data from previous market cycles shows similar patterns where extended bullish periods lead to overleveraged long positions. When market conditions change, these positions become vulnerable to forced closures. The March 2025 event follows several months of generally positive price action, suggesting some degree of complacency among leveraged traders. Market infrastructure has evolved significantly since previous major liquidation events. Exchanges now implement more sophisticated risk management systems, including: Isolated and cross-margin options Partial liquidation mechanisms Advanced price oracle systems Insurance funds for extreme scenarios These developments have reduced but not eliminated systemic risks associated with high leverage in cryptocurrency markets. The current data indicates that despite improved infrastructure, substantial liquidation events remain possible during periods of heightened volatility. Expert Perspectives on Market Structure Financial analysts specializing in cryptocurrency derivatives note several important considerations regarding the recent liquidation data. First, the concentration in long positions suggests market participants generally expected upward price movement. Second, the simultaneous liquidations across multiple assets indicate correlated market movements rather than asset-specific developments. Third, the absolute dollar amounts, while substantial, represent a smaller percentage of total open interest compared to previous extreme events. Market makers and institutional participants typically monitor liquidation levels as potential support or resistance zones. When large liquidation clusters occur at specific price points, these levels often become significant for future price action. The current data provides valuable information about where leveraged positions accumulated and where they faced elimination. Risk Management Considerations for Traders The liquidation event underscores the importance of proper risk management in leveraged cryptocurrency trading. Experienced traders emphasize several key principles to mitigate liquidation risks: Conservative leverage : Using lower leverage ratios reduces liquidation probability Diversified positions : Spreading exposure across multiple assets Active monitoring : Regularly checking position health and margin levels Stop-loss orders : Implementing predefined exit points before liquidation levels Collateral quality : Using stable assets as margin to reduce volatility Exchange data shows that the majority of liquidated positions used leverage ratios between 10x and 25x. Positions with higher leverage naturally face greater vulnerability to price fluctuations. The concentration of liquidations in long positions suggests many traders underestimated downside risks or overestimated bullish momentum. Conclusion The $125 million Bitcoin liquidation event provides valuable insights into current cryptocurrency market conditions and trader behavior. The dominance of long positions in these forced closures indicates prevailing bullish sentiment among leveraged traders before the volatility episode. While substantial in absolute terms, this event represents a controlled market adjustment rather than systemic failure, thanks to improved exchange infrastructure and risk management practices. Market participants should monitor liquidation data as an important indicator of leverage levels and potential price pressure points. The Bitcoin liquidations, along with similar patterns in Ethereum and Zcash, highlight the interconnected nature of cryptocurrency derivatives markets and the importance of disciplined risk management in volatile trading environments. FAQs Q1: What causes forced liquidations in cryptocurrency markets? Forced liquidations occur when a trader’s position loses enough value that their remaining collateral cannot meet the maintenance margin requirement. Exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent account balances from going negative. Q2: Why were long positions disproportionately affected in this event? The data suggests most leveraged traders held bullish positions expecting price increases. When prices moved downward instead, these long positions reached their liquidation thresholds before short positions, which benefited from the price decline. Q3: How do liquidations affect cryptocurrency prices? Liquidations create additional selling pressure as exchanges automatically close positions. This can exacerbate downward price movements, potentially triggering further liquidations in a cascade effect, though modern exchange mechanisms aim to mitigate this. Q4: What’s the difference between perpetual and traditional futures? Perpetual futures lack expiration dates and use funding rate mechanisms to track spot prices, while traditional futures have set expiration dates and settle based on predetermined settlement procedures. Q5: How can traders reduce liquidation risks? Traders can use conservative leverage ratios, implement stop-loss orders, maintain adequate collateral buffers, diversify positions, and actively monitor market conditions and margin requirements.

Trump and Tan discussed the tech firm’s progress in making new and more powerful computer chips in the United States, as America pushes to bring advanced chip manufacturing back home. President Trump later posted on his social media network, Truth Social, celebrating the meeting and praising Intel for making what he called “great progress” in its work. Intel is based in Santa Clara, California, and is one of the most well-known names in the computer hardware industry. Government expands stake to strengthen Intel Over the past year, Trump noted that the United States government has begun purchasing shares of Intel as part of a national strategy to bolster the country’s chip production capacity. Shares are ownership stakes in a company. Shareholders, whether owned by individuals or a government, become part-owners of that company. After all, the Trump administration plans to take a 10% ownership stake in Intel. As it stands, the government now owns approximately 5.5% of the company’s shares. Additional shares are expected to be acquired in the future. Intel’s stock price has soared since news first circulated about the government’s plan to buy shares. Actually, the share price has increased by more than 70% in that time, making each share far more valuable than before. Higher prices bring great cheer for most shareholders, indicating that their shares are now worth more than they once were. President Trump also claimed that the government had made “tens of billions of dollars for the American people” and pointed to the increase in share value. In August, when the government purchased Intel shares, the package was valued at about $5.7 billion. The value of the shares currently in ownership is just over $11 billion today, still a robust increase but still below “tens of billions.” There is, however, a murkier aspect to the deal as well. Additionally, there are certain shares that the government does not currently own, which it could purchase in the future under certain conditions. If the government held all those shares today, the total value of its stake would be approximately $27.7 billion. But as it stands, those shares aren’t fully owned and hinge on future events, so they don’t count yet. Intel pushes to recover lost ground with new chips When Lip-Bu Tan took over Intel in March, he moved swiftly to improve the company. Intel, for years, was the chief creator of chips. However, gradually, it fell behind other chip companies. Some rivals began to win more customers and also to develop more advanced chips more quickly. Consequently, the tech firm has been putting in the work needed to pull itself back. A significant change comes with Intel’s development of a new line of computer processors. These are the “brains” inside computers, tablets and even some intelligent machines. At a major industry conference earlier this week, Lip-Bu Tan confirmed that Intel shipped its first sub-2-nanometer 18A chips at the end of 2025, meeting its scheduled timeline. These chips are extremely small and powerful. Smaller chips enable devices to run faster, use less energy, and remain cooler. Although this growth is important, Intel still depend on external chip factories for some of its most essential aspects of production. Among them is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s largest chipmake r, which produces chips for other companies and ranks among the top semiconductor manufacturers globally. The investment in Intel has also attracted attention from private companies. Nvidia , a global leader in graphics and artificial intelligence chips, and SoftBank Group of Japan have both bought large stakes in Intel worth billions of dollars.

This persistent trend, led by industry giants BlackRock and Fidelity, signals a pivotal moment of reassessment for investors in these landmark financial products. The movement underscores the volatile and evolving nature of cryptocurrency integration into mainstream portfolios. Bitcoin ETF Outflows: A Detailed Breakdown of January 8 Data compiled by analyst Trader T provides a clear snapshot of the day’s activity. The outflows were not uniform across all funds, revealing distinct investor behavior. Leading the retreat was BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which saw a substantial withdrawal of $194.64 million. Following closely was Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with an outflow of $120.52 million. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which converted from a closed-end fund, recorded a further $73.09 million in outflows. Other funds contributing to the negative flow included Ark Invest’s ARKB ($9.63 million) and Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust ($7.24 million). However, the day was not entirely negative. Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) and WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW) managed to attract modest inflows of $2.96 million and $1.92 million, respectively, demonstrating that selective investor interest remains. ETF Ticker Provider Net Flow (Jan 8) IBIT BlackRock -$194.64M FBTC Fidelity -$120.52M GBTC Grayscale -$73.09M BITB Bitwise +$2.96M BTCW WisdomTree +$1.92M Contextualizing the Spot Bitcoin ETF Market Trend This three-day outflow pattern follows an initial period of massive accumulation after the SEC’s landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. Consequently, analysts are now examining several potential catalysts for the shift. Firstly, some investors may be engaging in profit-taking after a significant rally in Bitcoin’s price throughout late 2024. Secondly, macroeconomic factors, such as shifting interest rate expectations or broader equity market volatility, often influence capital flows across all asset classes, including digital assets. Furthermore, the structure of these products plays a role. For instance, Grayscale’s GBTC, which carries a higher fee than many competitors, has experienced consistent outflows as investors rotate into lower-cost alternatives. This rotation is a natural market mechanism for optimizing portfolio costs. The current trend highlights that Bitcoin ETFs, while providing crucial exposure, are not immune to traditional market forces and investor sentiment cycles. Expert Analysis on Market Dynamics and Future Implications Market strategists point to the need for a long-term perspective. “Daily flow data is important, but it’s a noisy signal,” notes a portfolio manager specializing in digital assets. “We always anticipated volatility in flows post-launch. The true test will be the net flow over quarters and years, which will indicate sustained institutional adoption.” The consecutive outflows present a reality check, emphasizing that these instruments are for risk-aware investors. The impact extends beyond the ETF issuers. Sustained outflows increase selling pressure on the underlying Bitcoin held by these trusts, potentially affecting its spot price. However, the established and regulated nature of these ETFs also provides a transparent mechanism for this price discovery, a stark contrast to the opaque markets of the past. This transparency itself is a sign of maturation for the crypto asset class. Historical Precedents and Comparative Asset Behavior Outflow cycles are not unique to cryptocurrency products. Newly launched equity ETFs or funds focused on volatile sectors often experience similar patterns of intense early interest followed by consolidation. The gold ETF (GLD), for example, faced multiple periods of outflows during its first decade despite its long-term growth trajectory. This historical context is crucial for understanding that short-term redemptions do not necessarily invalidate the fundamental investment thesis of an asset class. Key differentiators for Bitcoin ETFs include: 24/7 Underlying Market: Bitcoin trades continuously, while ETF flows are processed during market hours, creating arbitrage nuances. Regulatory Scrutiny: As new products, they operate under intense regulatory observation, which can influence investor confidence. Retail Accessibility: They have democratized access, meaning flows now reflect a broader mix of retail and institutional sentiment. Conclusion The third straight day of net outflows from U.S. Bitcoin ETFs, totaling $400 million, marks a significant phase in the lifecycle of these pioneering investment vehicles. While the movements from major funds like BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC capture attention, the simultaneous small inflows into others like Bitwise’s BITB show a diversifying market. These Bitcoin ETF outflows serve as a reminder of the asset’s inherent volatility and the sophisticated, sometimes fickle, nature of modern capital allocation. For observers and investors, the coming weeks will be critical in determining whether this is a short-term correction or the beginning of a more sustained trend in the spot Bitcoin ETF landscape. FAQs Q1: What does a “net outflow” mean for a Bitcoin ETF? A net outflow occurs when the dollar value of shares redeemed by investors exceeds the value of new shares purchased. This forces the ETF issuer to sell some of the underlying Bitcoin to return cash to exiting shareholders. Q2: Why is Grayscale’s GBTC seeing consistent outflows? GBTC converted from a closed-end fund with a high management fee. Many investors who were previously locked in are now able to sell or rotate into newer, lower-fee spot Bitcoin ETF competitors, driving sustained outflows. Q3: Do ETF outflows directly cause Bitcoin’s price to drop? They can create downward pressure. To meet redemption requests, authorized participants must sell Bitcoin on the open market. However, Bitcoin’s price is influenced by many global factors, so outflows are one contributor among many. Q4: Is this outflow trend unusual for new financial products? Not at all. Many new ETFs and investment funds experience volatile flows in their early years as the market finds equilibrium, investors take profits, and portfolios are rebalanced. It is a common part of market maturation. Q5: How should a long-term investor interpret this news? A long-term investor should focus on the fundamental reasons for holding Bitcoin (e.g., as a digital store of value or hedge) and the structural importance of the ETF wrapper itself. Short-term flow data is useful for context but is often a poor guide for long-term strategy.

This sustained outflow pattern raises immediate questions about short-term sentiment toward these recently approved investment vehicles. Data from Trader T confirms a net outflow of $159.94 million on January 8th, closely following substantial withdrawals the previous day. Consequently, market analysts are scrutinizing the underlying causes and potential implications for the broader digital asset ecosystem. Ethereum ETF Outflows: A Detailed Breakdown The January 8th data reveals a clear hierarchy in investor exit behavior. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) bore the brunt of the selling pressure. It recorded a dominant outflow of $108.42 million. Following distantly, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) saw $31.72 million leave its fund. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust experienced a $12.90 million withdrawal. Other major issuers registered smaller movements. For instance, Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) had a $4.63 million outflow. Similarly, VanEck’s Ethereum Trust (ETHV) recorded a $2.27 million withdrawal. This distribution highlights where the most concentrated investor unease currently resides. Contextualizing the ETF Launch Timeline To understand these flows, one must recall the product’s brief history. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first batch of spot Ethereum ETFs in late 2024. Trading commenced shortly thereafter in a highly anticipated market debut. Initial flows were positive as institutional and retail investors gained their first direct, regulated exposure to Ether. However, the market environment has shifted since launch. Several macroeconomic factors now influence investor decisions. These factors include fluctuating interest rate expectations and changing risk appetites across traditional finance. Analyzing the Drivers Behind the Withdrawals Multiple interconnected factors likely contribute to the consecutive outflow days. First, profit-taking represents a primary technical driver. Early investors may be locking in gains after the initial post-launch price appreciation. Second, broader cryptocurrency market volatility often triggers fund flows. Recent price corrections in Bitcoin and other major altcoins create a risk-off sentiment. Third, competition from other yield-generating DeFi products might attract capital. Investors constantly compare the passive ETF structure with potentially higher returns elsewhere. Profit-Taking Activity: Early adopters securing gains after the launch rally. Macroeconomic Pressure: Rising treasury yields impacting high-growth asset valuations. Relative Value Shifts: Investors rebalancing portfolios between Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Liquidity Needs: Year-end portfolio rebalancing by institutional holders creating selling pressure. Furthermore, analysts reference historical patterns from the spot Bitcoin ETF launch in early 2024. Those products also experienced volatile flow patterns in their first months. Periods of intense inflows were frequently followed by consolidation phases featuring outflows. Therefore, the current Ethereum ETF activity may reflect a normal maturation process rather than a fundamental flaw. The Impact on Ethereum’s Market Structure Spot ETF flows directly impact the underlying market mechanics for Ether. Notably, authorized participants must manage the creation and redemption of ETF shares. During net redemption periods, they sell ETH from the fund’s treasury to return cash to exiting shareholders. This process can add subtle selling pressure on centralized exchanges. However, the daily volume involved remains a small fraction of Ether’s global trading volume. Thus, the direct price impact is often more psychological than mechanical. Conversely, the transparency of these flows provides unprecedented market data. For the first time, analysts can track daily institutional sentiment toward Ethereum through regulated vehicles. This data becomes a valuable indicator for the entire digital asset class. It offers a clear window into how traditional finance allocates capital to crypto. Consequently, sustained outflows could signal a cautious institutional stance in the near term. Expert Perspectives on Long-Term Viability Financial experts urge perspective when interpreting short-term flow data. “Two days of outflows do not define a product’s success,” notes a portfolio manager specializing in digital assets. “We observed similar volatility with Bitcoin ETFs before they accumulated tens of billions. The key metric is net assets under management over quarters, not days.” This view emphasizes the long-term adoption trajectory. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum’s ongoing network upgrades arguably matter more for ultimate success. Additionally, the fee structures of these ETFs will play a crucial role. Lower-fee products like the Grayscale Mini Trust may eventually attract flows from higher-cost competitors. This dynamic mirrors the intense fee war witnessed in the traditional ETF marketplace. Issuers like BlackRock and Fidelity compete not just on brand but on cost efficiency. Therefore, future flow patterns may shift as investors optimize for lower expense ratios. Comparative Performance Against Bitcoin ETFs A relevant analysis compares the early flow patterns of Ethereum ETFs to their Bitcoin predecessors. The first U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in January 2024. Their initial weeks also showed a mix of inflows and outflows as the market found equilibrium. However, Bitcoin ETFs benefited from a massive, pent-up demand from Grayscale GBTC conversions. The Ethereum ETF landscape lacks a single dominant pre-existing vehicle of similar size. This structural difference may lead to a slower but potentially more stable accumulation phase. Spot ETF Early Flow Comparison (Illustrative) Metric Bitcoin ETF (Early 2024) Ethereum ETF (Early 2025) First Month Net Flow Highly Positive Mixed / Volatile Dominant Driver GBTC Conversion Outflows Fresh Capital Allocation Market Context Post-Bear Market Recovery Maturing Bull Market Phase Primary Investor Base Retail & Hedge Funds Broader Institutional Mix This comparison suggests different adoption curves. Ethereum ETFs might follow a more traditional financial product trajectory. Conclusion The consecutive days of Ethereum ETF outflows, totaling nearly $160 million on January 8th, present a moment for analysis rather than alarm. While BlackRock’s ETHA led the withdrawals, the movements reflect common early-stage volatility for a new asset class product. Key drivers include profit-taking, macroeconomic shifts, and portfolio rebalancing. Importantly, these regulated flows now provide transparent insight into institutional sentiment. The long-term success of U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs will depend less on two-day fluctuations and more on broader adoption, competitive fees, and Ethereum’s underlying network growth. Observers should monitor weekly and monthly net flow trends for a clearer picture of enduring demand. FAQs Q1: What caused the Ethereum ETF outflows? The outflows likely stem from a combination of profit-taking by early investors, broader cryptocurrency market volatility, and institutional portfolio rebalancing at the start of the year. Q2: Is BlackRock’s ETHA ETF underperforming? Based on a single day’s flow data, ETHA saw the largest outflow. However, assessing an ETF’s performance requires analyzing net assets over months, not isolated daily movements. Q3: How do ETF outflows affect the price of Ethereum (ETH)? The direct mechanical impact is typically minimal relative to total market volume. However, large, sustained outflows can influence market sentiment and contribute to indirect selling pressure. Q4: Is this pattern normal for a new ETF? Yes, new exchange-traded funds, especially in novel asset classes, often experience volatile inflow and outflow patterns as the market discovers equilibrium and liquidity. Q5: Should investors be worried about these outflows? Short-term flows are a common metric but not a sole indicator of health. Investors should focus on the product’s long-term viability, fee structure, and how it fits their investment strategy.

Crypto Market Has Seen Liquidations Of More Than $462 Million According to data from CoinGlass, a notable amount of liquidations have occurred in the crypto derivatives market over the past day. “Liquidation” refers to the forceful closure that any open contract undergoes after it has amassed losses of a certain percentage specified by the platform. Related Reading: CryptoQuant CEO Expects Boring Bitcoin Action, Not Major Crash A mass amount of simultaneous liquidations can occur when the asset’s price observes a sharp price swing, not allowing investors the time to close their positions. The risk of this happening can increase depending on how much leverage traders are opting for. The trigger for the derivatives flush in the past day has been a downward move across tokens in the digital asset sector, which took Bitcoin to a low under $89,600. Below is a table that shows the numbers involved in this liquidation event. In total, the crypto market has witnessed over $462 million in liquidations during the last 24 hours, with longs dominating most of the flush. More specifically, bullish bets made up for $418 million of the positions involved, representing more than 90% of the total. The large amount of liquidations could indicate that the recovery in Bitcoin above $94,000 lured traders into opening fresh longs, which then ended up getting caught out by the price plunge. In terms of the symbols, the largest contributor to the liquidation event has been BTC with $132 million in positions involved, while Ethereum hasn’t been too far behind with a flush of $116 million. Interestingly, while the top two have been predictable, the third place hasn’t been occupied by the usual suspects this time. As the above heatmap displays, contracts related to Zcash (ZEC) have been caught up in liquidations of $24 million. The asset managing higher liquidations than the likes of XRP and Solana could be down to the fact that it has seen a notably sharper drop over the last 24 hours.

A New Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Proposal On Wednesday, Florida House of Representatives member John Snyder introduced House Bill 1039 (HB 1039) to create and administer a state-run Strategic Cryptocurrency Reserve focused on Bitcoin (BTC). According to the legislation, the strategic reserve would be established as “a special fund outside the State Treasury” to serve “hedge against inflation and economic volatility” and the “public purpose of providing enhanced financial security to residents of this state.” Notably, the bill states that “to be eligible to be purchased for the reserve, a cryptocurrency must have an average market capitalization of at least $500 billion over the most recent 24-month period.” Under this condition, only Bitcoin, with its $1 trillion market capitalization, meets the requirements. Based on this, Florida’s reserve would consist of “money transferred or deposited to the credit of the reserve by legislative appropriation, (…) Revenue that the Legislature by general law dedicates for deposit to the credit of the reserve, (…) Cryptocurrency purchased using money in or received by the reserve, (…) Investment earnings and interest or rewards earned on assets in the reserve.” In addition, the reserve would be custodied and managed by Florida’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO), who will be able to “acquire, exchange, sell, supervise, manage or retain any kind of investments” that a prudent investor would manage, under “the purposes, terms, distribution requirements, and other circumstances then prevailing for the reserve.” The CFO would be allowed to establish contracts with one or more third-party entities for the administration and management of the reserve, including technology providers for a secure custody solution, a qualified custodian, and liquidity providers that facilitate the purchase and sales of the reserve’s assets. Moreover, HB 1039 would launch the “Florida Strategic Cryptocurrency Reserve Advisory Committee” within the Department of Financial Affairs. The committee would be composed of five members, including the CFO, who would serve as the chairman, and four other individuals appointed by the CFO. Florida’s SBR Push Representative Snyder’s proposal follows previous attempts to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in Florida. Over the past year, some lawmakers joined the global SBR momentum and introduced multiple bills to create and manage a state-run crypto reserve. As reported by Bitcoinist, the Florida Blockchain Business Association (FBBA) proposed the state’s first Bitcoin Reserve at the end of 2024, seeking to allocate a small percentage of its $185.7 billion pension fund to BTC. Samuel Armes, head of the FBBA, suggested that the state could use 1% of its pension fund, around $1.85 billion, to invest in Bitcoin as part of Florida’s push to launch a crypto-based strategic reserve. In February 2025, Senator Joe Gruters introduced Senate Bill 550 (SB 550) to allow the state’s CFO to invest up to 10% of public funds in the flagship crypto. Similarly, Representative Webster Barnaby introduced House Bill 487 (HB 487) in April 2025 to allow Florida’s CFO and the State Board of Administration to invest up to 10% of certain state funds in Bitcoin, as a strategy to protect against inflation and enhance economic security. Nonetheless, both bills died in the first half of the year after failing to obtain a majority vote in their respective committee hearings. Last October, Representative Barnaby filed House Bill 183 (HB 183) with a revised and “more flexible” text to revive Florida’s SBR efforts. If HB 1039 passes the state’s Senate and House votes and is signed into law, Florida would join Arizona, New Hampshire, and Texas as the few states to have enacted a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.",Crypto News|Arizona crypto bill|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto Bill|Crypto legislation|Florida crypto bill|Strategic Bitcoin Reserve|Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Florida|Texas crypto bill|US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-09 04:00:44

This ambitious initiative, reported by The Daily Hodl, specifically targets startups developing real-world, on-chain payment applications. The program represents a strategic investment in bridging the gap between cryptocurrency technology and everyday financial transactions. Morph Accelerator Program Details and Objectives The Morph accelerator program establishes clear criteria for participation. Applicants must possess an existing product, not merely a concept. Furthermore, they must demonstrate the operational capacity to launch measurable activities and report on their progress. This focus on tangible development and accountability signals a mature approach to venture funding within the crypto space. The program aims to identify and nurture companies that can deliver functional payment solutions. Consequently, this initiative seeks to address a persistent challenge in cryptocurrency: practical utility for daily transactions. While digital assets have gained popularity as investment vehicles, their use for payments has lagged. High network fees and slow transaction times on base layers like Ethereum have historically been significant barriers. Morph’s Layer 2 technology is designed to solve these scalability issues, making micro-payments and frequent transactions economically viable. The Strategic Context of On-Chain Payment Development The launch of this accelerator occurs within a broader industry trend. Major financial institutions and technology firms are increasingly exploring blockchain-based payment rails. For instance, Visa and Mastercard have ongoing projects integrating stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Morph’s program directly contributes to this ecosystem by funding the next generation of payment infrastructure builders. It provides essential capital and support during a critical phase of product-market fit. Moreover, the program underscores the evolving role of cryptocurrency exchanges. Bitget, Morph’s primary backer, is moving beyond simple trading services. By incubating scaling solutions and funding application-layer startups, the exchange is fostering an entire ecosystem. This vertical integration strategy can create more robust and valuable networks. Successful startups from the accelerator will likely benefit from integration opportunities and technical support from the Morph and Bitget teams. Expert Analysis on Funding and Market Impact Industry analysts view this $150 million commitment as a strong vote of confidence in the future of on-chain commerce. “Funding dedicated specifically to payments is a clear signal that the industry is maturing beyond speculation,” notes a fintech research director at a major advisory firm. “The focus on companies with existing products suggests a shift towards scaling proven concepts rather than funding untested ideas.” This approach may lead to faster commercialization and user adoption. The timeline for impact is also crucial. Accelerator programs typically operate on 3-6 month cycles, suggesting we could see the first cohort of funded companies launching or scaling their products by late 2025. This rapid development cycle is characteristic of the crypto industry’s pace. The measurable activities requirement will generate valuable data on user adoption, transaction volumes, and technical performance, informing future development across the sector. Technical Foundations and Competitive Landscape Morph operates as an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) solution, utilizing optimistic rollup technology. This architecture bundles thousands of transactions off-chain before submitting a single proof to the Ethereum mainnet. The process dramatically reduces costs and increases speed for end-users. For payment applications, these technical advantages are non-negotiable. Consumers and merchants require fast, cheap, and reliable transactions to replace or complement existing systems like credit cards or digital wallets. The competitive landscape for L2 solutions is intense. However, Morph differentiates itself through its close ties to Bitget’s liquidity and user base. Other notable L2s with accelerator or grant programs include Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon. The table below provides a simplified comparison of key ecosystem funding initiatives. Project Program Type Reported Funding Pool Primary Focus Morph Accelerator $150 Million On-Chain Payments Optimism Retroactive Grants Governance Funded Ecosystem Growth Arbitrum DAO Grants Varies by proposal Developer Tools & DApps Polygon Venture Arm $100 Million+ Web3 Startups Morph’s singular focus on payments could create a concentrated hub of expertise and innovation. Startups in the program will benefit from shared knowledge and potentially synergistic partnerships. The eligibility requirement for an existing product filters for teams that have already navigated initial development challenges. This increases the likelihood that funded capital will be used for scaling and refinement rather than foundational research. Potential Real-World Applications and Use Cases The accelerator program will likely attract startups working on diverse payment applications. Potential use cases include: Cross-Border Remittances: Leveraging crypto for faster, cheaper international money transfers. Merchant Payment Gateways: Plugins or APIs that allow online and physical stores to accept crypto seamlessly. Recurring Subscription Payments: Enabling automated, on-chain subscriptions for services. Gig Economy Payouts: Instant payment solutions for freelancers and platform workers. DeFi Payment Integrations: Bridging decentralized finance protocols with real-world spending. Each application faces unique regulatory, technical, and user-experience hurdles. The accelerator’s role is to provide the resources to overcome these barriers. Success in any of these areas could significantly increase the total value processed on the Morph network. Furthermore, it would demonstrate concrete utility to regulators and skeptics who view cryptocurrency primarily as a speculative asset class. Evidence of a Growing Trend Data from industry trackers shows a consistent increase in venture capital flowing into blockchain infrastructure and payment projects throughout 2024. This Morph accelerator aligns with that macro trend. The substantial size of the fund indicates expectations for high capital requirements in the payments sector. Building compliant, user-friendly payment systems requires significant investment in legal, security, and product development teams. The program also reflects lessons learned from previous crypto market cycles. During the 2021-2022 bull market, funding often flowed to projects with high token valuations but unclear utility. The subsequent market correction led to a refocusing on fundamentals and sustainable business models. Morph’s criteria emphasize measurable activities and existing products, which are hallmarks of this more disciplined investment philosophy. Conclusion The launch of Morph’s $150 million accelerator program marks a pivotal step toward mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. By strategically funding startups with viable on-chain payment products, Morph and Bitget are investing directly in the utility layer of blockchain technology. This focused initiative addresses the critical need for scalable, low-cost transaction systems that can compete with traditional finance. The success of this Morph accelerator could catalyze a new wave of innovation, making digital asset payments a practical reality for consumers and businesses worldwide. The coming years will reveal how effectively this capital deployment translates into real-world usage and network growth. FAQs Q1: What is the Morph accelerator program?

For those tracking cultural cycles and blockchain adoption curves, now is the moment to study, observe, and act with intention. Exploring curated opportunities like Apeing’s whitelist path offers a timely entry point for readers aiming to stay ahead of accelerating narratives. 1. Apeing ($APEING): Community-Led Momentum Fueled by Meme Coin Whitelist Strategy Apeing ($APEING) stands out as a meme coin brand built by seasoned degens who understand that culture moves markets. Unlike short-lived hype tokens, Apeing positions itself at the intersection of energy, humor, and purposeful design. Its core philosophy prioritizes community authenticity, transparent communication, and security-first execution, aligning well with evolving investor expectations. From a market perspective, Apeing leverages the meme coin whitelist model as a structured gateway rather than a chaotic free-for-all. This approach reduces bot interference, supports fair allocation, and builds a verified community before broader access. Blockchain analysts often cite controlled early participation as a factor that improves long-term holder quality and ecosystem stability, a view supported by behavioral finance studies from sources like the Journal of Financial Economics and CoinDesk research reports. Get In Early, Reap the Rewards Later Through Apeing’s Upcoming Stage 1 The upcoming Stage 1 for Apeing introduces its lowest planned price point, projected at $0.0001, with a future listing target of $0.001.

Limited token allocation, verified participation, and priority access define this phase. The meme coin whitelist acts as the only gateway into Stage 1. Participants who secure placement receive front-row access without the stress of launch-day congestion or malicious links. This system mirrors successful early-access models observed in prior cycles, as highlighted by Messari and Chainalysis’s studies on fair token distribution.
