Major corporations and institutions are adopting Bitcoin, integrating it into treasury strategies, and offering Bitcoin ETPs, signaling its acceptance as a strategic asset. Small-cap companies like Semler Scientific and MetaPlanet have seen significant stock price appreciation after adopting Bitcoin strategies, highlighting BTC's potential for value creation. The upcoming launch of options on Bitcoin spot ETFs will enhance BTC's market maturity, liquidity, and attractiveness, despite its inherent volatility risks. Few metaphors are as enduring in finance as ""Tulip Mania."" In the 1630s, the Dutch fell in love with tulips, turning them from a rare luxury into an object of mass speculation. At its peak, a single tulip bulb could be worth as much as a house, only for the market to crash spectacularly, leaving many in ruin. It was one of the earliest recorded speculative bubbles, and it's become a cautionary tale ever since. So it’s no surprise that whenever an asset's price surges, someone inevitably compares it to those infamous tulips. Bitcoin (BTC-USD), now trading above $87,000 per coin and surging above previous all-time-highs, has faced this exact comparison for its entire existence. Skeptics have dismissed it as ""digital tulips"" or compared it to the Beanie Baby craze of the 1990s. But the narrative is quickly shifting now that Bitcoin has a dozen spot ETFs with enormous inflows , now that Bitcoin is being adopted by various corporations as a strategic reserve asset, and now that robust US-based options markets will develop over Bitcoin via the spot ETFs. What was once seen as tulips is now being seen as a legitimate asset class, driven by adoption from individuals to small companies to major institutions. Yet, little about the Bitcoin network has materially changed. Bitcoin still works with 10 minute blocktimes, 1 MB of space per block, 2.1 quadrillion total satoshis (100 million satoshis makes 1 BTC), a difficulty adjustment every 2016 blocks, a halving every 210,000 blocks, and proof-of-work consensus. It is the world that is waking up to Bitcoin, and not Bitcoin that is changing to be more agreeable to the world. One thing about asset bubbles is that they tend to not resurge after crashing. Bitcoin, therefore, must be a very unique form of tulip, because it simply refuses to die. Here’s the log chart, so you can see how many times it has crashed over 70% but has broken out to new highs. BTC All Time (bitinfocharts.com) Very recently, we just saw a very convincing breakout through the ATH setback in 2021. This was right before BTC crashed over 70%. Here’s the 3-year chart. BTC 3YR (bitinfocharts.com) So basically, the “tulips” have done it again. This is the fourth time the digital tulip has surged up in classic tulip mania fashion, right before erasing 70% of its market cap, and then proceeding to surpass the previous high in another tulip mania. Each time, the highs and lows were higher than the highs and lows of the previous time. And each time, bears and skeptics called for the final death of the digital tulips at the bottom, usually right before another manic rally commenced. This is the fourth time BTC has surpassed the previous tulip-mania high, making this current rally the beginning of the fifth tulip mania. Five tulip manias occurring in rather orderly 4-year cycles These are some very special tulips indeed. You will note that the original tulips of the Dutch did not make a comeback after the very first mania. Bitcoin is on its fifth mania and now publicly traded corporations are buying these tulips too. Now, I’ve been heavily buying these tulips and have recommended them to everyone who would talk to me. Here’s my article published over a year ago - Bitcoin: Why I'm Buying 14-Year-Old Tulips With Both Hands . Today BTC is past 15 years old, and two weeks ago on 31 October was the 16th anniversary of the Bitcoin white paper publication. The tulips have more than 3X’d since I wrote the article, and I’m still buying with both hands. I still see plenty of upside, and here I’ll go through why. From Flowers to Corporate Treasury Asset At this point, I hope it is clear that BTC behaves less like tulips and more like an asset that is experiencing a very volatile multi-year price discovery process. It started from 0 in 2009 and is now an asset that is bigger than many (smaller) fiat currencies and bigger than silver. The landscape has changed. Major corporations are integrating Bitcoin into their treasury strategies, not as a gamble, but as a way to store their economic energy and recapitalize the business. MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has made headlines with their Bitcoin purchases. This is a mediocre software business which has prioritized increasing BTC per share over anything else. The result is quite literally outperformance over every stock in the S&P 500 . MSTR Outperforming Everything In SPX (Saylor) The MSTR playbook is open for anyone to study. It is very easy to focus a business on acquiring BTC. The most difficult part is understanding the reason for buying BTC and developing the conviction. Once this conviction is developed, the action of focusing on acquiring BTC is almost certainly going to cause significant value creation for shareholders, as we’ll see below. Even traditional financial institutions like Fidelity and BlackRock have entered the market, offering Bitcoin ETPs. The message is clear: Bitcoin is no longer just for a fringe group of retail enthusiasts; it’s becoming a legitimate and strategic asset for corporate treasuries and institutional investors seeking diversification. SMLR And MetaPlanet: Case Studies In Bitcoin Adoption For Small-Cap Companies While the headlines often focus on large corporations, I think it’s in the small-cap space where Bitcoin’s adoption story is becoming even more compelling. Look at Semler Scientific (SMLR): a lesser-known small-cap medical services company with no debt and strong cash flows. SMLR is a good business. But the stock price didn’t reflect any appreciation for its objective achievements. The company was sitting on $60 million in cash and cash equivalents in Q1 2024. The price had fallen from the 50s to the low 20s in the first five months of 2024. In May 2024, SMLR made the bold move to start buying BTC , allocating nearly all its cash to BTC. The resulting price action speaks for itself. SMLR (Google) I’ve been bullish on this stock since the announcement of the Bitcoin acquisition strategy, as I cover in my article Semler Scientific's Bitcoin: The Next MicroStrategy? . I wasn’t even aware of SMLR's existence before that Bitcoin announcement, but it took only a glance at its strong capital structure and cash flow situation to realize that this stock could easily outperform if it started prioritizing BTC purchases. The strategy is not without doubters, even given the empirical facts of outperformance. Here was a comment from my SMLR article . Instead of buying-out other profitable niche businesses and growing the company, [SMLR] speculates on BTC. Even buying real estate, or pieces of art would be a smarter way to grow the intrinsic value of the company. Sell. The stock has rallied about 100% since this comment. At the time I responded with: Most buyouts are demonstrably overpaying. Real estate is a terrible investment - just look at how much ROE REITs generate. They are complete laggards. Art has no fungibility and is illiquid. BTC is the best place to store long term capital. Find me something else with 50% CAGR which no one entity can control. Now add on the fact that it is infinitely divisible, a bearer asset, and moves at light speed. Of course I can say ""I'll wait"" but let's be honest, you'll never find anything like this so I'll be waiting forever. That which constitutes good capital in the 21st century is shifting towards digital things. This trend is effectively unstoppable because the Internet has created unparalleled global connectivity and real-time updates of the world. As I stated in another response to the argument that art was as liquid as private debt (so SMLR could be better off buying art): If your measure of liquidity is against private debt then perhaps you can also send me your reasoning via carrier pigeon or the pony express. I'm sorry to bring you back to the real world, but the standard for liquidity in the digital age is increasingly approaching 24/7/365, worldwide accessibility. The writing is on the wall. Companies that get on the BTC train early are benefiting. This is simply the fact we can observe in the price action of these stocks. SMLR isn’t the only one. MetaPlanet is a tiny company in Japan that did the same thing. The price action, here in terms of the Japanese Yen, also speaks for itself. MetaPlanet (Google) A BTC strategy is not just a gimmick; it reflects a strategic play to enhance the balance sheet by injecting pristine capital into a business. If this weren’t the case, the market wouldn’t assign immediate premiums to stocks when they announce BTC strategies. It is very potent on a larger company like MSTR. But it is arguably even better to go from having no BTC to having some BTC. A small cap gets a huge amount of attention from the announcement alone, and the ability to increase BTC per share of course warrants a premium. The broader trend here is simple: small caps and private businesses have an opportunity to differentiate themselves by integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategies. As larger institutions embrace BTC, smaller players can follow suit, potentially boosting their stock valuations and creating a new wave of investor interest. I have been arguing that corporate adoption is the real catalyst during this fifth tulip mania. If more companies start buying BTC, it will send the price parabolically higher as the limited supply is squeezed. Rather than focusing on how President Trump might be crypto friendly, people need to see the big picture. Options on Bitcoin Spot ETFs: Another Gigantic Catalyst The impending launch of options on Bitcoin spot ETFs is another major benefit to BTC, bringing it one step closer to established financial assets. The reality is every single mature asset class has a robust and liquid options market. There are no exceptions. SPX, SPY, XSP, QQQ, IWM are the most liquid option chains in the world; they all have daily expiries. Then a step-down are TLT, GLD, SLV. These have expiries on Monday, Wednesday, Friday. A step-down from here would be the Magnificent 7 stocks with huge options volume, huge open interest, weekly expiries, and long-dated contracts. Options on Bitcoin ETFs means deeper liquidity and a more mature market structure, making BTC a more attractive asset for institutional investors because they will have the ability to hedge their positions. Options on BTC is a very deep topic, which I cover in the article IBIT Options Approval: Massive Watershed Moment For Bitcoin . The main thing I can see happening is that the reflexive flywheel of Option Greeks plus BTC’s absolute scarcity can create chaotic scenarios where rallies can extend by far more than what is normally considered possible. We’ve had various derivatives-driven tulip manias in smaller equities. The GME short and gamma squeeze in January 2021 was the most recent one. Like actual tulips, GME has failed to reclaim those highs. BTC will likely be very different. There is no ability to create more BTC to sell into rallies. This means price going higher is the only lever to satiate demand for BTC - and technically this doesn’t even satiate demand, it only prices out people who cannot pay the price. Risks In BTC Here’s the biggest risk I see for the corporate adoption thesis. BTC is still highly volatile, and its price can swing dramatically in a matter of days. This volatility could pose a unique challenge for corporate treasuries that choose to hold BTC. During steep market declines, companies might be tempted to panic-sell their reserves to shore up their balance sheets, potentially triggering a cascading wave of selling. This domino effect could amplify price declines and lead to broader market disruptions. However, I seriously doubt that crashes will kill BTC. It’s simply the Lindy Effect . At this point, it’s survived so many crashes that it’s becoming increasingly rational to assume that it just won’t die. Conclusion Bitcoin’s journey from ""tulips"" to a legitimate financial asset has been interesting. The growing adoption by corporations and the upcoming introduction of financial products like options on spot ETFs all point to a coming-of-age for the asset class. While the critics may continue to see BTC as tulips, the data tells a different story. As more companies integrate BTC into their financial strategies and institutions deepen their involvement, it becomes increasingly clear that BTC needs to at least be reclassified as “tulips with startling longevity.” In the end, whether you see Bitcoin as a bubble or the future of money, one thing is certain: these tulips have done it again—and they are almost definitely going even higher.",MSTR|SMLR|FBTC|IBIT|BTC|GBTC|BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-13 22:55:06

This increase is indicative of a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market, where significant coins such as Dogecoin are also reaping the rewards of overall market optimism. Related Reading: XRP Price Patterns And 2024 Election Spark Talk Of A New Rally SHIB’s ascent, presently valued at $0.00002803, is gathering traction, drawing the interest of both retail and institutional investors. In the past 24 hours, SHIB’s trading volume reached $5.69 billion, clearly indicating market awareness. This behavior indicates that SHIB may be preparing for substantial price fluctuations, particularly if market sentiment continues to be optimistic. Favorable Sentiment For The Memecoin A huge portion of SHIB growth can be attributed to the positive sentiment that exists in the cryptocurrencies market. Recent election results in the United States have instilled growing confidence, which seems to be spreading within the crypto space. The broader crypto landscape’s renewed confidence has largely acted as a catalyst in pushing the price up for SHIB. Some analysts even foresee that the price might shoot up as much as 306% based on this positive outlook. This optimism has resulted in a significant increase in whale activity, with substantial investors executing transactions that may substantially enhance SHIB’s value in the forthcoming months. With the growing interest in meme coins, SHIB’s market position appears increasingly favorable. Whale Activity Indicates Confidence One major determinant of SHIB’s growth is whale activity. Previously quiet for eight months, an investor has now reappeared and sent significant amounts of SHIB to exchanges. One such deal is the $2.81 million worth of 100 billion SHIB transfer to Gemini. This trade among others shows that whales are positioned deliberately to take advantage of SHIB’s recent spike. Early $SHIB buyer “0xd6b,” with a $120M profit, is back to offload tokens after 8 months of inactivity. An hour ago, this whale deposited 100B $SHIB ($2.81M) to #Gemini, leaving 2.5T $SHIB ($73M) remaining. Total estimated profit from $SHIB: $120M (+415%). Follow @spotonchain… https://t.co/yGvZt3QyKC pic.twitter.com/SODtxnIZ77 — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) November 12, 2024 The whale holds a massive 2.5 trillion SHIB, worth around $73 million even after moving large volumes. This behavior usually shows trust in the potential of the asset, implying that large investors are orienting themselves for continuous expansion. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Strategic US Hub Plan Sends SHIB Price On A 23% Moonshot Shiba Inu & Market Dynamics SHIB’s future will likely be influenced by persistent whale activity and prevailing market mood. The cryptocurrency market’s evolution indicates a robust development potential for SHIB. The growing interest from institutional investors, along with the fervor of regular traders, may create conditions for another substantial price surge. Nonetheless, with profit-taking already underway, it is evident that certain investors are attempting to realize their profits. The euphoria surrounding SHIB, driven by favorable sentiment and substantial transactions, remains elevated, with many wagering on the memecoin’s further success. The forthcoming months will be pivotal in ascertaining whether SHIB can sustain its rising trajectory or will encounter a setback.

This volatility showcases the potential and unpredictability surrounding LINK’s recent price action, drawing attention from analysts and investors alike. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, there’s a notable trend unfolding beneath the surface: Chainlink whales have been steadily accumulating LINK over the past two months. This accumulation by large holders suggests a growing conviction in LINK’s long-term value, reinforcing a bullish outlook for the asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly RSI Entering Power Zone – Last Time BTC Soared 80% Martinez’s data underscores this trend, highlighting that whales are continuing to add LINK to their portfolios despite the recent ups and downs in price. This activity suggests a solid foundation of support at current levels, as whales often act as market stabilizers. The coming weeks are expected to be pivotal for LINK, as further accumulation by large holders could fuel another upward move. Investors are now watching closely as Chainlink’s price action could signal a broader shift in sentiment within the DeFi and Oracle sectors. Whether LINK will continue to build on this bullish momentum or enter a period of consolidation remains to be seen. Chainlink Waking Up Smart Money Chainlink has recently posted an impressive surge, aligning with the broader market’s rally as bullish sentiment resurfaces across the crypto space. Key data from crypto analyst Ali Martinez indicates a strong accumulation pattern among Chainlink whales, who have amassed over 15 million LINK in the past two months—an investment valued at around $165 million. This substantial accumulation suggests high confidence among large holders, who appear committed to backing LINK despite its inherent price volatility. While many altcoins have benefited from a wave of retail-driven speculation, Chainlink’s recent surge seems to be fueled by more than short-term market excitement. The active participation of whales, typically seen as more strategic investors, indicates a solid support base at current levels. Martinez’s analysis highlights that the trend of accumulation by whales has been steady, even amid price fluctuations, which often signals confidence in longer-term potential. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Target $2.4 If Price Aligns With Macro Pattern – Details However, the next few weeks will be telling. Analysts and investors closely monitor whether this accumulation trend will continue or if it was a temporary push to capitalize on favorable market conditions. Sustained buying by whales would likely bolster LINK’s price further, reinforcing that Chainlink’s network and utility as a decentralized oracle provider hold significant value in the evolving blockchain ecosystem. Conversely, if accumulation slows, LINK could see a period of consolidation as the market recalibrates. Key Levels To Watch Chainlink is trading at $13.3 after reaching a local high of $15.3, marking a significant move that has renewed investors’ optimism. In this recent rally, LINK broke above the 200-day moving average (MA) at $12.8, a critical level often seen as a key indicator of long-term market sentiment. To confirm this bullish momentum, LINK needs to hold this 200-day MA as a support level; if successful, it would reinforce the bullish price structure and signal the potential for further gains. Holding above $12.8 would set a strong foundation for LINK’s price action, suggesting that buyers have established control and are willing to defend current levels. Related Reading: Cardano Skyrockets Over 40% – Funding Rate Suggests Further Upside If this support holds, LINK could make a sustained push above its recent local high at $15.3. Analysts anticipate that a confirmed breakout would open the door for LINK to test higher resistance levels, with the potential for a strong continuation in the coming weeks. However, if LINK fails to hold the 200-day MA, the price may retest lower support areas, potentially disrupting the bullish momentum. For now, all eyes remain on $12.8 as LINK attempts to solidify its recent gains and prepare for a possible run higher.

According to recent data from the event contract market, 60% of users believe Bitcoin will hit this milestone before January, while 45% are betting it could achieve this level as early as November. Analyst Predicts Six-Figure Bitcoin Prices By Year-End Kalshi, which launched in 2021, allows users to bet on various outcomes, including economic data releases and election results. The platform gained significant attention this year due to its legal battle with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which ultimately led to US users being allowed to participate in betting markets for the presidential election. Since the US presidential election on November 5, Bitcoin has surged more than 28%. The election outcome has been viewed as bullish for cryptocurrencies, especially with President-elect Donald Trump expressing his support for the industry and hinting at more favorable regulations. Related Reading: Justin Drake Unveils ‘The Beam Chain’: A Vision For Ethereum Final Design Analyst Mike Colonnese from H.C. Wainwright commented on the current market conditions, stating: Strong positive sentiment is likely to persist through the balance of 2024, and we see Bitcoin prices potentially reaching the six-figure mark by the end of this year. The analyst further noted that Bitcoin is now in a phase of “price discovery” after breaking through its all-time highs early last Wednesday morning, following the official announcement of Trump’s election victory. This combination of market enthusiasm and regulatory optimism, he suggests, could see BTC continue its upward trajectory, attracting new investors and cementing its place in the financial landscape by the end of 2024. UBS Warns Of Historical Volatility Although betting markets and investors have set their sights on BTC hitting $100,000, Wall Street analysts are warning about the “speculative” nature of cryptocurrencies. Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, emphasized this point in a note to clients on Tuesday. “We continue to view crypto assets as a speculative trade rather than a strategic investment in portfolios,” she stated. Marcelli expressed skepticism regarding the potential for digital assets to make significant inroads into disruptive real-world applications, noting their propensity to increase portfolio volatility. UBS highlighted that since 2014, Bitcoin has experienced three major drawdowns exceeding 70%, with an average recovery period of three years. Related Reading: Analyst Warns Of 10% Bitcoin Price Drop Ahead Of CPI Data On a more positive note, other cryptocurrencies saw gains on Wednesday. Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and even Dogecoin (DOGE) experienced upward movement. Dogecoin surged notably after Trump announced that Tesla CEO Elon Musk and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy would head a newly formed “Department of Government Efficiency,” cleverly abbreviated to DOGE. However, crypto-related equities did not follow the bullish trend of Bitcoin. Stocks like Coinbase (COIN) and Robinhood (HOOD) took a breather after recent rallies, with Coinbase shares down about 2% on Wednesday, while Robinhood remained relatively unchanged. After hitting a new all-time high of $93,000 on Wednesday, BTC has come back down to the $90,350 level, yet, still up 20% on the week.

Bitcoin Could Peak In Mid-2025 Before US Recession A recent Copper Research report, a recent crypto research firm, posits that the leading cryptocurrency by market cap could extend its bullish momentum until mid-2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Data Reveals Bulls Are Growing But Still Behind March 2024 Peak – Details As of November 13, Bitcoin is on day 555 of its current market cycle, and a price peak for the digital asset could arrive within the next 200 days. Notably, this peak may coincide with a potential US recession forecasted for mid-2025. According to the report, Bitcoin’s market cycles average 756 days. The starting point of these cycles is when the annual average growth of Bitcoin’s market capitalization turns positive, while the endpoint is when it hits a price peak. The report marks the beginning of the current market cycle around mid-2023, just before asset manager BlackRock filed for a BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF). Should Bitcoin stay true to its historical price patterns, the digital asset can hit its price peak for this cycle sometime around mid-2025. The report cites estimates by JPMorgan about the likelihood of a US recession in mid-2025. As a result, BTC’s price peak might align with a potential US economic downturn. Based on data from Treasury spreads, JPMorgan gives a 45% chance of a potential US recession by mid-2025. The report further highlights the gap between BTC’s price top and realized volatility. For the uninitiated, realized volatility measures BTC’s price fluctuations over a specific period, showing the standard deviation of the asset’s returns from the market’s mean return. BTC’s realized volatility currently stands at around 50%, indicating that its volatility is only halfway to previous bull market peaks. Another bullish technical indicator for the BTC price trajectory is its filtered relative strength index (RSI). The report reads: Currently, the RSI sits at 60 – well below previous bull market highs – indicating considerable room for Bitcoin to continue building momentum into the new year. BTC Could Rise Further, But Caution Is Necessary The digital assets market has been on a strong upward trend since pro-crypto Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 US presidential election. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs See Historic Surge – Institutions Go Bullish On BTC With $1.38 Billion Record Inflows Notably, the emerging industry has witnessed its total market cap surge beyond $3 trillion for the first time since November 2021. The rise in total crypto market cap – largely driven by BTC – is not surprising since the Trump administration is speculated to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve akin to that of El Salvador under Nayib Bukele. Bitcoin’s unprecedented price action has propelled the digital asset’s total market cap beyond that of silver, solidifying it as the 8th largest global asset by market cap in existence. With this in mind, it will be interesting to see how BTC dominance (BTC.D) behaves in the coming weeks, especially after facing rejection just below the $90,000 level. Currently hovering slightly above 60%, a fall in BTC.D could signal a capital rotation from BTC into altcoins, potentially benefiting smaller-cap digital assets. BTC trades at $87,767 at press time, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours. The asset’s total market cap sits at $1.738 trillion.

ETFs like BITW mitigate operational and regulatory risks compared to unregulated crypto exchanges, focusing solely on market risk for retail investors. BITW outperforms Bitcoin in rallies, up 56% in the past month, but carries high volatility with a 61% standard deviation and 64% annualized volatility. BITW serves as a diversification tool in the crypto space, ideal for investors seeking to increase risk/reward during bullish markets. Thesis While we are still amazed by the advent of the crypto universe, its establishment as an asset class cannot be debated. And just like any asset class, crypto has established players and high beta ones. Bitcoin and Ether are the two largest and most established cryptocurrencies, while the crypto universe has a plethora of other coins. The main difference between the established players and the secondary ones is represented by volatility and beta factor. With the significant rally in cryptocurrencies in the past two weeks, we are going to show retail investors how they can take advantage of exchange traded instruments which offer access to higher beta names in the crypto world. Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF ( BITW ) is an exchange-traded fund that does just that, via a regulated and robust structure versus crypto exchange investing. Structure matters - ETFs over crypto exchanges Let us start with the basics - while ETFs are established capital markets instruments, crypto exchanges are a different breed : Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges act as an intermediary between a buyer and a seller and make money through commissions and transaction fees. You can imagine a CEX to be similar to a stock exchange but for digital assets. Popular Crypto Exchanges are Binance, Coinbase Exchange, Kraken and KuCoin. Much like stock trading websites or apps, these exchanges allow cryptocurrency investors to buy and sell digital assets at the prevailing price, called spot, or to leave orders that get executed when the asset gets to the investor’s desired price target, called limit orders. Unlike established capital markets exchanges though, crypto exchanges are most of the time unregulated, thus subject to a plethora of risk factors, including operational risk factors and outright fraud. As the FTX bankruptcy taught us, even the most recognized names in crypto can turn out to have fraudulent aspects to them. Traditional capital markets exchanges, on the other hand, have been around for almost a century, and are heavily regulated by their respective oversight bodies. Take the New York Stock Exchange as an example: As a registered securities exchange, NYSE National is subject to the regulatory oversight of the SEC and all rules and amendments must be filed with and approved by the SEC pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder. From this section, a retail investor needs to understand that trading crypto via an unregulated exchange is fraught with risks, in addition to the usual market risks faced when purchasing a security. For that very reason, we are much more inclined to invest in crypto via ETFs or CEFs, instruments traded on regulated exchanges. Via this method of investing, an investor only takes market risk. What does BITW hold? A mixed portfolio of cryptos, but overweight Bitcoin and Ether. Let us start with the fund definition first: The Fund seeks to track an Index comprised of the 10 most highly valued cryptocurrencies, screened and monitored for certain risks, weighted by market capitalization, and rebalanced monthly. The fund provides the security and simplicity of a traditional investment vehicle. Currently, the fund is overweight Bitcoin and Ether: Holdings (Fund Website) Via the current market weighted composition, the fund has over 90% of its holdings in Bitcoin and Ether. The other significant fund components are Solana and XRP. Given its market capitalization build, do expect the two largest players to always have a meaningful weighting here. Nonetheless, a retail investor also gets access to higher beta plays. Unlike crypto exchanges where an investor can choose outright the individual currencies they want to trade, BITW provides for a third-party methodology based way to access the 10 most highly valued cryptos (as per the BITW methodology, which can be downloaded here ). What a retail investor should take away from this section is that BITW is an easy way to access a universe of 10 large liquid cryptos, with a market capitalization approach to the fund build. BITW is a higher beta play when compared to bitcoin outright When looking at returns, BITW shakes-out to be a high beta play in crypto when compared to Bitcoin outright: Performance (Seeking Alpha) Given its composition, the fund tends to have larger moves both to the downside and to the upside. While its correlation to bitcoin outright is very high, we can notice how BITW overshoots during sell-offs and also outperforms during rallies. In the past month, BITW is up +56% while BITO is up 'only' +30% from a total return perspective. Investors expecting the crypto rally to continue into year-end should expect high beta plays to outperform. Retail investors, however, need to be warned that BITW is truly a 'high beta' name. Suffice to look at the Seeking Alpha Risk page: Risk Metrics (Seeking Alpha) The one year standard deviation is 61% and the annualized volatility is 64%. Keep in mind the same figures for the S&P 500 are around 12%. The risks are tremendous here, but also the rewards, with BITW being up over +130% in the past twelve months. A building block for an emergent asset class We would like to think of BITW as a building block for the emergent crypto asset class. While we now have Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, more will follow (we believe). However, many cryptos will have issues around liquidity, build and tradability which will prevent them from ever being packaged via ETFs. To that end, a retail investor wanting to consolidate all investing in a brokerage account will need to use building blocks such as BITW. As highlighted above, we consider BITW as a high beta play in the crypto space, and we would go long only when wanting to increase the risk/reward ratio in the crypto space. While being more of a blunt instrument via the low amount of cryptocurrencies that can be introduced in its build, the fund does serve the purpose of diversification and layering in of beta during bull markets. Risk factors There are numerous risk factors in the crypto world, starting with operational risk (i.e. including hacking here) and ending with fundamental valuation concerns. Cryptos do not generate cash flows or earnings, and in our view are a momentum play for bull markets. However, investors have taken a liking in the asset class, and with more cash being allocated to the sector it is not an investment instrument that can be ignored. In our opinion trying to eliminate operational and regulatory risk and only focusing on market risk is the correct approach here, which is largely achieved via ETF investing. Conclusion BITW is an exchange-traded fund focused on the largest ten cryptocurrencies. The name is overweight bitcoin and ether, currencies which make up over 90% of the fund. The ETF is up over +56% in the past month, representing a high beta play in the crypto space, and outperforming bitcoin outright. The ETF circumvents many of the risk factors associated with investing via a crypto exchange, but at the same time provides for no flexibility in choosing what cryptos are introduces in the holdings. We view the name as a high beta building block in the crypto space, and investors looking for the crypto rally to continue into the year-end would be well served to look at BITW in addition to bitcoin outright.",BITW,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-14 02:43:33

BTC is now consolidating gains near $90,000 and might attempt another increase in the near term. Bitcoin extended its increase and traded above the $92,000 zone. The price is trading above $87,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $87,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it stays above the $85,400 zone. Bitcoin Price Sets Another ATH Bitcoin price started a fresh increase above the $88,000 level. BTC cleared the $90,000 resistance and traded to a new all-time high. It posted a high at $93,435 and is currently consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $91,500 level. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $85,302 swing low to the $93,435 high. However, the bulls are active near the $88,500 support zone. Bitcoin price is now trading above $87,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $87,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $85,302 swing low to the $93,435 high. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $90,500 level. The first key resistance is near the $91,200 level. A clear move above the $91,200 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $93,500. A close above the $93,500 resistance might initiate more gains. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $95,000 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $100,000 resistance level. More Downsides In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $90,500 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $88,400 level. The first major support is near the $87,200 level or the trend line. The next support is now near the $85,400 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $82,500 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 80 level. Major Support Levels – $88,400, followed by $87,200.

ETH is now consolidating and facing hurdles near the $3,250 resistance. Ethereum started a short-term downside correction from the $3,450 zone. The price is trading above $3,120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it remains stable above the $3,120 zone. Ethereum Price Hits Support Ethereum price started a fresh increase above the $3,1200 resistance like Bitcoin. ETH was able to climb above the $3,220 and $3,320 resistance levels to move further into a positive zone. It even surged above the $3,400 level and traded to a new monthly high. A high was formed at $3,445 before there was a minor pullback. The price dipped below the $3,320 and $3,250 support levels. A low was formed at $3,124 and the price is now consolidating. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,230 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,340 swing high to the $3,124 low. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The first major resistance is near the $3,260 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,320. A clear move above the $3,320 resistance might send the price toward the $3,450 resistance. An upside break above the $3,450 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,550 resistance zone. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,250 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,150 level. The first major support sits near the $3,120 zone. A clear move below the $3,120 support might push the price toward $3,050. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,000 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,880.

Here’s what it means for the asset. XRP NVT Ratio Reached A High Of 1,162 Earlier In The Month In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, analyst Maartunn has discussed about how the latest trend in the NVT Ratio of XRP has been like. The “NVT Ratio” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the market cap of the asset and its transaction volume (both in USD). Related Reading: Dogecoin Explodes 150% As Shark & Whale Buying Returns When the value of this metric is high, it means the value of the network (represented by its market cap) is high compared to its ability to transact coins (measured by its volume). Such a trend could imply the asset may be overvalued. On the other hand, the indicator being low suggests the market cap isn’t inflated when compared to the transaction volume, so the asset’s price could be due a rebound to the upside. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the XRP NVT Ratio over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP NVT Ratio has witnessed some spikes recently, with a particularly large one having come on the 2nd of this month. These recent highs in the indicator would imply the market cap of the coin isn’t being justified by its volume. Over the last week, the asset has registered a jump of more than 25% in its price, but if volume doesn’t catch up soon, it’s possible that the rally would run out of steam before long. Something else that could be a danger to the XRP run is an excess of Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) developing among the investors. According to data from the analytics firm Santiment, a couple of FOMO indicators related to the the asset have seen a surge recently. The metrics in question are the Binance Funding Rate and the Social Dominance. The former of these keeps track of the ratio between the long and short positions present on the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, while the latter measures the percentage of social media discussions related to the top 100 cryptocurrencies that XRP alone is contributing. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows how these metrics have changed for the coin recently. From the graph, it’s apparent that traders on Binance have opened a massive amount of long positions alongside the price surge as the Funding Rate has turned highly positive. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Be Set To Explore New Highs As On-Chain Metrics Light Up The Social Dominance has also seen an uplift of its own, with XRP-related discussions making up for more than 4% of social media discussions around the cryptocurrency sector. Both of these can point to the presence of excessive hype in the market, which is something that has historically led to a top for the asset. XRP Price XRP had surged to a high of $0.74 yesterday, but it appears the coin has seen a pullback since then as its price is now floating around $0.67.

There was a move below the $0.40 level. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.3519 swing low to the $0.4342 high. However, the bulls are active near the $0.3850 zone. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.3650 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.3870 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.3519 swing low to the $0.4342 high. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.400 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.4150 level. A close above the $0.4150 resistance might send the price toward the $0.4320 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.4500 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.4650. Are Dips Supported In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.4150 level, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.3870 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $0.3715 level. The main support sits at $0.3420. If there is a downside break below the $0.3420 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.3150 level or even $0.300 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.3870 and $0.3715.

36273788,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652975,1731560400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/36273788.jpeg,Toncoin Liquidity and User Activity Reviewed by Analyst: Insights on Market Impacts,https://www.newsbtc.com/toncoin-ton/toncoin-liquidity-and-user-activity-reviewed-by-analyst/,"Toncoin (TON) has seen notable changes in its market dynamics so far, driven by supply variations and heightened user engagement across its ecosystem. Particularly, according to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Shiven Moodley, TON’s total supply has steadily grown, moving from approximately 5.01 billion tokens to around 5.1 billion tokens. This growth, however, comes alongside significant changes in the circulating supply, particularly marked by a sharp decline in early 2024, attributed to lockups and staking activities within the network. The changes in circulating supply, according to Moodley, reflect TON’s evolving liquidity in the market and the increasing trend of users committing to staking and long-term holding. Related Reading: Toncoin Sharpe Ratio Is Falling: What It Means And — Is It Time To Buy? Layer One And Layer Two Comparisons: TON’s Position And Future Outlook Moodley’s analysis also highlighted that activities within the TON ecosystem, notably on the Masterchain and Workchain, are pivotal in driving user engagement. Specifically, apps and games hosted on the workchain, such as Hamster Kombat, DOGS, and Catizen, have been central to boosting increased trading activity. Moodley delved into TON’s comparative positioning among other prominent altcoins and blockchain ecosystems. He pointed out that over the past six months, TON transactions have maintained a relatively consistent pace, with occasional spikes linked to airdrops for games on the network. This steady transaction activity positions TON as a “strong layer-one blockchain network” with notable consistency compared to its closest competitor, Arbitrum. The CryptoQuant analyst noted: This growing user base would likely switch trader psychology towards holding over the medium to long term, reducing market liquidity in the TON ecosystem. Notably, this shift of potentially reduced market liquidity within the TON ecosystem, as suggested by Moodley, could come as more users opt to stake their tokens and engage in network activities over extended periods. Toncoin Market Performance Toncoin has benefited from the ongoing bull run in the market so far. In the past week, the altcoin has seen a major price and market capitalization increase, jumping by more than 15%. This double-digit increase in the past week has seen TON’s market cap reach above $13.8 billion, and its price trading for $5.41, at the time of writing, has risen by 1.4% in the past day. Interestingly, despite this increase, TON’s daily volume, after being valued above $1 million on November 12 seems to have cooled off with a current valuation of $679 million. Related Reading: Toncoin Sharpe Ratio Rising, Is TON Readying For $8? Regardless, many in the crypto community are still optimistic about the altcoin. For instance, a renowned crypto analyst CryptoBullet on X has recently predicted a $12 to $15 target for Toncoin. $TON #Toncoin Macro chart (chart request) I like the fact that #TON is testing prior Resistance for Support now.

Today, the asset has achieved a new all-time high of roughly $93,477. This ATH was achieved not long ago following an earlier dip today to $85,000. However, at the time of writing, BTC has seen a slight pullback, now down 0.5% from its peak to currently trade at $92,544, albeit still up 5.6% in the past day. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Now Overheating? Key Metrics Reveal Crucial Insights For Investors Bitcoin Finally At Its Peak? Amid the price surge in BTC, market analysts have offered their perspectives on Bitcoin’s potential trajectory. Crazzyblockk, a CryptoQuant analyst, addressed questions regarding whether Bitcoin has reached its peak by evaluating market profitability indicators. According to Crazzyblockk, two key metrics are essential for assessing Bitcoin’s profitability: the number of Bitcoin addresses currently in profit and the overall profitability rate for these addresses. The analyst observed that nearly all Bitcoin addresses are profitable, indicating heightened market risk. However, he also noted that current profit margins across different holding periods remain below those observed during previous bull markets, such as the 2019-2020 and 2021 uptrends, where profit margins reached 800-900%. Despite concerns about potential short-term price corrections due to elevated market risks, Crazzyblockk expressed confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term upward trajectory. He emphasized that strategies such as Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) and maintaining a long-term investment approach could benefit capital growth in this environment. More Room For Gains? In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant analyst Avocado Onchain highlighted miner activity and its implications for Bitcoin’s price movement. Avocado noted that some Bitcoin miners have already begun taking profits, but this does not necessarily indicate a weakening of Bitcoin’s overall upward potential. He pointed to the Miner Position Index (MPI), which tracks Bitcoin outflows from miners’ wallets relative to the annual average. A high MPI suggests increased miner selling activity, which can signal that Bitcoin’s price may be approaching a cycle peak. Related Reading: Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Move Millions To Binance—Is A Market Correction Imminent? So far, recent data showed a slight increase in MPI as Bitcoin reached new all-time highs. Avocado explained that this could represent early positioning for the next market cycle. By converting MPI to a 30-day moving average, clearer signals emerge regarding market cycles. The analyst identified patterns of profit-taking by miners near cycle tops, often followed by subsequent price increases and, eventually, longer-term downtrends. Avocado Onchain also highlighted additional data supporting the potential for further Bitcoin price growth. The hashrate and mining difficulty, key indicators of mining activity and network security, have reached new highs, reflecting strong miner participation and overall network health. This data, combined with continued market interest and growing liquidity, suggests that Bitcoin’s price could experience further upside in this cycle, as suggested by Avocado’s analysis.

Bitcoin Has Just Set A New All-Time High Above $93,000 Bitcoin had seen a bit of a pause in its bull run yesterday, but the uptrend has already returned for its price in spectacular fashion today as the coin has now achieved a new all-time high (ATH) beyond the $93,000 mark. Related Reading: XRP NVT Ratio Has Been High Recently: What It Means The chart below shows how the coin’s recent trajectory has looked. Following this rally, Bitcoin is sitting in weekly gains of over 24%. As is generally the case, the other assets in the sector have also followed BTC in this run, with Ethereum (ETH), the largest of the lot, garnering similar profits. However, many altcoins have outperformed these two giants, with Dogecoin (DOGE) particularly standing out with its impressive 120% positive returns. Whenever the market goes through such a bullish phase, investor sentiment shifts towards the better. The same has also happened this time, as the Fear & Greed Index shows. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Now At A Value Of 84 The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment among the investors in Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency markets. This metric uses a numeric scale from zero to a hundred to represent the trader mentality. Values above the 53 mark imply the average investor is showing greed, while those under 47 suggest the presence of fear in the market. The region between these two cutoffs corresponds to a net neutral sentiment. Other than these three main sentiments, there are also two special ones: extreme greed and fear. The former occurs at values above 75, while the latter is under 25. Now, here is what the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is like right now: As is visible above, the index is sitting at a value of 84. This naturally indicates that investor sentiment is firmly in extreme greed. Historically, Bitcoin and other coins in the sector have tended to move opposite to the majority’s expectations. The probability of a contrary move also grows the crowd’s confidence. As such, whenever the Fear & Greed Index has gone too far off into one extreme, a reversal has become likely for BTC. This effect was also witnessed during the top back in March of this year. During that top, the indicator was sitting at 88, which isn’t much higher than the latest value. Thus, it’s possible that, at least from the perspective of sentiment, Bitcoin may be starting to become overheated.
