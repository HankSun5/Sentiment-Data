Major corporations and institutions are adopting Bitcoin, integrating it into treasury strategies, and offering Bitcoin ETPs, signaling its acceptance as a strategic asset. Small-cap companies like Semler Scientific and MetaPlanet have seen significant stock price appreciation after adopting Bitcoin strategies, highlighting BTC's potential for value creation. The upcoming launch of options on Bitcoin spot ETFs will enhance BTC's market maturity, liquidity, and attractiveness, despite its inherent volatility risks. Few metaphors are as enduring in finance as ""Tulip Mania."" In the 1630s, the Dutch fell in love with tulips, turning them from a rare luxury into an object of mass speculation. At its peak, a single tulip bulb could be worth as much as a house, only for the market to crash spectacularly, leaving many in ruin. It was one of the earliest recorded speculative bubbles, and it's become a cautionary tale ever since. So it’s no surprise that whenever an asset's price surges, someone inevitably compares it to those infamous tulips. Bitcoin (BTC-USD), now trading above $87,000 per coin and surging above previous all-time-highs, has faced this exact comparison for its entire existence. Skeptics have dismissed it as ""digital tulips"" or compared it to the Beanie Baby craze of the 1990s. But the narrative is quickly shifting now that Bitcoin has a dozen spot ETFs with enormous inflows , now that Bitcoin is being adopted by various corporations as a strategic reserve asset, and now that robust US-based options markets will develop over Bitcoin via the spot ETFs. What was once seen as tulips is now being seen as a legitimate asset class, driven by adoption from individuals to small companies to major institutions. Yet, little about the Bitcoin network has materially changed. Bitcoin still works with 10 minute blocktimes, 1 MB of space per block, 2.1 quadrillion total satoshis (100 million satoshis makes 1 BTC), a difficulty adjustment every 2016 blocks, a halving every 210,000 blocks, and proof-of-work consensus. It is the world that is waking up to Bitcoin, and not Bitcoin that is changing to be more agreeable to the world. One thing about asset bubbles is that they tend to not resurge after crashing. Bitcoin, therefore, must be a very unique form of tulip, because it simply refuses to die. Here’s the log chart, so you can see how many times it has crashed over 70% but has broken out to new highs. BTC All Time (bitinfocharts.com) Very recently, we just saw a very convincing breakout through the ATH setback in 2021. This was right before BTC crashed over 70%. Here’s the 3-year chart. BTC 3YR (bitinfocharts.com) So basically, the “tulips” have done it again. This is the fourth time the digital tulip has surged up in classic tulip mania fashion, right before erasing 70% of its market cap, and then proceeding to surpass the previous high in another tulip mania. Each time, the highs and lows were higher than the highs and lows of the previous time. And each time, bears and skeptics called for the final death of the digital tulips at the bottom, usually right before another manic rally commenced. This is the fourth time BTC has surpassed the previous tulip-mania high, making this current rally the beginning of the fifth tulip mania. Five tulip manias occurring in rather orderly 4-year cycles These are some very special tulips indeed. You will note that the original tulips of the Dutch did not make a comeback after the very first mania. Bitcoin is on its fifth mania and now publicly traded corporations are buying these tulips too. Now, I’ve been heavily buying these tulips and have recommended them to everyone who would talk to me. Here’s my article published over a year ago - Bitcoin: Why I'm Buying 14-Year-Old Tulips With Both Hands . Today BTC is past 15 years old, and two weeks ago on 31 October was the 16th anniversary of the Bitcoin white paper publication. The tulips have more than 3X’d since I wrote the article, and I’m still buying with both hands. I still see plenty of upside, and here I’ll go through why. From Flowers to Corporate Treasury Asset At this point, I hope it is clear that BTC behaves less like tulips and more like an asset that is experiencing a very volatile multi-year price discovery process. It started from 0 in 2009 and is now an asset that is bigger than many (smaller) fiat currencies and bigger than silver. The landscape has changed. Major corporations are integrating Bitcoin into their treasury strategies, not as a gamble, but as a way to store their economic energy and recapitalize the business. MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has made headlines with their Bitcoin purchases. This is a mediocre software business which has prioritized increasing BTC per share over anything else. The result is quite literally outperformance over every stock in the S&P 500 . MSTR Outperforming Everything In SPX (Saylor) The MSTR playbook is open for anyone to study. It is very easy to focus a business on acquiring BTC. The most difficult part is understanding the reason for buying BTC and developing the conviction. Once this conviction is developed, the action of focusing on acquiring BTC is almost certainly going to cause significant value creation for shareholders, as we’ll see below. Even traditional financial institutions like Fidelity and BlackRock have entered the market, offering Bitcoin ETPs. The message is clear: Bitcoin is no longer just for a fringe group of retail enthusiasts; it’s becoming a legitimate and strategic asset for corporate treasuries and institutional investors seeking diversification. SMLR And MetaPlanet: Case Studies In Bitcoin Adoption For Small-Cap Companies While the headlines often focus on large corporations, I think it’s in the small-cap space where Bitcoin’s adoption story is becoming even more compelling. Look at Semler Scientific (SMLR): a lesser-known small-cap medical services company with no debt and strong cash flows. SMLR is a good business. But the stock price didn’t reflect any appreciation for its objective achievements. The company was sitting on $60 million in cash and cash equivalents in Q1 2024. The price had fallen from the 50s to the low 20s in the first five months of 2024. In May 2024, SMLR made the bold move to start buying BTC , allocating nearly all its cash to BTC. The resulting price action speaks for itself. SMLR (Google) I’ve been bullish on this stock since the announcement of the Bitcoin acquisition strategy, as I cover in my article Semler Scientific's Bitcoin: The Next MicroStrategy? . I wasn’t even aware of SMLR's existence before that Bitcoin announcement, but it took only a glance at its strong capital structure and cash flow situation to realize that this stock could easily outperform if it started prioritizing BTC purchases. The strategy is not without doubters, even given the empirical facts of outperformance. Here was a comment from my SMLR article . Instead of buying-out other profitable niche businesses and growing the company, [SMLR] speculates on BTC. Even buying real estate, or pieces of art would be a smarter way to grow the intrinsic value of the company. Sell. The stock has rallied about 100% since this comment. At the time I responded with: Most buyouts are demonstrably overpaying. Real estate is a terrible investment - just look at how much ROE REITs generate. They are complete laggards. Art has no fungibility and is illiquid. BTC is the best place to store long term capital. Find me something else with 50% CAGR which no one entity can control. Now add on the fact that it is infinitely divisible, a bearer asset, and moves at light speed. Of course I can say ""I'll wait"" but let's be honest, you'll never find anything like this so I'll be waiting forever. That which constitutes good capital in the 21st century is shifting towards digital things. This trend is effectively unstoppable because the Internet has created unparalleled global connectivity and real-time updates of the world. As I stated in another response to the argument that art was as liquid as private debt (so SMLR could be better off buying art): If your measure of liquidity is against private debt then perhaps you can also send me your reasoning via carrier pigeon or the pony express. I'm sorry to bring you back to the real world, but the standard for liquidity in the digital age is increasingly approaching 24/7/365, worldwide accessibility. The writing is on the wall. Companies that get on the BTC train early are benefiting. This is simply the fact we can observe in the price action of these stocks. SMLR isn’t the only one. MetaPlanet is a tiny company in Japan that did the same thing. The price action, here in terms of the Japanese Yen, also speaks for itself. MetaPlanet (Google) A BTC strategy is not just a gimmick; it reflects a strategic play to enhance the balance sheet by injecting pristine capital into a business. If this weren’t the case, the market wouldn’t assign immediate premiums to stocks when they announce BTC strategies. It is very potent on a larger company like MSTR. But it is arguably even better to go from having no BTC to having some BTC. A small cap gets a huge amount of attention from the announcement alone, and the ability to increase BTC per share of course warrants a premium. The broader trend here is simple: small caps and private businesses have an opportunity to differentiate themselves by integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategies. As larger institutions embrace BTC, smaller players can follow suit, potentially boosting their stock valuations and creating a new wave of investor interest. I have been arguing that corporate adoption is the real catalyst during this fifth tulip mania. If more companies start buying BTC, it will send the price parabolically higher as the limited supply is squeezed. Rather than focusing on how President Trump might be crypto friendly, people need to see the big picture. Options on Bitcoin Spot ETFs: Another Gigantic Catalyst The impending launch of options on Bitcoin spot ETFs is another major benefit to BTC, bringing it one step closer to established financial assets. The reality is every single mature asset class has a robust and liquid options market. There are no exceptions. SPX, SPY, XSP, QQQ, IWM are the most liquid option chains in the world; they all have daily expiries. Then a step-down are TLT, GLD, SLV. These have expiries on Monday, Wednesday, Friday. A step-down from here would be the Magnificent 7 stocks with huge options volume, huge open interest, weekly expiries, and long-dated contracts. Options on Bitcoin ETFs means deeper liquidity and a more mature market structure, making BTC a more attractive asset for institutional investors because they will have the ability to hedge their positions. Options on BTC is a very deep topic, which I cover in the article IBIT Options Approval: Massive Watershed Moment For Bitcoin . The main thing I can see happening is that the reflexive flywheel of Option Greeks plus BTC’s absolute scarcity can create chaotic scenarios where rallies can extend by far more than what is normally considered possible. We’ve had various derivatives-driven tulip manias in smaller equities. The GME short and gamma squeeze in January 2021 was the most recent one. Like actual tulips, GME has failed to reclaim those highs. BTC will likely be very different. There is no ability to create more BTC to sell into rallies. This means price going higher is the only lever to satiate demand for BTC - and technically this doesn’t even satiate demand, it only prices out people who cannot pay the price. Risks In BTC Here’s the biggest risk I see for the corporate adoption thesis. BTC is still highly volatile, and its price can swing dramatically in a matter of days. This volatility could pose a unique challenge for corporate treasuries that choose to hold BTC. During steep market declines, companies might be tempted to panic-sell their reserves to shore up their balance sheets, potentially triggering a cascading wave of selling. This domino effect could amplify price declines and lead to broader market disruptions. However, I seriously doubt that crashes will kill BTC. It’s simply the Lindy Effect . At this point, it’s survived so many crashes that it’s becoming increasingly rational to assume that it just won’t die. Conclusion Bitcoin’s journey from ""tulips"" to a legitimate financial asset has been interesting. The growing adoption by corporations and the upcoming introduction of financial products like options on spot ETFs all point to a coming-of-age for the asset class. While the critics may continue to see BTC as tulips, the data tells a different story. As more companies integrate BTC into their financial strategies and institutions deepen their involvement, it becomes increasingly clear that BTC needs to at least be reclassified as “tulips with startling longevity.” In the end, whether you see Bitcoin as a bubble or the future of money, one thing is certain: these tulips have done it again—and they are almost definitely going even higher.",MSTR|SMLR|FBTC|IBIT|BTC|GBTC|BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-13 22:55:06

This increase is indicative of a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market, where significant coins such as Dogecoin are also reaping the rewards of overall market optimism. Related Reading: XRP Price Patterns And 2024 Election Spark Talk Of A New Rally SHIB’s ascent, presently valued at $0.00002803, is gathering traction, drawing the interest of both retail and institutional investors. In the past 24 hours, SHIB’s trading volume reached $5.69 billion, clearly indicating market awareness. This behavior indicates that SHIB may be preparing for substantial price fluctuations, particularly if market sentiment continues to be optimistic. Favorable Sentiment For The Memecoin A huge portion of SHIB growth can be attributed to the positive sentiment that exists in the cryptocurrencies market. Recent election results in the United States have instilled growing confidence, which seems to be spreading within the crypto space. The broader crypto landscape’s renewed confidence has largely acted as a catalyst in pushing the price up for SHIB. Some analysts even foresee that the price might shoot up as much as 306% based on this positive outlook. This optimism has resulted in a significant increase in whale activity, with substantial investors executing transactions that may substantially enhance SHIB’s value in the forthcoming months. With the growing interest in meme coins, SHIB’s market position appears increasingly favorable. Whale Activity Indicates Confidence One major determinant of SHIB’s growth is whale activity. Previously quiet for eight months, an investor has now reappeared and sent significant amounts of SHIB to exchanges. One such deal is the $2.81 million worth of 100 billion SHIB transfer to Gemini. This trade among others shows that whales are positioned deliberately to take advantage of SHIB’s recent spike. Early $SHIB buyer “0xd6b,” with a $120M profit, is back to offload tokens after 8 months of inactivity. An hour ago, this whale deposited 100B $SHIB ($2.81M) to #Gemini, leaving 2.5T $SHIB ($73M) remaining. Total estimated profit from $SHIB: $120M (+415%). Follow @spotonchain… https://t.co/yGvZt3QyKC pic.twitter.com/SODtxnIZ77 — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) November 12, 2024 The whale holds a massive 2.5 trillion SHIB, worth around $73 million even after moving large volumes. This behavior usually shows trust in the potential of the asset, implying that large investors are orienting themselves for continuous expansion. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Strategic US Hub Plan Sends SHIB Price On A 23% Moonshot Shiba Inu & Market Dynamics SHIB’s future will likely be influenced by persistent whale activity and prevailing market mood. The cryptocurrency market’s evolution indicates a robust development potential for SHIB. The growing interest from institutional investors, along with the fervor of regular traders, may create conditions for another substantial price surge. Nonetheless, with profit-taking already underway, it is evident that certain investors are attempting to realize their profits. The euphoria surrounding SHIB, driven by favorable sentiment and substantial transactions, remains elevated, with many wagering on the memecoin’s further success. The forthcoming months will be pivotal in ascertaining whether SHIB can sustain its rising trajectory or will encounter a setback.

This volatility showcases the potential and unpredictability surrounding LINK’s recent price action, drawing attention from analysts and investors alike. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, there’s a notable trend unfolding beneath the surface: Chainlink whales have been steadily accumulating LINK over the past two months. This accumulation by large holders suggests a growing conviction in LINK’s long-term value, reinforcing a bullish outlook for the asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly RSI Entering Power Zone – Last Time BTC Soared 80% Martinez’s data underscores this trend, highlighting that whales are continuing to add LINK to their portfolios despite the recent ups and downs in price. This activity suggests a solid foundation of support at current levels, as whales often act as market stabilizers. The coming weeks are expected to be pivotal for LINK, as further accumulation by large holders could fuel another upward move. Investors are now watching closely as Chainlink’s price action could signal a broader shift in sentiment within the DeFi and Oracle sectors. Whether LINK will continue to build on this bullish momentum or enter a period of consolidation remains to be seen. Chainlink Waking Up Smart Money Chainlink has recently posted an impressive surge, aligning with the broader market’s rally as bullish sentiment resurfaces across the crypto space. Key data from crypto analyst Ali Martinez indicates a strong accumulation pattern among Chainlink whales, who have amassed over 15 million LINK in the past two months—an investment valued at around $165 million. This substantial accumulation suggests high confidence among large holders, who appear committed to backing LINK despite its inherent price volatility. While many altcoins have benefited from a wave of retail-driven speculation, Chainlink’s recent surge seems to be fueled by more than short-term market excitement. The active participation of whales, typically seen as more strategic investors, indicates a solid support base at current levels. Martinez’s analysis highlights that the trend of accumulation by whales has been steady, even amid price fluctuations, which often signals confidence in longer-term potential. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Target $2.4 If Price Aligns With Macro Pattern – Details However, the next few weeks will be telling. Analysts and investors closely monitor whether this accumulation trend will continue or if it was a temporary push to capitalize on favorable market conditions. Sustained buying by whales would likely bolster LINK’s price further, reinforcing that Chainlink’s network and utility as a decentralized oracle provider hold significant value in the evolving blockchain ecosystem. Conversely, if accumulation slows, LINK could see a period of consolidation as the market recalibrates. Key Levels To Watch Chainlink is trading at $13.3 after reaching a local high of $15.3, marking a significant move that has renewed investors’ optimism. In this recent rally, LINK broke above the 200-day moving average (MA) at $12.8, a critical level often seen as a key indicator of long-term market sentiment. To confirm this bullish momentum, LINK needs to hold this 200-day MA as a support level; if successful, it would reinforce the bullish price structure and signal the potential for further gains. Holding above $12.8 would set a strong foundation for LINK’s price action, suggesting that buyers have established control and are willing to defend current levels. Related Reading: Cardano Skyrockets Over 40% – Funding Rate Suggests Further Upside If this support holds, LINK could make a sustained push above its recent local high at $15.3. Analysts anticipate that a confirmed breakout would open the door for LINK to test higher resistance levels, with the potential for a strong continuation in the coming weeks. However, if LINK fails to hold the 200-day MA, the price may retest lower support areas, potentially disrupting the bullish momentum. For now, all eyes remain on $12.8 as LINK attempts to solidify its recent gains and prepare for a possible run higher.

According to recent data from the event contract market, 60% of users believe Bitcoin will hit this milestone before January, while 45% are betting it could achieve this level as early as November. Analyst Predicts Six-Figure Bitcoin Prices By Year-End Kalshi, which launched in 2021, allows users to bet on various outcomes, including economic data releases and election results. The platform gained significant attention this year due to its legal battle with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which ultimately led to US users being allowed to participate in betting markets for the presidential election. Since the US presidential election on November 5, Bitcoin has surged more than 28%. The election outcome has been viewed as bullish for cryptocurrencies, especially with President-elect Donald Trump expressing his support for the industry and hinting at more favorable regulations. Related Reading: Justin Drake Unveils ‘The Beam Chain’: A Vision For Ethereum Final Design Analyst Mike Colonnese from H.C. Wainwright commented on the current market conditions, stating: Strong positive sentiment is likely to persist through the balance of 2024, and we see Bitcoin prices potentially reaching the six-figure mark by the end of this year. The analyst further noted that Bitcoin is now in a phase of “price discovery” after breaking through its all-time highs early last Wednesday morning, following the official announcement of Trump’s election victory. This combination of market enthusiasm and regulatory optimism, he suggests, could see BTC continue its upward trajectory, attracting new investors and cementing its place in the financial landscape by the end of 2024. UBS Warns Of Historical Volatility Although betting markets and investors have set their sights on BTC hitting $100,000, Wall Street analysts are warning about the “speculative” nature of cryptocurrencies. Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, emphasized this point in a note to clients on Tuesday. “We continue to view crypto assets as a speculative trade rather than a strategic investment in portfolios,” she stated. Marcelli expressed skepticism regarding the potential for digital assets to make significant inroads into disruptive real-world applications, noting their propensity to increase portfolio volatility. UBS highlighted that since 2014, Bitcoin has experienced three major drawdowns exceeding 70%, with an average recovery period of three years. Related Reading: Analyst Warns Of 10% Bitcoin Price Drop Ahead Of CPI Data On a more positive note, other cryptocurrencies saw gains on Wednesday. Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and even Dogecoin (DOGE) experienced upward movement. Dogecoin surged notably after Trump announced that Tesla CEO Elon Musk and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy would head a newly formed “Department of Government Efficiency,” cleverly abbreviated to DOGE. However, crypto-related equities did not follow the bullish trend of Bitcoin. Stocks like Coinbase (COIN) and Robinhood (HOOD) took a breather after recent rallies, with Coinbase shares down about 2% on Wednesday, while Robinhood remained relatively unchanged. After hitting a new all-time high of $93,000 on Wednesday, BTC has come back down to the $90,350 level, yet, still up 20% on the week.

Bitcoin Could Peak In Mid-2025 Before US Recession A recent Copper Research report, a recent crypto research firm, posits that the leading cryptocurrency by market cap could extend its bullish momentum until mid-2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Data Reveals Bulls Are Growing But Still Behind March 2024 Peak – Details As of November 13, Bitcoin is on day 555 of its current market cycle, and a price peak for the digital asset could arrive within the next 200 days. Notably, this peak may coincide with a potential US recession forecasted for mid-2025. According to the report, Bitcoin’s market cycles average 756 days. The starting point of these cycles is when the annual average growth of Bitcoin’s market capitalization turns positive, while the endpoint is when it hits a price peak. The report marks the beginning of the current market cycle around mid-2023, just before asset manager BlackRock filed for a BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF). Should Bitcoin stay true to its historical price patterns, the digital asset can hit its price peak for this cycle sometime around mid-2025. The report cites estimates by JPMorgan about the likelihood of a US recession in mid-2025. As a result, BTC’s price peak might align with a potential US economic downturn. Based on data from Treasury spreads, JPMorgan gives a 45% chance of a potential US recession by mid-2025. The report further highlights the gap between BTC’s price top and realized volatility. For the uninitiated, realized volatility measures BTC’s price fluctuations over a specific period, showing the standard deviation of the asset’s returns from the market’s mean return. BTC’s realized volatility currently stands at around 50%, indicating that its volatility is only halfway to previous bull market peaks. Another bullish technical indicator for the BTC price trajectory is its filtered relative strength index (RSI). The report reads: Currently, the RSI sits at 60 – well below previous bull market highs – indicating considerable room for Bitcoin to continue building momentum into the new year. BTC Could Rise Further, But Caution Is Necessary The digital assets market has been on a strong upward trend since pro-crypto Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 US presidential election. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs See Historic Surge – Institutions Go Bullish On BTC With $1.38 Billion Record Inflows Notably, the emerging industry has witnessed its total market cap surge beyond $3 trillion for the first time since November 2021. The rise in total crypto market cap – largely driven by BTC – is not surprising since the Trump administration is speculated to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve akin to that of El Salvador under Nayib Bukele. Bitcoin’s unprecedented price action has propelled the digital asset’s total market cap beyond that of silver, solidifying it as the 8th largest global asset by market cap in existence. With this in mind, it will be interesting to see how BTC dominance (BTC.D) behaves in the coming weeks, especially after facing rejection just below the $90,000 level. Currently hovering slightly above 60%, a fall in BTC.D could signal a capital rotation from BTC into altcoins, potentially benefiting smaller-cap digital assets. BTC trades at $87,767 at press time, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours. The asset’s total market cap sits at $1.738 trillion.
