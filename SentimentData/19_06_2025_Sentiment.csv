A recent report suggested that Iran had sent a delegation to Oman for crucial talks. However, this has now been directly addressed by Iranian officials, adding another layer of complexity to the regional diplomatic landscape. For those tracking global events and their potential impact on financial markets , including the cryptocurrency space, understanding these developments is key. What Were the Speculations About Iran Oman Talks? Recent speculation circulating, notably reported by Al Jazeera via Financial Juice on Telegram, suggested that Iran had dispatched a negotiating delegation to Oman. Oman has historically played a mediating role in regional and international discussions involving Iran, often serving as a quiet channel for communication between Tehran and Western powers or other regional actors. Therefore, reports of Iran Oman talks are not inherently surprising, given this historical context. The nature of the speculated talks wasn’t immediately clear, but such high-level meetings could potentially touch upon various sensitive topics, including regional security, economic sanctions, or even aspects related to the nuclear program. Has Iran Confirmed or Denied These Reports? According to the latest reports, the Iranian Foreign Minister has explicitly denied sending any negotiating delegation to Oman. This direct denial dismisses the recent speculation and clarifies Iran’s current stance regarding such a mission. The statement indicates that the reports circulating about a delegation being dispatched are inaccurate. Key points from the Iranian response: The Iranian Foreign Minister made the statement. The statement was a direct denial of sending a delegation. It specifically addressed and dismissed the recent speculation. The source reporting this denial was Al Jazeera via Financial Juice on Telegram. This denial is significant as it contrasts with the circulating rumors and provides an official position from Tehran on the matter. Why is Iran Diplomacy in the Middle East Important? Iran’s diplomatic activities are closely watched by the international community due to its significant role in the Middle East. The country is involved in various regional dynamics, from its relationships with neighboring states to its stance on international agreements. Iran diplomacy efforts, or the lack thereof, can have wide-ranging implications for regional stability, energy markets, and global politics. Oman’s unique position as a neutral mediator often makes it a potential venue for sensitive discussions, making any news about Middle East negotiations particularly noteworthy. Understanding Iran’s diplomatic posture helps in gauging potential shifts in regional alliances, the likelihood of de-escalation or conflict, and the path forward on critical issues like the nuclear deal. How Do Geopolitical Tensions Potentially Impact Markets, Including Crypto? Geopolitical events, especially those involving key players in volatile regions like the Middle East, can significantly influence global financial markets. Increased geopolitical tensions often lead to uncertainty, which can manifest in several ways: Increased Volatility: Markets react to news, and uncertainty can cause sharp price swings. Shift to Safe Havens: Investors might move capital towards assets traditionally considered ‘safe,’ though the definition of safe haven is debated, especially regarding crypto. Impact on Commodities: Tensions in the Middle East frequently affect oil and gas prices, which can have ripple effects throughout the global economy. Investor Sentiment: Negative geopolitical news can dampen overall market sentiment, leading to sell-offs. While the direct link between specific geopolitical tensions and cryptocurrency price movements is not always straightforward, the broader impact on global liquidity, risk appetite, and traditional market stability can certainly spill over into the crypto market. Crypto is increasingly seen as a risk-on asset, but some argue it can also serve as a hedge against traditional financial system instability or currency devaluation in certain contexts. What Does This Denial Mean for Middle East Negotiations? The denial of a specific delegation being sent to Oman doesn’t necessarily mean that all channels of communication are closed, but it does pour cold water on the specific report. It suggests that either the timing or the nature of the speculated mission was incorrect. For those watching Middle East negotiations, this highlights the often opaque nature of high-level diplomacy. It underscores the need to rely on confirmed official statements rather than unverified reports. The denial could also be a tactical move, but without further information, it confirms that the reported talks, in the manner described, are not happening. Considering the Crypto Market Impact How does this specific piece of news potentially factor into the broader crypto market impact? A single denial of talks in Oman is unlikely to cause immediate, dramatic shifts in Bitcoin or altcoin prices on its own. However, it contributes to the overall narrative of geopolitical stability or instability. If this denial signals a breakdown in potential communication channels or an increase in regional friction, it could add to the ambient level of geopolitical risk that investors consider. Conversely, if it simply corrects a false report, its impact might be minimal. Crypto investors often monitor global macro events, including geopolitical developments, as part of their overall market analysis. While crypto markets have their unique drivers, they are not entirely immune to the forces shaping traditional finance and global stability. Keeping an eye on significant international news, like developments in Iran diplomacy, helps in building a more complete picture of the global economic and political environment. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty in Geopolitics and Markets The report of Iran sending a delegation to Oman for talks and the subsequent denial by the Iranian Foreign Minister illustrate the fluid nature of international diplomacy and news reporting. While speculation is common, official confirmations or denials provide crucial clarity. This event underscores the ongoing complexities in the Middle East and the sensitivity surrounding potential negotiations involving Iran. For market participants, including those in the cryptocurrency space, staying informed about such geopolitical developments is part of understanding the broader risk landscape, even if the direct, immediate crypto market impact of a single event like this denial is often indirect and difficult to quantify precisely.

The operation is part of an ongoing crackdown on cryptocurrency-related fraud, which officials say has defrauded more than 400 victims. Tether Trail Leads DOJ to $225M Seizure in Global Crypto Scam Tied to OKX According to the DOJ, the funds were traced through a web of blockchain transactions that linked them to an international confidence scam. The investigation revealed that the stolen assets were laundered through the crypto exchange OKX before being consolidated into wallets holding Tether’s stablecoin. “Today’s civil forfeiture complaint against over $225 million worth of cryptocurrency is the Department’s latest action in our ongoing fight against cryptocurrency fraud schemes,” said Matthew Galeotti, head of the DOJ’s Criminal Division. Today, Matthew R. Galeotti of @DOJCrimDiv announced a civil forfeiture complaint to seize $225.3M in cryptocurrency tied to investment fraud & money laundering. The funds were traced through a sophisticated blockchain network used to scam 400+ suspected victims. pic.twitter.com/pBEN8Mjrfd — Criminal Division (@DOJCrimDiv) June 18, 2025 He added that the FBI estimates that over $9.3 billion in crypto-related losses were reported in 2024 alone, with $5.8 billion tied directly to fraudulent investment schemes. The complaint alleges that the perpetrators of the scam used thousands of transactions to obscure the movement of stolen funds. Victims were lured with what they believed were legitimate crypto investment opportunities, only to lose their money to well-coordinated fraud rings. The seized funds, held entirely in USDT, represent the largest amount ever tied to a single crypto scam case. The DOJ said this action is part of a broader strategy to disrupt transnational criminal networks that target vulnerable investors, particularly older adults. “These schemes harm American victims and undermine investor confidence in the cryptocurrency ecosystem,” Galeotti said. The case follows a string of similar actions by federal authorities. Just last week, the DOJ announced guilty pleas from five people who laundered more than $36 million through a Cambodia-based scam . Last month, another federal court ordered the forfeiture of $2.5 million in crypto tied to a similar operation. U.S. Attorney Pirro and other federal officials emphasized the personal and financial toll of these scams. Many victims, they noted, were older adults who lost life savings after being targeted online. “The impact of these schemes on their victims can be devastating,” said Galeotti. “This impact is compounded many times over by the scale of these schemes.” The DOJ urged the public to stay alert and learn how to spot fraudulent investment tactics. Galeotti pointed to the FBI’s online resources for identifying red flags, especially unsolicited investment offers or strangers offering quick returns via social media. “This is not the first action we’ve taken—and it will not be the last,” he said. “We will use every tool at our disposal to ensure these crimes do not pay and to bring perpetrators to justice.” The DOJ has not yet announced charges against specific people tied to the $225 million seizure, but investigations are ongoing. More Than 5,400 Victims Notified Amid Surge in Crypto Fraud Reports by FBI The DOJ’s $225 million seizure follows a wider crackdown on crypto-linked fraud, with U.S. authorities intensifying enforcement in 2025 as digital scams hit new highs. Just last month, prosecutors filed charges against Jeremy Jordan-Jones , the self-proclaimed CEO of a blockchain firm called Amalgam. He allegedly defrauded investors of over $1 million through false claims of major partnerships with sports teams and payment platforms. Instead, the funds were reportedly used to bankroll a lavish lifestyle. “Jordan-Jones’s alleged blatant lies funded his personal lifestyle at the expense of unknowing victims,” said FBI assistant director Christopher Raia. On a broader scale, the DOJ recently unsealed an indictment against Rustam Rafailevich Gallyamov , a Russian national accused of creating and deploying the Qakbot malware. The DOJ seized over $24 million in crypto from Gallyamov, who allegedly ran a global botnet used to launch ransomware attacks. The FBI says crypto fraud is rising at an alarming pace. Its latest IC3 report shows $9.3 billion in crypto-related losses in 2024 alone , a 66% increase from the year before. Ransomware remains the top threat to U.S. infrastructure. The FBI recorded $9.3 billion losses spread across various crypto-related investment scams, extortion, ATM and kiosks, among others, in 2024. #FBI #CryptoFraud #CryptoScam https://t.co/1Eb8KStAHk — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 24, 2025 FBI officials confirmed that more 5,400 people have been notified since January 2024 after being unknowingly targeted in crypto scams. “Cryptocurrency has become an enticing means to cheat investors,” said FBI operations director Chad Yarbrough.

And is the latest Solana (SOL) price prediction signalling a move back toward the $200 range? While traders continue to debate these popular crypto coins, one project is focused on real progress. BlockDAG’s (BDAG) GO LIVE wasn’t just a reveal; it was a comprehensive rollout plan backed by action. CEO Antony Turner outlined a clear six-week strategy to take BDAG from presale to top-tier coin. This includes real-time token utility, working dApps, community miners going live, and liquidity locked across 20 exchanges. The $600 million target isn’t just talk. It will fund a fully operational network with developer support and transparency tools. With only three days left for the $0.0018 price, BlockDAG is betting on execution, and it’s happening now. Ethereum Sentiment Shifts with ETF Inflows and Market Momentum Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing a revival in investor sentiment, with ETH recently surpassing $2,800 for the first time in 15 weeks. This surge is fueled by strong spot ETF inflows, led by BlackRock’s ETH ETF, and a favourable U.S. inflation report. On June 11 alone, net inflows totalled $240 million, sparking renewed interest in ETH. While ETF activity was slightly paused on June 14, the 18-day streak of inflows has set a bullish tone for ETH’s near-term prospects. However, on-chain data tells a more cautious story. Whale wallet activity has dropped slightly, possibly indicating short-term profit-taking, while more than 34.6 million ETH are staked, suggesting long-term conviction in the network. With the Fear & Greed Index still in the “Fear” zone, investor sentiment remains cautiously bullish. If ETH can maintain support in the $2,749–$2,800 range, the path toward $3,000 and beyond looks increasingly likely. Solana (SOL) Poised for a Breakout: $200+ on the Horizon? Solana (SOL) is showing promising signs of a potential breakout, with technical indicators suggesting a short-term target of $150–$165. If SOL can clear resistance levels between $158 and $164, analysts expect it to push toward the $180 range. Currently consolidating near key moving averages, SOL’s RSI shows it may be close to oversold territory, which could lead to a bounce if momentum holds. Looking ahead, Solana’s long-term outlook remains strong, with price predictions for late 2025 ranging between $250 and $400. This is driven by infrastructure upgrades, such as Firedancer, DeFi launches, and potential ETF approval. Institutional interest, including from JP Morgan, could trigger billions in future inflows. BlockDAG’s $600M Plan: Clear Execution, Not Hype At its GO LIVE reveal, BlockDAG isn’t relying on empty promises; it’s demonstrating real progress. CEO Antony Turner unveiled a six-week rollout plan that will transition BDAG from a presale coin to a fully functional ecosystem. The plan ensures that the mainnet will go live at the start of the six weeks, with miners already securing the network and smart contracts in action. BlockDAG isn’t teasing features, it’s delivering them. The roadmap includes DeFi apps, a launchpad, community-driven dApps, and coin utility before the first exchange listing. BlockDAG’s $600 million presale is much more than just a big number. It’s a detailed funding plan that supports liquidity for 20 exchanges, mobile and hardware mining infrastructure, developer grants, and real-world integrations like DePIN and decentralised AI. Unlike many projects that overpromise and underdeliver, BlockDAG is mapping out exactly where the funds will go and what each milestone will achieve. Currently in Batch 29 of 45, BlockDAG has raised over $309.5 million and sold more than 22.8 billion BDAG coins. The standard batch price is $0.0276, but the platform is offering a limited-time rate of $0.0018 per BDAG for the next six days. At launch, 40% of presale coins will be live on-chain, with a running vesting smart contract giving buyers immediate utility. This isn’t just another speculative presale; it’s an opportunity to join a project with a functioning chain and a detailed growth plan. While other crypto projects compete for attention, BlockDAG is focused on execution, making this a key window for early involvement. The Path Ahead Ethereum (ETH) investor sentiment is on the rise following strong ETF inflows and a breakout above $2,800, while Solana (SOL) is eyeing the $200 mark if resistance levels are cleared. Both are still major players in the crypto space, but they aren’t offering the same entry opportunities as BlockDAG. At $0.0018, BlockDAG isn’t just speculating, it’s executing a solid six-week plan with working technology, active miners, dApps, and secured liquidity deals. With the $600 million roadmap in place and 20 exchanges confirmed, BlockDAG is focused on delivering more than just hype. The $0.0018 price offer ends in six days, making now the ideal time to get in before the full launch.

Elastos, known for its innovative work in decentralized technologies, has just unveiled a groundbreaking new asset: BTCD. This isn’t just any stablecoin; it’s a Bitcoin stablecoin designed with robust mechanics to provide a stable dollar value, directly backed by BTC itself. What is the Elastos BTCD Stablecoin? Elastos has officially launched BTCD stablecoin , a digital asset pegged to the US dollar but uniquely collateralized by Bitcoin. Developed as part of their BeL2 protocol – a layer designed to bring Bitcoin’s security and liquidity into the DeFi space – BTCD represents a significant effort to bridge the gap between the world’s largest cryptocurrency and the need for price stability in decentralized applications. The core idea behind BTCD is to create a stable unit of account within the Bitcoin ecosystem without relying on centralized fiat reserves. Instead, it leverages the inherent value of Bitcoin itself, but with a crucial twist: significant overcollateralization. Asset Backing: Primarily backed by Bitcoin (BTC). Pegging Mechanism: Aims to maintain a stable 1:1 peg with the US dollar. Protocol: Launched on Elastos’s BeL2 protocol. Overcollateralization: Features a high collateralization ratio, reported between 160% and 200%. Why is a BTC-Backed Stablecoin Important for Bitcoin DeFi? Bitcoin, while the king of crypto in terms of market cap and security, is famously volatile. This volatility makes it challenging to use directly in many decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, such as lending, borrowing, or trading, where predictable value is essential. A BTC-backed stablecoin like BTCD addresses this fundamental problem. Imagine trying to take out a loan denominated in BTC. If the price of Bitcoin drops significantly, the value of your loan decreases, potentially triggering liquidations or making the loan less attractive. Conversely, lending BTC means the value of your principal could fluctuate wildly. Stablecoins provide a much-needed anchor in this turbulent sea. By creating a stable, dollar-pegged asset derived from BTC, BTCD allows users to participate in DeFi activities on protocols like BeL2 using the value locked in their Bitcoin, but with the stability of a stablecoin. This unlocks new possibilities for yield generation, borrowing against BTC, and stable value transfer within the Bitcoin ecosystem, facilitated by Elastos. How Does BTCD’s Overcollateralization Work? One of the standout features of Elastos BTCD is its high level of overcollateralization, ranging from 160% to 200%. This means that for every dollar worth of BTCD minted, there is between $1.60 and $2.00 worth of Bitcoin locked up as collateral. This high ratio serves as a crucial buffer against Bitcoin’s price volatility. If the price of BTC drops, the collateral value decreases, but the high overcollateralization ensures that the system can absorb significant price swings before the collateral value falls below the value of the outstanding stablecoins. This mechanism is designed to enhance the stability and security of the BTCD peg. In systems with lower collateralization or reliance on volatile assets, a sharp price drop can lead to rapid liquidations and even de-pegging events. BTCD’s conservative collateralization ratio aims to mitigate these risks, providing a stronger foundation for its stability. The Digital Bretton Woods Vision and On-Chain Arbitrage CoinDesk reported that BTCD is designed to mimic a ‘digital Bretton Woods system’. The original Bretton Woods system pegged global currencies to the US dollar, which was in turn pegged to gold. In BTCD’s digital parallel, Bitcoin acts as the underlying ‘gold’ or reserve asset, and BTCD acts as the stable ‘dollar’ equivalent within the digital economy. Maintaining this peg relies heavily on on-chain arbitrage. Arbitrageurs play a vital role in stablecoin systems by profiting from small price discrepancies between the stablecoin and its peg. If BTCD trades slightly below $1, arbitrageurs can buy it cheaply and redeem it for $1 worth of the underlying BTC collateral (minus fees), pushing the price back up. If BTCD trades slightly above $1, arbitrageurs can mint new BTCD using BTC collateral and sell it on the market for a profit, increasing supply and pushing the price back down. This constant activity by arbitrageurs helps to keep the BTCD stablecoin trading close to its intended $1 peg, leveraging market forces directly on the blockchain. The BeL2 protocol provides the infrastructure for these on-chain operations. Benefits of BTCD for the Bitcoin Ecosystem The introduction of BTCD brings several potential benefits: Enhanced Stability: Provides a stable medium of exchange and store of value within Bitcoin-centric DeFi applications. Increased Capital Efficiency: Allows BTC holders to utilize their assets in DeFi without selling their Bitcoin, unlocking liquidity. Reduced Volatility Risk in DeFi: Makes lending, borrowing, and trading on BeL2 and potentially other compatible protocols more predictable. Strengthening Bitcoin DeFi: Adds a crucial building block needed for a mature and functional decentralized finance ecosystem around Bitcoin. Decentralization: As a BTC-backed stablecoin, it relies on decentralized collateral (Bitcoin) and on-chain mechanisms, reducing reliance on centralized entities compared to fiat-backed stablecoins. Potential Challenges and Considerations While promising, the launch of Elastos BTCD also faces potential challenges: Collateralization Management: Maintaining the required overcollateralization ratio requires robust liquidation mechanisms to handle significant and rapid drops in BTC price. Oracle Reliance: The system relies on accurate and timely price feeds (oracles) for Bitcoin’s value to manage collateral and liquidations effectively. Oracle failures or manipulation could pose risks. Adoption and Liquidity: The success of BTCD depends on gaining user adoption and sufficient liquidity on exchanges and DeFi protocols to facilitate efficient arbitrage and use. Smart Contract Risk: As with any DeFi protocol, there is inherent risk in the smart contracts governing the minting, burning, and collateral management processes. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin DeFi? The launch of a robust, BTC-backed stablecoin like BTCD on BeL2 is a significant development for the nascent Bitcoin DeFi space. For years, the vast liquidity and security of Bitcoin have been largely siloed from the rapid innovation happening in DeFi on other chains like Ethereum. Protocols like BeL2 and assets like BTCD are attempting to change this. By providing essential DeFi primitives – in this case, a stable unit of account – they pave the way for more complex and useful applications to be built, potentially unlocking billions in value currently held in inert Bitcoin wallets. This move by Elastos signals growing momentum in bringing Bitcoin’s power to decentralized finance. It’s a space to watch closely as more protocols and assets emerge to build out the Bitcoin DeFi landscape. Actionable Insights for Users For those interested in exploring BTCD and the BeL2 protocol: Research: Understand the mechanics of BTCD, including how collateralization and liquidation work. Evaluate Risk: Be aware of the risks associated with stablecoins (de-pegging, smart contract risk) and the specific risks related to volatile collateral. Look for Opportunities: Explore where BTCD is available for trading or use within DeFi protocols on Elastos/BeL2 to potentially earn yield or use it as collateral. Stay Informed: Follow updates from Elastos and the BeL2 team regarding the stablecoin’s performance and any changes to the protocol. Conclusion: A Stable Future for Bitcoin DeFi? Elastos’s launch of BTCD is a bold step towards building a more stable and functional Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem. By leveraging Bitcoin’s security and value with a carefully designed overcollateralization model and on-chain arbitrage, the BTCD stablecoin aims to provide a reliable dollar peg within the BeL2 protocol. While challenges remain, the potential for a robust, BTC-backed stablecoin to unlock new possibilities for Bitcoin holders in DeFi is immense. This development could be a key piece in realizing the full potential of decentralized finance built around the world’s most secure blockchain.

On-chain data also shows that whales are actively accumulating XRP, with the addresses holding one million coins recently reaching a new high. XRP Ledger Records Massive Growth In Past Week In an X post, on-chain analytics platform Santiment revealed that the XRP Ledger is showing signs of growth, from both a usage and key stakeholder perspective. The platform revealed that there are now over 2,700 whale and shark wallets holding at least 1 million XRP for the first time in the token’s 12-year history. Related Reading: Is There A “Secret XRP Ledger” And Is The Price Really At $1,000? Additionally, Santiment stated that the number of active XRP addresses has averaged over 295,000 daily over the past week. This is notable as the normal daily average over the past three months was between 35,000 and 40,000. It is worth mentioning that the XRPL recorded some major developments last week. One is the launch of Circle’s USDC stablecoin on the XRP Ledger. This is expected to boost network activity given the increasing demand for stablecoins. Crypto analyst Moon Lambo predicted that this would increase the total value locked (TVL) on the network. He also noted how this was bullish for the XRP price, since users will need the token for every USDC transaction. Furthermore, Ondo Finance launched its tokenized US treasury fund (OUSG) on the XRP Ledger last week, which could have also contributed to the surge in network activity. The BlackRock-backed fund will be mintable and redeemable using the RLUSD stablecoin. Meanwhile, Guggenheim also recently partnered with Ripple to launch the first Digital Commercial Paper on the XRPL. Expert Predicts Price Rally Above $4 Amid the surge in network activity on the XRPL, crypto analyst Javon Marks has predicted that the XRP price could rally above $4 and even reach as high as $8. He stated that the altcoin is holding a clear breakout and is getting ready for a major bullish continuation. Marks added that the targets are at $4.80 and $8, marking new all-time highs (ATHs) for XRP. Related Reading: These Factors Will Drive XRP Price To $25-$75 In June – Analyst Crypto analyst Dark Defender recently alluded to a previous analysis in which he stated that the XRP price could make a decision within two weeks. The analyst is confident that the altcoin could rally to as high as $6 on this Wave 5 impulsive move to the upside. He has also previously predicted that XRP would reach double digits in this market cycle. On the other hand, it is worth mentioning that the XRP price has again dropped below the $2.25 level. Crypto analyst CasiTrades had warned that the support levels at $2.01, $1.90, and $1.55 could be in play if the $2.25 level holds as resistance. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.16, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

He emphasizes that his previous projection, issued in mid-2024, delivered substantial returns and transformed ordinary investors into millionaires. July 2024 Prediction Delivered Exceptional Returns In July 2024, Michael identified a bullish technical chart signal , a breakout from a seven-year bull pennant formation, describing it as the most compelling setup he had encountered in cryptocurrency markets. At the time, XRP was priced around $0.50 and underperformed despite positive developments involving Ripple’s corporate deals. Many market participants dismissed the token, but Michael remained steadfast in his conviction. That conviction paid off. XRP surpassed the $0.50 resistance level by November 2024 and surged sharply to reach $3.40 in January 2025, representing a nearly 580% increase. This move marked a return to price levels not seen since 2018. The prediction earned respect from some previously critical voices, many of whom acknowledged the accuracy of Michael’s original call. Last year, I shared an XRP prediction that helped many ordinary people become millionaires. The cabal didn’t like it. They tried to stop me in various ways. Yesterday, I posted another XRP prediction.. I wouldn’t be surprised if they try to stop me again when it plays out. https://t.co/49ZsoVxT1E — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) June 16, 2025 Seven-Month Consolidation Marks a Pause Following the parabolic uptrend, XRP entered a consolidation phase that lasted approximately seven months. This period included a decline of over 50%, bringing the price down to around $1.60. Since that dip, XRP has mostly remained above $2. Michael interprets this behaviour as a healthy correction. He suggests it represents a period of accumulation and stability, setting the stage for the next upward move. According to him, XRP is now exiting this consolidation and preparing for a new rally. Bitcoin Breakout to Ignite Next Crypto Surge In his latest commentary, Michael shifts attention to Bitcoin. He notes that Bitcoin is nearing a breakout above an eight-year descending trendline. He believes that when Bitcoin finally surges past that resistance, its momentum will ripple through the crypto market and significantly benefit altcoins like XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Michael cautions that this upcoming rally could be supported by what he terms a “generational wealth” event, which would draw wider investor interest. Although he does not specify XRP’s exact target, he suggests the movement could prove exceptionally rewarding for long-term holders. Potential Gains and Price Range Expectations Michael acknowledges possible resistance to this forecast but remains confident in its potential. He points to analyst projections that XRP might reach between $5 and $30 during this cycle. Even at the lower bound, investors holding 500 XRP could see significant gains. For example, if XRP climbs to $5, a holding of 500 tokens, currently worth approximately $1,000, could increase to $2,500, representing a 150% gain. Some in the community believe XRP could reach $100 ; however, Michael regards this as overly optimistic for the present cycle. Still, he notes that even speculative targets in this range would have a lasting impact on smaller positions. Michael XBT reiterates that his mid-2024 XRP call delivered transformative results and that he is prepared to repeat that level of accuracy. With XRP emerging from its consolidation and Bitcoin potentially breaking a significant resistance, he believes market conditions are aligning for a new round of significant price movement.

For businesses operating in the digital space, finding efficient, cost-effective, and global payment solutions is paramount. This is where the intersection of e-commerce and cryptocurrency becomes incredibly exciting. Recently, American crypto exchange giant Coinbase made a significant move by announcing the launch of its new service, Coinbase Payments . This development is poised to offer e-commerce platforms a fresh perspective on how they handle transactions, potentially revolutionizing the online payment landscape. What Exactly is Coinbase Payments? Coinbase Payments is described by the company as a “stablecoin payments stack designed for commerce platforms.” In simpler terms, it’s a dedicated service built by Coinbase to allow online businesses to accept payments directly in cryptocurrency, specifically focusing on stablecoins like USDC. Unlike traditional crypto payment gateways that might involve volatility risks or slower settlement times, Coinbase Payments aims to provide a seamless, instant, and reliable method for merchants to receive funds. Key features highlighted by Coinbase include: Instant Settlement: Payments are processed and settled almost instantly, 24/7. USDC Focus: Primarily utilizes USD Coin (USDC), a stablecoin pegged 1:1 with the US dollar, minimizing price volatility risk for the merchant. Designed for Commerce: Built with the specific needs of e-commerce platforms in mind, offering integration tools and features relevant to online retail. Global Reach: Leverages the borderless nature of cryptocurrencies to facilitate international transactions more easily than traditional methods. This isn’t just another button to accept Bitcoin; it’s a structured approach to integrating Stablecoin Payments into the core of online commerce operations. Why Consider Crypto Payments for Your Business? For years, businesses have relied on credit cards, debit cards, and traditional online payment processors. While effective, these methods often come with drawbacks: High Transaction Fees: Percentage-based fees can eat into profit margins, especially for businesses with high sales volumes or small ticket items. Chargebacks: The risk of chargebacks can be a significant headache and financial loss for merchants. Slow Settlement Times: Receiving funds can take days, impacting cash flow. Geographical Limitations: International payments can be complex, expensive, and subject to various regulations and currency conversions. Crypto Payments offer potential solutions to many of these issues. By using cryptocurrencies, especially stablecoins, businesses can access lower fees, eliminate chargeback risk (as crypto transactions are irreversible), and benefit from near-instant global settlement. The introduction of Coinbase Payments makes these benefits more accessible and practical for mainstream e-commerce platforms. Unpacking the Benefits of USDC Payments with Coinbase Payments Focusing on USDC is a strategic choice by Coinbase. USDC is one of the most widely adopted and regulated stablecoins, backed by reserves held in segregated accounts. Using USDC Payments via Coinbase Payments offers distinct advantages: For Merchants: Reduced Fees: Significantly lower transaction costs compared to traditional payment processors. Eliminate Chargebacks: Crypto transactions are final, removing the possibility of fraudulent chargebacks. Instant Access to Funds: Money is settled instantly, improving cash flow management. Access to a New Customer Base: Tap into the growing market of cryptocurrency holders who prefer to pay with digital assets. Simplified International Transactions: Accept payments globally without complex currency conversions or high cross-border fees. Reduced Fraud Risk: The nature of blockchain transactions makes certain types of fraud, common in card payments, impossible. For Customers (Using Crypto): Alternative Payment Method: Provides an option to spend their digital assets directly. Privacy: While not completely anonymous, crypto transactions offer a different level of privacy compared to linking bank accounts or credit cards. Potential Discounts: Some merchants might offer small discounts for crypto payments due to lower processing costs. This focus on Stablecoin Payments mitigates the primary concern merchants have had with accepting volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin directly. How Does Integration Work? Actionable Insights for Merchants For e-commerce platforms considering adopting Coinbase Payments , the process is designed to be developer-friendly. Coinbase provides APIs and tools to integrate the payment option directly into a website or application. The customer experience is intended to be smooth: Customer selects the crypto payment option at checkout. They are presented with a QR code or payment link for the exact USDC amount (or equivalent in another supported crypto, instantly converted). Customer sends the payment from their crypto wallet. Coinbase confirms the transaction instantly. The merchant receives the USDC in their Coinbase account, ready to use or convert to fiat if desired. Before integrating, businesses should consider: Target Audience: Does your customer base include cryptocurrency holders? Accounting & Taxes: Understand the accounting and tax implications of receiving payments in cryptocurrency. Coinbase provides reporting tools, but it’s essential to consult with a tax professional. Technical Resources: Ensure you have the technical capacity to integrate and maintain the payment gateway. Customer Support: Be prepared to offer basic support for customers choosing this payment method. Adding E-commerce Payments via crypto isn’t just a technical change; it’s a strategic business decision. Coinbase Payments vs. Traditional E-commerce Payments: A Quick Comparison Let’s look at how Coinbase Payments stacks up against common methods: Feature Comparison: Feature Coinbase Payments (USDC) Traditional Credit Card Processors Transaction Fees Significantly lower (often a small flat fee or percentage) Higher (percentage + per-transaction fee) Settlement Time Instant (24/7) Days (typically 2-5 business days) Chargebacks None (transactions are irreversible) High risk (can occur weeks or months later) Global Reach Borderless, easy international payments Complex, high fees, currency conversion issues Fraud Risk (Payment Level) Very Low (blockchain inherent security) Higher (card number theft, etc.) Volatility Risk Minimal (using stablecoins like USDC) None (fiat-based) While volatility risk is minimal with USDC, it’s not zero in extreme market conditions, and the merchant needs to decide whether to hold USDC or instantly convert to fiat (Coinbase offers conversion services). The Future Landscape of E-commerce Payments The launch of Coinbase Payments signals a growing confidence in the viability of cryptocurrency, particularly stablecoins, as a legitimate and superior form of payment for online businesses. As more platforms integrate solutions like this, we could see a shift in consumer behavior and merchant preferences. Wider adoption of Stablecoin Payments could lead to: Increased competition among payment processors, potentially lowering fees across the board. Greater financial inclusion for businesses and customers in regions underserved by traditional banking. Innovation in checkout experiences leveraging the unique properties of blockchain. Coinbase is a major player, and their entry into this specific niche of E-commerce Payments is likely to accelerate the trend. It forces other payment providers, both crypto and traditional, to innovate and adapt. Conclusion: A New Era for Online Transactions? Coinbase Payments represents a significant step forward in bridging the gap between the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency and the established realm of e-commerce. By offering a reliable, instant, and cost-effective solution built around stablecoins like USDC, Coinbase is presenting a compelling alternative to traditional payment methods for online businesses. While challenges around adoption and regulatory clarity remain, the potential benefits – lower fees, no chargebacks, instant settlement, and global reach – are substantial. For e-commerce platforms looking to innovate, reduce costs, and tap into new markets, exploring Coinbase Payments might just be the key to unlocking the future of online transactions.

Select crypto assets maintain stability or exhibit measured upward movement amid broader market decline. Both Hedera and Cosmos are showing minor pullbacks, yet they’re holding ground and actively developing. That signals strength beneath the surface. Qubetics ($TICS) is writing an entirely different script. While other projects hold steady or retract, Qubetics is actively solving a real crypto industry problem: seamless cross-border transactions. It’s building for businesses, professionals, and individuals who need low-cost, decentralised value transfer with minimal friction. That focus on function over noise makes it arguably the best crypto investment in this market phase. Unlike predecessors that overpromised and underdelivered, Qubetics solves an Operational challenge in crypto: seamless cross-border transactions. From global remittance firms to regional e-commerce operators, the demand for secure, decentralised, low-fee value movement across chains and borders has never been higher. Qubetics ($TICS): Cross-Border Efficiency and Structured ROI Qubetics is engineered with purpose. Beyond the typical token utility narrative, it delivers concrete value in cross-border settlements, especially for small to mid-sized businesses and decentralised financial service providers. A payment gateway serving clients in Asia, Europe, and Africa can move value between chains securely, with fewer intermediaries, lower fees, and instant finality. Professionals using stablecoins to pay offshore contractors can do so directly through the Qubetics wallet, eliminating the need for custodians. Businesses handling payroll in multiple regions can automate execution across networks. It’s not just infrastructure, it’s functional efficiency. From a presale perspective, Qubetics is in Stage 37, priced at $0.3370. With only 10 million tokens remaining, this is the final entry point before the listing price of $0.40 activates. That alone gives a 20% ROI for those buying now. For instance, a $5,000 investment secures roughly 14,850 tokens, worth $5,940 at listing. Tokenomics have been reshaped to reflect long-term value. The total supply has been cut down from over 4 billion to 1.36 billion, and public allocation increased to 38.55%, shifting power away from concentrated entities and into the hands of the community. There’s measurable upside and genuine utility, which qualifies Qubetics as the best crypto investment for those looking for structure, performance, and relevance. Qubetics Crypto Presale: Final Stage With Built-In ROI The Qubetics crypto presale is now open for direct investment. Currently in Stage 37, the token is available at a fixed price of $0.3370. Over 516 million tokens have been sold, and $18 million+ has been raised. More than 28,000 holders have joined, and only 10 million tokens remain. It’s a capital opportunity with built-in value. Upon launch, $TICS will list at $0.40, securing an immediate 20% ROI for those who enter now. For example, an investment of $5,000 would secure around 14,850 tokens, worth $5,940 at listing — a clear $940 gain at the point of exchange. Qubetics has reduced its total supply from 4 billion to 1.36 billion, and increased public allocation to 38.55%, pushing power into the hands of real users. This isn’t about speculation but accessibility, control, and a quantifiable return on entry. For those comparing the current presales, this is one of the few with proper infrastructure, working utility, and visible upside. It’s why Qubetics is being called the best crypto investment of this presale cycle. Hedera (HBAR): Enterprise Blockchain With Real-World Alignment Hedera continues to be one of the most enterprise-aligned crypto protocols. Trading at $0.1501, with a 24-hour volume of $156.6 million, and a market cap of $6.34 billion, it’s currently down 3.48%. Its hashgraph technology, a consensus mechanism distinct from traditional blockchains, provides finality with low fees and high throughput. That’s why companies like IBM, Google, and Boeing participate in Hedera’s governance council. This is not an experiment; it’s a production-ready protocol. HBAR supports use cases such as document tracking, digital identity verification, carbon offset registries, and stablecoin infrastructure. It attracts institutional partnerships and has maintained high developer activity despite macro headwinds. Hedera still checks key boxes for those seeking the best crypto investment with enterprise viability and strong tech fundamentals. While current price action consolidates, the protocol’s strategic positioning within traditional finance makes it a long-term contender. Cosmos (ATOM): At $4.05, Building the Internet of Blockchains Through Modular Connectivity Cosmos remains a cornerstone of the interoperability conversation. Priced today at $4.05, with a 24-hour volume of $95.2 million and a market cap of $1.58 billion, it’s down 2.16% but remains a resilient force in decentralised architecture. With 390 million ATOM coins circulating, it maintains a mid-cap presence with a loyal developer base. Its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol was among the first real implementations of chain-to-chain interoperability. Cosmos empowers developers to build application-specific blockchains that can talk to each other, forming a decentralised internet of blockchains. It’s ideal for protocols that want sovereignty without sacrificing composability. For example, a DeFi platform can run its secure chain while plugging into liquidity across other networks. Cosmos’ approach remains unique and forward-facing, even if its market value temporarily lags. Anyone assessing the best crypto investment based on modularity and future scalability should not overlook ATOM. It’s not just a token, it’s a framework. Conclusion: Why Qubetics Stands Out as the Best Crypto Investment Today When the market is quiet, smart capital looks for fundamental real use, strong tokenomics, and entry at the right time. Qubetics delivers on all three. With a fixed price of $0.3370, a guaranteed 20% ROI at launch, and real-world application in cross-border payments, it ranks as the best crypto investment . Hedera and Cosmos both remain respected, with enterprise traction and technical credibility. But for those searching for structured gains and long-term relevance, Qubetics offers the timing, transparency, and infrastructure that define a modern crypto asset worth backing. Act before the final 10 million tokens are gone. Miss this presale, and you miss the only built-in ROI.

Qubetics ($TICS) is considered one of the best crypto investment opportunities due to its real-world use cases, cross-border transaction utility, and fixed 20% ROI via its final presale stage. How does Qubetics enable cross-border transactions? Qubetics offers a decentralised infrastructure that simplifies and reduces costs for sending stablecoins or native assets across blockchains. It’s ideal for businesses with international payroll, contractors, and remittance flows. Is there a guaranteed return in the Qubetics crypto presale? Yes. At Stage 37, $TICS is priced at $0.3370. Upon listing at $0.40, buyers secure an immediate 20% return on their capital, a rare structure in today’s presale space. Why are Hedera and Cosmos included as top contenders? Hedera offers enterprise-grade tech adopted by major corporations, while Cosmos supports chain interoperability and modular blockchain development. Both serve niche use cases with long-term demand. How much would a $5,000 investment in Qubetics be worth at launch? At the fixed presale price of $0.3370, $5,000 gets approximately 14,850 $TICS.

The Bank of England (BoE) has signaled its intent to bring about crucial new regulations concerning how banks interact with the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. This move, set to take effect by 2026, is a clear indication that the UK’s central bank is taking a cautious, even restrictive, stance on Banks crypto exposure . If you’re involved in banking, finance, or the crypto space in the UK, understanding these impending changes is essential. What is the Bank of England Crypto Regulation All About? The core of the BoE’s announcement revolves around limiting the risks that banks face when dealing with crypto assets. David Bailey, the BoE’s executive director for prudential policy, highlighted the central concern: cryptocurrencies are an asset class where investors can potentially lose their entire investment. This inherent volatility and risk profile necessitate a more controlled environment for institutions holding public deposits and maintaining financial stability. The plan is to introduce a specific regulatory framework by 2026. This framework will likely build upon international standards being developed by bodies like the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), which has been working on how banks should treat exposures to crypto assets. Here’s a breakdown of the key points from the initial announcement: Target: Banks and other prudentially regulated firms in the UK. Scope: Exposure to unbacked crypto assets (like Bitcoin or Ether) and potentially stablecoins and tokenised traditional assets. Timeline: Regulations expected to be in place by 2026. Rationale: High risk of loss for investors, potential for financial instability if banks have significant exposure without adequate safeguards. Approach: Described as ‘restrictive’ by the BoE. Why is the BoE Focusing on Banks Crypto Exposure Now? The move towards stricter UK crypto regulation isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several factors are driving central banks and regulators globally to address the intersection of traditional finance and crypto: Financial Stability Concerns: While banks’ direct exposure to crypto is currently relatively low, rapid growth or unexpected shocks in the crypto market could potentially spill over into the traditional financial system if not managed. The BoE’s primary mandate is financial stability. Consumer and Investor Protection: The volatile nature of many crypto assets and instances of market disruption (like the collapse of certain platforms or stablecoins) highlight the risks faced by both institutions and their clients. Bridging the Gap: As institutional interest in crypto grows, regulators need to ensure that the bridges built between traditional finance and crypto are robust and do not introduce systemic vulnerabilities. International Coordination: Regulatory bodies worldwide, including the BCBS, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and others, are discussing and developing frameworks for crypto. The BoE’s plans align with this global push for harmonized standards. Defining the Asset Class: Regulators are grappling with how to classify and treat different types of crypto assets, acknowledging the significant differences in risk between, for example, an unbacked cryptocurrency and a fully backed stablecoin or tokenised security. What Might the BoE Crypto Rules Look Like? While the exact details are yet to be finalized and consulted upon, the ‘restrictive approach’ mentioned by David Bailey suggests the regulations will likely be stringent. Based on international discussions and the BCBS proposals, potential elements of the BoE crypto rules could include: High Capital Requirements: For unbacked crypto assets (like Bitcoin, Ether), banks may be required to hold capital equivalent to 1,250% of their exposure. This is an extremely high requirement, effectively making it very capital-intensive for banks to hold such assets directly on their balance sheets. The idea is that for every £100 of exposure, a bank might need to hold £1,250 in capital, making it prohibitively expensive and therefore restrictive. This high capital charge reflects the regulators’ view that these assets are currently seen as carrying maximum risk due to their volatility, lack of historical data in a banking context, and operational/technology risks. Specific Treatment for Stablecoins and Tokenised Assets: Regulations might differentiate between different types of crypto assets. Stablecoins that meet certain strict requirements (e.g., fully backed by high-quality liquid assets, robust governance, redemption rights) could potentially receive lower capital charges, similar to traditional assets. Tokenised versions of traditional assets (like bonds or stocks issued on a blockchain) might be treated based on the underlying asset, provided the tokenisation mechanism meets regulatory standards. Enhanced Risk Management Frameworks: Banks dealing with crypto would likely need to implement sophisticated risk management systems specifically tailored to the unique risks of digital assets, including market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk (cybersecurity, technology failures), and compliance risk (AML/CFT). This would involve new policies, procedures, and potentially technology investments. Liquidity Requirements: Rules might be introduced regarding the liquidity treatment of crypto exposures, ensuring banks have sufficient liquid assets to cover potential outflows or margin calls related to their crypto activities. Disclosure Requirements: Increased transparency on banks’ crypto exposures and related activities will likely be mandated to allow regulators, investors, and the public to better assess the risks. This potential framework aims to ensure that if banks choose to engage with crypto, they do so in a way that does not jeopardize their own stability or the broader financial system. How Will This Impact UK Banks and the Crypto Market? The introduction of robust Cryptocurrency regulation UK by the BoE will have multifaceted impacts: For Banks: Increased Compliance Burden: Banks will need to invest significantly in compliance, risk management, and potentially new technological infrastructure. Limited Direct Exposure: The high capital requirements for unbacked crypto assets will likely make it uneconomical for banks to hold these assets on their balance sheets in large quantities. Focus on Other Crypto Activities: Banks might pivot to focus more on activities like providing custody services for institutional clients, facilitating payments using stablecoins (if regulated appropriately), or dealing with tokenised traditional assets, where the regulatory treatment might be less punitive. Strategic Decisions: Banks will need to carefully evaluate their strategy regarding digital assets and blockchain technology in light of the new rules. For the UK Crypto Market: Potential for Legitimacy (with caveats): While restrictive, having clear rules from a major central bank could paradoxically lend a degree of legitimacy to the asset class by integrating it into the regulatory perimeter. Institutional Adoption Pace: The restrictive capital rules for unbacked crypto might slow down direct institutional investment by banks themselves, though they could still facilitate client activity. Focus on Regulated Assets: There might be increased focus and demand for crypto assets that fit better within the regulatory framework, such as well-regulated stablecoins or tokenised securities. Clarity for Innovation: While rules can be seen as burdensome, a clear regulatory landscape can sometimes provide the certainty needed for responsible innovation within defined boundaries. Are There Challenges in Implementing This Regulation? Absolutely. Regulating a rapidly evolving technology like cryptocurrency comes with unique challenges: Defining and Classifying Assets: The crypto landscape is diverse. Creating rules that appropriately capture the risks of everything from volatile meme coins to complex DeFi protocols and stablecoins is difficult. Pace of Innovation: The technology and new use cases emerge much faster than regulations can typically keep up. Rules need to be flexible enough to remain relevant. Cross-Border Nature: Crypto operates globally. Regulations in one jurisdiction can have limited effectiveness if not coordinated internationally. Data and Expertise: Regulators and banks need to develop expertise and gather sufficient data on crypto market dynamics and risks. Balancing Innovation and Stability: The challenge is to mitigate risks without stifling potentially beneficial innovation in digital finance. What Should Stakeholders Do? Actionable Insights With the 2026 deadline on the horizon, various parties should start preparing: For Banks and Financial Institutions: Assess Current Exposure: Understand your direct and indirect exposure to crypto assets and related services. Monitor Regulatory Developments: Pay close attention to consultation papers and final rules released by the BoE and other relevant bodies like the FCA. Enhance Risk Management: Begin reviewing and potentially upgrading risk management frameworks to address crypto-specific risks. Engage with Regulators: Participate in consultation processes to provide feedback on proposed rules. Evaluate Strategy: Determine what role, if any, you want digital assets and blockchain technology to play in your future business model under the new regulatory regime. For Cryptocurrency Businesses and Developers: Understand the Landscape: Familiarize yourself with the evolving regulatory environment for both crypto firms (under the FCA) and traditional finance (under the BoE and PRA). Consider Institutional Requirements: If your business model involves interacting with banks or seeking institutional adoption, understand the constraints and requirements they will face. Focus on Compliance and Robustness: Projects and businesses that prioritize strong governance, transparency, and compliance are more likely to navigate the regulatory environment successfully. For Investors: Be Aware of Risks: The BoE’s stance reinforces the high-risk nature of many crypto assets. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Understand Institutional Access: Be aware that banks’ ability to offer direct crypto services may be limited or expensive due to the new rules. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with regulatory changes that could impact the market. The Benefits of Clearer Cryptocurrency Regulation UK Despite the ‘restrictive’ label, a well-designed regulatory framework can bring benefits: Increased Stability: By ensuring banks manage crypto risks appropriately, the system becomes more resilient. Enhanced Confidence: Clear rules can increase confidence among institutions and sophisticated investors looking to engage with the space in a regulated manner. Level Playing Field: Consistent rules help create a more predictable environment for all participants. Reduced Illicit Activity: While the BoE’s focus is prudential, broader crypto regulation (including AML/CFT rules from other bodies) helps combat illicit use. Conclusion: Navigating the Future of Banks and Crypto in the UK The Bank of England’s plan to introduce new regulations on Banks crypto exposure by 2026 marks a pivotal moment for the UK’s financial and crypto sectors. By adopting a cautious and likely restrictive approach, the BoE aims to safeguard financial stability against the inherent volatility of crypto assets. While this may present challenges and potentially slow down direct institutional holdings of unbacked cryptocurrencies, it also sets the stage for a clearer, more regulated environment. Stakeholders across the board must pay close attention to the development of these BoE crypto rules and adapt their strategies accordingly. The journey towards integrating digital assets into the traditional financial system is complex, but the BoE’s move signals a determined step towards establishing robust guardrails for Cryptocurrency regulation UK , ensuring that innovation does not come at the expense of stability.

The South Korean media outlet Newsway reported that unnamed Circle executives have held recent meetings with officials from the Bank of Korea and lawmakers from the National Assembly. The parties reportedly “exchanged opinions” on stablecoins in private meetings. The media outlet’s sources said they were not at liberty to reveal “the main agenda or topics discussed” at the talks.

But as USDT and USDC trading booms on South Korean exchanges, some appear to believe that Seoul should let financial institutions use USD-pegged coins in settlements. On June 10, the Democratic Party lawmaker and key Lee ally Min Byung-deok unveiled an amended version of his private member’s bill, dubbed the Basic Digital Asset Act. The revamped bill has several clauses pertaining to stablecoin adoption. The National Assembly held a public briefing session on the legislation on June 17.

The governor explained: “I think won-pegged stablecoins are necessary, and I am not against their issuance. [But] if won stablecoins are issued, it will be easier to exchange them for dollar stablecoins. And that will increase the demand for dollar stablecoins. In turn, that will make it difficult [for us] to manage foreign exchange operations.” Lee Chang-yong also opined that stablecoin adoption could also hurt commercial bank profitability. He concluded: “Once the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, the Financial Services Commission, and other relevant ministries have [reached a consensus], we plan to fine-tune policies by holding inter-ministerial consultations.” USDT Volumes Climb USDT trading volumes continue to soar on South Korean crypto exchange platforms.

While central bank announcements might seem distant from your Bitcoin or Ethereum holdings, the reality is that macro-economic policy, particularly concerning Fed interest rates and liquidity, has a profound inflation impact on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Let’s break down the Fed’s latest update and what its assessment of the economic outlook means for your digital asset portfolio. So, What Exactly Did the Fed Say This Time? The Federal Reserve recently concluded its meeting, offering insights into the current state of the U.S. economy and its policy stance. Here are the key takeaways: Growth Path: The Fed maintained its assessment that the economy remains on a steady growth path. This suggests resilience despite various global and domestic headwinds. Labor Market: The job market continues to be described as stable, with low unemployment figures. A strong labor market is often seen as a positive sign for consumer spending and overall economic health. Inflation: This remains the persistent challenge. Inflation is still above the Fed’s long-standing 2% target. This is a critical point as it directly influences monetary policy decisions. Data-Dependent Policy: The Fed reiterated that future decisions regarding interest rates will be heavily based on incoming economic data and evolving forecasts. This emphasizes flexibility rather than a predetermined path. Quantitative Tightening (QT): The process of reducing the Fed’s balance sheet continues as planned. This ongoing withdrawal of liquidity from the financial system is a key component of the Fed’s tightening policy alongside interest rates. In terms of forecasts, the Fed did make some adjustments: Metric Previous Forecast New Forecast (2025) GDP Growth ~1.8% (Hypothetical Previous) 1.4% PCE Inflation ~2.6% (Hypothetical Previous) 3.0% (Note: Specific previous forecast numbers were not provided in the source text, the ‘Hypothetical Previous’ are illustrative based on typical forecast revisions). The downward revision in the 2025 GDP forecast suggests a slightly less optimistic view on future growth, while the upward revision in the inflation estimate underscores the challenge of bringing prices back down to the target level. How Do Fed Interest Rates Really Affect the Crypto Market? Understanding the link between Fed interest rates and the crypto market is crucial for any digital asset holder. Here’s the simplified mechanism: Cost of Capital: When the Fed raises interest rates, it becomes more expensive for businesses and individuals to borrow money. This increases the ‘cost of capital’ across the economy. Impact on Risk Assets: Higher borrowing costs and potentially lower economic growth prospects tend to reduce investor appetite for ‘risk assets’. Risk assets are investments perceived as having higher potential returns but also higher volatility, such as stocks (especially tech stocks) and, yes, cryptocurrencies. Discounting Future Value: Investment valuations often involve discounting expected future profits or value back to the present. Higher interest rates mean a higher discount rate, making future potential profits (like those hoped for in early-stage tech or crypto projects) worth less today. Opportunity Cost: Higher interest rates make safer investments, like government bonds or high-yield savings accounts, more attractive. This increases the opportunity cost of holding riskier assets like crypto, as investors can get a decent return with less risk elsewhere. Therefore, a central bank committed to keeping rates higher for longer to combat inflation can create a challenging environment for the crypto market , potentially leading to downward price pressure or sideways consolidation as liquidity tightens and risk appetite wanes. Is Quantitative Tightening Still a Headwind for Crypto? Absolutely. While rate hikes grab headlines, quantitative tightening (QT) is the Fed’s other major tool for withdrawing monetary stimulus. Here’s why it matters for the crypto market : Reducing Liquidity: During Quantitative Easing (QE), the Fed injects money into the financial system by buying assets. QT is the reverse – the Fed allows assets on its balance sheet to mature without reinvesting, effectively removing money from the system. Less Money Chasing Assets: A reduction in overall financial system liquidity means there’s less readily available capital looking for a home. This reduced pool of money can impact asset prices across the board, including cryptocurrencies. Bond Market Impact: QT also affects the bond market, potentially pushing up longer-term interest rates, which further tightens financial conditions. Think of it like draining a pool. Even if you stop adding water (rate hikes slowing), if you’re still actively removing water (QT), the overall water level (liquidity) continues to drop. This ongoing withdrawal of liquidity from quantitative tightening acts as a persistent headwind for risk assets, including the crypto market . What Does the Updated Economic Outlook Tell Us? The Fed’s updated economic outlook provides clues about their future policy path and the potential macro environment for the crypto market . The revised forecasts suggest: Slower Growth Ahead: The lower GDP forecast for 2025 indicates expectations of a moderation in economic expansion. While not predicting a recession outright, slower growth can impact corporate earnings, consumer confidence, and overall investment levels. Inflation Challenge Remains: The higher inflation forecast for 2025 is a strong signal that the Fed believes bringing inflation back to 2% will be a longer, more challenging process than previously hoped. Policy Implications: Persistent inflation combined with potentially slower growth creates a difficult balancing act for the Fed. It reinforces the likelihood that interest rates may need to remain elevated for a significant period to curb price pressures, even if growth softens. This scenario, often termed ‘stagflation lite’ or a ‘higher for longer’ rate environment, is generally not favorable for risk assets like crypto. The updated economic outlook suggests that the macro environment will likely continue to be a dominant factor influencing the crypto market for the foreseeable future, driven by the ongoing battle against inflation and the implications for Fed interest rates and quantitative tightening . What Should Crypto Investors Consider Now? Given the Fed’s stance and the prevailing macro conditions, what are the actionable insights for those navigating the crypto market ? Challenges Highlighted by the Fed’s Stance: Sustained Macro Pressure: Expect the influence of macro factors (inflation, rates, liquidity) to continue driving market sentiment and volatility. Reduced Risk Appetite: A ‘higher for longer’ rate environment tends to dampen speculative enthusiasm. Liquidity Constraints: Quantitative tightening means less easy money flowing into assets. Potential Approaches & Considerations: Focus on Fundamentals: In a challenging macro environment, projects with strong fundamentals, clear use cases, and sustainable tokenomics may outperform purely speculative assets. Long-Term Perspective: Recognize that macro cycles are temporary. Focus on the long-term potential of blockchain technology and specific crypto projects rather than short-term price swings driven by Fed announcements. Risk Management: Revisit your portfolio’s risk exposure. Consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to mitigate the risk of investing a lump sum at a market peak. Diversification: While crypto is a specific asset class, ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified. Stay Informed: Continue to monitor key economic indicators and central bank communications. Understanding the macro backdrop is vital for making informed decisions in the crypto market . Inflation Hedge Debate: While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are sometimes touted as inflation hedges, their performance during recent inflationary periods has been mixed, heavily influenced by their status as risk assets sensitive to liquidity. Understand this nuance and don’t rely solely on crypto as your only hedge. This period requires a nuanced approach, balancing the exciting long-term potential of crypto with the realities of the current macro landscape shaped by the Fed’s fight against inflation and the ongoing quantitative tightening . Conclusion: Navigating the Macro Tides The Federal Reserve’s latest update confirms a picture of steady growth alongside persistent inflation, necessitating a continued tight monetary policy stance involving elevated Fed interest rates and ongoing quantitative tightening . This macro environment presents clear challenges for risk assets like those in the crypto market . While the Fed’s primary focus is on domestic economic stability, its actions have undeniable ripple effects across global financial markets, including digital assets. The updated economic outlook , particularly the revised inflation forecast, suggests that the ‘higher for longer’ narrative regarding interest rates may persist, keeping liquidity relatively constrained. For crypto investors, this underscores the importance of understanding the macro backdrop. It’s a time for informed decision-making, focusing on robust projects, managing risk, and maintaining a long-term perspective rather than being solely reactive to short-term price volatility driven by macro headlines. Staying educated on how factors like inflation impact the broader financial system is key to navigating the current landscape successfully.

46306375,https://timestabloid.com/?p=71538,1750289457,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Here’s Likely Worth of 5,000 XRP In 2035",https://timestabloid.com/heres-likely-worth-of-5000-xrp-in-2035/,"XRP remains a widely discussed asset in the cryptocurrency market, attracting both long-term supporters and skeptics. As of now, the asset trades at approximately $2.16, and despite periods of underperformance, many analysts maintain a long-term bullish stance. At today’s market price of $2.16 , purchasing 5,000 XRP would require an investment of roughly $11,000. Over the past year, XRP has experienced a significant increase of 351%, reflecting renewed market interest. Data from XRP’s ledger indicates that ownership of this volume of tokens is relatively rare. Out of the 6.566 million total wallets, only about 541,166 hold between 1,000 and 5,000 XRP. Most holders, over 5.3 million wallets, maintain balances under 500 XRP. These figures suggest that owning 5,000 XRP places an investor in a relatively small and distinct group. This exclusivity is likely due to rising acquisition costs. For instance, in November 2024, XRP was trading near $0.49. At that rate, 5,000 tokens would have cost only $2,450. In comparison, today’s price represents a 340% increase over just seven months. Analysts such as Edoard Farina of Alpha Lions Academy note that as XRP’s price increases, the barrier to entry becomes higher for retail participants. Despite its growth, many investors believe XRP remains undervalued. Market participants like crypto commentator John Squire have publicly stated that investors may regret not accumulating XRP at its current price level in the years to come. This perspective is informed by the token’s rapid rise from below $0.50 in late 2024 to over $2 within a short timeframe. Supporters argue that the project’s fundamentals, along with its utility in cross-border payments, could drive further appreciation. Some experts anticipate XRP eventually entering the triple-digit price range, and in extreme cases, even higher valuations have been proposed. However, these expectations remain speculative. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Projections Through 2035 Several market research platforms have released forecasts for XRP’s long-term value. According to crypto exchange Changelly , the asset may reach a minimum of $54.48 by January 2034 and potentially climb to $89.64 by the end of that year. A similar forecast for 2035 is provided by the analytics site Telegaon . If these estimates prove accurate, a 5,000 XRP holding acquired today for $11,000 could grow to a minimum of $272,400 or a maximum of $448,200 by 2035. That would reflect a return of approximately 4,050% on the original investment. Risk Considerations While bullish scenarios dominate the conversation, a few alternative outlooks offer a more conservative view. Notably, Bitwise has published a bearish forecast, suggesting the asset could fall to $0.13 by 2030. At that rate, a 5,000 XRP position would be valued at only $650. However, it’s worth mentioning that Bitwise’s more optimistic projection places the token at $30 within the same timeframe. The current cost of acquiring 5,000 XRP is substantial relative to historical prices, yet some investors view it as a long-term opportunity. Whether the token fulfills high-end predictions or not, its future value remains tied to broader market dynamics and adoption. As with all crypto investments, potential gains must be weighed against associated risks. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $304 billion, has failed to capitalize on rising demand from institutional investors. As Coinpedia has pointed out , the U.S. spot Ether ETFs have recorded three consecutive months of cash inflow, led by BlackRock’s ETHA . In the past two months, the U.S. spot Ether ETFs recorded a net cash inflow of more than $1.4 billion. As a result, the overall supply of Ether on centralized exchanges has gradually declined in the past two months to about 14.77 million coins at the time of this writing. Why Has Ethereum Price Not Mooned? Ethereum price has continued to consolidate in the last two months despite the palpable accumulation by institutional investors. In the past 7 days, ETH price has dropped over 8 percent to trade at about $2,529 on Wednesday, during the late North American session. How is ETH lower despite a record stretch of ETF inflows? Simple: record futs short pic.twitter.com/JIQcTzSsvr — zerohedge (@zerohedge) June 18, 2025 The main reason why Ether price has performed poorly in the recent past amid heightened demand from institutional investors is the overheated futures short position, especially on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Notably, hedge funds and other institutional players have been deploying heavy short bets through the CME futures, currently worth over $1 billion. As a result, the short bets have been outweighing the overall demand from spot Ether ETFs, leading to a significantly suppressed ETH price.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-18 23:44:13

Despite mounting uncertainty, BTC continues to hold firm above the $104K level, signaling strong buyer interest at key support zones. Bulls remain in control for now, but hawkish macro conditions—such as elevated US Treasury yields, persistent inflation concerns, and geopolitical turmoil—pose serious risks that could drive BTC below the critical $100K mark. Related Reading: Ethereum Golden Cross Approaching – Will History Repeat? The market is divided on what comes next. Some analysts point to strong fundamentals and institutional adoption as fuel for a massive bull run, while others warn of a deeper correction before any upward continuation. Top analyst Darkfost emphasized the importance of monitoring on-chain behavior during such periods of uncertainty. According to CryptoQuant data, realized profits on Bitcoin (7-day moving average) show no major warning signs. Current profit-taking activity remains below $1 billion—similar to levels seen following the October 2024 correction—indicating that investors are neither panicking nor overly euphoric. This muted profit realization could be a sign that long-term holders are still confident in the broader trend, setting the stage for an eventual breakout once macro conditions stabilize. On-Chain Metrics Signal Calm Bitcoin Consolidates As the conflict between Israel and Iran escalates, fears of a broader war—and the possibility of US intervention—continue to weigh heavily on global markets. Investors remain on edge, with rising oil prices and weakening economic confidence feeding into macro uncertainty. Yet, Bitcoin seems largely unfazed. Despite the heightened geopolitical tension, BTC continues to consolidate just below its all-time high, showing resilience that has both bulls and bears second-guessing their next move. Fundamentally, Bitcoin remains strong. Institutional adoption is steadily increasing, and exchange supply continues to decline, reflecting a trend toward long-term holding and off-exchange accumulation. In many ways, BTC appears to thrive in this environment of volatility and uncertainty. According to on-chain data shared by Darkfost, realized profits on Bitcoin—measured by the 7-day moving average (7DMA)—show no major warning signs. Current profit levels remain under $1 billion, a range not seen since the end of the October 2024 correction. Even during the recent ATH surge, realized profits stayed well below the January 2025 peak. This lack of aggressive profit-taking suggests that most investors are still holding strong, neither panicking nor rushing to sell. That restrained behavior is playing a key role in Bitcoin’s ongoing consolidation. Without a wave of profit realization, there’s little pressure to force the market down—yet no catalyst strong enough to push it decisively higher either. Monitoring these on-chain signals will be critical in the coming days. If realized profits spike or exchange inflows surge, it may mark the beginning of a new phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Strong Despite Israel-Iran Tensions – Weekly Resistance Begins To Crack BTC Technical Analysis: Key Support Being Tested The 12-hour chart of Bitcoin (BTC/USD) shows the asset currently trading at $104,292, just above a crucial support level at $103,600. This area, which corresponds to the previous all-time high set in late 2024, has become a key battleground for bulls and bears. BTC has repeatedly bounced from this level in recent weeks, and its ability to hold could determine the direction of the next major move. BTC failed to break through the $109,300 resistance, forming a series of lower highs since tapping the $112,000 level. This suggests a weakening bullish momentum and highlights the importance of current price action around the 50-period SMA, which is now acting as short-term dynamic resistance. Volume has remained relatively stable but showed slight upticks during recent pullbacks, hinting at cautious selling rather than full-blown capitulation. The 100-period and 200-period SMAs, currently sitting at $104,065 and $94,617, respectively, offer additional support beneath the current range, with the 100-SMA now directly aligned with the horizontal $103,600 level. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Range Support – Bulls Set Sights on Higher Levels If BTC breaks and closes below this demand zone with volume confirmation, it could trigger a move toward the $100K psychological support. Conversely, a strong bounce from here would reinforce the ongoing consolidation and keep the path open for another test of $109,300.

According to the analytics platform, those holding onto Bitcoin between six and 12 months are abruptly locking in massive gains at a rate exceeding all other cohorts, raking in a $904 million profit on Monday. “Last week, we highlighted how BTC wallets that held greater than 12 months were the primary profit-takers. But that trend has now flipped. [On Monday]: less than 12 months cohorts accounted for 83% of all realized profit. Six to 12-month holders alone realized $904 million – the second-highest daily profit year to date.” Source: Glassnode/X Glassnode says the same six-to-12-month investor cohort netted more profits two months ago. “Mid-cycle buyers (six-12 months) stepped up on June 16th with $904 million in realized gains. That’s just behind the April top in terms of daily profits – and shows that Q4’24 buyers are now distributing heavily.” Source: Glassnode/X However, the analytics firm says that the selling of Bitcoin for profits is slowing way down for long-term BTC holders. “Meanwhile, greater than 12-month holders realized just $324 million, a notable drop from the relentless profit realization in May or even the last week’s peak of around $1.2 billion.

Ethereum is back above $2,800, riding strong ETF inflows and a fresh wave of technical upgrades. At the same time, BNB is gaining steam with analysts calling for a breakout toward $750 and possibly $1,000 before the year ends. These big names are proving their staying power, but the most compelling upside may be coming from a newer project flying under the radar. That project is Unstaked ($UNSD) . The $UNSD presale is tied to AI agents built for income generation and on-chain activity. With a price under $0.011739 and over $10 million raised, Unstaked could be the best crypto investment before wider adoption hits. Ethereum Climbs Toward $3,500 as ETF Inflows Intensify Ethereum is back in the spotlight as it moves above $2,800, with growing momentum suggesting a push toward $3,500 may be on the table. Daily ETF inflows topping $125 million and continued whale accumulation are fueling the rise. ETH has also broken out of a wedge pattern and is now holding support between $2,745 and $2,755, setting the stage for a potential move to $3,065. But this rally is not just about price charts. The Pectra upgrade, increasing stablecoin integration, and the launch of institutional products are reinforcing Ethereum’s position. Some year-end forecasts now range between $5,900 and $6,700, with the most optimistic aiming higher. With fundamentals and technicals aligning, Ethereum’s upward trend looks far from over. BNB Price Eyes $750 as Bullish Trend Holds BNB is staying firm near $651, and traders are watching closely as it approaches the next key range between $675 and $700. Analysts see a short-term move toward $754, with some setting a year-end high around $1,292. Support near $640 has remained solid, bolstered by strong EMAs and consistent buying pressure. Several factors are contributing to this outlook. BNB’s ongoing token burns, ecosystem upgrades, and cross-chain DeFi growth are keeping momentum alive. Some models are setting the 2025 average target near $926. If the market holds steady, BNB could be preparing for its next breakout in the coming weeks. Unstaked Sells 1.1B Tokens as $5 Forecast Gains Traction Unstaked has officially crossed the 1.1 billion token mark in its presale, and the numbers are turning heads. With over $10 million raised, this isn’t some low-effort meme coin surge. The traction is real, driven by Unstaked’s unique focus on utility through tokenized AI agents. These agents are built to drive community engagement and measurable on-chain activity, something few other projects can offer before launch. Currently in Stage 21, the $UNSD token is priced at just $0.011739. With the launch price set near $0.1819, the potential return stands at more than 27x. But that’s just the start. Long-term projections aiming for $5 are now entering the conversation, creating a possible 3000x upside for early participants. It is not just a crypto presale; it is a tech-backed system preparing for scalable adoption. Unstaked’s foundation is its Proof-of-Intelligence framework, which tracks and rewards the performance of each AI agent on-chain. These agents are designed for use across Telegram, Discord, and X, giving businesses and communities a new way to automate growth while maintaining control. With no coding needed, the barrier to entry is low, and the functionality is real. Unstaked is positioning itself as a next-gen AI project with product-first traction. With 1.1 billion tokens already sold, this could be one of the most overlooked yet best crypto investments before broader attention catches up. In Summary Ethereum’s surge above $2,800 and the bullish BNB outlook near $1,000 are setting the tone for what could be a major market breakout. Both coins are backed by strong fundamentals and ongoing inflows, signaling that big moves are still on the table. But if the goal is outsized upside, Unstaked offers something those charts do not. With 1.1 billion tokens sold, a price of $0.011739, and a launch forecast near $0.1819, the setup is hard to ignore. As Unstaked’s AI agent system goes live, it is not just joining the momentum, but it could lead it. This might be the best crypto investment before the crowd arrives.

But unlike these projects that hinge on broader trends and social chatter, Web3 ai is already delivering results. Currently priced at $0.000443 in Stage 9, WAI gives access to several functional AI tools. The project is confirmed to list at $0.005242. That gives early buyers a steep edge. With over $8 million raised so far, Web3 ai stands out as a platform with real products and ongoing development. Shiba Inu Holds Ground, Awaits Directional Clarity SHIB remains range-bound, holding above its support at $0.0000107 while facing resistance near $0.000014. Repeated failures to clear resistance have trapped the token in a tight downtrend, leaving traders cautious. The weekly MACD indicator has shown minimal change, reflecting a quiet market. However, this flat movement could be a calm before a push. If the price jumps above $0.000014 with solid volume, SHIB may head toward $0.000016. Current chart positioning allows risk-managed trades. Those entering near support may benefit from placing tight stops while keeping an eye on volume changes. The next move depends on whether SHIB builds upward strength or continues sideways. ADA Stays Strong Near $0.66 as $0.70 Target Comes Into View Cardano (ADA) is currently trading around $0.66 after bouncing from key support at $0.65. This level is considered vital by market watchers. A hold here could see a push toward $0.70, while a slip could lead to a drop near $0.60. The asset dropped from its recent peak in April but has since shown stability. Low volatility and firm support suggest that ADA might be ready for a rebound. Its addition to Nasdaq’s crypto index may also lend strength. ADA appeals to those tracking technical setups and upcoming developments. Watching the $0.65 area closely might offer an early position before a potential breakout gains steam. Web3 ai at $0.000443 Could Be the Dark Horse of 2025 WAI, the native currency of Web3 ai, is now priced at $0.000443 in Stage 9. It’s already locked in a listing price of $0.005242, giving those who enter early a major advantage. More than $8 million has flowed into the project so far. Each WAI purchase connects users to several helpful tools. These include a risk simulator using real-world models, a DeFi pool analyser ranked by safety, a contract scanner to detect scams, and many more features designed to aid crypto users. Every interaction reduces WAI in circulation, which adds built-in scarcity to the system. Web3 ai has reached this stage without relying on marketing stunts or celebrity tie-ins. Its real strength lies in what it offers out of the box. If usage grows, its pricing may rise rapidly. Those who missed early entries in top coins may see Web3 ai as their next shot. But the offer remains until the Stage 9 slots are filled. Web3 ai Changes the Game by Replacing Guesswork With Tools Many traders still compare SHIB’s support levels with ADA’s upside potential. But both rely heavily on the market’s mood and future events. SHIB’s progress is tied to social trends, and ADA’s price path depends on regulation and listings. Web3 ai removes uncertainty. Every scan, tool use, or insight burns WAI, trimming supply. Buying at $0.000443 opens access to several useful tools, with a listing already planned at $0.005242. With over $8 million already raised, this is one of the few projects ready to deliver results.

The growing demand for alternative financial tools in post-conflict regions made Binance’s entry into the Syrian market strategic. The lifted sanctions created a rare but temporary legal window for international platforms to engage with Syria’s recovering financial system. Traditional remittance channels in the country remain expensive, unreliable, or inaccessible for most citizens. After years of civil war and under new transitional leadership, Syria still lacks a strong banking infrastructure. However, this fast entry by private tech firms raises concerns about whether cryptocurrency can be a positive force for rebuilding in sanctioned or recovering nations or sets a dangerous precedent where corporations, not governments, fill the power and policy void. Binance goes all-in on Syria with full product rollout Binance didn’t just dip its toes into the Syrian market; it launched the full package. Starting June 12, 2025, Syrians gained access to nearly every major product that Binance offers worldwide. This includes spot trading with over 300 cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), BNB, XRP, SHIB, DOGE, TON, and BCH. They can also use futures trading to speculate on price movements as traders in other regions. Binance’s Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading platform now supports the Syrian Pound (SYP). It allows users to buy and sell crypto directly in their local currency without going through foreign exchange or middlemen. In addition, Binance is running a zero-fee promotion for all SYP P2P trades from June 16 to July 12, 2025, to lower barriers for people testing the platform for the first time by allowing them to complete trades without paying transaction fees. The company also launched its Earn programs in Syria to help people grow their wealth in an environment where traditional banks have either failed or vanished altogether by allowing them to stake or lock their crypto holdings in exchange for rewards. Moreover, Syria has over 13 million citizens living in the diaspora who can now use Binance Pay to send money home quickly and with lower fees than traditional remittance services. Binance also introduced Arabic-language educational content to build financial literacy and bring in a broader population, including those using crypto for the first time. However, Binance says it applies a “robust, globally standardized compliance framework” to every country it operates in, and every Syrian must go through identity verification before using the platform to prevent illegal activity such as money laundering, terrorism financing, or fraud. The company is planting its flag in a country that has long been excluded from the global financial system because the launch includes every major product live and ready for users without usage caps, feature restrictions, or waitlists. Binance seizes post-regime opportunity in Syria Binance took advantage of the rapid political and economic changes that reshaped Syria almost overnight. The fall of the long-standing Assad regime in December 2024 happened in a matter of weeks, and a transitional government led by HTS (Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham) quickly stepped in with promises of democratic reforms and renewed international cooperation. On May 23, 2025, the United States lifted many sanctions that had isolated Syria’s economy for over a decade. This includes a 180-day temporary waiver under the Caesar Act that allowed legal financial transactions with the Syrian Central Bank and various institutions. The European Union also removed most of its economic restrictions on Syria just days later, on May 28, to support its reconstruction and reintegration into the global economy. International businesses saw these policy changes as a rare and immediate window to re-enter a market that had been closed off and criminalized for years. Digital assets and decentralized finance became the only viable solution for cross-border transactions as inflation had eroded the value of the Syrian pound. Many of the population in rural and recently liberated areas had no access to regulated financial services. Syria’s unusually high interest in cryptocurrency and a massive diaspora of more than 13 million Syrians scattered across the globe created a strong demand for low-cost, fast, and trustworthy remittance solutions that traditional banks and money services could not deliver. Binance’s speed, scale, and global recognition gave it a first-mover advantage in a country desperate for financial stability. It positioned the company ahead of smaller crypto platforms, regional governments, and traditional financial institutions. However, Binance’s dominating presence raises deeper governance concerns about whether the future of finance in countries like Syria, Venezuela, or Afghanistan should depend on the decisions of a single private platform. Should one company, no matter how advanced or well-meaning, hold the keys to remittances, savings, and local commerce in nations trying to recover from war, sanctions, or economic collapse? Bitget enters the Syrian market with full services Bitget, a fast-growing exchange known for its trading tools and community-driven platform, recognized the opportunity to tap into a newly opened market. It positioned itself as a serious alternative to Binance from the very beginning. The company launched full services in Syria on the same day as Binance and offered a competitive suite of features, such as spot trading, futures, copy trading, and earn programs. Bitget’s CEO, Gracy Chen, explained that their mission was to serve people who “need crypto the most”. She said the company’s entry in Syria is a commitment to real-world financial utility in countries dealing with inflation, instability, and limited access to banking services. Binance’s early advantage still outweighed Bitget’s aggressive entry, but its presence, and possibly others, means Binance will need to innovate faster, expand its services more thoughtfully, and maintain high standards for security and education if it wants to retain its lead. We may soon see platforms like OKX, Bybit, or even Coinbase looking to enter markets that were once considered off-limits due to legal complexity or reputational risk. They will likely have to adopt clearer compliance policies to meet the expectations set by early movers. Countries with partial sanctions, large diaspora populations, or weak banking sectors across the Middle East and North Africa, like Lebanon, Iraq, or Yemen, may also explore crypto adoption more seriously if Syria’s crypto re-entry proves successful.

In a video interview on Wednesday on platform X, Bessent stated that stablecoins could help reduce global financial risk and strengthen the US dollar’s dominance. He explained that stablecoins have the potential to become one of the largest purchasers of the US Treasury, thereby reinforcing the dollar’s position in the global economy. He said that this could significantly boost global demand for US government debt, adding that there was a strong possibility crypto could ultimately be the key factor in securing the dollar’s long-term supremacy. His remarks came a day after the US Senate approved historic stablecoin legislation . The bill aims to establish a national set of regulations for stablecoin issuers and standards for licensing and compliance. Now, the House of Representatives will have to decide whether to consider the Senate bill or move forward with its own, which made its way through the House Financial Services Committee earlier this year. Whichever of these prevails, President Trump has been very clear that he wants legislation done and on his desk by August. So they see crypto, particularly stablecoins, as a strategic innovation that can entrench American financial leadership in the digital age. Exploding stablecoin market on the horizon, Bessent confirms With major traditional financial institutions poised to enter the stablecoin market, firms like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, along with some prominent voices, including Bessent, see the stablecoin market as set to grow into the trillions of dollars. And this is just the start, says Bessent. Last week, he forecasted stablecoins backed by US dollars might achieve a total market capitalization of over $2 trillion by the next three years, nearly a ten-fold increase from the reported current market cap of around $240 billion, according to information from The Block. Bessent emphasized that the issue extended beyond just crypto, saying it was about constructing the financial infrastructure for the next generation of the global economy, an infrastructure built around the US dollar. Tether, which is based in El Salvador, is the market leader with its stablecoin. Yet Bessent thinks American financial institutions, with an assist from the policy front, will soon lead a world similar in size to the one in which WeWork aspires to play a driving role. He stated that US-based stablecoins could become the foundation of global digital payments. According to him, they have the potential to democratize access to US dollars, increase demand for Treasuries, and extend American financial influence across the internet. Biden gets roasted for his crypto neglect Bessent also used the opportunity to hit the former president, Joe Biden administration’s crypto policy, which many in the industry thought was overly regulatory. Asked whether the Biden administration had “constrained” the crypto sector, Bessent countered that “constrain” was too mild a term; the administration effectively had tried to make it extinct. Instead, he accused the Biden-era regulators of ignoring innovation and creating uncertainty, sending companies, talent, and capital overseas. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) were the target of constant criticism by the Biden administration for their regulatory strategy, their industry-derided “regulation by enforcement” in particular. It left a lot of crypto projects and exchanges operating in a legal gray area without much clarity. The contrast under Trump is stark. His administration has suggested a willingness to work with the crypto industry and a desire to develop a future-focused regulatory regime that safeguards consumers without squelching innovation. Bessent is among several other crypto-friendly Trump recruits to join other officials to fulfill a broader mandate to make the US a worldwide center for the innovation of digital assets.

It’s testing the $0.168 area for a second time since mid‑April. A clear break could send the meme coin spinning lower. Bulls and bears are watching every tick. Related Reading: Record‑High Ethereum Open Interest Signals Institutional Confidence Key Support Under Scrutiny According to crypto expert Ali Charts, Dogecoin fell roughly 30% from its mid‑May high. That slide brought it down to the same $0.168 mark that held as support last April. If prices drop below that level on a weekly close, there are hardly any bids to slow the fall. Below $0.168 lies what traders call a “gap area,” where past buying activity was sparse. That could open the door to steeper losses and fast moves. Cup And Handle Pattern Based on reports, the current chart forms part of a four‑year cup‑and‑handle setup. The lower boundary of a symmetrical triangle sits right where the handle meets its cup. A clean break above the triangle’s upper trendline would point to a target near $0.75. #Dogecoin $DOGE must hold above $0.168 to avoid a 30% price drop! pic.twitter.com/PDhqo7fpcK — Ali (@ali_charts) June 15, 2025 That projection comes from the 1.618 Fibonacci extension of the cup’s depth. Hitting $0.75 would mean a 350% gain from today’s levels. Momentum Indicators Signal Weakness Momentum readings have lost much of their shine. After a brief golden cross in May, the 50‑day moving average slipped under the 200‑day in early June. The MACD line is widening beneath its signal, hinting at longer‑term selling pressure. The RSI sits at 42, under the neutral 50 mark, and drifting lower. Under 50 on the RSI often points to more sellers than buyers. With those readings turning sour, bulls need a strong bounce around $0.168 to stay alive. ETF Decision Could Swing Sentiment All eyes now turn to June 15, when US regulators may rule on a spot Dogecoin ETF. Approval would let traditional money flow in from big funds. A thumbs‑down or a delay, on the other hand, could spark fresh sell‑offs. That decision could make or break the next leg of Dogecoin’s move. Related Reading: Trump Media Makes Moves On Bitcoin And Smartphone – What’s Next? According to CoinCodex data, Dogecoin has recorded 13 out of 30 green days over the past month, with price swings of about 10.57% on average. Their forecast pegs DOGE at $ 0.20 by July 18, a 17% rise from current levels. Market sentiment sits in the neutral zone, and on‑chain signals aren’t flashing clear buy or sell warnings. This week’s action around $0.168 will tell us if Dogecoin can steady itself. Holders and traders should watch volume, weekly closes, and that looming ETF call. If support holds, we may see a rebound. If it breaks, lower levels could come into view fast. Either way, Dogecoin is at a make‑or‑break moment—and everyone will be listening for the next big clue.

Ethereum is gaining traction from rising ETF inflows and strong chart setups. Meanwhile, Bittensor’s price outlook shows potential for a major rally by year-end. But while these names fight for market attention, BlockDAG (BDAG) has rolled out its plan for one of the biggest launches of the year. BlockDAG’s progress is not just talk. It’s in motion. CEO Antony Turner has launched a full six-week plan. It includes smart contract vesting, DeFi feature rollouts, active nodes, and daily progress updates. Half of the targeted $600M presale is already secured. With momentum building, BlockDAG is quickly being seen as a top crypto contender for 2025. $0.0018 Price Deal Still On as BlockDAG Closes in on $600M! BlockDAG isn’t planning a future launch; it’s already delivering. CEO Antony Turner laid out a clear six-week timeline: vesting contracts going live, DeFi tools roll out, nodes activate, and exchange listings. Everything is tied to a set schedule, and the results are showing. As of now, BlockDAG has raised $309.5 million, hitting the halfway mark toward its $600M presale goal. The presale is in Batch 29 of 45, with the regular price at $0.0276 per coin. However, the project has extended its frozen price of $0.0018 for just 3 more days, creating a final window to grab early access. More than 22.8 billion BDAG coins have been sold, and over 18,000 X1 mining devices have already been claimed. That early traction helped Batch 1 buyers see a 2,660% return based on the current batch price. BlockDAG is also set for listings across 20 exchanges, including five major Tier-1 platforms. Once Batch 45 wraps and the $600M goal is hit, trading begins. What makes BlockDAG stand out is its execution. The testnet is live, the hardware works, and app development is underway. Community nodes are prepping for full sync. Everything is happening ahead of launch, not after. This isn’t a plan waiting for funding, it’s a system already operating. With the price still at $0.0018 for now, this could be one of the last real entry points before the public listing. If the pace continues, BlockDAG may be one of the biggest launches of 2025. Strong ETF Flows Push ETH Closer to $3K Ethereum is building real momentum, and the signs are clear. Over $528 million entered ETH spot ETFs this week alone, led by names like BlackRock. ETH futures open interest has surged to $41 billion, a major show of confidence from traders. Technically, multiple bullish patterns have formed, golden cross, a bullish flag, and cup-and-handle setups are all flashing green. ETH has stayed strong above $2,500, and if it breaks $2,750, it could head for $3,000 or even $4,100. The Pectra upgrade adds more strength to Ethereum’s case, and its dominance in DeFi and stablecoins isn’t slowing. Analysts believe ETH could jump 35% if it breaks the $2,800 mark with enough volume. Although RSI and MACD indicators show mixed signals, the bigger picture remains positive. With strong inflows, steady charts, and on-chain activity growing, ETH could be one of the best-performing cryptos heading into Q3. Bittensor Builds Momentum in AI Market Bittensor (TAO) is building a solid case for a major breakout later this year. The current price sits around $355–$365, but if TAO breaks through the $450–$472 range, analysts say $500+ is likely next. Forecasts for August and September place TAO at $449 or higher, while some end-of-year projections go as far as $1,100. Daily volumes are holding above $70 million, showing that interest is steady. But the bigger story is TAO’s role in the decentralized AI space. Its subnet growth and increased attention from large players are pushing expectations up. Looking ahead to 2030, some long-term models place TAO beyond $3,000. In the short term, the outlook remains positive, especially if it holds support and the AI theme continues to gain momentum. Of all the AI-linked cryptos out there, TAO has one of the clearest paths to long-term upside. Final Thoughts Ethereum continues to show strength, backed by over $528 million in ETF inflows and solid chart patterns that suggest a possible move above $2,800. If momentum holds, ETH could target $3,000 or even $4,100 in the coming months. Bittensor is also on watch, with projections pointing to a breakout past $1,000 by year-end if key resistance levels are cleared. But while those two are setting up for potential runs, BlockDAG is already delivering. With $309.5 million raised, 22.8 billion coins sold, and over 18,000 miners already in circulation, it’s not just talk, it’s execution. The six-week rollout is in progress, DeFi tools are ready, and 20 exchanges are already locked in. The frozen $0.0018 offer still stands for four more days. If there’s a project that’s turning heads before launch, it’s BlockDAG.

(CSE: HODL), a Canadian company that successfully implemented a Solana (SOL) treasury plan, has filed Form 40-F with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company plans to register its securities with the agency and list on the Nasdaq Exchange under the ticker symbol STKE. The Form 40-F is a requirement by the U.S. SEC for Canadian companies seeking to register securities for trading in the United States market. The crossover to the U.S. market will help SOL Strategies grow exponentially in the coming years fueled by the mainstream adoption of crypto assets. Following the announcement , HODL stock gained over 4.3 percent on Wednesday to close the day trading at $2.38. Expected Impact on Solana Market As Coinpedia previously reported, Sol Strategies ditched its Bitcoin holdings to strengthen its Solana stash. By the end of May, SOL Strategies reported an additional acquisition of 26,478 SOL for $4.7 million, thus increasing its net holding to about 420,355 SOL coins. In Canada, Sol Strategies filed a preliminary short-form base shelf prospectus with the securities regulator to issue up to $1 billion in the next two years. The company announced that it plans to strengthen its Solana holdings through leveraging the equity market. As a result, its entrance into the U.S. market will significantly strengthen its bid to purchase Solana coins. The company will join DeFi Development Corp.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. South Korea has long been known for its outsized influence on altcoin markets, from the XRP mania that drove a 400% rally last year to the present-day obsession with a token that proudly calls itself USELESS. The $ USELESS phenomenon has ties to South Korean KOLs, Bradley Park, a Seoul-based analyst with DNTV Research, told CoinDesk in an interview. At the center of everything is Yeomyung, a Korean KOL and liquidity provider who aped into USELESS early, held through a 50% drawdown, and is now sitting on serious paper gains. “He made big profits during the Trump coin run, and with USELESS, he also earned from [providing liquidity] early on and is now just holding,” Park told CoinDesk. “They’re all just waiting for a CEX listing, because without it, there’s no real way to exit.” Park tracked Yeomyung’s wallet activity and noted that his early conviction has inspired copy-trading among Korean retail investors. Even wallets tied to insiders on Solana’s Jupiter JUP are holding. The rise of USELESS reflects a broader evolution in Korean market behavior. “I truly think Korean users in this market are no longer just exit liquidity,"" he said. ""They’re starting to understand the market and are evolving into real global players.” Another character in this story is Bonk Guy , an early promoter of BONK , who reappeared to tweet enthusiastically about USELESS after the price rebounded, though some Korean traders, including Park, have questioned his sincerity. “Bonk Guy was the first to shill LetsBONK,” Park said. “But after the price collapsed, he went silent. Now that USELESS is bouncing back, he’s suddenly showing interest again.” Park pointed to the rise of Hyperliquid, Kaia, and now Solana-based memecoins like USELESS as evidence that Korea is no longer a secondary market. While XRP’s rally was underpinned by legal clarity in the U.S. and narratives about Trump-era deregulation, USELESS feels less like chaos for chaos’s sake and more like a reflection of where attention, and exhaustion, is flowing in today’s market, Park said. With no roadmap, no utility, and no pretense of building something bigger, it taps into a kind of memetic disillusionment: a collective shrug at traditional crypto promises, and an ironic bet on nothingness that, paradoxically, appears to be more honest than many tokens claiming to change the world. Trump Endorses GENIUS Act President Donald Trump on Tuesday endorsed the GENIUS Act in a Truth Social post following its bipartisan passage in the Senate, calling it a major step toward U.S. leadership in the digital asset sector. Trump urged the House of Representatives to pass the bill “lightning fast” and without amendments, stating it should be sent to his desk with “no delays, no add-ons.” The message signals strong executive support for the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, which introduces reserve and compliance requirements for dollar-backed stablecoin issuers and marks the first major piece of crypto legislation to clear the Senate. Trump framed the legislation as key to enabling “massive investment” and “big innovation,” positioning the U.S. as a global leader in digital assets. While the bill passed the Senate with significant bipartisan backing, its fate in the House remains uncertain. Democratic lawmakers are weighing potential amendments, including stricter oversight for foreign-issued tokens and limitations on potential issuers. However, the bill isn't without its critics. In a recent CoinDesk editorial , Georgetown University finance professor James J. Angel argues that the GENIUS Act is a flawed piece of legislation because of fragmented oversight by 55 regulators, redundant processes, exclusion of interest-bearing stablecoins, and inefficient joint rulemakings. News Roundup: Coinbase Unveils Coinbase Payments for Merchants Coinbase (COIN) unveiled Coinbase Payments on Wednesday, CoinDesk previously reported , a new merchant-focused payments stack built on its Ethereum layer-2 network Base. The product allows global ecommerce platforms like Shopify to accept USDC 24/7 without needing blockchain expertise, using tools like a gasless stablecoin checkout, an ecommerce API engine, and an onchain payments protocol. Coinbase said the system is designed to replicate traditional payment rails while lowering costs and offering always-on settlement. The launch positions Coinbase alongside fintech firms like Stripe and PayPal in the race to modernize payments with blockchain infrastructure. It also deepens its partnership with USDC issuer Circle (CRCL), whose shares jumped 25% on the news, while Coinbase rallied 16%. Coinbase says stablecoins processed $30 trillion in transactions last year, tripling from the year prior, and it's betting that programmable, dollar-pegged payments will continue to disrupt the global financial stack. Market Movements: BTC : Bitcoin rebounded above $105,000 in a V-shaped recovery despite escalating Israel-Iran tensions, with strong ETF inflows and key support at $103,650 highlighting institutional confidence amid market volatility, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data. ETH: Ethereum rebounded 4% to hold above $2,500 despite Middle East tensions, with record-high staking and accumulation signaling growing investor conviction amid market volatility. Gold: Gold slipped 0.19% to $3,383.11 after the Fed held rates steady at 4.25–4.5%, with Chair Powell signaling no imminent policy changes and emphasizing continued economic strength despite trade tensions. Nikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.27% on Thursday as Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed, weighed down by the Fed’s rate pause and ongoing Israel-Iran tensions. S&P 500: The S&P 500 dipped 0.03% to 5,980.87 after the Fed held rates steady, with Chair Powell signaling a wait-and-see approach amid uncertainty over Trump’s tariffs.

Waiting too long can be the difference between a 2x return and a 30x gain. In this article, we will explore projects that hold potential for gains of over 3,000%. One of them, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , looks especially promising. The project is currently in the presale phase, which means there is potential for massive upside. This is especially so since the project is built on utility, and not merely hype. The projects on this list are built for long-term gains, allowing investors to use the trusted buy-and-forget strategy. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin (BTC) has been an impressive project when it comes to returns. Over the past decade, its value has grown over 100x. While it is trading close to its most recent all-time high, many investors believe it has potential for gains in the future. One of the main things going for Bitcoin (BTC) is that it was the first crypto coin in the world. As such, it is the most well-known and is now considered to be digital gold by many in the crypto world. At the current price of over $100,000, analysts forecast that it could rise to $150,000 by the end of 2025. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is forecast to offer even bigger returns for investors. As such, for investors looking for new opportunities for growth, MUTM tokens could be a better option. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Massive Growth Potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project that has received a wave of interest recently from investors looking to extend their gains from the recent bull run. Analysts forecast that MUTM tokens could rise by 2,765% in the upcoming altcoin bull run. For context, a $1,700 investment in the presale could grow into $47,005, based on those projections. That is a massive return that no investor wants to miss. On top of these positive projections, Mutuum Finance has organized a $100,000 giveaway . In the ongoing giveaway, the team plans to give ten lucky winners $10,000 each for participating in the presale. To qualify for this giveaway, you only need to make a $50 purchase in the ongoing presale. The MUTM Token Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of its presale. Tokens in the current phase of the presale are going for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. The presale has raised over $10.7 million from around 12,100 investors so far. That figure is expected to keep climbing as word spreads about the analysts’ forecasts. Over 38% of the presale tokens set aside for phase 5 have already been sold, a signal of the high interest in this project. Besides the positive forecasts, another major driver of the presale is the CertiK audit. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a Token Scan Score of 80 from CertiK, which has been a source of trust for the project. A CertiK audit is so important that many investors will not even consider a project if it has not undergone one. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) understood the importance of trust-building, and they made sure to submit their code for CertiK auditing early in the life of the project. To ensure that the project maintains the highest levels of security, the team plans to launch a bug bounty program when it goes live. This program will be an open invitation to security experts, ethical hackers, and blockchain developers to examine the code on their own and alert the internal team. The bug bounty will ensure that there are always eyes on the code in real time. Besides the code, the program will cover the user interface and all API services that will be used within the extensive ecosystem. Tron (TRX) TRX is the native coin of the Tron blockchain and has gained significant traction since it went live. Tron aims to build a decentralized internet and become a competitor to existing projects like Ethereum. The blockchain is touted for its high transaction speed and scalability. Additionally, it is known to have low transaction costs. One of the main downsides of this project is the high level of centralization. Besides that, its founder, Justin Sun, has been a source of controversy in the past, which has not been helpful to the progress of the project. Conclusion 2025 is an exciting year for the crypto sector, and June has brought with it new opportunities for growth. If you are looking to make gains of over 20x, one of your best bets is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Built with a laser focus on utility and ecosystem growth, this could be one of your top gainers this summer.

The reorganization will include an unspecified number of layoffs. The planned reorganization could result in thousands of layoffs , said someone familiar with the arrangements. The cuts are expected to be announced in early July, not long after the end of the tech giant’s fiscal year in June. Microsoft targets sales teams in new layoffs Microsoft sales teams are expected to be hit hardest, but it won’t be the only division affected by layoffs. Sources note that the timing and final scope of the layoffs could still change. The company has not yet commented on the matter. The move indicates that Microsoft is trying to streamline its operations as it plows tens of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence and cloud infrastructure. Executives have assured investors that they can keep a line on operating expenses even as they participate in the AI spending spree. The pending cuts come after the company laid off roughly 6,000 employees in May, trimming mostly engineering and product roles. Those layoffs left untouched most customer-facing positions, like sales and marketing. In April, Microsoft announced a change in sales strategy, telling employees it would lean more heavily on third-party companies to sell software products to small and midsize businesses. As of June 2024, Microsoft had a global workforce of about 228,000 people, 45,000 of whom worked in sales and marketing. The firm typically makes internal reorganizations at year-end. Microsoft said it regularly evaluates its structure to align with long-term growth plans. Meta cuts VR jobs while competing to poach AI talent with $100M offers Meta is also letting go of over 100 employees in its Reality Labs division, which manages virtual reality and wearable technology. The job cuts affect employees developing VR experiences for Meta’s Quest headsets and staff working on hardware operations to streamline similar work between the two teams. Despite the staff reduction plans, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says Meta has offered his employees bonuses of $100 million to recruit them, as the tech giant seeks to ramp up its artificial intelligence strategy. The alleged attempts by Meta to hire OpenAI staffers are the latest signs of a frenzy to hire top engineers to develop AI models, and they come at a time when the Facebook owner is working on building its superintelligence unit to catch up with competitors. Amazon is another firm that is planning the next round of layoffs. In a message to employees shared Tuesday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy talked highly of the company’s embrace of artificial intelligence tools across the company. He noted that the company will ultimately reduce the total corporate workforce as it gains efficiency over time. That is only slightly veiled corporate speak for “get ready to be replaced.” Jassy referred to generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that will change how the company operates, and said Amazon is already using it in “virtually every corner of the company.” According to Jassy, Amazon already has over 1,000 Generative AI services and applications in progress or built, and said, “That’s a small fraction of what we will ultimately build.” So it’s clear the company is all in on AI. Amazon said it would commit $100 billion to investing in AI technologies this year. Last year saw more than 150,000 job cuts across 549 companies, according to independent layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi . So far this year, more than 22,000 workers have been the victims of reductions across the tech industry, with a staggering 16,084 cuts in February alone.

This move will strengthen the firm’s push to serve the surging institutional appetite for cryptocurrencies. The sources said that the cryptocurrency prime broker also had informal talks with bankers and advisers to investigate the IPO process. FalconX is evaluating tapping public markets as it hunts for strategic partnerships and deals. However, it has not hired an investment bank. This is the first formal step to a public listing . Additionally, the company declined to comment on whether it has considered going public. FalconX considers going public in the wave of IPO filings in the crypto space Two sources revealed that FalconX has also discussed ways to boost its public image during the talks. This maneuver may help FalconX’s quest to raise fresh capital for its rapidly expanding company, which has recently increased the pace of its dealmaking. According to a person familiar with the matter, crafting a compelling narrative is crucial when preparing for an IPO, as it shapes how the company is introduced to potential investors. FalconX’s discussions are unfolding amid a surge of initial public offerings in the cryptocurrency sector. A record number of digital asset firms — including Bitcoin services provider Fold, crypto wallet company Exodus, and trading platform eToro — have gone public in 2025. Circle’s listing of approximately $1.1 billion on June 5 marked the largest crypto IPO in recent memory. These developments align with industry experts’ predictions that more digital asset companies will soon join the competition. For instance, in recent weeks, several crypto companies have revealed that they will soon try to access public markets. This happened just days after Circle’s blockbuster IPO, centralized cryptocurrency exchanges Bullish and Gemini filed for IPOs. At the same time, c rypto tycoon Justin Sun’s blockchain group Tron is set to go public in the United States through a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed SRM Entertainment, a toy company that will rebrand itself as Tron Inc. as part of the deal. The merger deal includes a $100 million equity investment from a private investor affiliated with Sun to establish a Tron treasury, with a total token injection planned to reach up to $210 million in TRX digital tokens, which the new public company will hold as a primary reserve asset, adopting a strategy similar to Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings. FalconX positions itself as a financial services provider for the next crypto generation FalconX was established in 2018 as a crypto-focused prime brokerage that allowed clients access to markets where they could trade directly on exchanges. It has since evolved into a trading firm and digital assets services provider. The company operates three verticals — a markets business, a custody and staking business, and a prime brokerage direct-market-access business. It is like a principal trading business or dealer, investing client capital. FalconX has also accelerated its f in the past year to underpin its broadening mandate across its business verticals. The deals put the company in a position to offer services to a broader range of clients as investors’ interest in crypto is exploding. Moreover, in early 2025, FalconX announced that it had purchased crypto derivatives-focused trading company Arbelos Markets to expand in the lucrative global derivatives space. A few months later, FalconX struck a strategic partnership to implement the international banking group Standard Chartered’s banking structure and foreign exchange capabilities into its businesses, enhancing its institutional arm. Following these achievements, Josh Lim, a FalconX co-head of markets, highlighted the company’s aim to be a financial services provider for the next generation of crypto. However, Lim declined to say whether FalconX has been exploring raising new funds. In late May, the company announced its agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald to tap into a large credit facility backed by Bitcoin. This is the “first step in a broader credit framework” that could make it possible for FalconX to cater to more traditional institutional investors, according to FalconX CEO Raghu Yarlagadda. Lim signaled they could acquire many possible partners or companies that offer services connecting their current business areas. Based on his argument, these are services that customers might otherwise need to combine from different sources outside their company. He says they aim to partner with or purchase businesses to help them fill those gaps.

Prosecutors have filed a civil forfeiture action targeting over $225 million in laundered USDT, part of a butchering scam with ties to a Philippines call center that ensnared Shan Hanes, the disgraced former CEO who embezzled $47 million from Heartland Tri-State Bank , a theft which was directly attributed to the agricultural lender's demise in 2023. According to the Department of Justice complaint , OKX, a crypto exchange, provided key information that helped identify an intricate network of accounts on the exchange used to launder the crypto proceeds. Scammers laundered funds by first directing victims to send USDT to 93 scam-controlled deposit addresses. From there, the funds were routed through as many as 100 intermediary wallets in a process designed to obscure the source of funds and mix deposits from multiple victims, according to the complaint. These laundered funds were then funneled into 22 primary OKX accounts and further shuffled across 122 additional OKX accounts, all linked by shared IP addresses, reused KYC documents, and coordinated behavior allegedly traced to a Manila-based scam compound, which the complaint names as ITECHNO Specialist Inc. In total, the DOJ says that approximately $3 billion in transaction volume was generated by this laundering network. Largest victims In total, the DOJ says there were 434 victims and has identified 60 of them who lost a combined $19.4 million. The largest of these victims was Hanes, with the DOJ identifying $3.3 million of the $47 million he embezzled in this seizure. Hanes embezzled the money between May 30, 2023, and July 7, 2023, according to both the DOJ complaint and the Federal Reserve’s report into the collapse of Heartland Tri-State Bank, one of the banks to collapse in the aftermath of the 2023 U.S. banking crisis. During this six-week period, Hanes initiated 10 wire transfers totaling approximately $47.1 million from Heartland Tri-State Bank, a small community lender focused on agricultural loans, to a crypto wallet he controlled. These wire transfers occurred between the bank’s quarterly regulatory reporting periods, allowing the activity to go initially undetected. At the time, Heartland was well-capitalized with $13.7 million in capital and $139 million in assets, but Hanes' actions depleted its liquidity, triggered $21 million in emergency borrowing, and left the bank with a $35 million capital hole, forcing regulators to shut it down in July 2023. According to prior reporting from CNBC , Hanes also stole $40,000 from the Elkhart Church of Christ, $10,000 from the Santa Fe Investment Club, $60,000 from his daughter’s college fund, and liquidated nearly $1 million in stock from a firm called Elkhart Financial to send to pig butchering scammers. He was sentenced to 24 years in prison in August 2024. The DOJ complaint referred to him as both a perpetrator and a victim. Seized crypto likely going to Fed stockpile Crypto seized by the U.S. government, such as in this case, is likely to be earmarked for a not-yet-established stockpile ordered by President Donald Trump. The bitcoin BTC reserve and the stockpile of other cryptocurrencies haven't yet been formally established, but the Treasury Department has been leading an audit of governmental digital asset holdings to determine what needs to be gathered. Once established, the long-term crypto holdings will likely put seized bitcoin in one fund and other types of tokens in another. The holdings in this case appear to be in significant amounts of USDT, according to the filing. It's unclear what funds may eventually be returned to victims, as only a relatively small percentage of those directly harmed have been identified.",Policy|Pig Butchering|crypto scams|Kansas|Department of Justice|News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-19 01:52:27

Expert Insights",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-xrp-dogecoin-and-op-the-smart-money-rotation-for-late-q2-2025-expert-insights/,"As Q2 2025 draws to a close, investors are watching three key altcoins — XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), and Optimism (OP) — for signs of a strategic pivot by institutional capital. With billions in value moving across networks and sentiment heating up, the crypto market may be on the verge of another major rotation. But while those assets are getting attention, crypto insiders are already positioning themselves for what many believe could be 2025’s biggest altcoin surprise. XRP: Institutional Confidence at All-Time High XRP has roared back to life, surging over 300% since late last year. As of mid-June, XRP is holding strong in the $2 range, with analysts targeting $2.80 to $3.40 by early July and some forecasting a leap to $5.00 under bullish conditions. The real story here? Institutional adoption. Major corporate treasuries, including Webus International and VivoPower, have poured over $470 million into XRP. Combined with the resolution of the SEC lawsuit and growing speculation around an XRP ETF, confidence is rising fast. With sentiment locked in the “extreme greed” range, it’s clear that XRP has captured the attention of the smart money — and momentum doesn’t appear to be slowing down. Dogecoin: Volatility and Whale Games Continue DOGE remains a volatile but fascinating play. Priced between $0.17 and $0.22, it’s riding waves of whale activity — with over $1 billion in large-holder accumulation in the last month alone. Analysts are split on its short-term future, with technical patterns like a falling wedge suggesting a breakout, while others warn of its dependence on celebrity-driven hype. Despite some bearish pressure, DOGE’s Fear & Greed Index remains in the “greed” zone, revealing quiet optimism among traders. Whether DOGE makes a run toward $0.25 in Q3 will depend on whether sentiment and ETF rumors translate into real market momentum. Optimism (OP): DeFi Growth and Layer 2 Dominance OP, the Ethereum Layer 2 solution, is gaining traction where it matters most — on-chain. Currently trading between $0.70 and $0.85, OP has seen an 8% jump recently as Ethereum upgrades like PeerDAS continue to improve scalability. DeFi activity on Optimism is rising, with growing Total Value Locked and strong protocol revenue suggesting deep fundamentals. Analysts believe OP could reach the $2.60 range in the coming quarter if it continues to absorb capital rotation from Ethereum’s base layer. Smart investors are already making moves. As one analyst put it: “When the market shifts from hype to infrastructure, OP leads the charge.” Why Early Buyers Are Betting Big on MAGACOIN FINANCE While XRP, DOGE, and OP dominate headlines, a growing wave of investors are turning their focus to MAGACOIN FINANCE — and for good reason. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as one of the most talked-about altcoins of 2025. Strategic analysts are naming it a top breakout pick, with momentum building rapidly across multiple investor networks. High-volume buyer interest is flooding in as thousands seek early exposure to what some say “may outperform every token this cycle.” This isn’t just another entry in the altcoin sweepstakes — MAGACOIN FINANCE is being recognized as a dominant force in the next leg of the bull run. Early signals point to an asset with long-term upside, growing recognition, and an investor base ready to take it to the top. Final Takeaway As the second half of 2025 begins, the crypto market is shifting. XRP is gaining traction with institutional support, Optimism (OP) is rising on strong DeFi growth, and Dogecoin remains unpredictable but active. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a standout. Early buyers are getting in, analysts are watching closely, and momentum is picking up fast. For many, it’s shaping up to be one of 2025’s biggest altcoin opportunities. Smart money isn’t waiting — crypto insiders are already in.

While rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East may be weighing on the asset, several analysts maintain that BTC’s long-term bullish trajectory remains intact. Bitcoin To Top At $205,000? In a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, contributor Carmelo Aleman pointed to the Bitcoin Yearly Percentage Trend as a signal of strong potential growth in BTC’s price through the rest of 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Negative Funding On Binance – A Classic Setup For A Short Squeeze? For the uninitiated, the Bitcoin Yearly Percentage Trend tracks BTC’s annual price performance since 2011, revealing a recurring pattern of three bullish years followed by one year of consolidation. This trend aligns closely with Bitcoin’s four-year halving cycle, helping investors identify long-term market phases beyond short-term volatility. Aleman shared the following chart to support his outlook for 2025. If BTC maintains the growth pace typically seen in the third year of this cycle, it could climb 120% in 2025. Such a surge would take BTC from $93,226 at the beginning of the year to as high as $205,097 – potentially marking the cycle top for this year. If realized, this would make 2025 the third consecutive year of gains and complete another full bullish cycle. This scenario suggests that BTC is currently in the final phase of its ongoing cycle, giving investors limited time to adjust their strategies to align with the market’s growth trajectory. Supporting this outlook, other cyclical metrics – such as Realized Cap – continue to post new all-time highs in 2025. Aleman concluded: The Bitcoin Yearly Percentage Trend is a tool that allows us to filter out daily market noise and reconnect with Bitcoin’s true cyclical nature. It reminds us that beyond micro metrics and short-term candles, Bitcoin adheres to a structural rhythm that repeats with striking consistency: three years of expansion followed by one of compression. On-Chain Indicators Suggest More Upside Beyond the Yearly Percentage Trend, several on-chain metrics continue to support a bullish case for BTC. Notably, both whale and retail BTC inflows to Binance have dropped to cycle-lows – often a sign that investors are holding in anticipation of further gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Following ABCD Pattern? Analyst Sees Path To $137,000 Whales also appear to be accumulating ahead of a potential breakout. According to CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha, Bitcoin whales withdrew 4,500 BTC from Binance on June 16 – a move historically associated with price rallies. Still, caution remains warranted. On-chain data indicates that short-term holders have been selling into the recent dip, which could temporarily suppress price momentum. At press time, BTC trades at $104,079, down 1.6% over the past 24 hours.

Developed to support multichain interoperability through its unique relay chain and parachains architecture, it was once heralded as a serious Ethereum competitor. As of mid-2025, however, DOT continues to hover just below the $4 mark, leaving many analysts and buyers questioning whether this price point can be sustainably broken. Polkadot’s core value lies in its flexible and secure framework, enabling the launch of customizable blockchains that can communicate seamlessly. It also supports shared security across its network of parachains. Despite the strength of its foundational technology, DOT’s price performance has lagged behind expectations in the post-2021 cycle. According to CoinCodex, Polkadot’s price forecast for 2025 is relatively flat. Projections show DOT ranging between $3.73 and $3.93, indicating that while volatility remains low, upside movement may be capped barring a market-wide resurgence. Monthly averages from June to December cluster tightly around the $3.75 to $3.85 zone, with only a marginal bullish tilt toward year-end. The data implies that without a breakout catalyst, DOT may remain trapped under its psychological ceiling of $4. Technical Factors Influencing Polkadot’s Price Outlook Polkadot’s lack of explosive momentum can be attributed to various factors. First, despite its growing number of parachains and ecosystem participants, the value accrual to DOT holders has not scaled at the same rate. Second, DOT’s staking incentives have been pressured by competition from Layer-1 protocols like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche, all offering aggressive staking yields and broader DeFi adoption. The relative underperformance of DOT is also tied to waning social sentiment. While developer activity remains strong—Polkadot consistently ranks among the top five most actively developed projects on GitHub—trading volume and on-chain user activity have seen declines. The disconnect between technical development and token price reflects a wider challenge: converting ecosystem growth into market value. From a technical standpoint, DOT needs to establish support above $4.10 and retest resistance at $5.00 to trigger a significant trend reversal. The RSI on higher timeframes remains neutral, while MACD readings suggest slow bullish divergence building. If broader market conditions improve—especially in the wake of potential U.S. crypto ETF approvals—Polkadot may rally beyond $4. However, without such catalysts, the price could continue to consolidate sideways. External Pressures and Regulatory Environment Polkadot’s price forecast is also impacted by the macro environment. Increased regulatory scrutiny, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, has placed constraints on many blockchain ecosystems. While Polkadot’s governance model and decentralized structure may offer some insulation, uncertainty around token classification and staking regulations could deter institutional participation. Moreover, Polkadot has yet to fully capitalize on mainstream narratives such as real-world asset tokenization or institutional DeFi. As a result, capital rotation has often favored other projects that more visibly align with current trends. For DOT to emerge from its $4 resistance trap, it may need to position itself more aggressively within the narratives dominating 2025’s market momentum. Why Polkadot Remains a Watchlist Contender Despite these headwinds, Polkadot continues to attract attention from blockchain developers and ecosystem builders. With over 500 projects built on Substrate and numerous parachains actively operating, the technical merits of the Polkadot network remain intact. The protocol’s focus on governance, scalability, and cross-chain compatibility ensures it still holds a foundational place in the future of Web3. Why does Polkadot make this list? Because even in a stagnant phase, it showcases long-term promise through deep infrastructure capabilities. DOT may be trading under $4 now, but as adoption accelerates and interoperability gains value in enterprise and public sector applications, its potential upside remains meaningful—especially for long-term holders. Qubetics: Leading the Crypto Innovation Frontier in 2025 While Polkadot consolidates, Qubetics is experiencing breakout momentum fueled by real-world tools and rising presale demand. At the heart of its innovation are QubeQode and the Qubetics IDE—two game-changing platforms tailored for the next generation of decentralized builders. QubeQode enables developers to write, test, and deploy smart contracts using a simplified visual interface. Unlike traditional code-heavy frameworks, QubeQode offers a low-code environment without compromising on customization or scalability. This empowers both seasoned developers and new entrants to build dApps, NFT protocols, and cross-border DeFi platforms more efficiently. The Qubetics IDE enhances this experience by integrating debugging, analytics, and token deployment tools into one cohesive ecosystem. Developers can simulate transaction flows, monitor network performance, and even auto-generate security audits before deploying on-chain. These features are helping Qubetics carve out a serious position among developer-centric platforms—and the market is responding accordingly. The broader utility of these tools is being seen in industries such as digital identity, cross-border remittances, and even decentralized VPN services. These are not just experimental concepts but active applications with enterprise partnerships in progress. By focusing on accessible development and real-world integrations, Qubetics is positioning itself as more than just a token—it’s a full-stack infrastructure layer for Web3. Qubetics Presale Performance: ROI Projections Fuel Excitement Qubetics is currently in Stage 37 of its crypto presale , priced at $0.3370 per $TICS token. The project has raised over $18 million, sold more than 516 million tokens, and attracted over 28,000 token holders. The pace of adoption reflects growing market confidence in its roadmap and tokenomics strategy. The presale is entering its final window with only 10 million tokens left at the current price. The listing price is set at $0.40, which offers a 20% immediate upside for last-minute buyers. This dynamic is amplified by a deliberate token supply reduction—down by 66% to just 1.36 billion tokens—designed to enhance scarcity and increase long-term price resilience. Qubetics allocates 38.55% of its total supply to the public, reinforcing its community-first model. This token distribution ensures that governance and value capture remain in the hands of users. A $1,000 investment could return $15,000 to $30,000 under bullish scenarios. At a future valuation of $10 per token, a $10,000 position could grow to $300,000. Early buyers, developers, and crypto analysts alike are watching this project as the leading presale of 2025. Qubetics combines next-gen development tools with a disciplined presale model, delivering both technical value and investment upside. As blockchain infrastructure evolves, Qubetics is showing what the next phase of adoption truly looks like. Final Thoughts Polkadot is a maturing Layer-0 giant refining its cross-chain strategy; While Qubetics is a rising force leveraging developer experience and community engagement to disrupt the market. Polkadot’s price outlook may appear muted, but its long-term positioning remains strong—particularly as interoperability and governance take center stage. Meanwhile, Qubetics is proving that real utility, when paired with smart economics, can drive exponential momentum even in a cautious market. For buyers and developers alike, 2025 is about identifying platforms that blend infrastructure with innovation. Join the Qubetics presale today.

Recently, Ripple filed a Supplemental Letter in support of its Motion for an Indicative Ruling, asking Judge Analisa Torres to reconsider parts of her earlier decision. In response, both Ripple and the SEC have requested that the Second Circuit Court of Appeals keep the appeals on hold for now. The SEC has been asked to file a status report by August 15, 2025. On social media, XRP supporters are openly expressing their disappointment. Many feel the lawsuit should have ended long ago, criticizing Judge Torres for not closing the case when she had the opportunity. However, former SEC official Marc Fagel stepped in to clarify the situation. He explained that Judge Torres already ruled last year that Ripple violated securities laws, ordering the company to pay a $125 million penalty and placing a permanent injunction against it. But since both Ripple and the SEC filed appeals, it has kept the case alive. “She did end it, ruling that Ripple violated the law and should pay a $125m penalty and be permanently enjoined. But then both parties appealed, and now they are trying to have her change her remedies order. That’s on Ripple/SEC, not her,” he wrote. Fagel explained that no one is purposely delaying the process. He said that there’s a motion pending before the court, and it takes time to write an opinion. The expert also reminded the public that this is a rare and complicated situation — possibly the first time the SEC, under new leadership, has tried to undo a court win. She did end it, ruling that Ripple violated the law and should pay a $125m penalty and be permanently enjoined. But then both parties appealed, and now they are trying to have her change her remedies order.

Known as the “Day of Great Expectation,” millions of Pioneers are hoping the Pi Core Team will finally speak up about the Global Consensus Value (GCV) and recognize it as the real value of PiCoin. Supporters of GCV have pushed for a value of $314,159 per Pi to represent belief, unity, and trust in the project. Although the Core Team does not officially endorse this, it is being promoted globally through events, particularly in Asia and Africa. A Community-Driven Vision GCV is a value set by the community, not by exchanges or market prices. Over 6 million small on-chain transactions show that people are already using this value in real trades. A recent poll showed that 99.1% of users support GCV. They claim that while the Core Team handles the tech side, like Mainnet and KYC, it is the users who are giving Pi real value through everyday use. According to them, if the Pi Core Team were to adopt GCV, it would not involve setting a fixed price for exchanges. Since GCV is meant to be community-driven, the Core Team would keep building the ecosystem and encourage more real-world use. What do I think about Pi GCV? Pi GCV is presented as a compelling and innovative approach to digital currency valuation. It distinguishes itself from traditional speculative models by emphasizing ""value in use"" and ""voluntary consensus within the community.""

Analysts like Dr Altcoin warn that without a major update, including a GCV discussion, the token could slide back to $0.40. On the other hand, even a small update or roadmap news could give the price and community sentiment a boost. We might still see Pi drop to around $0.40, especially if there's no major update on June 28th! @PiCoreTeam @nkokkalis @Chengdiao pic.twitter.com/DSbrChUEzN — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) June 17, 2025 Can GCV Turn Things Around? Pi Coin has had a tough time lately, as it is down 24% in the past month and more than 80% from its all-time high. With more tokens unlocking and no major news yet, the pressure is building. With the mainnet launch expected soon, updates on GCV, merchant tools, or mainnet news could change how people view the project and its future value. If the Core Team keeps silent, the impact could be severe as it could lead to mass sell-offs, and users losing interest. The community demands that the Pi Core team officially recognize the GCV as a show of respect for the millions of users who have supported the project over the years. Moreover, a leading Pi Network news account has also expressed frustration that if Pi2Day only brings Pi Domains and no big updates, many will be disappointed. They are urging the Core Team to launch long-promised features like smart contracts instead of just stretching out announcements over the years.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-19 02:55:41

In contrast, Lightchain AI is rapidly gaining retail interest as a project built for intelligent, scalable blockchain solutions. With its presale raising over $20.9 million at a fixed token price of $0.007, Lightchain AI is attracting a wave of buyers drawn by its unique blend of advanced infrastructure and practical utility. While BNB’s momentum slows, Lightchain AI’s organic demand continues to build, fueled by growing community support and developer engagement. This shift highlights a broader market trend where retail investors are moving toward projects offering genuine innovation and long-term growth potential. BNB Shows Limited Movement Amid Market Fatigue At the time of recording (2025/05/27), the price is around $680.80, up 0.95% over the previous 24 hours. While we’ve seen this slight gain, BNB trading has not been very exciting with the 661 and 690 range. Analysts believe this consolidation follows a break above a symmetrical triangle pattern that led to speculation of a move higher to come. The market seems to be showing signs of exhaustion according to the sentiment, as despite bullish on-chain metrics like growing decentralized exchange (DEX) volume and stablecoin activity on the BNB Chain, BNB is not catching up with the pace. Technical indicators suggest that BNB is trading above important moving averages, but has not been able to make a significant breakout above the $700 level, which indicates the market is wary. In this relevance, despite the bullish set-up of BNB, the lack of price volatility amid some broad market weariness indicates that traders have not yet found new narratives to push an extended trend. Lightchain AI Attracts Fresh Retail Attention Across Platforms Lightchain AI is attracting fresh retail attention across platforms as its Bonus Round continues to build momentum. With the token price fixed at $0.007 and over $20.9 million raised, new buyers are joining daily, drawn by the project’s unique blend of AI utility and decentralized infrastructure. Lightchain’s architecture features validator and contributor nodes for scalable computation, dynamic pricing for AI tasks, and gas optimization for efficiency. A $150,000 grant pool has been deployed to support dApps, APIs, and data tools, signaling strong ecosystem growth. The upcoming public repository release and Meme Launchpad are also generating buzz among first-time crypto participants. As exposure spreads across social media and forums, Lightchain AI is fast becoming a retail favorite in the current cycle. Don’t Miss Out on Lightchain AI – Future of Blockchain is Here!

Here’s whether they can sustain the momentum, according to social media data. Social Media Has Started Paying Attention To These Altcoins In a new insight post, the analytics firm Santiment has talked about some altcoins that have recently diverged from the rest of the market with notable price surges. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Enters Reversal Zone: BTC Dangerously Overvalued? Here are the coins in question and how their monthly returns have looked: As is visible above, these altcoins have managed to deliver sizeable profits during a period where the major assets have printed losses. Bitcoin (BTC), for instance, is down around 2% on this timeframe. Among the listed alts, two are particularly prominent in terms of market cap size: Hyperliquid (HYPE) and WhiteBIT Token (WBT). The former has seen a rise of 51.6% and the latter 59.2%. Now, can these coins sustain their runs? One hint can come from social media data. Santiment has shared two indicators related to social media: Social Dominance and Positive/Negative Sentiment. The first metric, the Social Dominance, tells us about what part of social media discussions related to the top 100 assets a particular cryptocurrency is responsible for. The indicator determines this by comparing the asset’s Social Volume, a count of the posts/messages/threads on social media containing unique mentions of the coin, with the combined Social Volume of the top 100 cryptocurrencies. The other metric of interest, the Positive/Negative Sentiment, basically measures the ratio between the positive and negative sentiments present among the social media users. To determine this, the indicator runs the Social Volume of an asset through a machine-learning model to distinguish between bullish and bearish comments. It then takes the ratio of the two to find the net situation on these platforms. First, here is a chart that shows the trend in both of these metrics for Hyperliquid: As displayed in the above graph, the Social Dominance of HYPE peaked at 1.5% in May, but has gone down since then, despite the price continuing its surge. Nonetheless, the indicator has remained at 1.25%, which is still a notable level. Alongside this high attention, the Positive/Negative Sentiment has stayed at around 3.75, which suggests social media users have been making almost 4 times as many bullish comments related to the altcoin as bearish ones. Historically, altcoins have tended to move against the crowd’s expectations, so an excessive sentiment in either direction has often proven to be a reversal signal. This means that an overly bullish mood can actually lead to a top for an asset. Considering this, HYPE may not be in the best position for continuing its surge, at least from the perspective of sentiment. Related Reading: XRP Bullish Signal: Shark & Whale Wallets Set New All-Time High While Hyperliquid has seen a bit of a cooldown in Social Dominance, WhiteBIT Token has just seen a huge surge. That said, WBT’s Positive/Negative Sentiment hasn’t budged alongside this Social Dominance explosion, although it remains at a notable level of 3.07. Based on the trend, the analytics firm thinks, “we likely will see its price make a second run after its local top that just occurred on June 15th unless FOMO begins to make an appearance.” HYPE Price Hyperliquid has seen a sharp decline since its peak on Monday as its price has come down to $39, a potential sign that the social media hype may already be biting back.

Take a look at the Avalanche (AVAX) price, which dropped from over $21 to around $19 this week, struggling to hold support. Pi Coin also took a sharp 35% hit, falling to $0.40 before a slight recovery. These fluctuations show just how unpredictable even popular tokens can be. While traders focus on charts, Gen Z is quietly mining BDAG in a completely new way. BlockDAG’s (BDAG) mobile-first X1 app allows users to mine using just their phones, no rigs, no energy bills, no stress. The app rewards consistency, not hardware, offering daily taps and streak bonuses for real crypto. With BDAG still in presale at $0.0018, it’s quickly becoming one of the most bullish altcoins for early adopters who are looking beyond the usual hype. Avalanche (AVAX) Price Dips Below $19: Can It Rebound? Avalanche (AVAX) has taken a hit recently, dipping below $19 after a sharp decline from its June $21 high. The drop, driven by broader geopolitical tensions and risk-off sentiment, has left the coin trading at around $19.20. However, key support zones between $20.25 and $21.15 could provide a temporary buffer, while resistance is building at $22 and $24. From a technical viewpoint, AVAX is currently trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, signaling potential weakness. The RSI is near neutral, leaving the market in a state of indecision. While some analysts predict a short-term bounce, others warn of further downside if market conditions worsen. Avalanche needs a strong catalyst, like increased network activity or market-wide recovery, to regain momentum. Pi Coin Price Drops 35%: Can a Binance Listing Revive It? Pi Coin saw a dramatic 35% drop on June 20, falling to $0.40 before slightly recovering to $0.58. This volatility was sparked by a significant token unlock and external geopolitical factors, triggering support between $0.40 and $0.55. Resistance is forming around $0.60 to $0.63, leaving traders on edge. Despite the rebound, uncertainty lingers as many users still face KYC and migration delays. However, the buzz around a potential Binance listing by June 28 is keeping hope alive. While some see breakout potential, others argue the hype is inflated. Pi Coin’s next move hinges on real-world adoption and market reaction: could this be the moment it breaks free from its downtrend? BlockDAG’s Mobile Mining Revolution: X1 App Makes Earning BDAG Easy! While many are still speculating about the next Bitcoin halving, Gen Z has already moved on to something simpler: mining BDAG directly from their phones. BlockDAG’s X1 app has revolutionized mining, replacing the need for expensive rigs and complex setups with a Proof-of-Engagement model. Users simply tap their phones daily to earn rewards, making the process feel more like a mobile game than traditional mining. With over 2 million users mining daily, the X1 app allows users to earn up to 20 BDAG just by engaging with the app. No tech skills are required, and there are zero gas fees or hardware headaches. The app’s gamified interface keeps users engaged, with streak bonuses and referral rewards amplifying earnings. Early users are already sharing screenshots of their growing BDAG collections, showcasing the success of this mobile-first mining experience. BlockDAG’s presale has raised over $309.5 million, with more than 22.8 billion BDAG sold. Currently in batch 29, the price is temporarily set at $0.0018, but this offer expires on June 20. After that, the price will increase to $0.0276, with a projected listing price of $0.05, offering early participants up to 2,670% ROI. For those following bullish altcoins on platforms like Reddit and Telegram, BlockDAG’s mobile mining angle is impossible to overlook. The simplicity, accessibility, and presale potential make it one of the most talked-about projects in the crypto space today. Moving Ahead The Avalanche (AVAX) price has struggled to regain momentum, pulling back below $19 after last week’s drop. Similarly, Pi Coin took a major hit, crashing 35% before settling around $0.58. Upcoming token unlocks and lingering KYC issues continue to add uncertainty. These volatile movements highlight the risks even with popular altcoins during turbulent times. While others are waiting for the next rally, Gen Z is mining BDAG with ease using the X1 app. With over 2 million users and a presale price of just $0.0018 until June 20, the upside is clear. This mobile mining revolution is already paying out, and the opportunity is now.

During the Risk Live Europe event in London, David Bailey, an Executive Director of Prudential Policy at the Bank of England, stated that the UK aims to implement more stringent regulations . Bailey indicated that banks will likely be encouraged to keep their crypto exposure low. The UK takes precautions to address financial instability in crypto-related banks Many nations have been trying to address financial instability resulting from crypto volatility by examining how connected their banks are to cryptocurrency. This particularly follows the 2023 collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate Bank, which had significant crypto-related clients. Addressing the Bank of England’s upcoming proposals on crypto exposure, David Bailey said it can be prudent to begin with stricter regulations while gathering data to determine whether those rules could be eased over time. He noted one example of this issue: how banks handled their investments in crypto assets, particularly ones with high price swings and where investors could lose everything. It is worth noting that the UK is trying to enact the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s disclosure framework for banks’ exposure to crypto . The committee said the framework should be in place by the beginning of 2026 to allow nations to assess risks. Additionally, the Basel Committee recommended that banks allow only 1% of their investments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Bailey stated that the UK would base its plans on the guidelines the Basel Committee had created. Meanwhile, the UK’s prudential crypto regulations will come as the country’s other financial watchdog — the Financial Conduct Authority — will soon roll out a new regulation for crypto. FCA lifts ban on retail investors’ access to ETNs The UK is changing its stance on crypto as the government looks to boost the economy and back the digital assets sector. In April, Britain released a draft of laws to regulate cryptocurrencies for the first time. This matched the United States’ strategy instead of following the European Union’s tailored rules for the industry. Earlier, Britain’s financial regulator revealed plans to lift a ban on consumers buying crypto Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs) but under certain legal conditions. Notably, to be available to individual consumers, the ETNs must be traded on an investment exchange approved by the FCA, according to the regulator. This marks a shift from the regulator’s earlier position, which barred retail investors from accessing the financial product. While the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) approved crypto ETNs for professional traders last year, it maintained a ban for retail investors, arguing that the products were “ill-suited” and posed significant risks of harm. The FCA gave a reason for this sudden shift in policy. According to a regulatory body, allowing retail investors to buy ETNs would help economic growth and competitiveness. David Geale, Executive Director for Payments and Digital Finance at the FCA, said the regulator is rethinking its approach to risk. According to Geale, lifting the ban would let people decide if a high-risk investment suits them, even if it means they could lose all their money. He addressed this as they opened up room for feedback on the proposal. Still, the watchdog noted that the ban on retail investors trading cryptoasset derivatives will remain.

Despite a surge in spot ETF inflows , stablecoin market caps, and positive regulatory developments in the U.S., the leading cryptocurrency by market value continues to trade directionless, fluctuating between $100,000 and $110,000. It's been a record 42 straight days of back-and-forth trading above the $100 mark, and the question is: Who has been selling BTC and quietly counteracting the ETF inflows amid mounting concerns about the U.S. fiscal situation ? According to Alexander Blume, managing partner at the SEC-registered investment adviser Two Prime, BTC is facing a unique crosswind of participant composition as it transitions from speculative buyers to long-term investors. ""Amidst the recent geopolitical turmoil, it makes sense that speculators and leverage traders are taking risk off the table. At the same time, new long-term investors are buying the dip,"" Blume told CoinDesk. ""It seems about right that we are currently at an equilibrium of these groups."" Blockchain data tracked by Glassnode shows that wallets with a history of holding coins for less than a year have recently increased their profit-taking. On Monday, these wallets accounted for 83% of the total realized profit. Furthermore, wallets holding coins for six to 12 months alone contributed $904 million to the selling pressure in the market, the second-highest year-to-date total. The selling by short-term holders follows an even more aggressive profit-taking operation by long-term holders in May and early this month. According to Glassnode, the realized profit of wallets holding coins for over 12 months reached a peak of $1.2 billion last week. Last week, this cohort realized just $324 million in profits. ""Long-term OG investors continue to sell into the steady ETF-driven demand, effectively absorbing inflows and keeping price action in check. This dynamic has led to a compression in volatility, but a breakout is inevitable,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research , said in a note to clients Thursday. Miners offload BTC Miners, or those producing bitcoin, have also been contributing to the selling pressure, according to data source IntoTheBlock . The balance held in miner wallets has declined to roughly 1.91 million BTC from 1.94 million at the end of May, indicating that these entities offloaded approximately 30,000 BTC in 20 days. ""Miners have to continually sell, and believe it or not, some long-term holders continue to sell gradually as they manage their USD liabilities. The key thing is volume - is it sold or bought on high volume? It is noise and speculative flows that can revert very quickly,"" Philippe Bekhazi, CEO of crypto platform XBTO, told COinDesk. Note that miners' share in total spot market volume is minuscule and has hit the lowest since 2022. Accumulation stalls for next-best alternatives Overall, the substantial accumulation by both whales and small addresses observed during bitcoin's initial run higher from the early April lows near $75,000 has stalled since prices broke into six figures. ""Those same accumulation patterns began to weaken once BTC breached $100k. The reason the price slowed down is likely due to the availability of next-best alternatives. Funding rates were rallying hard, and having delta-neutral positions earning 15-30% APY likely seemed attractive enough to de-risk on a directional basis,"" Benjamin Lilly, founder of Jarvis Labs, noted. The delta-neutral trades involve shorting perpetual futures and simultaneously purchasing the asset in the spot market when futures trade at a premium to the spot price. The non-directional arbitrage strategy enables traders to capitalize on price differentials while mitigating risks associated with price volatility. Jimmy Yang, co-founder of Orbit Markets, said that bitcoin maturing into a more stable asset class means it may not necessarily generate outsized returns. That has likely prompted some holders to divest into other assets. ""While the directional upside remains, investors can no longer expect 10x or 100x returns in a short period. As a result, we’ve seen some long-term holders begin to divest a portion of their BTC holdings to diversify into other asset classes such as equities, gold, and private placements — a move that makes sense from a portfolio allocation perspective,"" Yang told CoinDesk. What next? According to Yang, the market may not offer much excitement in the near-term, as the cryptocurrency continues to trade in tandem with equities and broader risk sentiment. ""Both asset classes are hovering near all-time highs, and if equities break higher, BTC is likely to follow. With the summer lull setting in, market activity is expected to remain subdued in the near term,"" Yang noted. Blume said that the BTC market may cool off a little, having seen prices surge from $75K to over $100K in the early weeks of this quarter. ""It’s also to keep in mind that Bitcoin rallied from 78k less than two months ago, so I’d expect a cool off anyway. It’s telling that the dips in price are quite shallow and are a sign of strength for the next leg up,"" Blume said. According to Thielen, the key levels to watch are $102,000 on the downside and $106,000 on the upside.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-19 03:25:13

On the daily chart, XRP has been stuck in a narrow range for about a week, bouncing between $2.15 and $2.35. Traders are watching closely to see which way the price might break next. Currently, indicators like the MACD show a flat trend, meaning there’s no clear strength from buyers or sellers. This suggests that the price could continue moving sideways for a little while longer. According to analysts, a key support level is at $1.79. If XRP falls below this point, it could trigger more selling pressure and weaken the current positive outlook for the coin. However, as long as XRP stays above this level, there’s still hope for a future upward move. The next important resistance level is at $2.34. A break above this price would be a positive sign and could signal the start of a new rally. For now, though, such a breakout isn’t expected unless there’s a major event in the market — like an important decision from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which often causes price swings across the crypto market. In short, XRP is currently moving in a sideways pattern without much momentum, and traders should keep an eye on the $1.79 support and $2.34 resistance levels for the next possible move. A Big Move Soon? Analyst Casi Trades said that after months of moving in a tight range, XRP is now at a crucial point where a big move is expected soon. From here, the price will either break out strongly to the upside or dip sharply one last time before bouncing back. “What makes this moment even more critical is the timing. It’s mid-week, Wednesday, this is when sentiment tends to flip. We’ve seen it before many times at the end of consolidation: a sharp fakeout that recovers by the macro close, leaving most people behind,” she said.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-19 03:37:17

The analysis revealed that Binance is leading, while other players like Bybit, OKX, Kraken, and Coinbase are trailing. The PoR Rankings The survey evaluated each exchange’s reserve ratio, a metric calculated by dividing the net customer balance by the platform’s total balance. Binance ranked first in transparency, consistently maintaining a coverage level above 100% and releasing its PoR reports on a monthly and timely basis. OKX followed closely behind, also reporting a capital backing rate that remains above 100%. However, the figure is slightly below Binance’s. The exchange also publishes its disclosures monthly and without delay. Bybit came in next on the list, with a reserve ratio ranging between 105% and 115%. The platform recently improved its disclosure practices by shifting from bi-monthly to monthly reporting. CryptoQuant gave Kraken the fourth spot, with the exchange maintaining backing figures above 100%. However, it has only published four reports since November 22, 2022, with CQ’s analysis highlighting the need for more regular updates. Coinbase is ranked last, as the exchange has not published any PoR report. Analyst Maartun described this trend as a major shortcoming, especially given the company’s size and market position. Coinbase Fails to Reveal Reserves The CryptoQuant quick take noted that Binance and OKX are currently setting the industry standard due to their strong reserve coverage and consistent, on-time reporting. Despite a few gaps that need to be filled, Bybit and Kraken are also making progress. However, Coinbase stood out as the only exchange among the five reviewed that has yet to offer any PoR data. Proof-of-reserves is a method used by crypto exchanges to show that they hold enough digital assets to cover customer deposits. The transparency measure became popular among institutions after big crypto platforms like FTX and Mt. Gox collapsed, leaving investors unsure whether their funds were safe. Despite growing adoption, the practice has also been criticized by some notable crypto industry figures. Strategy’s Michael Saylor recently called it a “ bad idea .” He argued that disclosing wallet addresses, often part of the PoR process, introduces serious security risks. According to the Bitcoin enthusiast, no professional security team would recommend making wallet structures public. He further claimed that if AI were asked to evaluate the risks posed by the practice, it would produce 50 pages of potential threats.

QoQ transaction revenue declines appear temporary, as the rebound in crypto prices should drive stronger results in upcoming quarters. Valuation remains attractive, with the P/S ratio well below early 2024 highs, presenting a favorable entry point for investors. Technical indicators suggest current weakness is likely consolidation, with long-term momentum and fundamentals supporting a bullish outlook. Seeking Alpha With the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) more than recovering from its February to April decline, Coinbase Global, Inc. (COIN) has also rallied significantly off its early April lows. Early April was when my previous article on this company was written, and the stock has seen gains of nearly 70% since that buy rating. That outpaced the S&P500's around 20% gain during this period. In this article, I'm here to determine whether the stock likely has room to run or whether now would be a good opportunity to take some profits. YoY Growth Is Acceptable Coinbase Q1 Shareholder Letter Let's begin with a discussion of their 2025 Q1 revenues. Coinbase reported total revenues of $2.0343 billion, representing growth of 24.2% YoY. Still, this underperformed expectations by some margin as they missed by $43.95 million. After subtracting $74 million of corporate interest and other income, net revenues were $1.9603 billion, up 23.5% YoY. This shows the core business grew slightly slower than what the total revenue figure had indicated. In QoQ terms, total revenues did contract by 10.4%, however. Headwinds Pressure Transactions Coinbase Q1 Shareholder Letter Total transaction revenues saw significant QoQ declines of 19% as they cited a poor backdrop. They attributed this weakness to a wipe-out of 19% in total crypto market cap from the end of Q4 to the end of Q1. As you can see above, transaction revenues were still able to see healthy YoY gains of 17.2%, however, and so the company still performed respectably amid the crypto rout. Consumer transaction revenues saw major QoQ declines, as they dropped 19% to $1.1 billion. In terms of trading volume, you can see that there were notable QoQ declines for both Consumer and Institutional clients. Consumer volume dropped by 17.0% while Institutional volume dropped by 8.7%. Still, both categories saw significant YoY increases, and so I would say the long-term direction of the business remains strong. Stablecoin Leads The Way Coinbase Q1 Shareholder Letter Coinbase Q1 Shareholder Letter Subscription and services revenue saw better performance overall, as there were both QoQ and YoY gains. They reported revenues of $698 million, up 9% QoQ and 36.6% YoY. Within this segment, Stablecoin revenues saw a particularly strong Q1, as QoQ growth of 32% to $298 million was reported. YoY gains exceed 50%. They attribute this to ""average USDC held in Coinbase products increased 49% Q/Q to $12.3 billion, driven by longstanding efforts to better integrate USDC across our product experience and our rewards program."" Therefore, I believe these results show that their strategy is paying off handsomely. As shown above, off-platform USDC hit $42 billion, as they saw growth of 39% QoQ as they cited ""growth in USDC usage across onchain dapps, and expanded distribution partnerships."" Blockchain rewards revenue and interest and finance fee income saw modest QoQ declines of 9% and 4%, respectively, while other subscription and services revenue increased 5% QoQ. Their stablecoin business was clearly the highlight here in my view. Revenues Are Resilient Data by YCharts After that Q1 discussion, I believe a zoom out view of where things are at would be of value to readers. Revenues are overall in quite a strong position despite QoQ declines as they are at the second-highest level in the past three years. As for YoY revenue growth, the slowdown from Q4 was considerable but still, revenue growth is at around the average of the past few years. In addition, I believe that this deceleration in growth could just be temporary, as the rebound in Bitcoin and other crypto prices should boost its transactions business in the next few quarters. Guidance Is Mixed Coinbase Q1 Shareholder Letter They don't provide guidance for their transaction revenue, but they did say that generated $240 million in April. Spot transaction volumes were down 12% MoM, basically in-line with the global spot volume declines of 13%. For May and June, I expect considerably stronger transaction results due to the major rebound in crypto prices. They are projecting transaction expenses to be in the mid-teens percentage range of net revenues, which would in-line with Q1's 15%. For subscription and services revenue, they are expecting between $600 million and $680 million. At the midpoint, this would represent QoQ declines of 8.3% but YoY gains of 6.8%. Obviously, QoQ declines shows expected weakness in this segment after strong Q1 results. YoY growth slowing from around 37% to the mid single digits shows that the longer-term trajectory of this segment may slow. Technology & Development + General & Admin expenses are expected to drop slightly QoQ at the midpoint, as they reported $749.7 million in Q1. As for Sales and Marketing expenses, the midpoint of guidance at $265 million is a moderate increase from $247.3 million in their Q1. As a whole, the guidance that they provided for subscriptions and services was a bit weaker than desired, but I believe a rebound in transactions could potentially more than offset those QoQ declines. Valuation Remains Attractive Data by YCharts The P/S ratio has rebounded from lows of around 6.0 earlier this year but in the grand scheme of things, the multiple is not at an elevated position when compared to the peak in early 2024. I believe this current valuation provides opportunity for investors. Q1 results were overall a bit weaker than expected, but that was mainly a result of crypto weakness and not problems with the company itself. QoQ transaction revenue declines are temporary in my view, and these headwinds already seem to have dissipated as Bitcoin has more than recovered from its stretch of weakness. In their guidance, it was shown that subscription and services revenue growth could slow YoY in their Q2, but the likely bounce back in transactions should highly offset those effects on company-wide net revenues. Overall, Coinbase seems well positioned, despite headwinds unfavourably affecting their Q1 results. Therefore, the significant contraction in the P/S ratio from a far above 20 reading in early 2024 to a current level of 9.868 shows that the stock is still at a relatively attractive entry price. Currently, there are no directly comparable companies to Coinbase that are publicly traded, and so I will leave this valuation discussion at that. Stock Is Likely Consolidating Yahoo Finance Let's conclude today's discussion with a brief look at Coinbase's technicals. Firstly, a death cross occurred between the 50-day SMA and 200 day SMA back in early April, but the deviation between the lines has been closing since early May. Therefore, downward momentum has been receding. In fact, a golden cross seems achievable in the near future. The stock did rally back above the 200-day SMA back in early May as a key sign of long-term strength as well. For the near term, the stock did drop a hair below the Bollinger Bands midline on the most recent trading day, and so there may be some weakness. In addition, the MACD line is currently below the signal line after a bearish crossover in late May. This period of weakness may be just consolidation, however, as the RSI has remained above 50 for the most part. Currently, the RSI has a reading of 54.68 and so the bulls seem to be holding on to control of the stock by a modest margin. My Take The stock has had an incredible run since my buy rating in early April. I believe maintaining the buy rating at this point would be appropriate. Q1 earnings show the effects of crypto headwinds that were uncontrollable for Coinbase. The company's stablecoin business came through as subscription and services revenue managed both YoY and QoQ gains. Total revenue growth did slow considerably YoY, and guidance was a bit weaker than desired for their subscription and services segment. However, as discussed earlier, I expect the rebound in crypto prices to boost transaction revenues in the coming quarter. This should help to strongly offset this potential weakness. The valuation remains attractive in my view as the P/S ratio is still far off the 2024 peak despite the recent rebound. Lastly, the technicals likely show a consolidation phase and so further gains are possible from here especially with the SMAs showing long-term strength improving. As a result of this analysis, Coinbase remains a buy in my view.",COIN,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|USDC,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-19 03:50:20

Shiba Inu is nearing important price points that could influence its future. Dogecoin’s anticipated upward trend faces uncertainty after recent fluctuations. Meanwhile, XYZVerse hints at a possible surge of 5,000%. This overview examines these developments to uncover what might be unfolding in the crypto space. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-te rm growth. Fueled by the sports mentality , the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner’s podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price : $0.0001 Price Now : $0.003333 Next Stage : $0.005 Final Presale Price : $0.02 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $14 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Shiba Inu Coin: The Memecoin Growing Beyond the Meme Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency that began as a meme but has grown into more. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, it runs on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing it to interact within the Ethereum ecosystem. To build trust, half of the quadrillion SHIB tokens were sent to Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder. Buterin donated a large amount to India’s Covid Relief Fund and burned 40% of the supply, boosting SHIB’s popularity and value. Because SHIB operates on Ethereum, it supports various applications. It has ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange where users can trade tokens. Plans include an NFT platform and a governance system for holders to influence SHIB’s future. This gives SHIB potential beyond being a meme coin. In today’s market, SHIB stands out by combining fun with real utility. Compared to other coins, its growth and active community make it appealing. Market trends favor projects with real uses, so SHIB might be attractive for crypto enthusiasts. Dogecoin Unleashed: Can a Meme Coin Change the Crypto Game? Dogecoin began in 2013 as a joke, using the Shiba Inu dog meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin’s scarcity, Dogecoin is abundant, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially seen as a “memecoin,” its value surged in 2021, becoming a top ten cryptocurrency with a market cap over $50 billion. This rise was fueled by social media influence, especially from Elon Musk. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer for fun, Dogecoin’s popularity shows the power of community and social media on financial markets. Does Dogecoin have potential now? Its technology is based on Litecoin, making it fast and cheap. Critics say it lacks development versus other coins. Yet, its strong community and celebrity backing keep it in the spotlight. While investors often focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum for utility and growth, Dogecoin’s low price attracts attention. If the crypto market surges again, Dogecoin might rise too. However, it’s volatile and risky. Compared to other coins, Dogecoin is unique for its meme origins and social media power. Whether it stays a joke or becomes serious is uncertain.

He called it a brilliant step forward and urged the House of Representatives to pass it quickly, without adding anything new. Trump posted on Truth Social , saying this bill would make the United States the “undisputed leader” in digital assets and could bring major investment and innovation. He made it clear he wants the bill on his desk “lightning fast,” with “no delays, no add-ons.” GENIUS Act Sets First Stablecoin Rules The GENIUS Act, recently passed by the Senate in a 68-30 vote, is the first US bill focused on stablecoins, digital tokens tied to the US dollar. It calls for full 1:1 reserve backing, proper licenses, and strong anti-money laundering checks. The bill also limits how issuers can use reserves, aiming to prevent risky practices and protect consumers. While most House Republicans support regulating stablecoins, some are considering combining the GENIUS Act with a larger cryptocurrency bill. That broader package would define how digital assets are regulated across different agencies. However, Trump has warned against this approach, saying it would slow down progress and risk losing momentum. Senator Hagerty Wants Bill Signed Before July 4 Senator Bill Hagerty, who sponsored the bill, agrees with Trump’s call for speed. He hopes to have the law signed before the Fourth of July. He also warned that adding new parts or merging them with other bills could delay approval in the Senate, where 60 votes are needed. Political Tensions Still in Play Although the bill has passed now, some Democrats have still voiced concerns. Senator Elizabeth Warren claimed the bill could benefit Trump’s family due to their ties to stablecoin projects, such as USD1. Others, like Senator Mark Warner, raised issues but admitted that the US can’t afford to fall behind in the global digital asset race. While the bill is widely accepted, big institutions and banks are ready to enter once these rules come into effect. The goal is to make US dollar-backed stablecoins globally competitive, especially against Asian regulators. With Trump backing the bill, social media is buzzing with some excited for clear rules and new investment, while others worry about politics and rushing the process.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-19 04:00:25
46319000,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=773739,1750305635,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/46319000.jpeg,Dogecoin Looks Like ‘It Wants To Play Dead’—Again,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-looks-like-it-wants-to-play-dead/,"In the late-cycle quiet of mid-June, veteran market technician Tony “The Bull” Severino, CMT, posted a monthly Dogecoin (DOGE) chart that suggests the meme-coin’s exuberant bark might be fading into a tired whimper. The 1-month candle view, published on TradingView at 22:43 UTC+2 on 17 June 2025, fixes DOGE at $0.1694 — down roughly 2.3% on the session — and places three stark black arrows where prior macro-momentum crested, rolled, and ultimately bled into prolonged downside. Is Dogecoin Just Playing Dead? On the price pane, the first arrow sits at the January 2018 peak, when DOGE briefly tagged the two cent area before relinquishing nearly all of its gains. The second arrow marks the euphoric blow-off in May 2021, when the token spiked to just under seventy cents and then began an two year descent. The third arrow lands on the most recent cluster of lower monthly highs that capped out just under $0.26 last month and has since slipped back beneath the psychological twenty-cent threshold. Beneath the candles, Severino overlays his preferred long-term MACD (labelled “LMACD”) with default histogram. The indicator — blue for the fast line, orange for the signal line — records an almost metronomic rhythm: steep positive crossovers during parabolic advances, followed by equally dramatic bearish flips as buyers are exhausted. The histogram’s tallest green bars in early 2017 and early 2021 coincide with those price spikes; in each instance, once the histogram faded to neutral and turned red, DOGE entered a multi-year drawdown. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Enters ‘Alarm Zone,’ Major Move Coming? Today, that pattern appears to be repeating. The blue LMACD line has just crossed below the orange signal line, printing a modestly negative histogram value of -0.0263 while the signal rests at 0.1704 and the LMACD itself at 0.1440. The configuration mirrors the early stages of the 2018 and 2022 downturns, the two previous rollover points Severino emphasizes with his arrows. In his own words, the monthly oscillator “looks like it wants to roll over and play dead,” hinting that the crossover may herald a deeper retracement toward historical support zones. From a structural perspective, DOGE is now trapped between the former cycle’s floor near the five-cent mark and overhead resistance at the late-202 swing high around $0.48. The waning momentum on the LMACD suggests bears maintain the upper hand unless fresh demand arrives quickly enough to invalidate the incipient bearish crossover. A decisive close below the April low near $0.13 would open the chart to vacuum-like territory, as low as the cycle bottom at $0.0491. Related Reading: Bear Signal Lingers On Dogecoin—Here’s Why That’s Bullish Severino’s analysis, while strictly technical, lands at a moment when broader crypto liquidity is thinning ahead of the summer doldrums and as risk appetite shows signs of fatigue across digital assets due to postponed hopes for the next rate cut by the US Federal Reserve and geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran. For long-term traders who monitor momentum more than memes, the monthly crossover carries more weight than any viral tweet. History does not repeat exactly, but for Dogecoin holders it has rhymed with unsettling precision every time the LMACD has curled over from an elevated crest. Whether the canine-themed coin has truly curled up for a longer nap, or merely paused before another round of tail-wagging speculation, will depend on how price reacts should the histogram grow more negative in coming months. For now, the chart’s message is unambiguous: Dogecoin’s dominant trend has lost its pulse, and momentum traders may want to keep a close ear to the dog’s breathing before assuming it is only playing. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.168.

In just over 6 months, Cardano has added 400,000+ new wallets. pic.twitter.com/uX8lgDNRdz — TapTools (@TapTools) June 11, 2025 ADA remains under pressure However, its recent price action remains in a bearish trend. Cardano has dropped 13.4% in the past week, falling from over $0.70 on June 12 to around $0.60 today. Most technical signals are neutral to bearish: RSI is at 33.39, close to oversold, MACD and Momentum are negative. CCI is the only indicator flashing a clear buy. Major moving averages, like the 10-day EMA ($0.6324) and 200-day EMA ($0.7097), are above the current price, showing a strong downtrend. Support at $0.60 Is Critical Cardano’s long-term holders are also cashing out. If ADA falls below $0.60, the next major support lies at $0.57. A short-term bounce to $0.66 is possible if the support holds, but a sentiment shift is needed for sustained recovery. ADA also faces strong resistance between $0.75–$0.78, a zone it has failed to break in past rallies. Unless it reclaims $0.62 and pushes toward $0.70, there is a risk of more downside. Signs of a Bullish Reversal? On the brighter side, recent analysis points to a possible triple bottom forming at current levels, which is a classic bullish reversal pattern. ADA is also trading within a falling wedge, which often leads to breakouts. If ADA holds this level and forms a strong bullish weekly candle, it could gain upside momentum.

Formally known as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, the bill represents Congress’s first major attempt to regulate stablecoins, which are crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar. Source: Truth Social/@realDonaldTrump GENIUS Act Faces Scrutiny Over Trump’s Crypto Gains Ahead of House Debate Next, the House is expected to take up the measure, with Republicans holding a narrow majority. While GOP leadership is likely to support the bill, partisan tensions remain. The GENIUS Act failed its initial Senate vote in May. This was largely due to concerns about Trump’s ties to the crypto industry. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of the bill’s strongest critics, raised serious objections. She accused the president and his family of standing to make “hundreds of millions” if the bill becomes law. Trump’s USD1 stablecoin reportedly brought in $57m last year. Despite the controversy, several Democrats say the need to regulate the growing stablecoin sector is urgent. Sen. Mark Warner, who also raised concerns about Trump’s crypto ventures, argued that the US cannot afford to remain on the sidelines while other countries move forward with digital asset policy. With Backing from Industry, Stablecoin Bill Moves Ahead Despite Regulatory Gaps If the House passes the GENIUS Act, it would create a federal licensing system for stablecoin issuers. Each token would be required to maintain full 1:1 backing with US dollars. In addition, the bill would restrict how reserves are used, limiting them to redemptions and low-risk investments such as Treasury repos. It also mandates anti-money laundering checks and basic consumer protections. Once cleared by the House, the bill would head to President Trump for his final signature. Large crypto firms have largely welcomed the legislation. Many have spent millions lobbying in Washington to shape digital asset rules. However, critics say the bill leaves important gaps. While it prohibits members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins, it does not apply the same rule to the president or first family. As a result, Trump could continue issuing stablecoins even as he signs the regulations governing them into law. Other provisions in the bill have also drawn criticism. It prohibits yield-bearing stablecoins, a move some say protects traditional banks but stifles innovation. Additionally, the bill’s strict compliance rules could increase costs. This may push out smaller issuers and concentrate power among a few large players. Even so, momentum appears to favor the bill. Trump’s allies see his urgency as a strategy to lock in digital asset policy. They hope to avoid delays from drawn-out Congressional negotiations or the risk of the bill being bundled with more contentious crypto legislation.

According to Yahoo Finance data , the stock briefly touched an all-time high of $200.90 before closing at $199.59. The move marked a nearly 6.5-fold increase from the company’s initial public offering price of $31 set two weeks earlier on June 5. The sharp rally came just after the U.S. Senate passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, a bill that would establish a comprehensive federal framework for regulating dollar-backed stablecoins such as Circle’s USD Coin ( USDC ). The legislation, which cleared the Senate with a 68–30 vote on June 17, now heads to the House of Representatives. House Financial Services Committee staff confirmed that scheduling discussions are expected to begin next week, although a floor vote date has not yet been announced. Supporters of the bill hope to have it on President Donald Trump’s desk before the August congressional recess.

The market reaction reflected growing confidence that clear federal oversight of stablecoins could accelerate mainstream adoption and de-risk the regulatory landscape for U.S.-based issuers. The GENIUS Act creates federal licensing requirements for stablecoin issuers, mandates complete backing of tokens with dollar reserves, such as cash or Treasuries, and gives the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency oversight powers. The legislation also seeks to improve technical interoperability among blockchain platforms and standardize consumer protection guidelines. While some states, like New York, already regulate stablecoins through local regimes like BitLicense, the GENIUS Act aims to bring all of those efforts together under a single national standard. The Act enhances Circle’s standing as a top U.S. issuer with institutional-grade practices, as it already complies with strict reserve transparency and compliance standards. USDC, Circle’s primary product, is currently widely used in decentralized finance, remittances, and tokenized payment systems.

In a June 18 update via X, the group said it had burned the funds across multiple blockchains using “vanity addresses” that contain no recoverable private keys, effectively rendering the assets permanently inaccessible. This follows the high-profile exploit of Nobitex, in which over $90 million in Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), and other tokens were drained from hot wallets. The attackers had originally framed the breach as a direct response to Nobitex’s alleged role in helping the Iranian regime circumvent sanctions and fund terrorism. 12 hours ago 8 burn addresses burned $90M from the wallets of the regime's favorite sanctions violation tool, Nobitex. 12 hours from now The source-code of Nobitex will be open to the public, and Nobitex’s walled garden will be without walls. Where do you want your assets to be?… — Gonjeshke Darande (@GonjeshkeDarand) June 18, 2025 The group, also known as Predatory Sparrow, tied the hack to ongoing military and cyber tensions between Iran and Israel, which intensified following Israeli airstrikes on Tehran’s nuclear sites days earlier. Blockchain security platforms like Chainalysis quickly confirmed that the stolen assets had not been transferred to mixers or exchanges, but rather to irretrievable addresses with inflammatory labels. You might also like: Is the crypto bull run still possible after Israel bombed Iran? Some of the addresses included phrases like “FuckIRGCTerroristsNoBiTEX,” targeting Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. One Bitcoin wallet used in the attack is provably unspendable due to its invalid checksum. On Ethereum, tokens were sent to the “0x…dead” burn address commonly used to retire supply permanently. In response, Nobitex issued a fresh statement acknowledging the burn. The exchange said that user assets are safe in cold storage and that the situation is now under control. Nobitex clarified that as a precaution, its staff had also emptied hot wallets. It reiterated that no customer funds would be lost, citing its reserve fund and insurance pool. Nobitex Announcement No. 4 – Regarding the Security Incident As part of Nobitex’s ongoing response to the recent security incident, we would like to inform our users that the situation is now under control. All external access to our servers has been completely severed. If you… — Nobitex | نوبیتکس (@nobitexmarket) June 18, 2025 The attackers have also threatened to release the source code and internal infrastructure data of Nobitex, which could worsen the situation for Iran’s leading cryptocurrency platform, which has over 11 million users. Gonjeshke Darande warned that any assets left on the platform would be at risk if users did not withdraw immediately. Despite having no financial motivation, the hack has far-reaching implications. The intentional destruction of more than $90 million worth of digital currency demonstrates how state-level conflicts have turned crypto infrastructure into a new battlefield.

This article delves into the potential future value of these cryptocurrencies. Examining market trends and projections, it uncovers how a modest sum could grow significantly. The evolving landscape of digital coins could transform a small investment into a noteworthy portfolio. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price , far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility.

Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Shiba Inu Coin: The Memecoin Growing Beyond the Meme Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency that began as a meme but has grown into more. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, it runs on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing it to interact within the Ethereum ecosystem. To build trust, half of the quadrillion SHIB tokens were sent to Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder. Buterin donated a large amount to India’s Covid Relief Fund and burned 40% of the supply, boosting SHIB’s popularity and value. Because SHIB operates on Ethereum, it supports various applications. It has ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange where users can trade tokens. Plans include an NFT platform and a governance system for holders to influence SHIB’s future. This gives SHIB potential beyond being a meme coin. In today’s market, SHIB stands out by combining fun with real utility. Compared to other coins, its growth and active community make it appealing. Market trends favor projects with real uses, so SHIB might be attractive for crypto enthusiasts. Dogecoin Unleashed: Can a Meme Coin Change the Crypto Game? Dogecoin began in 2013 as a joke, using the Shiba Inu dog meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin’s scarcity, Dogecoin is abundant, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially seen as a “memecoin,” its value surged in 2021, becoming a top ten cryptocurrency with a market cap over $50 billion. This rise was fueled by social media influence, especially from Elon Musk. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer for fun, Dogecoin’s popularity shows the power of community and social media on financial markets. Does Dogecoin have potential now? Its technology is based on Litecoin, making it fast and cheap. Critics say it lacks development versus other coins. Yet, its strong community and celebrity backing keep it in the spotlight. While investors often focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum for utility and growth, Dogecoin’s low price attracts attention. If the crypto market surges again, Dogecoin might rise too. However, it’s volatile and risky. Compared to other coins, Dogecoin is unique for its meme origins and social media power. Whether it stays a joke or becomes serious is uncertain. Conclusion Holding $1,000 in SHIB, DOGE, and XYZVerse could yield significant returns by 2035, with XYZVerse’s unique sports meme approach offering potentially greater growth.

From stuck KYC verifications and broken 2FA emails to disappearing wallet balances, things aren’t going as planned. While users wait to transfer their Pi coins to the open network, many are now asking: Is the Pi system even ready? KYC Problems Block Migration Progress A major issue for thousands of Pioneers is the Know Your Customer (KYC) verification step. Many users who passed KYC months ago are experiencing problems again, with their migration status looping endlessly or displaying a “tentative approval” that prevents further progress. Even after clearing photo and document checks, the Pi system isn’t syncing properly, and support from the team has been mostly silent. 2FA Step Adds to Frustration Another trouble point is the two-factor authentication (2FA) feature , which was added to make transfers safer. But instead of helping, it’s causing more headaches. Many users report never receiving the confirmation email or getting error messages when they click the link. In some cases, completing 2FA sends the tokens back to the mobile app, forcing users to start over. Zero Balances After Migration Attempt Even users who complete every step correctly are facing a surprising issue — their wallet shows zero balance . Some say the coins appeared briefly and then vanished. Others are watching their unlocked tokens disappear without ever reaching their mainnet wallet. This has led to anger and confusion, especially after years of waiting. Bugs, Delays, and Broken Trust The Pi Core Team says they are working on fixes, but there is still no clear timeline. They recommend updating the app, clearing the cache, and rechecking the steps. Meanwhile, scammers are targeting frustrated users with fake support messages. With the Pi native coin (Pi) price already down 75% from its peak, users are now hoping the June 28 migration doesn’t turn into another disappointment.",News,EN,0,0,TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-19 04:53:17

In a recent post on X, he explained why he doesn’t care much about the Bitcoin price of these assets. What matters more to him is how much he owns. The Wealthy Think Differently Kiyosaki believes that poor and middle-class people tend to focus too much on the price of things. They often worry if an asset is too expensive or if it might drop in value. But according to him, wealthy people think differently. They care more about owning a large quantity of valuable assets, not just watching price charts. He used gold, silver, and Bitcoin as examples. While he admits that price does play a role, he made it clear that his priority is building up how much he owns. He started buying Bitcoin when it was around $6,000 and bought as much as he could. Looking back, he wishes he had even more money at the time to buy more. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : FED Rates Remain Unchanged—What Does This Mean for Bitcoin & the Crypto Markets? , Moreover, he has long warned that the U.S. economy is weak and could collapse. He believes it’s being held up by too much debt and what he calls fake money. To protect themselves, he advises people to avoid trusting the system and instead invest in Bitcoin, gold, and silver, not cash or government bonds. Bitcoin to Hit $1M by 2030 Kiyosaki is still very bullish on Bitcoin and believes its price could reach $1 million by the year 2030. His point is that those who own the most Bitcoin will benefit the most in the long run, no matter what the current price is. The focus, he says, should be on growing the amount you hold rather than waiting for the perfect entry price. Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, echoed similar views by predicting that Bitcoin could hit $1.5 million by 2030 in her firm’s most optimistic scenario. She explained this would require Bitcoin to grow about 58% each year, driven mainly by more institutions getting involved. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Could XRP be gearing up for another breakout? Let’s dive into what he’s saying now. Last year, I shared an XRP prediction that helped many ordinary people become millionaires. The cabal didn’t like it. They tried to stop me in various ways. Yesterday, I posted another XRP prediction.. I wouldn’t be surprised if they try to stop me again when it plays out. https://t.co/49ZsoVxT1E — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) June 16, 2025 Michael XBT’s XRP Price Prediction Comes True XRP faced a brutal second quarter in 2024, dropping by 25% and hitting a yearly low of $0.38 on July 5. Interest in the token was fading fast. But while sentiment was low, Michael XBT spotted a bullish pattern forming — a 7-year bull pennant, a strong continuation setup in technical analysis. He predicted a major breakout. And he was right. By January 16, 2025, XRP skyrocketed to $3.40, marking a stunning 600% increase from its lows — exactly as he forecasted. XRP Market Today: A Healthy Cooldown? After peaking in January, XRP has entered a consolidation phase. Here’s a look at recent performance: January 2025 : +46% February : -29.3% March : -2.52% April : +4.98% May : -0.80% June (so far) : -0.74% .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Lawsuit News: Ex-SEC Official Says Judge Torres Already Ended the Ripple Case , Despite recent pullbacks, XRP is holding strong above $2, even after touching $1.60 on April 7. 30-day change : -7.5% 7-day change : -5.3% 24-hour change : -2.8% to $2.17 Michael XBT calls this a “healthy cooldown” before the next big move. XRP Price Forecast: Breakout Like Bitcoin? Michael now believes XRP could be on the verge of another massive breakout — one that could rival Bitcoin’s 8-year trendline breakout. While he hasn’t given a specific price target yet, his confidence is clear. Other analysts expect XRP to reach $5 to $30 during this cycle. However, some extreme bulls still cling to the dream of $100 XRP, though many experts view this as highly unrealistic. Michael XBT’s track record has earned him credibility in the crypto world. With XRP showing signs of a potential breakout, investors are watching closely. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In Washington, President Donald Trump has called on lawmakers to urgently pass the GENIUS Act , a stablecoin-focused bill aimed at securing US leadership in digital asset regulation. Meanwhile, in Beijing, China’s central bank governor Pan Gongsheng announced the establishment of a new international operations center for the digital yuan, signaling the country’s ambition to expand its central bank digital currency globally and promote a more diversified monetary system. Trump Urges House to Pass GENIUS Act “Lightning Fast” After Senate Approval In a bold show of support for pro-crypto legislation, US President Donald Trump has called on the House of Representatives to swiftly pass the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, a landmark bill that could significantly reshape the digital asset landscape in the United States. The legislation cleared the Senate in a decisive 68-30 vote earlier this week and now awaits a vote in the House, where Republicans maintain a narrow majority. “The Senate just passed an incredible Bill that is going to make America the UNDISPUTED Leader in Digital Assets,” Trump declared in a post on Truth Social Thursday. “Get it to my desk, ASAP — NO DELAYS, NO ADD ONS,” he added, urging lawmakers to finalize the legislation without amendments or procedural holdups. Trump’s post on Truth Social (Source: Truth Social ) A Push Toward Stablecoin Innovation The GENIUS Act marks a pivotal step in formalizing the US government’s regulatory stance on stablecoins—cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar and used primarily for payments and settlements. The legislation mandates 1:1 reserve backing, enforces Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards, and restricts how stablecoin issuers may deploy reserves. These provisions aim to boost transparency, reduce systemic risk, and position the United States as a global hub for regulated digital dollar assets. According to the bill’s sponsor, Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), the GENIUS Act will allow businesses and individuals to send payments nearly instantly instead of relying on outdated, multi-day settlement systems. “Businesses of all sizes, and Americans across the country, will be able to settle payments nearly instantaneously rather than waiting for days or sometimes even weeks,” Hagerty noted in support of the legislation. Proponents argue that the GENIUS Act is essential not just for domestic innovation, but for maintaining the global supremacy of the US dollar in a digital-first financial future. With countries like China aggressively piloting state-controlled digital currencies, US lawmakers and industry leaders see dollar-backed stablecoins as a counterbalance to centralized alternatives. David Sacks, a prominent investor and political ally of Trump, echoed this sentiment, suggesting the GENIUS Act could “reassert American financial leadership globally.” Trump’s vocal backing of the bill adds momentum to a broader strategy to position the US as a dominant force in digital finance. Political Divides and Crypto Controversies Despite bipartisan support in the Senate, the bill’s journey to this point hasn’t been without political friction. The GENIUS Act initially failed a cloture vote in May after several Democrats raised alarms over Trump’s close ties to the cryptocurrency sector. Chief among the critics was Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who accused Trump of crafting legislation that could financially benefit his inner circle. “Donald Trump and his family stand to make hundreds of millions of dollars from this bill through his USD1 stablecoin,” Warren said during Senate debates. Her reference was to a rumored project reportedly linked to Trump’s associates, which some fear could gain an unfair regulatory advantage under the bill’s framework. Other Democrats, such as Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), voiced skepticism over Trump’s crypto ambitions but ultimately supported the bill on national interest grounds. “We can’t afford to keep standing on the sidelines,” Warner said, acknowledging the US was at risk of falling behind in the rapidly evolving digital asset space. The GENIUS Act lays out a comprehensive regulatory framework for dollar-pegged payment stablecoins, offering clarity in an area previously marked by legal ambiguity. Key provisions include: Full 1:1 Reserve Backing: All stablecoins must be backed by US dollars or equivalent low-risk assets. Federal and State Licensing Options: Issuers must secure either a federal or state license, creating flexibility while ensuring oversight. Strict Use of Reserves: Stablecoin issuers may not use reserves for lending or speculative purposes—only for redemptions and designated safe assets like US Treasury repos. Mandatory AML Compliance: All issuers must conduct rigorous anti-money laundering and Know Your Customer (KYC) checks to curb illicit usage. Consumer Protections: The bill includes rules on redemptions, disclosures, and audit requirements to ensure end-user trust. These guardrails aim to eliminate the kind of financial engineering and unregulated practices that plagued earlier stablecoin models, such as TerraUSD’s algorithmic collapse in 2022. A Defining Moment for US Crypto Policy With House Republicans generally supportive of crypto innovation and Trump applying public pressure, the GENIUS Act is expected to face less resistance in its final legislative hurdle. Still, Democrats may attempt to introduce amendments or delay the process through procedural tactics—something Trump explicitly warned against in his Truth Social post. As the bill moves to the House floor, all eyes will be on whether the United States finally establishes a regulatory regime that could define the next era of financial infrastructure. China Accelerates Digital Yuan Expansion as Global Currency Competition Heats Up Meanwhile, China is doubling down on its central bank digital currency (CBDC) ambitions with a renewed push to expand the global footprint of the digital yuan, or e-CNY. At the prestigious Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai, People’s Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Pan Gongsheng announced the launch of an international operations center for the digital yuan and reaffirmed China’s long-term vision for a multipolar monetary system. Pan’s remarks underscore China’s strategic positioning of the e-CNY as both a domestic financial innovation and a geopolitical counterweight to the US dollar’s longstanding global dominance. The timing of China’s latest CBDC push is not coincidental. In 2025, investor confidence in the US dollar has taken a hit, in part due to heightened economic nationalism and unpredictable tariff policies from President Trump. The dollar’s centrality in the global financial system—already under scrutiny—has now become a catalyst for alternative systems and technologies. Pan made clear that digital payment technologies can provide a more neutral and resilient foundation for global trade and financial interactions, especially amid mounting geopolitical tensions. “Traditional cross-border payment infrastructures can be easily politicized and weaponized, and used as a tool for unilateral sanctions,” he warned, noting that such systems risk destabilizing global economic order when manipulated for political ends. His remarks echo a growing sentiment among emerging markets and major economies that current cross-border payment rails, often routed through Western-led networks like SWIFT, are outdated and vulnerable to geopolitical interference. Building a CBDC Hub in Shanghai The creation of an international operations center for the digital yuan in Shanghai is a tangible step toward making e-CNY a serious player in global finance. Shanghai, already a top-tier financial hub, is strategically positioned to serve as the bridge between China’s domestic economic engine and international CBDC deployment. The move also highlights China’s confidence in its years-long CBDC development cycle. Since beginning research into the e-CNY in 2014, China has run several pilot programs in major cities, tested the currency during high-profile events like the Beijing Winter Olympics, and formed technical alliances with global financial institutions to promote interoperability. China is not alone in the race to digitize fiat currency. While stablecoins like USDT and USDC—pegged to the US dollar—have gained momentum for facilitating borderless transactions in the crypto space, central banks around the world continue to invest in CBDC infrastructure. In Europe, the European Central Bank is inching closer to a digital euro, despite pushback from privacy advocates. The United Arab Emirates expects to roll out its digital dirham by the end of the year, while Israel recently published design specifications for a digital shekel. Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, is currently running a pilot program for a stablecoin framework, further blending centralized and decentralized digital payment paradigms. However, enthusiasm for CBDCs has tempered in recent months. A February 2025 report by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) revealed that 31% of central banks have delayed CBDC implementation due to unresolved issues surrounding regulation, privacy, and monetary stability. China, by contrast, remains resolute. The digital yuan is already integrated into retail payment systems like Alipay and WeChat Pay, and the new Shanghai-based international center is expected to accelerate partnerships with foreign firms, trade zones, and possibly even cross-border trade settlements. Stablecoins vs. CBDCs: Competing Models The push-and-pull between stablecoins and CBDCs represents a broader contest between decentralized financial innovation and centralized control. While stablecoins offer borderless, market-driven alternatives to traditional fiat, they are often seen as vehicles for dollar dominance. CBDCs, meanwhile, are tightly controlled by central banks and designed to reinforce sovereign monetary authority. Pan’s comments illustrate the ideological rift in how countries approach financial modernization. While stablecoins have become crypto’s first mass-market utility, CBDCs offer state-sanctioned alternatives that can integrate with existing legal, financial, and geopolitical frameworks. China’s move to internationalize the digital yuan has deep strategic implications. If successful, e-CNY could reduce the reliance of regional trade partners on the US dollar, offer a payments infrastructure resistant to sanctions, and potentially serve as a model for other state-backed digital currencies. By establishing a multipolar currency vision, China is sending a clear message: the era of single-currency dominance is fading, and digital tools like e-CNY will help shape the next chapter of international finance.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-19 05:30:00

Related Reading: Tether Enforces Freeze On $12 Million In Tron Funds Over Illicit Activity Based on reports from blockchain sleuth ZachXBT, at least $81.7 million was moved out of the exchange’s hot wallets on June 16, 2025. The stolen funds came from both the Tron network and various Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains. Massive Funds Drained From Hot Wallets According to ZachXBT’s Telegram post, the first chunk—$49 million—went through a vanity address that read “TKFuckiRGCTerrorists…mNX.” A second custom address, “0xffFFfFFffFF…Dead,” was used to pull the rest. These special wallet names aren’t random. They show how attackers slipped around Nobitex’s checks and grabbed funds meant to stay locked down. Vanity Addresses Exploit Access Controls Experts say the use of these human‑readable addresses points to a flaw in the exchange’s internal controls. “Attackers managed to infiltrate systems that should have blocked unauthorized wallets,” noted Hakan Unal of Cyvers security. The exchange confirmed that it spotted the breach quickly and suspended the affected hot wallets. Political Motive Behind The Breach A pro‑Israel hacker group calling itself “Gonjeshke Darande” claimed responsibility in an X post. The group called Nobitex a tool for “regime financing” and threatened to release source code and internal files within 24 hours. After the IRGC’s “Bank Sepah” comes the turn of Nobitex WARNING!

This hack comes as tensions surged between Israel and Iran after Israel’s largest strikes on Iran since the 1980s. Reports say at least 224 people died in Iran and 24 in Israel during the renewed conflict. Cold Storage And User Security Assurances Nobitex says users’ main funds are safe in cold storage, and only a fraction of hot‑wallet assets were hit. The exchange promised to cover all losses with its insurance fund and internal resources. That promise should reassure customers, though the fear of leaked code or files could drive some to pull funds. Related Reading: Crypto Gets A Green Light From Spanish Banking Giant Unmoved Funds Could Reveal Next Steps Interestingly, none of the stolen coins have moved since the hack was first spotted. That could mean the hackers are choosing their next move. Or it might be a warning shot meant to show they can strike again.

As the crypto world watches, Nobitex users will be looking closely at how the platform rebuilds trust and keeps their money safe.

He urged the House of Representatives to advance it “lightning fast.” “The Senate just passed an incredible Bill that is going to make America the UND ISPUTED Leader in Digital Assets … Get it t o my desk, ASAP — NO DE LAYS, N O ADD ONS,” Trump posted He characterized the legislation as “incredible” and “pure GENIUS,” asserting confidently that this was American brilliance at its best, and they would show the world how to win with digital assets like never before. Trump said the House should quickly pass a “clean” version of the Senate bill. His message serves as a warning to House Republicans — includi ng Congressman French H ill — who are considering how much to alter the Senate bill and whether to incorporate it into a larger package of crypto legislation that would go back to the Senate. Trump expresses excitement about the ‘GENIUS Act’ making the US a global leader in crypto Trump’s post came one day after the Senate passed the cryptocurrency bill in question, which aims to establish the first US regulatory framework for digital tokens called stablecoins, which are tied to the dollar’s value. House Republicans support passing stablecoin legislation but might hesitate to approve the Senate’s GENIUS Act bill. This is because the Republican Party in the House has proposed its own version of stablecoin legislation that shares similarities with the Senate’s bill, yet there are several important differences. The House’s proposal passed through the Financial Services Committee in April. Trump expressed excitement about the stablecoin bill, stating that the Senate passed an amazing bill to make America the“undisputed leader” in digital assets. He said, “Nobody will do it better; it is pure GENIUS!” The US President further stated that digital assets are their future. He then asserted that their nation was going to take charge. Based on his argument, they discuss massive investments and major innovations in this context. Hill has been advocating for years to promote crypto-friendly laws in the House and is also considering how to pass multiple digital asset bills successfully this year. He has considered combining stablecoin legislation with another larger bill — a key part of the Republican Party’s effort to support the crypto industry, which would divide oversight of digital assets among market regulators. Additionally, Brooke Nethercott, Hill’s spokesperson, stated that the Arkansas Republican is eager to keep working with their members and House leadership as they find a way forward. Some House Republicans, however, worry that simply passing the Senate’s stablecoin bill — even if it aligns with their version — could weaken efforts to push for broader market structure legislation that affects more areas of the crypto industry than just stablecoins. Senator Bill Hagerty eyes a legislative victory with the stablecoin bill In the Senate, Republicans are eager to quickly achieve a legislative victory by sending their stablecoin bill to Trump for approval. This bill has gone through months of tough negotiations, and senators worry that a larger crypto package would struggle to pass in the Senate, where they need Democratic votes to reach the 60-vote requirement. Senator Bill Hagerty, the main sponsor of the Senate stablecoin bill, mentioned in an interview last week that his goal is to secure a win for the American people and get it to the president before the Fourth of July. According to Hagerty, it was clear that they have a great opportunity for a significant win for the American public right now. He then cautioned that if they change the bill to include market structure legislation, it would need to return to the Senate for more work. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Alongside the acquisition, the firm appointed former OKEx COO Andy Cheung to its board and added Tracy Hoyos Lopez, who helped shape Donald Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance, to its advisory team. The announcement boosted Prenetics’ stock by over 23%. Meanwhile, Norwegian brokerage K33 is also aggressively entering the Bitcoin space, and plans to raise $8.9 million to purchase up to 1,000 BTC. In contrast, political backlash erupted in the Czech Republic over a controversial $45 million Bitcoin donation from a convicted criminal to the Ministry of Justice. This led to resignations and a failed no-confidence vote. Prenetics Adds Bitcoin and Trump Advisor to Team Prenetics, a healthcare company with headquarters in both Hong Kong and the United States, announced a bold move into the Bitcoin space by investing $20 million to acquire about 187 BTC at an average price of $106,712 per coin. The purchase was secured through a Kraken custody account, and is the beginning of the firm’s strategy to become one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders in the healthcare industry. This strategic pivot is very similar to the approach taken by other institutions like Strategy, which have integrated Bitcoin into their treasury reserves as well. Press release from Prenetics The company also revealed changes to its leadership structure to support this new direction. Andy Cheung, former chief operating officer of OKEx, will be joining the Prenetics board of directors. In addition, Tracy Hoyos Lopez, the Kraken executive credited with influencing former President Donald Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance during his campaign, joined the company’s advisory team. Lopez pointed out that Prenetics is well-positioned to capitalize on growing institutional adoption, especially given its improved financial standing and the changing regulatory landscape surrounding digital assets. Prenetics reported a strong liquidity position of roughly $117 million, including its new Bitcoin holdings, cash, and short-term assets. After the announcement, the company’s stock (PRE) saw a boost of more than 23%over the past 24 hours. Prenetics stock price over the past day (Source: Google ) The move comes as the Trump administration continues to embrace digital assets. In March, President Trump issued an executive order calling for the creation of a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a “Digital Asset Stockpile.” According to the White House, the US government currently holds around 200,000 BTC, which was largely obtained through civil and criminal seizures. While the legal path for expanding these reserves is still a bit uncertain, advisers have proposed funding new acquisitions by revaluing gold certificates held by the US Treasury. This would not involve taxpayer funds and would be considered budget-neutral. K33 Aims for 1,000 BTC Norwegian crypto firm K33 announced plans to raise at least 85 million Swedish krona, or roughly $8.9 million, through a directed share issue to fund the purchase of up to 1,000 Bitcoin for its own corporate reserves. The company appointed Pareto Securities to manage the offering, setting the subscription price at $0.011 per share and aiming to issue a minimum of 820 million shares. Announcement from K33 According to K33, the proceeds will be used to buy Bitcoin for its balance sheet, which will help enhance both its financial position and its operational capabilities as a brokerage. The move builds on K33’s earlier step in May when it secured financing to purchase 57 BTC. On Tuesday, the firm confirmed it acquired an initial 5 BTC, valued at approximately $523,000. According to the company, holding Bitcoin will improve its margins, support new product development, and increase its appeal to institutional clients. K33 firmly believes that Bitcoin exposure provides “real operational leverage” for its brokerage business. CEO Torbjørn Bull Jenssen described the fundraising as the first step toward building a strong Bitcoin-based balance sheet, which means that the company is committed to growing its BTC holdings over the long-term. The share offering will not be available in jurisdictions like the United States, Canada, Australia, Russia, or South Korea, among others where such distribution would be prohibited. K33's announcement is part of a broader movement in Norway, where more firms are embracing Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Earlier this month, Norwegian Block Exchange experienced a massive 138% stock surge after revealing plans to hold Bitcoin. Additionally, Aker ASA’s crypto-focused subsidiary, Seetek, now holds 754 BTC . Bitcoin Donation Sparks Political Uproar While Bitcoin mostly attracts feelings of excitement, the same can certainly not be said for everyone. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala’s government survived its fourth no-confidence vote in three years, this time brought on by a $45 million Bitcoin scandal involving a convicted criminal and the Ministry of Justice. The motion was spearheaded by opposition parties ANO, SPD, and the Pirates, but it failed to reach the necessary 101 votes in Parliament, ending with only 94 supporters after more than 24 hours of debate. Although the Civic Democratic Party remains in power, the controversy surrounding the donation raised many serious questions about the government's handling of crypto-related affairs and its ethical standards. At the center of the scandal is Tomáš Jiřikovský, a man with prior convictions for drug trafficking, weapons offenses, and embezzlement. On May 27, Jiřikovský donated 1,561 Bitcoin — worth approximately 1 billion Czech koruna ($45 million) — to the Ministry of Justice. The donation was made possible after a court authorized the return of his previously seized devices. Jiřikovský claimed the Bitcoin was a third of his crypto holdings, with the remainder — 3,855.15 BTC — tied to the now-defunct illicit website Nucleus Market. Due to outdated hardware, access to the larger wallet has reportedly been lost . The donation triggered a political firestorm that even led to the resignation of Justice Minister Pavel Blažek on May 30. Finance Minister Zbyněk Stanjura is also under scrutiny, with opposition members alleging he was aware of the donation in advance. Eva Decroix was sworn in as the new Minister of Justice on June 10 and committed to launching an independent investigation into the matter. She assured the public that her ministry would fully cooperate with authorities. Prime Minister Fiala admitted that the donation could have been prevented and acknowledged that it damaged public trust in his party. He promised accountability for the ethical missteps but accused opposition parties of exploiting the situation to attack his government with “insults and lies,” according to a post he made on X . The incident now adds to a growing list of global political controversies involving cryptocurrency, including US President Donald Trump’s crypto-related ventures and Argentine President Javier Milei’s association with the Libra token scandal. While the Czech government weathered this latest political storm, the long-term implications for its credibility and crypto governance are still uncertain.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-19 05:36:32

Therefore, the ultra-fast network, known for settling transactions in just 3-5 seconds and its native token’s price, both now faces uncertainty. Now the question remains, will XLM price breakout?. To find answers, keep reading to know more. Why On-chain Metrics Are Turning Green? Recent social content indicate a shift in sentiment from XLM. As negative messages have been largely overshadowed by positive ones this week, reflecting a bullish bias in the overall emotional tone of people. This trend is reflected in data fetched on Santiment, which shows that the total weighted sentiment for XLM has risen from -0.775 to +0.192 this week. Especially, on June 17th, positive sentiment reached 11.31, significantly outpacing the negative sentiment of 0.81. This is signaling a notable increase in positive conversations. In addition to this, the derivatives market for Stellar (XLM) has seen a notable increase in Open Interest weighted funding rates, indicating a recovery over the past week. Funding rates, which were around -0.378% on May 13th, have now climbed to +0.0029%.The trend has shifted due to positive developments, such as efforts to integrate PayPal’s PYUSD stablecoin into Steller’s network to support small and medium businesses with affordable cross-border payments facilities, and a hint of an upcoming collaboration with EasyA. However, these factors have not translated into significant gains for the XLM price. As a reason why, the growth in metrics doesn’t align much with the bearish price action on XLM; however, the traders’ bias is clearly shifting towards upside direction slowly, and it is in clear need of a catalyst to boost price. Overall, the development suggests that investors in the derivatives market are bullish on price recovery. In What Case Could XLM Price Turn Bullish? The XLM liquidation heatmap indicates that the price is currently positioned near the bottom side of liquidity. A further breach southwards could trigger a long squeeze, that can potentially drive XLM price to significant lows. However, there are signs that geopolitical tensions may be on a path to ease soon, particularly with Trump’s ultimatum to Iran. If Iran complies and surrenders, markets that have been under pressure for so long could experience a reversal with a peaceful breath, especially concerning the Israel-Iran conflict. Similarly, the outcome of today’s FOMC meeting could be crucial in determining the direction for both top coins and altcoins. If the situation leans towards the optimistic side, XLM may find support and begin to rise from the liquidity cluster around $0.25. This potential shift could provide the momentum needed for a price recovery.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XLM,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-19 05:37:10

His remarks centered on the potential effects of tariff policies, specifically how they might influence both economic activity and, critically, tariffs inflation . What Did Jerome Powell Say About Tariffs and Inflation? Chairman Powell stated that the outcome of tariff policies isn’t uniform; it depends heavily on the specifics and the level of tariffs imposed. However, he issued a clear caution: significant tariff hikes, particularly those implemented this year, could have a twofold negative effect: Weighing on Economic Activity: Higher tariffs can increase costs for businesses, disrupt supply chains, and potentially reduce consumer spending as imported goods become more expensive. This can slow down overall economic growth. Potentially Boosting Inflation: Tariffs act like taxes on imports. When the cost of imported goods rises, businesses often pass those costs onto consumers, leading to higher prices across various sectors. This is a form of ‘cost-push’ inflation. This isn’t the typical inflation the Fed usually battles, which is often driven by strong consumer demand. Tariff-induced inflation is supply-side driven, making it a tricky challenge for monetary policy. How Do Tariffs Impact Economic Activity? Understanding the Economic Impact Let’s break down the mechanisms behind the potential negative economic impact of tariffs: Increased Costs for Businesses: Companies relying on imported raw materials or components face higher input costs. This can squeeze profit margins or force them to raise prices. Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs can complicate international trade relationships, forcing companies to find new suppliers or relocate production, which is costly and time-consuming. Reduced Consumer Spending: As the cost of imported goods (from cars to electronics to clothing) increases, consumers have less disposable income for other purchases. Retaliation: Countries hit by tariffs often retaliate with their own tariffs on the first country’s exports, hurting domestic industries that rely on international markets. Investment Uncertainty: The unpredictability of tariff policy can make businesses hesitant to invest in new projects, further slowing growth. All these factors contribute to a potential slowdown in the economy, impacting job growth and overall prosperity. Why Does This Matter for Fed Policy and Interest Rates? The Federal Reserve’s primary goals are maximum employment and stable prices (controlling inflation). Fed policy , particularly decisions around Fed interest rates , is the main tool used to achieve this. Normally, if inflation is high due to strong demand, the Fed raises interest rates to cool the economy. If the economy is slowing, the Fed might lower rates to stimulate activity. However, tariffs present a dilemma. They can cause both inflation *and* a slowdown in economic activity simultaneously. If the Fed raises rates to combat tariff-induced inflation, they risk further harming an already weakening economy. If they keep rates low to support the economy, they might allow inflation to accelerate. This makes navigating monetary policy significantly more complex. What Could This Mean for the Crypto Market? Analyzing the Crypto Market Reaction The connection between macroeconomic factors like inflation, interest rates, and the crypto market is a subject of ongoing debate and observation. Here’s how Powell’s comments and the potential fallout could influence crypto: Inflation Hedge Narrative: If tariffs significantly boost inflation, some investors might turn to assets perceived as inflation hedges, like Bitcoin. This narrative gained traction during previous periods of high inflation. Risk-On/Risk-Off Sentiment: Cryptocurrencies are often viewed as riskier assets. If tariffs lead to economic uncertainty and a slowdown, investors might move away from riskier investments (risk-off), potentially putting downward pressure on crypto prices. Conversely, if the inflation aspect dominates and conventional investments struggle, crypto might be seen as an alternative (risk-on in a different sense). Fed Policy Uncertainty: Any confusion or unpredictable moves from the Fed regarding interest rates can increase market volatility across the board, including crypto. Impact on Disposable Income: If tariffs reduce consumer purchasing power and harm the broader economy, it could potentially reduce the capital available for speculative investments like crypto. There isn’t a single guaranteed outcome. The crypto market reaction will likely depend on which factor dominates: the fear of inflation or the fear of economic slowdown. Navigating Macro Headwinds: Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts Given the potential complexities introduced by factors like tariffs and their impact on tariffs inflation and the broader economy, what should individuals interested in the crypto market consider? Stay Informed: Pay attention not just to crypto-specific news but also to major macroeconomic announcements, including statements from the Federal Reserve and data on inflation and economic growth. Understand the Links: Educate yourself on how traditional finance and economic policies can influence the crypto space. The world is interconnected. Consider Your Strategy: Are you investing in crypto as a long-term store of value, a speculative asset, or something else? Macro factors might influence the performance of different types of crypto assets differently. Think Long-Term: While short-term volatility can be influenced by macro news, many crypto investors focus on the long-term potential of the underlying technology and networks. Jerome Powell’s comments serve as a reminder that external economic forces play a significant role in the financial landscape, and understanding them is key to navigating any market, including crypto. The Bigger Picture: Global Trade and Inflation Trends The discussion around tariffs isn’t isolated to the U.S. economy. Trade policies have global repercussions. Changes in trade dynamics can shift manufacturing, alter supply chains worldwide, and impact inflation rates in multiple countries. As central banks globally grapple with post-pandemic inflation and potential economic slowdowns, trade policy adds another layer of complexity to their decisions. This interconnectedness means that developments like those highlighted by Jerome Powell can have ripple effects that eventually reach every corner of the global financial system, including digital asset markets. Summary: Jerome Powell’s warning about tariffs potentially boosting inflation and weighing on economic activity highlights a significant challenge for Fed policy . This complex macroeconomic environment, where inflation risks coexist with potential economic slowdowns, creates uncertainty that can influence the crypto market in various ways.

According to a financial analyst, recent updates from the U.S. Federal Reserve are setting the stage for what could be a major move in the crypto market, just not immediately. In fact, this “quiet time” could be the best chance to prepare before altcoins finally take off. Fed Keeps Rates Unchanged The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided not to cut interest rates — again. This is the fourth straight time they’ve paused, keeping rates at 4.25%–4.50% . The reason? Inflation is still too high. Core inflation is sitting at 2.8%, while the Fed wants it closer to 2%. That means no fresh money is being pumped into the market right now. And without that, altcoins often struggle to rise in a big way. Big altcoin rallies usually need extra liquidity, cheap money, lower interest rates, or stimulus to really explode. Altcoins in Accumulation Phase Right now, the altcoin market is in what experts call the “accumulation phase. ” Prices are not crashing, but they’re not soaring either. Many coins are just moving sideways. It’s a quiet zone, and that’s when smart investors usually build their positions. Altcoins need two things to spark a full-blown rally: A drop in Bitcoin dominance (which is still strong above $100k) A return of market liquidity (which comes with rate cuts or printing more money) Until then, altcoins will mostly move based on their individual projects, news, and development progress. Altcoin Season isn’t Cancelled — Just delayed! One of the biggest triggers will be the U.S. Federal Reserve finally cutting interest rates. That could happen later this year. When it does, it will unlock more money and liquidity into the market. And that’s exactly when altcoins are expected to take off in a big way. Adding to this excitement, the Altcoin Index has just confirmed entry into the famous 4-Year Cycle Zone, the same pattern that led to massive altcoin rallies in both 2017 and 2021. This signals that altcoins may soon be ready for another explosive run.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-19 05:40:31

While… pic.twitter.com/cgm7JVy5vz — 10x Research (@10x_Research) June 19, 2025 No FOMO, No Fuel: Bitcoin Struggles as Retail and Risk Appetite Fade Beyond the inflows, several headwinds are dampening momentum. Retail participation, a key driver in previous bull runs, remains unusually muted. On-chain data shows a lack of smaller transactions (under $10,000), while Google Trends reveals low retail interest in Bitcoin compared to the frenzied peaks of 2017 and 2021. Without widespread retail speculation, the kind that creates parabolic moves, prices have little fuel to break higher. Geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty are also contributing to the stall. The Israel-Iran conflict , potential US tariff shifts and mixed signals from the Federal Reserve are creating a cautious risk environment. Despite Inflows, Market Stalls as Liquidations and Weak Liquidity Bite Bitcoin has responded by trading sideways, and recent liquidations totaling $1.2b in leveraged positions have only added downward pressure. Liquidity conditions remain tight. Since March 2025, USD liquidity has been flat to slightly negative, limiting the flow of capital into speculative assets like Bitcoin. Even with ETF demand, the broader environment lacks the monetary backdrop seen in previous rallies. At the same time, technical signals point to a market on edge. Volatility has compressed, a common precursor to large moves. Meanwhile, activity from long-dormant wallets has raised questions about whether early holders are exiting into strength. For now, momentum appears stuck. Trump’s crypto-friendly stance and steady institutional inflows continue to make headlines, but the price action tells a different story. As 10X Research puts it, traders would do well to focus less on surface-level inflows and more on where real pressure is quietly building.

This kind of large-scale movement is always noteworthy and prompts immediate questions about potential market implications. What Does This Bitcoin Inflow Mean? According to an alert from CryptoQuant, a platform specializing in on-chain data analysis, a staggering 4,635.92 BTC, valued at approximately $484.5 million at the time of the transfer, was detected moving onto spot exchanges in a concentrated period. For those closely monitoring the Bitcoin market , such a large inflow often suggests that holders might be preparing to sell, potentially increasing supply on exchanges and exerting downward pressure on price. However, the picture is rarely black and white in the complex world of crypto. While a sudden spike in exchange inflows can indicate potential selling pressure, it’s crucial to look deeper. On-chain data provides valuable clues, but interpreting them requires understanding various possibilities. Breaking Down the BTC to Exchanges Data The inflow wasn’t evenly distributed across all platforms. The vast majority of the BTC to exchanges movement was directed towards specific venues. The breakdown provided by CryptoQuant highlights the concentration: Coinbase Prime: Received the lion’s share with 3,581 BTC, accounting for approximately 77% of the total inflow. Coinbase Prime is an institutional-focused platform offering trading, custody, and prime brokerage services. Coinbase Advanced: Saw an inflow of 1,039 BTC, making up about 22% of the total. This platform caters more to experienced retail traders and potentially smaller institutions. Gemini: Received a smaller amount of 14 BTC, less than 1% of the total inflow. The heavy concentration on Coinbase platforms, particularly Coinbase Prime, is a key detail. CryptoQuant specifically noted that large deposits to custody-enabled platforms like these may simply reflect clients using exchange custody services. This is a critical nuance that challenges the immediate assumption of imminent selling. Why Track Crypto Exchange Flow? Understanding crypto exchange flow is a fundamental part of on-chain analysis for several reasons: Potential Selling Pressure: Generally, when a significant amount of cryptocurrency moves onto exchanges, it increases the available supply for trading, which can lead to selling pressure if those funds are intended to be liquidated. Liquidity Indicators: Exchange balances can give an idea of the readily available supply of an asset. High balances might suggest high potential liquidity for large trades. Sentiment Clues: Consistent outflows from exchanges (moving crypto to cold storage) are often seen as bullish indicators, suggesting holders plan to keep their assets long-term. Conversely, consistent inflows can be interpreted bearishly. Identifying Large Player Activity: Large, sudden movements like the one observed can signal activity from whales, institutions, or other significant market participants. Tracking these flows provides data points that complement traditional market analysis based on price charts and trading volume. Analyzing the Bitcoin Market Impact When a $484 million Bitcoin inflow occurs, traders and analysts immediately look for its impact on the spot price. Did Bitcoin’s price drop significantly shortly after this inflow was detected? Or did it hold steady? The potential impact on the Bitcoin market depends heavily on the intention behind the transfers. If this inflow was purely for selling, the market might see increased volatility and downward pressure. However, as CryptoQuant pointed out, the custody angle is vital. Many institutions and high-net-worth individuals use exchange custody services for security and convenience, even if they don’t intend to sell immediately. Depositing funds into a custody wallet on an exchange platform allows for easier and faster access if they *do* decide to trade in the future, or it might be part of a larger asset management strategy. It could also be related to over-the-counter (OTC) deals being settled or funds being moved in preparation for specific trading strategies that utilize exchange infrastructure. Beyond the Headlines: Deeper Crypto Analysis This event underscores the need for nuanced crypto analysis . Simply seeing a large inflow number and assuming a price crash would be an oversimplification. Effective analysis involves: Considering the Source: Which exchanges received the funds? Is it a retail-heavy platform or one known for institutional clients? Looking at Historical Context: Have similar inflows occurred recently? What were the market reactions then? Checking Other On-Chain Metrics: What are transaction counts doing? What about miner activity? Stablecoin flows? Combining On-Chain with Off-Chain Data: How does the inflow data correlate with news events, macroeconomic factors, or technical chart patterns? This particular $484M inflow, heavily concentrated on institutional platforms like Coinbase Prime, leans towards an interpretation that involves sophisticated players and potentially custody arrangements rather than an immediate, broad retail sell-off. While the funds are now in a position where they *could* be sold, their presence on custody platforms suggests intentions might be more complex than a simple market dump. Actionable Insight: For market participants, this event serves as a reminder to look beyond sensational headlines. A large inflow is a data point, but its meaning is derived from context. Pay attention to where the funds are going and consider the possibilities beyond just selling pressure, especially when institutional platforms are involved. Stay informed by following reliable on-chain data providers and combining their insights with broader market analysis. Summary The recent inflow of over $484 million in Bitcoin to exchanges, predominantly Coinbase, is a significant on-chain event. While large inflows can signal potential selling pressure, the concentration on institutional and custody-enabled platforms suggests the possibility of clients simply utilizing exchange custody services. This highlights the importance of detailed crypto analysis , looking beyond raw numbers to understand the context and potential motivations behind such large movements in the Bitcoin market . Tracking crypto exchange flow remains a crucial tool for gaining insight into potential market dynamics, but always consider the full picture.

Frustration ran high after the migration hiccups ahead of the June 28 upgrade, and many pioneers sold off in impatience. Just a month ago, Pi was comfortably trading above $1—now it feels like déjà vu as the coin tests lows down near $0.40. Triangle Pattern Signals Analysts have spotted a classic symmetrical triangle, with price pinching between roughly $0.54 and $0.74. This kind of squeeze means the next big move could be explosive. A push above $0.74, and holding that ground—might send Pi racing back toward, or even past, the $1 milestone. Support at $0.40: Make or Break The $0.40 zone has been Pi’s safety net for weeks, bouncing price each time it dips that low. A decisive close below $0.40 could open the door to deeper losses. On the flip side, holding firm there could spark a much‑needed relief rally. Pi2Day and Potential Catalysts With Pi2Day just around the corner on June 28, excitement is building. Any positive surprise—whether it’s smoother upgrades, a Fed decision that calms markets, or a big partnership announcement, could be the spark Pi needs. Pioneers are hoping that this “Day of Great Expectation” turns frustration into FOMO. Why Pi Is Under Pressure A flood of newly mined coins has outweighed real‑world demand, and without obvious use cases, many early adopters have cashed out. That oversupply is at the heart of Pi’s recent slide. Until mining cools off and practical applications emerge, price swings will likely feel lopsided. Looking Ahead If Pi can tame the supply tap and show genuine utility, a path back to $1 remains on the table. But the network will need more than wishful thinking—it needs real‑world adoption and patient holders. For now, all eyes are on the triangle squeeze and the events of Pi2Day to see whether Pi’s next big move is back up the mountain or further down the valley.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-19 05:52:52

This announcement, shared via the widely followed Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X, underscores the volatile nature of Middle Eastern geopolitics and its potential ripple effects across the world, including financial markets. For those following global events, especially in the context of potential market impacts, statements from figures like Trump carry significant weight. Geopolitical instability often translates into Market Volatility , affecting everything from oil prices to stock indices, and yes, even the often-unpredictable cryptocurrency market. The very mention of high-level discussions concerning a conflict zone signals the seriousness of the situation and the urgent need for de-escalation. Understanding the Iran-Israel Conflict The rivalry between Iran and Israel is deeply rooted, spanning decades and involving complex layers of political, religious, and strategic disagreements. It’s not a new phenomenon, but recent events have brought tensions to a boiling point. Understanding this backdrop is key to appreciating the significance of any potential Diplomatic Talks aimed at addressing it. Here are some core aspects of this long-standing tension: Regional Influence: Both nations vie for dominance and influence in the Middle East, supporting opposing proxies in various conflicts (e.g., Syria, Lebanon, Yemen). Iran’s Nuclear Program: Israel views Iran’s nuclear ambitions as an existential threat, while Iran insists its program is for peaceful purposes. Security Concerns: Israel faces threats from groups supported by Iran (like Hezbollah and Hamas), while Iran views Israel as an occupying force and a threat to regional stability. Direct Engagements: While often fought through proxies, there have been increasing instances of direct military confrontations, including cyberattacks, naval incidents, and aerial exchanges. These factors contribute to persistent Geopolitical Tensions that can flare up unexpectedly, sending shockwaves globally. Why Trump’s Comments Matter While no longer in office, Donald Trump remains a highly influential figure in global politics. His statements, particularly on foreign policy matters he was deeply involved with during his presidency (like the Iran nuclear deal or relations with Israel), are closely watched by governments, analysts, and markets alike. His mention of talks, even without specifying participants beyond the general context of the conflict, immediately elevates the profile of the situation. His administration took a firm stance against Iran, withdrawing from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and implementing significant sanctions. This history means his perspective on the current conflict and potential Diplomatic Talks is viewed through the lens of his past actions and potential future political aspirations. The Ripple Effect: Geopolitical Tensions and Market Volatility Global financial markets are highly sensitive to Geopolitical Tensions . Uncertainty stemming from conflicts, political instability, or diplomatic breakdowns can trigger significant price swings across various asset classes. Consider the typical reactions: Oil Prices: The Middle East is a major oil-producing region. Conflict or instability there directly threatens supply routes and production, often leading to spikes in oil prices. Safe-Haven Assets: Gold, U.S. Treasury bonds, and sometimes even certain currencies (like the Japanese Yen or Swiss Franc) are considered safe havens. Demand for these assets tends to increase during times of geopolitical stress, driving up their prices. Stock Markets: Equity markets generally react negatively to geopolitical uncertainty. Companies with exposure to the affected regions or those reliant on stable supply chains can see their values decline. Broader market indices often fall as investor confidence wanes. Cryptocurrency Market: The crypto market’s reaction is more complex and debated. While some argue Bitcoin acts as a digital safe haven uncorrelated with traditional finance, others point to its high correlation with tech stocks and its sensitivity to global liquidity and sentiment. During periods of intense Market Volatility driven by geopolitics, crypto prices can experience significant swings, sometimes following safe havens, sometimes risk assets. The news of impending talks, even if their outcome is uncertain, can itself introduce volatility as markets try to price in potential scenarios – from de-escalation to further conflict. What Do These Diplomatic Talks Entail? While details provided in the original snippet are sparse, the mention of Diplomatic Talks in the context of the Iran-Israel Conflict suggests efforts are being made at a high level to prevent further escalation. Such talks could involve: Mediation: A third party (like the U.S. or another major power) facilitating communication between the two sides. De-escalation Mechanisms: Discussing ways to reduce immediate military risks, such as establishing communication channels or agreed-upon rules of engagement. Addressing Root Causes: Potentially exploring broader issues contributing to the conflict, though this is often more complex and requires sustained negotiation. Setting Red Lines: Clarifying what actions would trigger a severe response from either side or involved third parties. The success of such talks hinges on the willingness of all parties involved to find common ground and prioritize stability over confrontation. The involvement, or even just the commentary, of figures like Trump adds another layer to the complex diplomatic landscape. Challenges and Opportunities in Diplomacy Achieving a breakthrough in the Iran-Israel Conflict through Diplomatic Talks faces significant challenges: Challenges: Deep-seated mistrust and historical grievances. Influence of hardline factions on both sides. Complexity of regional proxy networks. Disagreement over key issues like Iran’s nuclear program and regional security architecture. External influences from other global powers. Opportunities: Preventing a wider, potentially devastating regional war. Creating space for de-escalation and risk reduction. Potentially opening channels for future, more comprehensive negotiations. Providing a degree of predictability that could reduce Market Volatility . The mere act of holding talks is often seen as a positive step, indicating a preference for dialogue over immediate military action, even if the path ahead remains fraught with difficulty. Actionable Insights for Navigating Geopolitical Uncertainty For investors, traders, and anyone concerned about global stability, news related to the Iran-Israel Conflict and statements from figures like Trump serve as critical data points. Given the potential for increased Market Volatility , here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources reporting on geopolitical developments. Understand the context behind events. Assess Risk: Evaluate how potential escalation or de-escalation might impact your investments, particularly assets sensitive to geopolitical shifts like oil, gold, and potentially cryptocurrencies. Consider Diversification: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes and geographies to mitigate risk. Avoid Panic Reactions: Geopolitical events can trigger emotional responses. Make investment decisions based on analysis, not fear or hype. Monitor Key Indicators: Keep an eye on market reactions in real-time, including currency movements, commodity prices, and volatility indices. While Diplomatic Talks offer a glimmer of hope, the underlying Geopolitical Tensions remain, necessitating a cautious and informed approach. Conclusion: Watching Diplomacy Unfold The announcement by Trump regarding imminent talks on the Iran-Israel Conflict highlights the persistent and critical nature of Geopolitical Tensions in the Middle East. Such developments are key drivers of global events and can significantly contribute to Market Volatility . While the specific nature and participants of these Diplomatic Talks require further clarification, their potential impact on regional stability and global markets is undeniable. Staying informed about these high-stakes discussions is essential for understanding the forces shaping our complex world and navigating its associated uncertainties.

The token has dropped 14% this week and might face bearish pressure as analysts watch for a breakout. SUI Struggles Below $3 as Traders Watch for Breakout SUI has witnessed price swings over the last 24 hours. It dropped to $2.71 before rebounding to $2.92. SUI faced strong resistance at $2.82, and the price fell back to $2.78–$2.79. The token found support at $2.72–$2.75 and bounced several times. It may now move sideways as traders wait for the next breakout. SUI’s o pen interest has also taken a hit. For the first time in over three weeks, SUI’s open interest dropped to $1.19 billion, down over 40% from its all-time high of $2.05 billion. SUI may continue to struggle in the short term unless the buying momentum picks up. If SUI sees a trend reversal, it could bounce back to test resistance at $2.93 and possibly $3.50. The price might even aim for $4. On the flip side, if bearish pressure continues, SUI could slide down to its key support level near $2.40 this month. On-chain activity is booming, and the DeFi scene on Sui is thriving too. The 24‑hour DEX volume sits at $398 million, which shows heavy trading activity. Sui Ecosystem Booms as Analysts Eye Breakout Analysts said that Sui is showing strong growth across the board, making it one of the most promising ecosystems right now. Stablecoin volume has jumped from $400M in January to nearly $1.2B, while TVL has surged to $1.8B, ranking Sui 3rd among non-EVM chains. Wallet adoptions are accelerating as well, with the integration of Phantom and the rebranded SUI wallet Slush. SuiLend has reached over $600M in TVL, which is a 90% increase in the past month. A break above $3.30 could spark a major rally in SUI and set the stage for new all-time highs. Is $100 Within Reach for SUI? According to CoinCodex, by 2029, SUI could hit $12.05, a potential 323% gain from today’s price. For 2030, forecasts show a range between $6.00 and $10.87. CoinDCX predicts SUI could rise from $2.80 in 2025 to as high as $11.00 by 2030. The outlook remains bullish for the long term. For SUI to reach $100, it would require nearly 30x to 35x growth from even the most bullish targets. Most realistic forecasts for 2030 place SUI between $6 and $12. So, unless Sui sees massive adoption and becomes a top-tier blockchain, $100 remains a far-fetched dream as of now.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ZRX|SUI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-19 06:02:20

In the research report published today by Canaccord, it was emphasized that the future of stablecoins has not been clear for a long time due to regulatory uncertainties. However, this uncertainty has been significantly reduced with the passage of the “Guidance and Establishment of the United States Stablecoin National Innovation Act”, or GENIUS Act, by the Senate. According to the report, the Senate passage of this bill, which aims to bring stablecoin innovation back to the US, was a much more difficult process than it was to pass in the House of Representatives. However, the bipartisan support for the bill suggests that stablecoin regulation in the US is now very close. Related News: JPMorgan, the World's Largest Bank, Continues to Make Crypto Moves - They Didn't Skip Today Either Analysts say it’s only a matter of time before stablecoins are used as cash equivalents, not just in cryptocurrency trading pairs. With the U.S. government treating these assets like cash, it’s predicted that compatible stablecoins could significantly increase demand for short-term Treasury bonds due to the full reserve requirement. Additionally, it is assessed that with the global adoption of GENIUS-compatible stablecoins, the dollarization process could accelerate and these digital assets could further strengthen the global influence of the US dollar. *Not investment advice.

The core team behind the highly anticipated Polygon zkEVM has officially spun off into an independent entity. This strategic move, led by co-founder Jordi Baylina, marks a significant development for both the former Polygon team and the future of zero-knowledge technology. Why the Polygon zkEVM Team is Becoming ZisK The team responsible for building Polygon’s zkEVM solution has transitioned into a standalone Swiss startup named ZisK. This isn’t just a simple rebranding; it’s a full transfer of the team, along with all related code and intellectual property, into a new corporate structure. The primary goal for ZisK is to dedicate its focus entirely to advancing open-source, low-latency zkVM proving technology. This spin-off aligns with a broader strategic pivot happening within the Polygon Foundation . CEO Sandeep Nailwal has signaled intentions to sunset the existing, and perhaps underutilized, Polygon zkEVM chain. Instead, the foundation plans to double down on its core assets: the battle-tested Polygon PoS chain and the ambitious AggLayer aggregator project. What Does ZisK Aim to Achieve with zkVM Technology? ZisK’s mission is clear: to become a leader in zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) technology, specifically focusing on reducing the latency involved in generating proofs. Low-latency proving is crucial for many real-world applications of zero-knowledge proofs, including enabling faster transactions and more responsive dApps on zk-rollups and other scaling solutions. Their focus on open-source development means that the advancements made by Jordi Baylina and his team at ZisK will likely benefit the entire zero-knowledge ecosystem. This collaborative approach is a hallmark of the blockchain space and can accelerate innovation across multiple projects and chains. Key areas ZisK is expected to focus on: Developing highly optimized zkVM circuits. Improving the speed and efficiency of proof generation. Contributing open-source code and research to the community. Exploring new use cases for low-latency zk proofs. Understanding the Polygon Foundation ‘s Strategic Pivot The decision by the Polygon Foundation to shift focus away from the specific Polygon zkEVM chain and towards PoS and the AggLayer is a strategic one. It reflects a prioritization of resources and a refinement of Polygon’s long-term vision for scalability and interoperability. Polygon PoS remains one of the most widely used blockchain networks, boasting a large user base and thriving ecosystem. The AggLayer, on the other hand, represents Polygon’s bet on a future where different chains can seamlessly interact and share liquidity, creating a unified web of blockchains. While the existing Polygon zkEVM chain might be sunset, it’s important to note that the underlying technology and expertise developed by the team (now ZisK) are not lost. This knowledge will continue to advance within ZisK and potentially be utilized by other projects, including future Polygon initiatives that might leverage zkVM technology in different ways, perhaps integrated via the AggLayer. What This Means for the Ecosystem This development has several implications for the broader blockchain and zero-knowledge landscape: Increased Specialization: ZisK can now hyper-focus on zkVM proving technology without the demands of maintaining a full-fledged network like the Polygon zkEVM chain. Potential for Faster Innovation: A dedicated team with a singular technical focus can often move faster and push the boundaries of specific technologies. Uncertainty for Polygon zkEVM Users: Users and developers currently on the Polygon zkEVM chain will need clarity on the sunsetting timeline and migration paths. Strengthened Polygon PoS and AggLayer Focus: Polygon’s core efforts will now be more concentrated on their established chain and their ambitious interoperability layer. Open-Source Contributions: ZisK’s commitment to open source means potential benefits for the entire ZK space. The leadership of Jordi Baylina in this new venture is a positive sign, given his significant contributions to zero-knowledge technology within Polygon. His expertise will be invaluable in driving ZisK’s technical roadmap. The Future of Polygon zkEVM Technology (Outside the Chain) While the specific chain may be phased out by the Polygon Foundation , the technology itself, now residing with ZisK, remains highly relevant. The advancements in low-latency zkVM proving that ZisK aims to achieve could power future iterations of scaling solutions, potentially even those connecting through Polygon’s AggLayer. This spin-off can be viewed as a maturation of the technology. The team and IP are moving to an environment where they can specialize and innovate at a potentially faster pace, contributing foundational technology that others (including Polygon in the future) can build upon. Conclusion: A Strategic Evolution The spin-off of the Polygon zkEVM team into the independent ZisK, led by Jordi Baylina , is a significant strategic evolution. It allows a highly specialized team to focus exclusively on cutting-edge zkVM technology while enabling the Polygon Foundation to streamline its resources towards Polygon PoS and the AggLayer. While it introduces changes for users of the existing zkEVM chain, it ultimately aims to accelerate innovation in zero-knowledge proofs, potentially benefiting the entire blockchain ecosystem in the long run. The crypto world will be watching closely to see the advancements ZisK brings forth and how Polygon’s refined strategy unfolds.

According to a June 18 analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Burrakesmeci, one metric tells a compelling story. The 1 – Year Cumulative Buy/Sell Quote Volume Difference for Altcoins, excluding Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), now sits at –$36 billion. This level that suggests investors are still pulling money from the altcoin market. The net demand from traders putting buy versus sell quotes on altcoin pairs across exchanges is reflected in this metric. It often indicates peak interest and occasionally a local top when it flips positive, as it did in December 2024. The trend has since reversed, with sustained outflows rather than inflows, as confirmed by the current reading which is in extremely negative territory. In short, altcoin investors are still sitting on the sidelines, even as Bitcoin dominates headlines. You might also like: Altcoin season is over: Here’s what can make a project thrive | Opinion This is important since the altseason usually has a set rhythm. Early bull cycles see Bitcoin at the top, particularly after halving, as was the case in April 2024. This attracts capital. Investors frequently shift their gains into altcoins when Bitcoin cools and starts to consolidate. Large-cap rallies like Ethereum are fueled by this rotation, which is followed by sector-specific spikes in memecoins, AI tokens, and other narratives. However, conditions do not currently favor that change. The Altcoin Season Index is stuck below 30, far below the 75 threshold. Bitcoin dominance is still high at 64%, and risk appetite outside of BTC and ETH seems to be muted. Although the ETH/BTC ratio is rising, currently at 0.02405, and Ethereum has recently outperformed Bitcoin on a 90-day basis, these signals are preliminary and not conclusive. Macro conditions may also be delaying the altseason. The amount of capital available for speculative assets like altcoins is limited by continuous quantitative tightening and persistently high interest rates. If rate cuts occur or Bitcoin’s dominance wanes, some analysts predict a shift in late 2025. Others caution that the wait may last until 2026 if there is no clear Ethereum breakout or regulatory clarity. The signal is clear for the time being. The road to altcoin season is still blocked in the absence of a reversal in volume flows, and it is difficult to overlook the $36 billion in lost demand.

Authorities from the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office, the New York State Attorney General’s Office, and the New York State Department of Financial Services jointly disrupted a multi-layered cryptocurrency scam operation that had primarily targeted Russian-speaking residents in Brooklyn and across the United States. As part of the enforcement action, $140,000 in digital assets was seized, while an additional $300,000 was frozen in crypto accounts linked to the scheme. The scammers operated a malicious advertisement network across social media platforms that promoted dubious investment schemes to target unsuspecting crypto investors. The investigation into the scheme, known as “Black Hat” advertising, began in October 2024 when NYDFS detected a fake website, WhalesTrade.com, falsely displaying a BitLicense certification. The site was traced to a broader network of fraudulent platforms used to trick victims into sending cryptocurrency under the guise of high-return investment opportunities.

Once victims clicked on the ads, scammers shifted communication to encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, creating the illusion of legitimate investment interactions. Initial investments were met with fabricated account statements showing inflated returns, to motivate victims to send even more money. When users attempted to withdraw their funds, they were blocked or asked to pay bogus withdrawal fees and taxes . Eventually, scammers completely cut off communication and disappear. More than 300 victims have been identified, with Brooklyn alone accounting for over $1 million in estimated losses. Officials reported that Meta, Facebook’s parent company, shut down over 700 Facebook accounts tied to the scam after being alerted to the investigation. Authorities have also dismantled a network of more than 100 fraudulent domains and 17 registrar accounts used to lure unsuspecting investors. To bypass Facebook’s ad restrictions, the scammers hired “Black Hat” advertisers based in Vietnam and paid them with stolen crypto to run deceptive ads. Authorities found that the scammers converted Bitcoin into Vietnamese currency to fund the campaign, prompting a court order to freeze $300,000 in related accounts. This case is just one example in a string of scams that have weaponized digital advertising to steal from unsuspecting crypto investors. Similar tactics were seen earlier in 2024 when fake versions of platforms like Whales Market and Revoke Cash appeared as sponsored links on Google, tricking users into connecting their wallets to phishing sites. In some instances, even trusted services were impersonated with near-identical domain names, draining user funds through malicious scripts. Despite efforts by companies like Google and Meta to curb such abuse, fraudulent ads continue to surface.

Right now, that spotlight is firmly on artificial intelligence. With AI investments soaring past $110 billion in 2024, securing VC funding for AI startups is more competitive than ever. While the influx of capital presents opportunities, it also demands that early-stage companies find effective ways to stand out from the crowd. Beyond the Pitch: What Venture Capitalists Really Want Forget the glossy slides and perfect delivery. According to seasoned investors like Jill Chase of CapitalG, Kanu Gulati of Khosla Ventures, and Sara Ittelson of Accel, the real substance lies elsewhere. At Bitcoin World Sessions: AI, these venture capital experts shared insights that challenge conventional wisdom for AI founders seeking startup investment. Their consensus? Stop fixating on the ‘perfect pitch.’ While clarity is important, VCs are looking for deeper signals. Building genuine relationships and establishing trust with potential investors often matters more than rehearsing every line of a presentation. This approach helps VCs understand the team, the vision, and the underlying potential beyond the immediate market trends. Navigating the Hype Cycle and Competition for AI Startups The AI landscape is currently experiencing significant hype. For AI startups, this means navigating inflated expectations and the risk of being overshadowed or, conversely, fueling unsustainable growth. VCs are keenly aware of this cycle and look for startups with a clear strategy for long-term survival and growth, not just riding the current wave. A critical challenge discussed was competing with large incumbents. Big tech companies have resources, data, and established market positions. Startups need a compelling answer to how they will differentiate, find their niche, and gain traction without getting crushed. This often involves focusing on specific problems, leveraging unique data, or developing proprietary technology that provides a distinct advantage. Consumer Focus and Speed Drive Startup Investment Interestingly, even in the often complex world of B2B AI, a consumer-centric approach and speed remain powerful differentiators. VCs noted that companies that prioritize user experience, ease of adoption, and rapid iteration often win, regardless of whether their end customer is a business or an individual. The ability to quickly adapt to feedback and demonstrate tangible value is key to securing venture capital. Key attributes VCs seek: Strong Team: Passionate, knowledgeable founders with the ability to execute. Clear Problem/Solution: Addressing a real market need with a viable AI-powered solution. Demonstrated Traction: Early signs of product-market fit, user adoption, or revenue. Defensible Technology: Proprietary tech, data advantage, or network effects. Understanding of Market Dynamics: Awareness of competition, incumbents, and future trends. Trustworthiness: Honesty, transparency, and reliability in communication. Agents and Automation Reshaping the Playbook The rise of AI agents and automation is not just changing industries; it’s also changing how startups themselves operate. VCs are observing how these technologies can create more efficient, scalable business models. Startups leveraging automation internally or building agent-based solutions are seen as potentially having a structural advantage in the market, influencing their attractiveness for startup investment. Conclusion: Building Trust in a Competitive Landscape The path from Seed to Series C for AI startups in 2025 requires more than just a groundbreaking idea and a polished pitch deck. It demands resilience, a deep understanding of market dynamics, the ability to build trust with investors and customers, and a clear strategy for navigating hype and competition. Focusing on these core principles, as highlighted by leading venture capital firms, can significantly increase a startup’s chances of securing the necessary funding to scale and succeed in the AI era.

Here’s the Chart,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-cardano-ada-is-warming-up-for-a-major-rally-heres-the-chart/,"Recent technical developments suggest that Cardano (ADA) could be positioning itself for a potential upward move, following a week of notable downside activity. After declining nearly 10% from its local high of $0.73 to a low of around $0.60 between June 10 and June 17, ADA appears to be establishing a foundation for a reversal. Technical Structure Indicates Bullish Shift An analysis by MyCryptoParadise on TradingView highlights several early signs of a trend reversal on the 4-hour chart. At the time of his analysis, ADA traded close to $0.6245, attempting to hold support in a key region. The analyst highlighted an internal change of character (I-CHoCH) after a liquidity sweep below $0.62, suggesting bearish momentum is waning, and indicating a potential shift toward a more constructive market setup. Other analysts have predicted a massive upswing for ADA , and the presence of a bullish divergence on the MACD further supports this interpretation. While ADA registered a lower low, the histogram and signal line within the MACD showed higher lows. This decoupling often precedes a change in trend direction. Adding to the bullish case, a previous resistance zone between $0.63 and $0.64 has turned to support. The chart shows a reaction near the $0.6421 level, where ADA bounced after dropping to $0.61 on June 14. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Price Action and Risk Zones While the current trading level shows signs of stability, the next steps remain critical. Recent predictions suggest a bullish turn before June 30 , and a sustained hold above $0.63 would reinforce the short-term bullish setup. A break above minor resistance near $0.67 would open the door for further gains, potentially targeting the $0.70 region. This move would represent over a 10% increase from current levels, assuming the upward momentum is maintained. Whales have shown notable interest in ADA in 2025, and reclaiming the $0.7 could increase their confidence. However, closing below $0.62 could invalidate the current outlook. Derivatives Trends Suggest Bullish Leaning ADA’s derivatives data signals cautious optimism. Trading volume surged 45% to $1.26 billion, while open interest declined 4.07% to $747.58 million. Long liquidations totaled $1.6 million versus $236,000 for shorts, and funding rates remained positive. The overall long/short ratio was 0.9391, but Binance and OKX showed a stronger long bias, both above 2.4. However, options activity plunged 92.94%, indicating reduced institutional positioning and lower volatility expectations. Despite this, the lack of a clear downtrend keeps short-term sentiment tilted slightly bullish, with some projections suggesting a rise to $1 .

Midjourney, renowned for its stunning AI image generation capabilities, has officially launched its first AI video generation model, dubbed V1. This development is particularly interesting for our audience, often at the forefront of technological shifts and disruptive innovations, much like those seen in the cryptocurrency space. The introduction of Midjourney V1 marks a new chapter for the company and intensifies the race in the burgeoning AI video market. Introducing Midjourney V1: What You Need to Know Midjourney’s V1 model arrives as an image-to-video tool. Here’s a breakdown of its core functionality: Users upload an existing image or select one generated by Midjourney’s image models. V1 processes the image and produces a set of four distinct five-second video clips based on the input. At launch, V1 is accessible exclusively through Discord, mirroring Midjourney’s existing model access, and is available on the web interface. The company announced the launch via Twitter, highlighting its ease of use and accessibility, positioning it as the “first video model for everyone.” Exploring Midjourney V1 Features and Pricing Midjourney has built a reputation for offering creative control, and V1 includes some initial settings: An automatic animation option adds random motion to the image. A manual setting allows users to guide the animation with text descriptions. Users can control camera and subject movement intensity with “low motion” or “high motion” toggles. While the initial output is five seconds, users can extend videos by four seconds up to four times, potentially creating clips up to 21 seconds long. Early previews suggest the generated videos possess a distinctive, perhaps less photorealistic and more artistic or “otherworldly” quality, consistent with Midjourney’s image outputs. Pricing for AI video generation introduces a new structure. Midjourney states that generating a video will consume approximately eight times the resources of a standard image generation. This means users on limited plans will see their allotted generations decrease much faster when creating videos. At launch, the cheapest way to access V1 is through the $10/month Basic plan. Users on the $60/month Pro and $120/month Mega plans gain unlimited video generations when using the slower “Relax” mode. Midjourney plans to review and potentially adjust video pricing in the coming month. Midjourney V1 vs. the Competition in AI Video Generation The launch of V1 immediately places Midjourney in direct competition with established players in the AI video model space. Competitors include OpenAI’s Sora, Runway’s Gen 4, Adobe’s Firefly, and Google’s Veo 3. While many companies are focusing on creating highly controllable models suitable for commercial applications like generating B-roll for films or advertisements, Midjourney emphasizes its focus on tools for creative individuals rather than solely commercial use cases. However, the company does have broader ambitions. The Broader Vision: Beyond AI Video Models Midjourney CEO David Holz outlined the company’s long-term trajectory in a blog post. The release of their first Generative AI video model is not the final destination but a stepping stone towards creating AI models capable of “real-time open-world simulations.” Following the development of AI video models, Midjourney intends to pursue AI models for producing 3D renderings and eventually real-time AI models. This vision suggests a future where AI could enable complex, interactive digital environments. AI Tools, Copyright, and Legal Challenges The timing of the V1 launch is notable, coming just one week after Midjourney was reportedly sued by Disney and Universal Studios. The lawsuit alleges that images produced by Midjourney’s AI models infringe on the studios’ copyrights by depicting recognizable characters like Homer Simpson and Darth Vader. This legal action highlights a significant challenge facing developers of AI tools that are trained on vast datasets, often scraping images from the internet without explicit consent from copyright holders. Hollywood and the broader creative industries are grappling with the rapid advancement of AI image and video generation. There is a growing concern that these technologies could potentially replace or devalue the work of human artists, writers, and designers. Many media companies have alleged that these AI products are trained using their copyrighted content without permission, forming the basis of several ongoing legal battles. While Midjourney positions itself as catering to creative users rather than purely commercial interests, it is not immune to these legal and ethical debates surrounding AI training data and copyright infringement. Conclusion: A New Era for Midjourney Midjourney’s entry into AI video generation with V1 is a significant step, expanding its suite of creative AI tools. While the initial release features 5-second image-to-video clips and introduces a new pricing structure, it sets the stage for future developments, including longer videos, more control, and potentially more ambitious projects like real-time simulations. The launch occurs amidst increasing scrutiny and legal challenges regarding AI and copyright, a critical issue that the entire generative AI industry must navigate. How Midjourney’s V1 evolves and competes with other models, particularly in balancing accessibility, creative utility, and navigating legal landscapes, will be fascinating to watch.

This shift, which began shortly after the April 2024 halving, marks a critical turning point in Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) supply dynamics, according to a June 18 report by Fidelity Digital Assets. As of June 8, an average of 566 BTC per day is crossing into the “ancient supply” category, meaning the coins have not moved in 10 years or more. That figure now exceeds the network’s post-halving daily issuance rate of 450 BTC. Fidelity’s analysis stresses how the growing influence of long-term holders is redefining Bitcoin’s scarcity narrative in real-time. Dormant coins are often interpreted as a sign of conviction, or in some cases, permanent loss due to inaccessible private keys. Regardless of motive, the numbers are significant. Over 3.4 million BTC, more than 17% of the total supply, have not moved in at least a decade. That figure includes coins mined in Bitcoin’s early years, with Satoshi Nakamoto considered the first 10-year holder as of January 2019. You might also like: Bitcoin price steady as Fed keeps interest rates stable This trend is more than symbolic. Fidelity notes that fewer than 3% of days since 2019 have seen a decline in ancient supply, while the portion of coins held for five years or more is also decreasing far less often than it rises. At the same time, public companies are increasingly contributing to this long-term cohort. As of June 8, 27 listed firms held more than 800,000 BTC combined. Projections suggest ancient supply could account for 30% of all Bitcoin in circulation by 2035 if this pattern holds. Still, high conviction isn’t absolute. Since the 2024 U.S. election, the report notes that ancient supply has fallen day-to-day 10% of the time, about four times the historical average. For holders of five years or more, that volatility is even higher, with 39% of days showing net outflows. These movements partly explain the choppy price action in early 2025 and serve as a reminder that even long-term holders can be shaken in uncertain markets. Fidelity emphasizes that scarcity is not the only factor influencing price. However, when issuance is decreasing and long-term supply is tightening, there is a greater chance of upward price pressure, especially if institutional and new ETF product demand picks up speed.

The total valuation of the industry has dipped slightly to $3.26 trillion. Trading volumes, too, have taken a hit, down by 9% indicating cautious moves by market participants. Talking about blue chip coins, Bitcoin is changing hands at $104,991.34, while Ethereum trades at $2524.22. XRP is slightly down at $2.16, holding on to gains from earlier in the week. The business appears to be in a consolidation phase, with volumes reducing and price ranges tightening. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Bitcoin price continues to hover around the $105k mark, showing resilience despite geopolitical instability. On the charts, BTC has formed a symmetrical triangle, hinting at a potential breakout, although the direction remains uncertain. It is worth noting that the support lies at $103,600, and a break below this could drag BTC toward the psychological $100k mark. Contrarily, the bulls must reclaim their foothold at $105,500 and aim for a breakout toward $108,000, where significant resistance awaits. However, with intraday volume at $48.42 billion, down nearly 9%, any upside may be capped unless fresh momentum arrives. Curious about BTC’s long-term growth? Read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction Ethereum has been range-bound, with prices slipping 0.54% to $2524.22. However, whale wallets have been actively accumulating, which is a healthy sign for a possible breakout. Traders should take note that the 24H low of $2469.05 serves as immediate support. If ETH price holds above $2,500, a short-term rally to $2,600 is possible. Conversely, falling below $2,460 could take ETH back toward the $2,400 demand zone. That being said, the drop in 24H volume by 17.65% may reflect weakening conviction among retail traders. Interested in stacking some Ether?

Its relatively stable price at $2.16 comes in the wake of positive sentiment from the Canadian XRP ETF approval, which has kept the asset in the spotlight. Technically speaking, XRP is trading close to resistance at $2.18. A bullish breakout could push it toward the $2.30 region. On the downside, support rests at $2.12, and a slip below that may open the gates to $2.00. Despite the price stability, the 14.94% drop in volume signals hesitation in the rally’s continuation.

Amid this vibrant landscape, investor interest is notably gravitating toward a compelling new contender: the Neo Pepe Coin presale. With over $1.1 Million already raised at a token price of $0.07, Neo Pepe Coin is swiftly proving its appeal beyond mere meme hype. What distinguishes Neo Pepe Protocol is its commitment to true decentralization through comprehensive DAO governance and a community-managed treasury, ensuring transparency, active participation, and structural integrity. As XRP and LINK capitalize on macroeconomic trends and enhanced technological adoption, Neo Pepe Protocol emerges as a significant grassroots-driven addition worth close attention. XRP & Chainlink Lead Charge Amid Renewed Crypto Confidence XRP and Chainlink (LINK) are currently driving a reinvigorated crypto rally. Chainlink recently hit fresh all-time highs, buoyed by expanding real-world use cases, notably through JPMorgan’s CCIP and oracle infrastructure trials. XRP, meanwhile, surged approximately 2.5% to $2.20, driven by significant corporate accumulation from entities such as Webus, VivoPower, and Wellgistics, collectively buying over $470 million in XRP, underscoring its appeal for swift, cost-effective settlements. Additionally, on-chain analytics reveal over 90% of XRP’s circulating supply is currently profitable, reinforcing bullish sentiments. Investors Shifting Attention from Traditional Altcoins Amid uncertainties plaguing established blue-chip altcoins like ADA, SOL, and XRP, investors increasingly pivot toward emerging tokens with compelling narratives and innovative frameworks. This shift is driven by a combination of stagnant price performance, skepticism regarding scalability, and diminishing innovation among legacy altcoins. High-potential, community-driven projects such as Neo Pepe Coin , characterized by fresh tokenomics and engaged grassroots communities, are capturing investor imagination. These initiatives represent opportunities for speculative upside and resonate culturally, making them attractive alternatives to traditional blue-chip altcoins. Neo Pepe Coin– Steering Meme Wave with Purpose Neo Pepe Protocol stands out as a meme coin uniquely positioned due to its structured approach, community-led governance, and strategic exchange listings. The project’s robust auto-liquidity mechanism automatically channels 2.5% of transaction fees into liquidity pools on platforms like Uniswap, with LP tokens permanently burned, thereby reinforcing price stability and market trust. Why Neo Pepe Protocol Stands Apart: DAO Governance: Holders of $NEOP tokens have the power to vote on critical decisions, including strategic exchange listings, directly shaping the coin’s trajectory. Governance decisions involve a structured voting system requiring a 5% quorum of total token supply, followed by mandatory timelock periods ensuring transparency and security. Structured Presale: A meticulously planned 16-stage presale, featuring incrementally rising prices and limited token allocations, rewarding early participation. Each presale stage features a capped allocation of tokens, creating urgency and exclusivity. Early stages offer significantly discounted token prices, providing tangible incentives for early adopters. Immutable Contracts: Smart contracts are non-upgradable and transparent, ensuring security and stability from inception. The contracts adhere to OpenZeppelin’s battle-tested standards and include gasless voting features enabled by ERC20Votes, providing a seamless and cost-effective governance experience. Community Managed Treasury: Treasury activities, including token burns, liquidity provision, and marketing campaigns, are strictly governed through community proposals and timelocked executions. The treasury’s secure architecture mandates all fund movements to pass through community approval, adding an extra layer of protection against unauthorized actions. Crypto League Spotlights Neo Pepe’s Distinctive Edge w/ Thoughtful Analysis In their detailed exploration, Crypto League offers viewers an insightful breakdown of Neo Pepe Coin ’s innovative features and presale appeal. They particularly commend the project’s structured token distribution and advanced auto-liquidity system, suggesting these mechanisms could underpin long-term stability. While maintaining a balanced stance, Crypto League lightly notes potential areas for improvement, such as ensuring sustained community involvement and steady adoption. Overall, their analysis positions Neo Pepe as a standout among emerging crypto projects, balancing realistic expectations with genuine enthusiasm about its future trajectory. Could Neo Pepe Protocol Be Breakout Star of this Rally? Amid current market optimism, Neo Pepe Coin presents an enticing blend of meme-culture appeal and substantial decentralized governance. With a fixed total supply of 1 billion tokens, ongoing independent security audits, and comprehensive transparency, the Neo Pepe Protocol is set to transcend traditional meme coin volatility, providing tangible long-term structure and vision.

On June 18, 2025, the official X account of a16z was compromised, granting unauthorized access to malicious actors who used the platform to promote a fake Solana-based token under the name “$a16z.” The breach lasted for a brief period, during which the attackers posted malicious links and false promotions to the account’s audience of over 850,000 followers. One of the posts falsely claimed, “It’s Official: $a16z Launches Its Own Token. Today marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of crypto @solana,” alongside a wallet address used to bait users into buying. Screenshot of a post shared during the a16z X account hack | Source: X Several other posts pushed fake giveaways and promises of free tokens, including one claiming a $5 million airdrop, all designed to lure unsuspecting users into engaging with the compromised content. On-chain data revealed that the fraudulent token briefly pumped in value following the posts, before crashing nearly 90% in a typical pump-and-dump pattern. You might also like: a16z backs EigenLayer with $70m token buy amid EigenCloud launch a16z regained control of the account shortly after and swiftly deleted the fraudulent content. In a statement , the firm confirmed the breach was limited to its X account and reassured users that none of the promotions came from them. “Earlier today, our X account was briefly compromised. During that time, the account promoted a token and other fake content— none of which originated from a16z. Apologies for any confusion caused by the clowns who temporarily took over our account,” the statement read. The firm’s response received mixed reactions from followers, with many raising concerns about the account’s security. Some users claimed to have fallen victim to the scheme and called on the firm to issue refunds . This is not the first time an a16z-affiliated account has been targeted. Back in February, the personal X account of a16z founder Chris Dixon (Shaw) was similarly compromised and used to promote a fake project. At the time, the co-founder described the breach as carefully planned and apologized to those affected by the scheme.

With Solana (SOL) holding strong momentum, attention is shifting toward powerful alternatives like Cardano (ADA) and a fast-rising DeFi gem still flying under the radar Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Cardano, currently trading around $0.64, is regaining steam thanks to renewed ecosystem growth and smart contract adoption, making it one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in for long-term value. But it’s Mutuum Finance that’s triggering serious FOMO, as it positions itself as the next big crypto to explode. The project is in its phase 5 of its presale and it’s priced at $0.03. Already, more than $10.8 million has been raised in the presale, with 12,200 early investors participating so far. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges Past $10.8M Attracts Over 12,200 Investors Mutuum Finance is quickly establishing itself as a major force in the DeFi space, with its presale already surpassing $10.8 million in funding and drawing in more than 12,200 early investors. The momentum is real and building fast. Currently, MUTM tokens are priced at $0.03, but upcoming presale rounds will see the price rise to $0.035 in the sixth stage. With demand soaring, MUTM’s first-mover advantage is proving powerful, this may be one of the smartest early entries in DeFi for 2025. $100,000 MUTM Giveaway: 10 Chances to Win $10K Mutuum Finance is a new protocol eager to reward the first supporters it has on its platform and has opened a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 participants will be selected and offered 10,000 MUTM tokens. This campaign will be an acknowledgment of the rapidly expanding community in the project as well as gratitude to the initial investors. However, the clock is ticking. Do not lose the opportunity to be one of the winners and at the same time gaining a stake as one of the most discussed new projects in DeFi. Built for Trust, Backed by Transparency While many DeFi projects fall short of their goals, Mutuum Finance is proving it’s here to stay. Its smart contracts have been fully audited by Certik, one of the most respected names in blockchain security. That means investors can trust the platform’s code is solid, secure, and built with transparency in mind. But Mutuum Finance is about more than just safety, it’s building a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum. Designed to provide price stability and deep liquidity, this stablecoin will serve both retail users and institutions, helping to build a trustworthy financial ecosystem for the long haul. A Dual-Lending Model That Works for Everyone Mutuum Finance is a flexible, innovative lending platform that employs a cross between Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. In P2C, users are suppliers of liquidity, which is usually in the form of USDT and the returns earned are stable and predictable. It would be passive income so that you can make profits and save the environment. However, P2P format gives investors and lenders an opportunity to define their conditions and interrelate without intermediaries. It is trustless, transparent, and provides the lending experience with full control within the hands of the users. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stealing the spotlight this altcoin season, with $10.8M+ raised and over 12,200 investors already in. Now in Phase 5 at $0.03, early buyers can lock in 100% ROI before launch at $0.06.

One such area is professional services, particularly accounting, now being revolutionized by artificial intelligence. A key player making waves is Multiplier, a startup founded by former Stripe executive Noah Pepper. Multiplier is carving out a unique niche by acquiring existing service businesses and supercharging them with AI, a strategy now fueling its impressive Multiplier Funding round. From Software Sales to AI-Powered Rollups Originally conceived in late 2022, Multiplier began with the intention of selling software solutions directly to tax accountants. However, the landscape shifted dramatically with the advent of powerful generative AI tools like ChatGPT. Founder Noah Pepper quickly recognized that the true potential wasn’t just in selling software to accounting firms, but in fundamentally changing how these professional service firms operate using AI. Pepper candidly shared, “I realized I was barking up the wrong tree by trying to build a SaaS business, and instead I should figure out how to make these people more effective.” This pivotal insight led to a strategic pivot towards an acquisition-based model. The Citrine Success Story: A Blueprint for AI Accounting The first real-world test of Multiplier’s new strategy came with the acquisition of Citrine International Tax. Citrine was a small, two-person firm specializing in cross-border tax accounting services. Multiplier integrated its proprietary AI capabilities into Citrine’s operations, effectively transforming the boutique provider. The results were compelling: Enhanced Efficiency: AI tools automated significant portions of manual work. Profit Margin Growth: Citrine more than doubled its profit margins post-integration. Business Expansion: Multiplier not only improved margins but also facilitated Citrine’s overall growth. This success story validated Multiplier’s hypothesis: acquiring existing businesses and enhancing them with AI is a highly effective way to scale professional services. Securing Significant Multiplier Funding: $27.5 Million Boost Based on the proven success of the Citrine model, Multiplier, now operating under the name Multiplier Holdings, announced a substantial funding achievement. The company has successfully raised a total of $27.5 million across its seed and Series A financing rounds. Key investors backing Multiplier’s vision include: Series A Leader: Lightspeed Venture Partners Seed Leader: Ribbit Capital Additional Participation: SV Angel This significant capital injection provides Multiplier with the resources needed to accelerate its acquisition strategy and further develop its AI Accounting platform. The Rise of AI Rollups: A New Venture Capital Trend Multiplier is at the forefront of a burgeoning trend in the venture capital world: the AI-powered roll-up. This strategy involves startups acquiring multiple smaller, established service businesses and then leveraging AI to streamline operations, increase efficiency, and drive growth across the consolidated entity. Prominent investors are increasingly interested in this model, seeing it as a powerful way to scale people-focused businesses that were previously difficult to grow rapidly. Firms like General Catalyst, Elad Gil, Thrive, and Khosla Ventures are also backing companies pursuing similar strategies across various service sectors. Justin Overdorff, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, highlighted the transformative nature of AI in enabling this trend, stating, “Until AI existed, none of this was possible.” Lightspeed itself is actively exploring this space, having already invested in several other unannounced AI-powered roll-up companies in addition to Multiplier. Why Target Smaller Firms for AI Rollups? According to Lightspeed’s Justin Overdorff, the AI roll-up strategy is particularly effective when targeting smaller companies. The reasoning is straightforward: smaller firms are typically more agile and open to adopting new technologies and changing existing workflows compared to larger, more entrenched organizations. “If you go to an accounting firm that has 200 accountants, it’s unlikely to get adopted at a [high] rate,” Overdorff noted. This focus on smaller, receptive businesses allows Multiplier to more easily integrate its AI Accounting solutions and demonstrate tangible benefits quickly, as seen with the two-person Citrine firm. Multiplier’s Vision: Challenging the Big Four with AI Multiplier’s ambitions extend far beyond consolidating small tax firms. The company’s long-term goal is to build a formidable, AI-powered competitor capable of challenging the dominance of the traditional ‘Big Four’ accounting firms. By systematically acquiring high-quality service providers and integrating advanced AI, Multiplier aims to offer superior efficiency and potentially more competitive pricing. Noah Pepper emphasizes that Multiplier isn’t just buying businesses; they are partnering with leaders who are enthusiastic about integrating and customizing AI to elevate their operations. “It’s a little bit like a venture-style business where you’re looking to make a bet on this leader who you think is just amazing in their category,” Pepper explained. This approach ensures that the human expertise remains central while AI serves as a powerful accelerator. The Future of Fintech Startups and Professional Services Multiplier’s success story underscores a significant shift in the landscape for Fintech Startups and professional services. The focus is moving beyond simply building software to enabling human professionals with cutting-edge technology. The AI roll-up model represents a powerful new avenue for growth, attracting substantial Venture Capital investment. This trend suggests a future where AI doesn’t necessarily replace professionals entirely but empowers them to be significantly more productive, efficient, and capable. Multiplier’s journey from a SaaS concept to a successful AI-powered acquisition engine highlights the dynamic opportunities emerging at the intersection of AI, finance, and traditional services. Summary: Multiplier’s AI-Fueled Ascent Multiplier, led by former Stripe executive Noah Pepper, has rapidly evolved from a software vendor to a leader in AI-powered service roll-ups. By acquiring firms like Citrine International Tax and enhancing them with advanced AI, Multiplier has demonstrated the potential to dramatically increase efficiency and profitability in professional services. This success has culminated in a significant Multiplier Funding round of $27.5 million, backed by prominent investors like Lightspeed Venture Partners and Ribbit Capital. Multiplier is pioneering the AI Rollups trend, aiming to build a powerful, AI-driven competitor in the accounting sector by leveraging technology to amplify human expertise in acquired firms. This strategic approach is attracting substantial Venture Capital and signals a transformative period for Fintech Startups targeting traditional industries with AI solutions, particularly in the realm of AI Accounting .

Currently priced at just $0.0269, this deflationary token offers incredible upside for those seeking sub‑dollar tokens with actual mechanics behind the hype. Its total supply is capped at 1.9 billion, and its viral presale has already raised over $240,000. What truly makes Angry Pepe Fork a cheap altcoin presale worth considering is its innovative staking model. Investors can earn up to 10,000% APY through an ETH-only pool, with tiered bonuses ranging from 5% to 20% depending on when you jump in. The earlier, the better. And then there’s the GambleFi layer, mini-games built into the ecosystem that burn tokens with each play, creating constant deflationary pressure. Add in CommunityFi rewards and the potential for upcoming CEX listings, and Angry Pepe Fork becomes more than just a low-price meme; it’s a low-cap gem with serious fuel. For those seeking early adopter gains in the 2025 presale cycle, Pepe’s forked path looks golden. Remittix: Remittance Token at $0.0781 Next up in the race for top under $1 crypto presales is Remittix, currently priced at $0.0781. Focused on streamlining cross-border money transfers, Remittix utilises stablecoin swaps to eliminate high foreign exchange (FX) fees and long wait times, targeting real-world financial friction. It’s building a permissioned DeFi network that promises sub-penny transactions, with a roadmap that includes compliance integration and regulatory approval for remittance corridors. This gives Remittix an edge among cheap altcoin presales looking for long-term use cases. Early backers benefit from a staking pool with moderate returns and a stable asset model. While it doesn’t have the meme appeal of Angry Pepe Fork, its utility-driven design may attract conservative investors seeking a sub-dollar token with low volatility. However, in terms of virality and short-term ROI potential, Angry Pepe Fork still dominates. Lightchain: Green NFTs for Pennies Lightchain offers an eco-conscious alternative in the low-cap gem market. Priced at just a few cents, it’s a sub‑dollar token leveraging a carbon-neutral Layer‑2 with Proof-of-Stake validation. Its pitch centres around sustainable NFT minting and an eco-friendly creator economy. Although its infrastructure is promising, Lightchain’s funding and community growth remain modest compared to Angry Pepe Fork. There’s less buzz, fewer whales, and limited staking incentives. For now, it sits quietly behind the leading frogs and remittance rails in the 2025 presale momentum race. Final Thoughts Among the hottest under-$1 crypto presales, Angry Pepe Fork reigns supreme. It’s a combo of meme energy, massive APYs, GambleFi deflation, and a sub-$0.03 price tag that creates the perfect storm for high-risk, high-reward seekers. While Remittix and Lightchain show promise, Angry Pepe Fork remains the crown jewel for anyone seeking early adopter gains in the 2025 presale market.

Here’s What Happened",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-29000-surge-on-coinbase-heres-what-happened/,"Edward Farina, the CEO of Alpha Lions Academy, drew attention on social media to an extraordinary surge in trading volume for the XRP/USD pair on Coinbase. Initially, Farina shared data showing a 24-hour volume increase of 12,495.31% for XRP on Coinbase, citing analytics from Coinglass. A short while later, this figure was surpassed by a revised update showing a 24-hour percentage increase of 29,140.38%, with the spot trading volume reaching $246.20 million. This unusual and massive spike in volume coincided with increased market activity around XRP across multiple platforms. According to the latest Coinglass heatmap data, Coinbase’s XRP/USD volume was among the highest in the market, trailing only behind Binance and briefly overtaking other exchanges such as Bybit, OKX, and Kraken. $XRP VOLUME IS UP 12495.31% on @coinbase What is going on???? pic.twitter.com/gDe1EmM2lo — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 16, 2025 ETF News Fueling Market Sentiment The trading surge may be closely tied to recent announcements regarding the potential launch of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). As shared by X user Nitinahuja and cited in community responses, Purpose Investments is reportedly set to launch Canada’s first spot XRP ETF on June 18, 2025. The product, to be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker XRPP, will offer investors direct exposure to XRP in a regulated format. This development marks a significant milestone in the institutional adoption of XRP . Purpose Investments had previously made headlines for launching the world’s first spot Bitcoin ETF in 2021. Their move into XRP reflects growing regulatory acceptance and institutional confidence in the asset. The Ontario Securities Commission’s green light signals a broader shift in how financial institutions are approaching digital assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Times Tabloid Confirms ETF Details and U.S. Regulatory Update Times Tabloid corroborated these developments, reporting that the news of Purpose Investments’ spot XRP ETF has already driven a notable market reaction. XRP saw a 7% price surge, rising from $2.16 to $2.30 within 24 hours. This move significantly outperformed Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market, indicating heightened interest specifically in XRP. In addition to the Canadian ETF, Times Tabloid also reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to deliver a decision today, June 17, 2025, on Franklin Templeton’s spot XRP ETF application. The ruling is expected to have a considerable impact on the market, especially given the SEC’s historical stance on digital asset classifications and ETF approvals. Growing Market Participation and Institutional Confidence The sharp rise in XRP volume on Coinbase, particularly over such a short window, suggests intensified trading activity that may be driven by both institutional positioning and retail anticipation. The prospect of two major ETF announcements within the same week—one confirmed in Canada and another pending in the U.S.—appears to be the central factor influencing current momentum. The combination of regulatory clarity, increased institutional involvement, and significant price movement indicates a potentially transformative moment for XRP’s market profile. As of now, all eyes remain on the SEC decision expected later today, which could either reinforce or temper the current trajectory of interest in XRP trading pairs, especially on U.S.-based platforms such as Coinbase.

46330400,https://invezz.com/?p=2769120,1750318527,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"ETF filings rise in 2025 — altcoin summer looms, MUTM might be leading the charge",https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/19/etf-filings-rise-in-2025-altcoin-summer-looms-mutm-might-be-leading-the-charge/,"2025 has seen an upsurge in altcoin ETF filings, with around 31 filed in H1 of the year. The filings have been prompted by regulatory optimism due to pending bills in the US Senate and Congress. In the past, the SEC has delayed approval for altcoin ETFs, prioritizing bitcoin. Following Trump’s victory, there has been renewed optimism that more ETFs could be approved. One notable example of these filings is for a BNB spot ETF made by VanEck. Analysts are optimistic that the SEC could approve up to 10 of these ETFs in 2025. Since the first spot ETF approvals in 2024, optimism has been building up. It marked a pivotal moment for the crypto sector that led to a flood of mainstream capital. Could it trigger an altcoin summer? When the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were approved back in 2024, it led to a mini rally that took the price of Bitcoin to a new all-time high. In 2025, with the SEC sounding more accepting of the crypto sector, a slew of approvals could ignite an altcoin summer. Many investors are taking this opportunity to position themselves to benefit from this expected flood of capital into the crypto sector. One tactic they are using is to scope out promising market opportunities and invest in them before the rest of the market finds out. A good example of this is the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale, which has recently become a favorite of smart investors looking to ride the altcoin summer wave to the top. Analysts forecast that MUTM tokens could increase in value by 20x or more once they go live. A deep dive into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized non-custodial lending protocol that aims to take the DeFi sector to the next level. On the protocol, users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. Lenders can deposit their funds into a pool on the protocol to earn interest. The interest they earn is based on the pool utilization rate. As more borrowers take loans from a pool, the utilization rate rises, which increases the interest rate. The rising interest rate forces borrowers to repay loans to avoid the higher interest. Meanwhile, it incentivizes lenders to deposit more assets in the pool to benefit from the higher yields. The growing liquidity in the pools lowers the interest rate, which helps the protocol achieve optimal capital efficiency. When lenders deposit their assets in a pool, they receive mtTokens in exchange. For instance, when a lender deposits $2,300 worth of ETH in a pool, they receive mtETH tokens in return. These tokens represent the value of their original deposit plus any interest accrued. They provide an easy and convenient way for lenders to keep track of the interest growth on their assets. Another benefit of mtTokens is that they grant holders access to the full liquidity of their assets. These tokens are based on the ERC20 token standard. Consequently, holders can use them to take advantage of crypto market opportunities in real time. All the while, their capital continues to accrue interest in the pools. The MUTM token presale Mutuum Finance is currently in phase 5 of its presale, where tokens are going for $0.03 each. The current token price is a 200% increase from the phase 1 price, where tokens were going for $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6 of the token presale, the price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. The presale has raised over $10.75 million so far from around 12,200 buyers. So far, around 40% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 of the presale have been sold in just over two weeks since they were launched. This intense pace is due to several reasons, key amongst them being the recent analysts’ forecasts on MUTM tokens. According to crypto analysts, the price of MUTM tokens could go up by 2,450% when they go live. Based on that projection, a $1,600 investment in the presale could grow into $39,200. That is a massive return that seasoned investors are doing everything to get hold of. Every exit opportunity that they get to exit elsewhere in the market is being utilized to grow their MUTM presale token holdings. Another major source of motivation for presale buyers is the planned beta version launch of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) protocol. The launch is expected to inspire new buyers to join the project through MUTM token purchases on the open market. That could increase the upward price momentum and take it to astronomical heights. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a lucrative entry point into the upcoming altcoin summer. With a slew of crypto ETFs expected to be approved this year, this presents your best opportunity for massive gains. Do not let this wonderful opportunity pass you by.

The Seychelles-based exchange teamed up with BitGo Singapore and will use the crypto custodian's Go Network for off-exchange settlement (OES), KuCoin said. ""KuCoin’s full suite of products — spot, margin, options, and perpetual futures — can now be accessed through Go Network, ensuring assets remain protected,"" the exchange said in Thursday's announcement . As crypto companies seek to cash in on increasing crypto institutional adoption , they're faced with having to introduce tools that a familiar in TradFi. In this case, institutional clients' assets remain in BitGo Singapore's storage, following the model of separating custody and execution to mitigate counterparty and systemic risk. For some, what KuCoin aims to offer has an echo of the now defunct Silvergate Bank's Exchange Network (SEN) platform, which helped institutions move funds to exchanges.

While computation and storage have seen real breakthroughs, oracle infrastructure still relies heavily on permissioned setups, opaque pricing, and manual onboarding. The result is a bottleneck that slows innovation and burdens newer chains with long lead times and steep costs. Blocksense , a zero-knowledge-native oracle protocol launched in 2024, set out to change that. One year after raising a $4 million pre-seed round, the team has evolved from early-stage concept to active deployments across more than two dozen ecosystems. Live feeds now serve builders on Aztec, Citrea, Pharos, Aurora, TAC, Plume, BIMA, and Manta Network, with the protocol preparing to join EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS), and its SDK entering public release. From Seed Round to Ecosystem Integration In mid-2024, Blocksense raised funding to build oracle infrastructure from scratch. Programmable, verifiable, and open by design. That vision has materialized into a protocol with measurable traction. It uses a ZK rollup-inspired architecture that allows feed updates to be batched and verified through zero-knowledge proofs. This drastically reduces on-chain cost while maintaining full integrity. Consensus is secured using zkSchellingPoint , where reporters vote in secret and are only rewarded if their submissions match the final majority. These aren’t theoretical claims. Blocksense’s system is already live in testnet environments, with pull-model feeds supporting DeFi protocols, prediction markets, real-world attestations, and emerging use cases in AI inference. Oracle-as-Code: Programmability Comes to Data Feeds What truly distinguishes Blocksense from earlier oracle models is its programmability . Legacy oracles operate as walled gardens. Developers often need approvals just to get a new feed listed — a process that can take weeks and limit experimentation. Blocksense flips that model. With its SDK, developers can define oracle logic in a WebAssembly-compatible format, specifying exactly what data to fetch, how to process it, and under what conditions to publish it. Once deployed, these scripts can be executed by node operators and verified on-chain — without any centralized bottlenecks. This shift from “oracle-as-a-service” to “oracle-as-code” unlocks a wide range of new use cases: Pharos uses programmable feeds to resolve prediction markets based on game-theoretic input. TAC triggers smart account actions only when multi-agent intent conditions are met. Citrea leverages custom scripts to publish Bitcoin L2 state views to Ethereum. BIMA verifies off-chain deliberation outcomes from human and AI collectives. Plume relies on oracle scripts to validate real-world asset metadata from partner registries. Manta Network experiments with feeds that verify compliance proofs for zk-based DeFi access. The core design: developers write the logic, node operators execute it, and a zero-knowledge circuit verifies that the votes and aggregation were processed correctly — including cryptographic signature validation and consensus logic. The result is a verifiable, permissionless, and expressive oracle layer designed for modular web3. Scaling Securely Without Sacrificing Trustlessness Blocksense avoids centralized coordination through a blend of cryptography and incentives. Reporters are selected privately and vote without visibility into the network’s state. A structure that discourages collusion and bribery. The system then uses a ZK circuit to prove that only valid votes were counted and that results matched the majority. To support this, the team has grown to 30+ across protocol engineering, cryptography, and developer support. While initial operations are backed by a trusted node set, decentralization is evolving — with open script publishing already live and full operator participation on the roadmap. The upcoming EigenLayer integration will deepen security by allowing Ethereum-aligned stakers to secure Blocksense as an AVS, aligning incentives across protocols, operators, and feed authors. What’s Next for Oracle Infrastructure? Blocksense envisions oracles not just as data feeds, but as middleware for intersubjective truth . The kind needed to verify AI outputs, trigger intent-based contracts, or synchronize decisions across modular systems. For Q2 and beyond, the team is focused on: Finalizing the public SDK for permissionless script creation Expanding support for non-price data formats and AI-related feeds Automating deployment pipelines for new rollups and alt-VMs Scaling incentives for reporters via MEV/OEV participation and AVS yield alignment With its 30+ network integrations, Blocksense is already powering applications that would be impossible to serve through legacy oracle frameworks. Conclusion In 2024, Blocksense raised capital to challenge how oracle data is produced, verified, and consumed. One year later, it has turned that capital into live infrastructure — tested, adopted, and used by real-world developers. Where many protocols celebrate fundraising as a milestone, Blocksense sees it as a starting point. What matters more is the shift it represents: away from permissioned data, toward a world where any developer can define how truth is derived on-chain. For builders seeking autonomy over their data layer, that shift is already underway.",Information,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|ZK,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-19 07:37:12

The move suggests institutional buyers may be quietly accumulating at lower levels as market participants brace for continued volatility. News Background Dogecoin’s rebound comes in the wake of intense selling pressure sparked by escalating geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran. The sharp market-wide correction, which triggered mass liquidations, briefly pushed DOGE down more than 7% intraday on Wednesday. Meanwhile, macroeconomic headwinds persist. The U.S. Federal Reserve continues to maintain restrictive monetary policy, keeping rates at 4.25%–4.50% while actively reducing its balance sheet — a dynamic that has historically weighed on riskier bets such as DOGE. Still, the memecoin remains one of the most liquid assets in the crypto space, with daily turnover near $1.37 billion and market cap holding above $24.7 billion. Elsewhere, technical indicators show DOGE entering oversold territory, and social sentiment data from LunarCrush reveals an 86% positive tone across 16,000+ mentions, suggesting continued community conviction even amid price volatility. DOGE’s near-term outlook may hinge on regulatory developments, including a potential U.S. spot ETF decision, as well as continued adoption on DeFi platforms such as Coinbase’s Base network where wrapped DOGE is gaining traction. Price Action DOGE saw its sharpest decline during the 13:00 hour, dropping to $0.164 on a 591M volume spike — the highest of the day. The strong bounce that followed pushed prices back above $0.171, where the memecoin found near-term equilibrium. Price action has since consolidated in a tight band between $0.170 and $0.1696, with small volume bursts suggesting accumulation at lower levels. Technical Analysis Recap DOGE posted a 4.7% recovery, rising from $0.164 to $0.171. Major liquidation-driven selloff occurred at 13:00, with volume peaking at 591M units. Volume-based support established at $0.164; resistance remains firm near $0.172. Recent candles show signs of accumulation, particularly during the 02:00–02:02 period (3.4M volume). RSI at 33.29 suggests DOGE may be nearing oversold territory. Price is consolidating just above short-term support of $0.1696. If DOGE breaks above $0.1750, the next resistance zone lies at $0.1820; failure to do so could trigger a retest of $0.1640 or even $0.150 in a risk-off environment. Technical patterns point to a descending triangle — typically a bearish signal — but reduced volatility suggests stabilization.

While the concept of a ‘solo unicorn’ – a one-person company valued over $1 billion – remains aspirational, a recent event provides a compelling look at just how productive a small team, led by a single vision, can be. Israeli developer Maor Shlomo recently demonstrated this potential with a significant tech acquisition that caught many by surprise. What Was the $80M Wix Acquisition All About? On Wednesday, Wix announced its acquisition of Base44, a six-month-old startup founded and initially run by Maor Shlomo. The deal is valued at $80 million, paid entirely in cash, according to confirmation from Wix. This swift and substantial exit for such a young company is notable, particularly in the current economic climate. While the initial narrative highlighted Shlomo as a ‘solo founder’, Wix confirmed that Base44 actually had 8 employees. These employees are set to receive $25 million of the total $80 million as a retention bonus. The details regarding the payout structure and required tenure were not disclosed. How Did This AI Startup Achieve Such Rapid Growth? Base44’s journey from launch to an $80 million acquisition in just half a year is remarkable. Here are some key factors: Explosive User Growth: Within its first three weeks, Base44 reportedly attracted 10,000 users, growing to 250,000 users in six months. Profitability: Despite potentially high costs associated with large language models (LLMs), the company was profitable, reporting $189,000 in profit in May. Shlomo was transparent about his journey, including LLM costs, on platforms like X and LinkedIn. Word-of-Mouth & Public Building: Shlomo, a 31-year-old programmer, openly shared his development process and company milestones online, which helped the platform spread organically. Strategic Partnerships: The startup quickly secured partnership agreements with established Israeli tech companies like eToro and Similarweb. Smart Tech Choices: Shlomo’s decision to use Anthropic’s Claude LLM via AWS, detailed publicly for cost-performance reasons, even led to an invitation to demo at an AWS event. What is Vibe Coding and Why is it Significant? Base44 is part of a new wave of tools often referred to as ‘vibe coding’ platforms. The core idea is to allow individuals, regardless of technical skill, to build software applications using natural language prompts rather than writing code. Users describe the application they want, and the platform generates the necessary components, including database, storage, authentication, analytics, and integrations for features like email, texting, and maps. Shlomo described Base44 as a ‘moonshot experiment’ aimed at democratizing software development. While other platforms exist in this space, Base44’s rapid user adoption highlighted the strong demand for accessible no-code or low-code solutions powered by AI. Why Did Wix Acquire Base44? For Wix, a company known for its no-code website building platform, acquiring a profitable and fast-growing AI startup focused on ‘vibe coding’ is a logical strategic move. Wix already empowers users to create professional online presences without coding expertise. Integrating Base44’s capabilities could allow Wix users to build more complex, application-like functionalities directly within the Wix ecosystem using simple prompts. The acquisition price of $80 million, while substantial, could be considered a relative bargain given the startup’s growth trajectory and profitability, especially when compared to other recent AI-related deals. For instance, OpenAI reportedly paid $3 billion for Windsurf, a company founded earlier in 2021. What Does This Mean for the Future of Solo Founders and Small Teams? Maor Shlomo’s journey with Base44 offers compelling evidence that small, agile teams leveraging powerful AI tools can achieve significant results very quickly. While a true ‘solo unicorn’ might still be a distant concept, the Base44 sale underscores the potential for highly productive individuals or small groups to build valuable technology that attracts major players. Shlomo himself noted that scaling Base44 organically to meet the necessary volume was challenging, suggesting that the resources and infrastructure provided by Wix were essential for the next phase of growth. His public documentation of the process, including the profitability details despite LLM costs, provides valuable insights for aspiring founders in the AI space. Conclusion: A New Era for Tech Acquisitions? The Base44 sale to Wix is more than just a successful exit story; it’s a testament to the speed at which value can be created in the AI-driven tech landscape. It highlights the power of transparent building, strategic partnerships, and leveraging cutting-edge technology like ‘vibe coding’. This tech acquisition by Wix signals increasing interest from established companies in integrating advanced AI capabilities to simplify and expand their offerings. The rapid rise and profitable operation of this young AI startup , even if not strictly a ‘solo founder’ success, provides inspiration and practical lessons for entrepreneurs navigating the fast-evolving world of artificial intelligence.

Here’s What You Need to Know! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cardano (ADA) has been under pressure lately and has dropped nearly 12-15%, slipping below the $0.6 level for the first time in nearly two months. It’s currently hovering around the $0.59 to $0.60 mark, which is a critical support zone for the altcoin. While the broader crypto market isn’t in panic mode, the ADA price seems to be losing steam. What’s Dragging the Cardano (ADA) Price Down? One of the main reasons behind the decline is the bearish technical momentum building up on the charts. Technical indicators are also signalling downward pressure, which is expected to be strong and may continue unless the buyers step in. ADA is also forming a possible falling wedge pattern, which is typically a bullish reversal sign, but it is not confirmed yet. Therefore, if the price breaks below the current support, the next stop could be around $0.57 or even $0.5. The above chart shows the price being stuck within a descending parallel channel while holding a crucial support zone. Currently, the price has reached the same support zone between $0.6 and $0.61, but is showing fewer signs of a positive rebound. If the price fails to trigger a rebound, a drop to the next support at $0.51 is viable. However, a rebound may elevate the levels to $0.65, which appears unlikely as the RSI is about to reach the lower threshold. A drop within the oversold range could validate a bearish continuation. Long-Term Holders are Taking Profit On-chain data reveals another red flag: ‘Age Consumed’—a metric that tracks the movement of older coins that have not been transacted for a significant period, just hit a 9-month high. This spike signals the diminishing confidence among the investors, as a rise in the metric suggests the long-term holders are cashing out and hence a negative impact on the ADA price could be imperative. This behaviour of the long-term holders seems concerning, as the markets, specifically Cardano, could face excessive selling pressure. This could make ADA more challenging to regain the positive momentum in the short term, keeping the short-term targets activated. This could be a key reason why the Cardano price is struggling to hold its ground. What’s Next for the ADA Price? Now the big question: Is this just a dip or something more serious? If Cardano can hold above the $0.6 level, we might see a bounce back toward $0.66 or even $0.70. But if that support breaks, $0.57 is the next line of defence. A drop below that? Then $0.50 could come into play quickly. The current Cardano (ADA) price action is a mix of technical weakness, long-term holders selling off, and bearish trader sentiment. While it’s not time to panic, it’s definitely a moment to watch closely.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-19 07:42:45

The new capability, announced by Securitize on June 18, marks a step forward in connecting traditional finance with DeFi. It sets a new standard for how tokenized assets are accessed and composed on-chain. Thanks to a new liquidity fund smart contract, qualified users onboarded through Securitize can now perform atomic swaps between BUIDL and USDtb around the clock. As a result, holders of BUIDL, or BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, now have unlimited access to a variety of DeFi strategies that already incorporate USDtb. USDtb, which has a circulating supply of over $113 million, is primarily backed by BUIDL and offers a stable, composable, and yield-exposed dollar on-chain. BUIDL now has 24/7 on-chain liquidity via @ethena_labs We’ve partnered with Ethena to enable atomic swaps from BlackRock’s BUIDL to USDtb—unlocking new composability, liquidity, and accessibility for the world’s largest tokenized Treasury fund.

It enables asset holders to switch between programmable dollars and tokenized treasuries without the need for off-chain middlemen. This opens up new trading options and liquidity for both CeFi and DeFi participants. BUIDL’s expanding role in crypto infrastructure is further demonstrated by its recent listing as collateral on Deribit and Crypto.com. The fund now dominates roughly 40% of the $7.3 billion tokenized U.S. Treasuries market, with strong inflows from institutions seeking regulated yield exposure. At first, Ethena Labs held up to 90% of USDtb’s reserves in BUIDL but has since stopped making additional allocations. However, USDtb is still closely related to the liquidity and performance of the fund. Systemic risks are introduced by the deep reserve concentration in BUIDL. If BUIDL were to face redemption bottlenecks or regulatory scrutiny, USDtb’s backing could be tested.

For this interview, we sit down with CEO Renç Korzay, whose vision of “agent-driven DeFi” replaces automation-as-usual with real-time intelligence and personalized financial autonomy. In the following, Korzay breaks down how Giza’s agents optimize on the go, enforce limits defined by the users without compromise, all the while operating with full transparency in a system where trust is minimzed. It’s not just about better tools – it’s also about redefining how capital moves through the digital world. How does Giza define “Agent-Driven DeFi,” and what advantages does it offer over traditional DeFi automation tools? Agent-Driven DeFi is not another intermediary; it’s a new interface layer where a user expresses intent and an autonomous agent executes that mandate continuously. Compared with recipe-style automation, agents: Adapt 24/7 instead of waiting for a cron job. Optimise decisions, not just transactions, so they can switch venues the instant market conditions flip. Give each user a bespoke risk/gas cadence, making sophisticated finance feel personal rather than prescriptive.” What sets Giza’s autonomous agents apart in terms of adaptability and decision-making in dynamic market conditions? Traditional bots chase hard-coded rules. Giza’s agents ingest markets data through a shared ontology, so when yields invert, the policy can jump protocols without waiting for a developer patch. The result? Inhuman discipline plus in-the-moment sense-making: thousands of micro-rebalances, each cryptographically proven to maximise the user’s personalised objective function. Can you elaborate on how Giza balances security and user sovereignty, particularly in the context of non-custodial agent deployment? We triangulate control between user, smart-account, and agent. The user mints an ERC-4337 smart account. They issue session keys that define exactly what, where, and for how long an agent may act. All transfers outside those guard-rails revert at the contract level, no private-key risk, no custody hand-off. On top, an EigenLayer-backed execution mesh slashes any operator who dares to deviate, so the safe-by-design rails are reinforced by crypto-economic teeth. How does Giza leverage AI in a way that ensures agents’ decisions are verifiable and transparent to users? Since inception, Giza has led verifiable computation market where our work in cryptographic proof systems that mathematically validate every decision hsa been a cornerstone for the ecosystem. Giza Agents combine smart account and session keys architecture that creates auditable permission boundaries where users can see exactly what actions their agents are authorized to perform. All agent actions are recorded on-chain with complete transparency. This creates trust-minimized AI where sophisticated decision-making operates within cryptographically enforced constraints, ensuring users maintain complete sovereignty while benefiting from verifiable autonomous intelligence. What are some of the most compelling use cases you foresee for Giza’s agents beyond yield optimization? Giza is engineered to be the liquidity wormhole of DeFi, the single passage capital trusts on both the way in and the way out: friction-free, trust-minimized intake, followed by algorithmic redeployment that wrings maximum productivity from every unit of capital. Giza will be the backbone for autonomous intelligent markets, that extends to all liquidity in DeFi and all possible use cases. As AI becomes more integrated into financial systems, how do you envision the regulatory landscape evolving, and how is Giza preparing for it? We expect rule-books to move from entity-level to model-level accountability: if an algorithm touches customer funds, its hash, inputs, and guard-rails must be attestable. Giza is ready because that is literally how our agents operate today, policy hashes on-chain, proofs in-flight, and optional compliance modules that can plug into any jurisdictional framework. As finance automates, verifiable agents will be the gold standard, and we aim to be the reference implementation Disclaimer: The content shared in this interview is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice, investment recommendation, or endorsement of any project, protocol, or asset.

The global crypto market cap declined by 0.51% to $3.27 trillion, while Bitcoin hovers around $105K, trading at $104,987 during this publication. Meanwhile, 1INCH appears ready for potential reversals after weeks of prolonged consolidations and significant downtrends. The alt recently rebounded from the reliable support at $0.1777, hinting at upside price actions. With the underway voting looking to compensate victims of last year’s hack, could 1INCH extend its recovery to the key hurdle at $0.2274? Fundamentals and technical indicators suggest so. DAO proposal to compensate exploited victims 1inch Foundation’s new proposal , dubbed 1IP-80, fuels the prevailing optimism on the digital asset. It seeks to pay individuals who suffered from the October 2024 supply chain exploit. The incident happened after perpetrators leveraged weakness in the website plugin Lottie Player library, stealing tokens worth $768,026. While the protocol recovered most assets from the latest attack (which happened in March 2025), it hasn’t recompensed October victims. Thus, the new proposal seeks to pay affected investors using DAO treasury funds. Compensating exploit victims might renew confidence in the project as it reveals its user-centric approach. The proposal reads: A comprehensive reimbursement maintains user trust, demonstrates ecosystem resilience, and aligns with the DAO’s commitment to community protection. The proposal’s controversy and KYC requirements The proposal has attracted controversies among the DAO community. One side believes compensating users using DAO funds without continued revenue inflows would drain the treasury, weakening 1inch. They trust the project doesn’t boast financial muscles to offer insurance services. However, some argue that the DAO should protect its users. The ongoing voting testifies to the split, with 53.47% (3.8 million) in favor and 46.53% (3.3 million) against. Source: 1inch Network However, only two large addresses dominate the voting, one accounting for all No and the other YES votes. Voting will conclude on 22 June. Meanwhile, the reimbursement plan requires various actions from users (if the proposal passes). First and foremost, they should verify their identities by completing KYC procedures. Also, victims should prove the loss with evidence and file a law enforcement statement. Moreover, they should sign a reimbursement agreement and surrender future rights to any retrieved assets. Meanwhile, a criminal investigation into 1inch’s exploitations is ongoing in the Cayman Islands 1NCH price outlook: an 18% rally imminent? The native token has struggled with notable bearishness lately, depicting deteriorated user confidence, possibly due to hacking incidents. Crypto enthusiasts avoid protocols with weak security infrastructures. 1INCH trades at $0.1916 after dropping 15% and 12% in the past month and week. Nevertheless, price charts bring some hope. 1inch forms a potential reversal pattern on the 4H chart after extended declines. The altcoin has bounced back from the reliable support barrier at $0.1777. 1NCH has tested this zone several times, highlighting buyer interest around the mark. Recently, prices plunged to $0.1744 but rebounded to the support swiftly, creating a potential double-bottom setup, which heralds substantial price rallies. 1inch bulls will target the resistance at $0.2208. That could clear the path to $0.2274, which would mean an 18.69% jump from 1NCH’s current price. The MACD and RSI demonstrate the gradual buyer resurgence. Source: TradingView However, 1inch trades below the 50EMA, indicating seller control. Price dips below $0.1900 could plunge the token to the $0.1777 foothold. Losing $0.1744 will invalidate the bullish narrative and catalyze notable dips or consolidations.

For those tracking the advancements from companies like OpenAI, led by figures such as Sam Altman , the integration of AI into daily routines is a familiar concept. However, few might have predicted its entry into the age-old challenge of raising a newborn. Sam Altman , recently a new father, shared how he leaned on ChatGPT during the initial weeks of parenthood, offering a unique glimpse into the potential role of AI in this fundamental human experience. Sam Altman’s Experience with AI in Parenting Becoming a parent is a transformative experience, often accompanied by a flood of questions and uncertainties, especially during the first few months. Sam Altman , CEO of OpenAI, openly discussed his personal journey into fatherhood on a recent company podcast. Describing himself as “extremely kid pilled,” Altman revealed he turned to ChatGPT “constantly” during the early weeks with his newborn son. His initial queries focused on understanding the immediate behaviors of the baby – presumably the myriad reasons behind crying, feeding patterns, and sleep challenges that plague new parents globally. As his son grew slightly older and more settled, the nature of his questions shifted towards broader topics concerning children’s developmental stages. Altman acknowledged the historical context, stating, “Clearly, people have been able to take care of babies without ChatGPT for a long time.” Yet, he added, “I don’t know how I would’ve done that,” highlighting the perceived utility the AI provided him. AI in Parenting: The New ‘Googling’? Altman’s reliance on ChatGPT for parenting advice isn’t entirely novel. For decades, parents have frantically searched online for answers to urgent questions about their children’s health, behavior, and development. This frantic searching, often late at night, has led many down internet rabbit holes filled with conflicting information. Artificial Intelligence , in this context, can be seen as the next evolution of this behavior. Instead of sifting through countless forum posts, blog articles, and medical websites, a parent can ask a single, conversational interface like ChatGPT for a summarized answer. However, this convenience comes with its own set of considerations. The challenge of AI “hallucinations” – instances where the model generates incorrect or nonsensical information – remains a significant concern. Relying heavily on an AI for critical advice, especially concerning a vulnerable infant, raises important questions about accuracy and trust. Yet, as the original article points out, parents are already navigating a minefield of questionable online sources, from anonymous forums to social media groups promoting unverified practices. Is consulting ChatGPT fundamentally riskier than taking advice from a stranger online who insists on moon-phase-based bedtimes? This comparison suggests that while the technology is new, the challenge of discerning reliable information in the digital age is not. The Future: Children Growing Up with Artificial Intelligence Beyond parents using AI, a perhaps more profound implication discussed by Altman is the reality of children growing up in a world where extremely smart Artificial Intelligence is commonplace. Altman recalled a video of a toddler trying to interact with a magazine as if it were a tablet screen, illustrating how quickly children adapt to new technologies and expect them to function in certain ways. Children born today will likely view sophisticated AI as a natural part of their environment. The discussion touched upon instances of children directly interacting with AI. Former OpenAI science communicator Andrew Mayne shared an anecdote about a parent using ChatGPT ‘s voice mode to engage his child on a topic the parent was tired of discussing – Thomas the Tank Engine. The child reportedly talked to the AI for an hour. Altman noted, “Kids love voice mode.” This raises a new set of questions, reminiscent of the ongoing debates around screen time and the impact of digital media on child development. While existing children’s media is typically created by human teams with some level of pedagogical consideration, AI models like ChatGPT are not specifically designed for young children and lack vetted parental controls. OpenAI ‘s own policies recommend users be over 13. Navigating the Challenges and Potential of OpenAI’s Technology Sam Altman is acutely aware that the integration of powerful AI into society, including into personal spheres like parenting and childhood, will not be without its challenges. He stated, “It’s not all going to be good. There will be problems.” A significant concern he highlighted is the potential for users, including children, to develop “somewhat problematic, or maybe very problematic parasocial relationships” with AI models. Society, he believes, will need to figure out new guardrails to address these emerging issues. Despite these risks, Altman remains optimistic about the overall trajectory. As the head of a company investing billions into advancing AI capabilities, he maintains a focus on the potential upsides. “The upsides will be tremendous!” he asserted, expressing confidence that “Society in general is good at figuring how to mitigate the downsides.” This perspective underscores the ongoing tension between the rapid innovation in Artificial Intelligence and the slower process of societal adaptation and regulation. Conclusion: AI’s Evolving Role in the Family Sam Altman ‘s personal anecdote about using ChatGPT for parenting advice offers a relatable, if perhaps surprising, example of how AI is beginning to permeate the most intimate parts of our lives. While the concept of using AI in Parenting might initially sound like something out of science fiction, it highlights the practical ways people are already leveraging these tools. Like any technology, AI presents a dual nature: immense potential for assistance and learning, alongside significant risks related to accuracy, dependence, and unforeseen psychological impacts, particularly on developing minds. As OpenAI and other companies continue to push the boundaries of Artificial Intelligence , the conversation about its appropriate role in raising children and supporting parents will only grow more critical. Altman’s experience serves as a reminder that these are not just abstract technological advancements; they are tools that will increasingly shape daily life, requiring careful consideration, societal dialogue, and the establishment of new norms and safeguards.

What the bill essentially does is establish a federal framework for private firms to issue stablecoins under strict regulations, including full reserve backing and monthly audits. While the GENIUS Act still needs approval from the House before it becomes a law, the legislation is already hurting traditional payment stocks like Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc. Why? Because this bill, if it becomes a law, could make it more appealing for global merchants to switch from conventional card payments to stablecoins for transactions. Why is GENIUS Act a threat for Visa and Mastercard? Senate’s approval of the GENIUS Act poses a meaningful threat to card companies like Visa and Mastercard as it could establish stablecoins as compliant, mainstream instruments for payments. If stablecoins are backed by liquid assets and audited regularly, as proposed in the aforementioned bill, businesses may begin to prefer them for transactions to avoid interchange fees and processing delays. In fact, retail behemoths like Amazon and Walmart Inc are already warming up to launch their own stablecoins – potentially bypassing Visa and Mastercard fees entirely – and losing business from giants like these could deal a significant financial blow to both . The GENIUS Act prohibits yield on consumer stablecoins, but vests regulatory control within the Treasury, offering clearer oversight. That threatens the stranglehold Visa and Mastercard hold over everyday transactions and settlement processes. While some would argue that consumers still value credit card rewards and protections, emergence of compliant, low-fee stablecoins backed by regulatory clarity could gradually reduce dominance of incumbent networks. Are stablecoins already being used actively for transactions? What’s also worth mentioning is that stablecoins are already being used for transactions, and that too, at scale. In 2024, stablecoins saw transaction volumes surpass $27 trillion , outpacing the combined volume on Visa and Mastercard – a landmark indicator of their growing usage. In Q1 this year, stablecoins continued to dominate those two payment networks, with over $1.4 trillion in transaction volume seen in a single month (May). More importantly, stablecoin usage is expanding well beyond crypto trading. More than 20% of stablecoin transaction volumes are now tied to payments, not trading. According to American Banker, just under half of the surveyed corporate treasurers say they are using stablecoins for operational payments, while another 23% are piloting them. Reportedly, weekly stablecoin transfers now average more than $500 billion, surpassing Visa by over 60%. These facts and figures confirm stablecoins are no longer niche – they’re actively being used for high-value transfers, remittances, and commerce – all of which could become a significantly more pronounced challenges for the likes of Visa and Mastercard if the GENIUS Act becomes a law.

It may revisit the April low if the bulls fail to intercept the current drops. For over a month, Bonk’s price has been on a steady decline following a sudden price rejection at $0.000026 in mid-May. This led to a significant deduction and it closed that month well under the $0.00002 level. Reiterating negative actions this month, it broke lower and fell to a low of $0.000014 level last Friday, as it forms a new bearish pattern on the daily chart. Rejecting that low sharply, it consolidated throughout last weekend and closed relatively calmly. Holding the low as support, volatility increased on Monday, and the price rose to the $0.000016 level, raising bulls’ hope for a strong recovery. Unfortunately, the recovery didn’t last as the bears stepped back and the price dropped, leading to more bullish traps. That interception triggered another weekly drag down and the price dips. As of now, it looks poised for more drops. Further drawdowns from the current trading level could cause a severe bloodbath before halting the sell. From a technical standpoint, the bears will likely have the upper hand in the next few days. Meanwhile, the bulls are struggling to step back. If they manage to intercept the latest move, we can expect relief in the selling pressure. BONK’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The closest level for selling right now is $0.000013. If the price fails to bounce this key level, the lower support level to keep in mind would be $0.0000114, April’s pullback level. Losing it could reset the market to the $0.0000089 support, marked as April’s low. Aside from the current weekly $0.000016 high, higher resistance levels to keep in mind for a slight shift are $0.0000183 and $0.0000244. The $0.0000314 level is the next resistance to watch in case of a breakout.

In an interview with Bloomberg , AI and crypto Czar, David Sacks, said that a crypto bill is “very close” to becoming a law. If passed, it could bring the clear rules the industry has long been waiting for. Stablecoin Bill Nears the Finish Line The Stablecoin bill is almost at the finish line. The House has already passed a similar version called the Stables Act and is now reviewing its next steps. If all goes smoothly, the bill could soon land on the President’s desk. “I think we’re very close here to having a bill that can go to the president’s desk,” he said. This comes as the Senate recently passed the GENIUS Act, a major stablecoin bill, with a strong 68–30 vote. President Trump is also backing the bill and the House to pass it “lightning fast.” He also called it “an incredible Bill that is going to make America the Undisputed Leader in Digital Assets.” Why Packaging Bills Could Delay Progress Sacks warned that trying to combine this stablecoin bill with a broader market structure bill could slow things down. While the House has already passed the stablecoin bill, the market structure bill hasn’t even been taken up by the Senate. So, bringing them together could delay the Stablecoin bill, which is already close to becoming law. Citigroup predicts that the global stablecoin market could grow to $3.7 trillion by 2030. But without clear regulation, that number could shrink to just $500 billion. Stablecoins Could Come Onshore with This Bill Currently, about $250 billion worth of stablecoins are in circulation, even without solid U.S. regulations. Sacks said the bill would bring the whole stablecoin industry onshore, improve consumer protection, and require regular audits. It could also boost global use of U.S. digital dollars, especially in countries with weaker currencies. That shift could drive trillions in new demand for U.S. Treasuries. Companies like Amazon and Walmart are already exploring their own stablecoins. The bill would bring these efforts under banking regulation, with clear rules and oversight. “The Payment System of the Future” Sacks also called this new blockchain-based dollar system “the payment system of the future.” With this bill, he sees the U.S. creating a faster, safer, and more efficient dollar system online. While executive actions help, he said lasting clarity comes from passing real laws. “If you want the rules to stick, especially if a future official like Gary Gensler comes back, you need to enshrine them into law,” he said, making this bill, and the broader one still in progress, critical for the industry’s future.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-19 07:59:53

Could this be where the bleed ends? Solana Has Strong On-Chain Support Between $145 & $147 In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about where support and resistance levels lie for Solana based on the Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) metric. Related Reading: These Altcoins Are Bucking The Trend—But Can They Keep It Up? The Cost Basis Distribution tells us about how much of the cryptocurrency’s circulating supply was last purchased or transferred at what spot price. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the data of the indicator for Solana over the past few months. As is visible, there are a few price zones near the current Solana spot price that stand out in terms of the amount of supply that they hold. The $155 to $157 range carries the cost basis of around 31 million tokens and the $164 to $166 range that of 29 million tokens. A third demand zone exists at $145 to $147, a region that the cryptocurrency’s price is currently making a retest of. Here, the investors last purchased a total of 13 million SOL. To any investor, their cost basis is an important level, so they are more likely to show some kind of move when a retest of it occurs. Generally, this type of reaction isn’t anything relevant for the asset when just a few holders share their acquisition mark at the level, but when a large amount of them are involved, like in the case of the range that SOL is retesting right now, a sizeable reaction can sometimes appear. Generally, these moves tend toward buying when the retest occurs from above. That is, when the investors were in the green prior to the retest. This happens because these holders might believe the price decline to be just a dip opportunity or they may simply want to protect their cost basis. Similarly, holders might panic sell when the retest happens from below. This could happen because underwater sellers can be desperate to get back into the green and once they do, they might fear that the rise is only temporary so they could push for the exit. As Solana is retesting the $145 to $147 range from above, it’s possible that buyers from this region could provide support to the asset and help cushion its fall. In the event that a turnaround does happen, the $155 to $157 resistance range could be of focus next. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Enters Reversal Zone: BTC Dangerously Overvalued? The analytics firm has also shared the CBD of another altcoin, Tron (TRX). As Glassnode explains, Cost Basis Distribution shows TRON found support in the $0.26–$0.27 range, where over 14B $TRX is held -marking the strongest cluster on the chart. Above that, the supply is relatively thin and most investor positioning remains below current price. SOL Price Solana is currently hanging right at the lower end of the support range as its price is floating around $145.

Starting today, Midjourney’s nearly 20 million users can animate uploaded or AI-generated images via the website. Midjourney CEO David Holz said the V1 model was the company’s next step towards its ultimate destination, creating AI models “capable of real-time open-world simulations.” The company also said it had bigger plans for its AI video models than just generating B-roll for Hollywood movies or commercials for the ad industry. Nick St. Pierre, Creative Director and unofficial Midjourney shill, observed that the V1 only did image-to-video conversions. Users were allowed four 24fps generations at 480p per clip, and they worked with any aspect ratio image. He also noted V1’s cost efficiency, claiming that 20 video clips for ~$4 were better than the $3 per video on Veo. The generation speed was notably faster. According to Pierre, V1 has custom settings allowing users to control the video model’s outputs. The automatic animation setting will make an image move randomly, and the manual setting will allow users to describe, in text, a specific animation they want to add to their video. While the videos generated with V1 are only five seconds long, users can extend them by four seconds up to four times, meaning that V1 videos could get as long as 21 seconds. Midjourney says it will charge 8x more for a video generation Had a chance to try out @midjourney video! Really impressed by a bunch of my outputs – it makes a big difference to start from a quality image, and the coherence is strong. The auto-prompting is great. And it's also a relatively fast and cheap model, which never hurts 😅 pic.twitter.com/yvf3nN9dmC — Justine Moore (@venturetwins) June 18, 2025 The Midjourney team said it would charge 8x more for a video generation than a typical image generation, meaning subscribers will run out of their monthly allotted generations much faster when creating videos than images. It also mentioned that it planned to develop AI models for producing 3D rendering and real-time AI models. The cheapest way to try out V1 at launch will be by subscribing to Midjourney’s $10-per-month Basic plan. Subscribers to Midjourney’s $60-a-month Pro plan and $120-a-month Mega plan will have unlimited video generations in the company’s slower “Relax” mode. Midjourney said it will reassess its pricing for video models over the next month. Holz claimed that Midjourney’s prices were over 25 times cheaper than what the market had shipped before. “Our goal is to give you something fun, easy, beautiful, and affordable so that everyone can explore. We think we’ve struck a solid balance. Though many of you will feel a need to upgrade at least one tier for more fast-minutes.” – David Holz , CEO at Midjourney According to Holz, the actual costs of producing models and the prices Midjourney charged were challenging to predict. He added that the company would do its best to give users access right now. However, he clarified that the Midjourney team would watch everyone use the technology over the next month and adjust everything to ensure the company was operating sustainably. Holz says models capable of real-time open-world simulations are next The Midjourney CEO laid out next year’s plans, claiming that the inevitable destination of V1’s technology was models capable of real-time open-world simulations. Basically, the company was looking to build an AI system that generated imagery in real time. Users could command it to move around in a 3D space where the environments and characters also moved, and users could interact with everything. Holz pointed out that to do this, the company needed visuals (our first image models), it needed to make those images move (video models), users needed to be able to move themselves through space (3D models), and they needed to be able to do this all fast (real-time models). He added that the next year involved building these pieces individually, releasing them, and slowly putting them together into a unified system. The Midjourney boss said it might be expensive at first, but the final product would be something everyone could use. Holz promised that more would come from his company over the next few weeks and months, adding that his team had learned a lot while building video models. He also pointed out that much of this learning would return to Midjourney’s image models in the coming weeks or months. But for now, Holz says to press “Animate”—and make those images move.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a popular barometer for gauging the prevailing emotion in the cryptocurrency market. Recently, this index has shown a significant uptick, signaling a notable shift in crypto market sentiment . Let’s dive into what this move means and how this fascinating tool works. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Provided by software development platform Alternative, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index aggregates various market data points to produce a single number between 0 and 100. This number aims to represent the current emotional state of the market participants. A score closer to 0 signifies extreme fear, often seen as a potential buying opportunity by contrarian investors, while a score near 100 indicates extreme greed, which some view as a signal for a potential market correction. As of June 19, the index registered a value of 57, a five-point increase from the previous day. This upward movement pushed the index out of the ‘Neutral’ territory and firmly into the ‘Greed’ zone. This shift suggests that market participants are becoming more optimistic and confident, potentially driven by recent price movements or positive news flow. Here’s a simple breakdown of the index zones: 0-24: Extreme Fear 25-49: Fear 50-59: Neutral 60-74: Greed 75-100: Extreme Greed What Factors Influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index isn’t based on a single metric but is a composite of six key factors, each weighted differently to reflect its perceived impact on crypto market sentiment : Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to average corresponding values. High volatility, especially downwards, can increase fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Analyzes the current volume and market momentum compared to average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a rising market indicates greed. Social Media (15%): Scans Twitter for specific posts related to Bitcoin and analyzes their sentiment and engagement rates. A high volume of positive, engaged tweets suggests greed. Surveys (15%): (Currently paused by Alternative) This factor previously incorporated weekly sentiment surveys. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total market cap. An increasing Bitcoin dominance can indicate fear of altcoins and a flight to the perceived safety of Bitcoin, while decreasing dominance might signal increasing greed for potentially higher altcoin gains. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google Search data for search queries related to Bitcoin. Rising search interest for terms like “Bitcoin price prediction” or “how to buy Bitcoin” can indicate growing public interest and potentially greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index attempts to provide a holistic view of the market’s emotional state, moving beyond just price action. Navigating the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does it Mean for Trading Psychology? The index moving into the ‘Greed’ zone is often interpreted as a sign that the market is heating up. Investors are becoming more confident, perhaps even euphoric. This increased confidence can lead to more aggressive buying, potentially driving prices higher in the short term. However, it’s crucial to understand the implications for trading psychology . Historically, periods of extreme greed have sometimes preceded market pullbacks or corrections. When greed is high, investors might overlook risks, chase hype, and make impulsive decisions based on FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). This can create a bubble-like environment that is vulnerable to sudden reversals. Therefore, while ‘Greed’ indicates positive momentum, it also serves as a yellow flag, reminding participants to exercise caution and avoid getting swept up in the euphoria. Conversely, periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ are often associated with market bottoms, as panic selling drives prices down, potentially creating opportunities for those brave enough to buy against the prevailing sentiment. The index essentially quantifies these collective emotional states, offering a counter-perspective to purely fundamental or technical analysis. Using the Index: Actionable Insights and Crypto Volatility How can investors and traders use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index ? It’s best viewed as a supplementary tool, not a definitive buy or sell signal. Here are some actionable insights: Contrarian Indicator: Some traders use the index as a contrarian signal. Extreme fear might suggest a potential buying opportunity (when others are panicking), while extreme greed might suggest a potential selling opportunity (when the market is overheated). Sentiment Confirmation: It can help confirm or question your own read on the market. If you feel the market is fearful but the index is high, it prompts further investigation. Risk Management: A high ‘Greed’ score can be a reminder to tighten stop losses, reduce leverage, or take some profits, acknowledging the increased risk of a downturn fueled by high crypto volatility . Understanding Market Phases: The index helps visualize the cyclical nature of market emotions, from panic and capitulation (fear) to optimism and euphoria (greed). It’s important to remember that the crypto market, known for its high crypto volatility , can change sentiment rapidly. The index provides a snapshot, but market conditions are constantly evolving. Limitations and Considerations While valuable, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not without limitations: Correlation, Not Causation: The index reflects sentiment, which correlates with price movements, but it doesn’t directly *cause* them. External news, regulations, or technological developments are primary drivers. Bitcoin-Centric: While it considers Bitcoin dominance, the underlying factors (volatility, volume, social media, Google Trends) are heavily weighted towards Bitcoin, making it less sensitive to sentiment shifts specific to altcoins. Historical Data: The effectiveness of using the index as a contrarian tool is based on historical patterns, which may not always repeat. Factor Weighting: The specific weightings assigned to each factor are determined by Alternative and might be debated. Therefore, always use the index in conjunction with other forms of analysis, including technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and macroeconomic factors. Conclusion: A Glimpse into Market Psychology The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 57 and its entry into the ‘Greed’ zone marks a significant moment for crypto market sentiment . It reflects increasing optimism among participants, driven by a combination of factors like market momentum, volume, and social buzz. While this indicates positive short-term energy, it also highlights the importance of understanding trading psychology and the inherent crypto volatility . The index serves as a powerful reminder that emotions play a huge role in financial markets. By tracking fear and greed, it offers investors a unique perspective – a pulse check on the collective mindset. As the market continues to navigate its path, keeping an eye on this index, while employing sound risk management strategies and diverse analysis methods, remains a prudent approach for anyone involved in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.

Despite strong ETF inflows and positive signs from the market, the price isn’t breaking out. So what’s holding it back? Recent reports reveal that both short-term traders and long-term holders are quietly selling. Even Bitcoin miners are adding to the pressure. Let’s take a deeper look into what’s really going on behind the scenes. Short-Term Holders Taking Profits Over the last few weeks, Bitcoin has faced heavy selling pressure from different types of holders. According to Glassnode, wallets that held Bitcoin for less than a year accounted for 83% of realized profits recently. Just six to twelve-month holders alone sold over $904 million worth of BTC, one of the highest selling amounts this year. Last week, we highlighted how $BTC wallets that held >12m were the primary profit-takers. But that trend has now flipped. Yesterday: 6–12m holders alone realized $904M – second-highest daily profit YTD pic.twitter.com/gBD8tLCjVG — glassnode (@glassnode) June 17, 2025 But it’s not just the short-term crowd. Even long-term holders who’ve kept their BTC for over a year are cashing out. In early June, they realized a massive $1.2 billion in profits. While that number has dropped, it still shows how veteran investors are using this range to take money off the table. Miners Add to Selling Pressure Another group adding pressure is the miners.Recent data shows they’ve sold 30,000 BTC in just 20 days, lowering their total holdings from 1.94 million to 1.91 million BTC. While this isn’t huge compared to the total market volume, it adds to the overall pressure keeping Bitcoin from breaking higher Investors Searching For Other Option At the same time, some institutional investors are shifting their focus. Delta-neutral strategies, which involve locking in gains without price risk, are giving returns of 15–30% APY. That’s attractive compared to holding Bitcoin, which has already seen huge gains from $75K to $100K in under two months. With fewer explosive gains expected from Bitcoin now that it’s over $100K, some funds are diversifying into gold, stocks, or private assets. Low Funding Rates Signal Healthy Despite recent volatility in the crypto market, Bitcoin continues to trade above the $100,000 mark, currently hovering around $104,665. According to on-chain analytics from Santiment , this price stability is accompanied by notably low funding rates, which is an encouraging sign for the market’s overall health. Funding rates are a key indicator in the crypto derivatives market. When these rates are low, it means there isn’t a surge of traders using leverage to bet on Bitcoin’s price moves. Bitcoin: Key Level To Watch Out As of now, Bitcoin continues to trade above the $100,000 mark, currently hovering around $104,665. Bitcoin’s next big breakout likely depends on U.S. stocks moving higher or broader liquidity returning to markets. The key levels to watch are $102,000 and $106,000.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-19 08:10:22

Vincent addressed a common misconception that XRPL’s transactions per second (TPS) metric strictly limits the number of individual payments that can be processed per second on the network. According to Van Code, this view oversimplifies how the system operates in real-world use cases, particularly when dealing with cross-border payments. He stated that XRPL TPS does not necessarily have one-to-one correspondence with the number of actual end-user payment transactions. Rather than treating every single customer payment as a separate XRPL transaction, institutions like Ripple use a batching model. In this model, multiple individual payments destined for a particular region are grouped and settled as a single or limited number of transactions on the XRPL. These batched payments are sent to a local payment partner, which is then responsible for remitting funds to the individual recipients. XRPL TPS doesn't necessarily mean you can only do X amount of say cross border payments per second. Ripple, and many others will use XRPL to batch settle payments to relevant payment partners. It is then the Ripple on off ramps that unhatched and remits money to individual… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) June 17, 2025 Mechanics of Batched Settlement Van Code used Japan as an example to illustrate the process. If there are 400 individual payments to be made to recipients in Japan, Ripple could send these payments in a batched format to its payment partner in Japan using only about 10 to 20 XRPL transactions. The partner then distributes the funds to the 400 recipients through local mechanisms. This approach dramatically reduces the number of XRPL transactions required, making more efficient use of the network TPS capacity. As Van Code emphasized, the XRPL is focused on transferring value, while Ripple’s infrastructure is designed to integrate with real-world systems and facilitate final-mile delivery of funds. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Engagement and Clarification A user identified as Awesomeness responded to the original post, expressing confusion about the batching process. The user asked how it would be possible to make fewer than 400 transactions when the payments involve 400 different recipients and different amounts. The user also questioned whether this reduced transaction volume could negatively impact demand for XRP. In response, Van Code clarified that only the required total funds need to be transferred through the XRPL in a single transaction. Once these funds arrive at the payment partner, that partner is responsible for distributing the payments to each of the 400 individual accounts. He explained that there is no requirement for a one-to-one relationship between each end-user payment and an XRPL transaction, emphasizing that the system is designed to work at a higher operational level where aggregation is more efficient. Technical Distinction Between XRPL and External Payment Interfaces The key point Van Code conveyed is the distinction between the XRPL’s role as a value settlement layer and Ripple’s function as a payment interface bridging the on-chain and off-chain components. The batching system allows large volumes of payments to be effectively managed and executed without overwhelming the XRPL’s native TPS capacity. This model supports scalability while maintaining the integrity and efficiency of cross-border payments. It also underlines that XRPL utilization is not diminished by reduced individual transaction counts, as value continues to move through the network in large amounts. In this structure, XRP demand is driven by the value being moved and the overall liquidity required, not merely the raw number of transactions on-chain.

The framework sets clear rules for token classification, VASP licensing, and key compliance obligations . Twin Regulatory Model for Crypto Tokens The new framework adopts a dual regulatory approach , with both the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) playing crucial roles: BSP (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) Oversees Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) , ensuring that activities such as exchange, transfer, and custody comply with consumer protection and AML/CFT standards . SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) Regulates tokens classified as securities under the Securities Regulation Code (SRC) . It ensures proper registration or exemption of token offerings and listings. Key Laws Impacting Crypto Token Listings The regulatory framework incorporates several legal provisions affecting token issuance and operations: BIR Revenue Memorandum Circulars 94-2014 & 85-2018 Treats crypto assets as property , applying capital gains (6%) , income , and business taxes . RA 10173 – Data Privacy Act Applies to crypto exchanges and token issuers collecting personal data. RA 10175 – Cybercrime Prevention Act Targets cybercrime, fraud, and other illegal activities in the crypto space with strict penalties. VASP Licensing and Obligations VASPs operating in the Philippines must secure BSP approval and comply with strict requirements: Licensing Conditions Includes capital requirements, governance structure, cybersecurity standards , and consumer protection measures . Operational Obligations Mandatory risk scoring , KYC , AML compliance , and token classification analysis. Transaction Monitoring Exchanges must implement Travel Rule-compliant transmissions (as per FATF Recommendation 15 ) for crypto transfers over US$1,000 . Penalties for Non-Compliance The framework imposes heavy penalties for failing to meet regulatory standards: SEC Non-Compliance Fines up to ₱5 million Additional ₱2,000 per day for continuing violations 7–21 years imprisonment for wilful false statements BSP Circular 118 Violations License suspension or revocation Fines up to three times the transaction value AML Violations ₱5 million administrative fine Up to 14 years imprisonment Data Privacy Violations Fines between ₱500,000 to ₱5 million per act 1–6 years imprisonment for misuse of sensitive data Final Thoughts The Philippines’ new crypto token listing framework sets a clear regulatory pathway for token classification, VASP licensing, cross-border trading, and exchange compliance.

The scaling solutions now being focused upon, along with the robust DeFi structure that is taking shape on the Bitcoin network, mean that attention is shifting quite rapidly from the paradigm of Bitcoin as a mostly static, low-throughput asset to that of a far more dynamic and fully usable Bitcoin network. Even at a low level of infrastructural development, the promise of a rigorous stack of DeFi primitives emerging on the Bitcoin network is pushing the price of Bitcoin upward—and for the first time, really, signaling to the architecture community that the world’s largest cryptocurrency is ripe for serious redevelopment and renovation. Bitcoin Ecosystem The Bitcoin ecosystem is rapidly evolving, with a strong focus on scaling solutions. Once the #Bitcoin scaling challenge is addressed, a flourishing DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin seems almost inevitable. This is especially true given Bitcoin’s dramatically… pic.twitter.com/zvac3yQCMH — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) June 18, 2025 Even with the spectacular rally of Bitcoin past the $100,000 mark, vital signs indicate that the market is not yet in the speculative bubble mode of prior peak periods. This creates the perhaps unprecedented situation of Bitcoin being up over 1,000% in the past year, yet being looked at as a relatively stable investment. In any case, it is virtually unthinkable that the current Bitcoin price level is anywhere near the ceiling. Scaling Unlocks the Path to Bitcoin DeFi The perennial problem of scalability on Bitcoin has been a serious bottleneck for greater utility and application development. Yet, a few recent developments in Layer 2 solutions—like the Lightning Network and other off-chain transaction frameworks—are finally starting to show some real promise. These innovations have allowed the network to achieve something that’s relatively rare in the world of Bitcoin: faster and cheaper transactions. And that, in turn, is enabling something that’s even rarer in the world of DeFi: a native ecosystem. DeFi has been built on Ethereum and other smart contract platforms. But building DeFi on Bitcoin has not yet been realized. With its serious security and phenomenal name recognition, Bitcoin could very well become the backbone of a future decentralized financial system—if the protocols keep improving in usability and scaling. This evolution is happening when institutional investors and state-level actors are taking part in Bitcoin like never before. Government-backed initiatives, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds have been putting real capital into Bitcoin, and the above-mentioned developments are only adding more and seemingly inexorable momentum to the Bitcoin ecosystem’s evolution and maturation. Market Still in Cooling Zone Despite All-Time Highs While Bitcoin trades easily above $100,000, its present MVRV ratio—a key valuation metric comparing market value to realized value—lingers at a modest 2.25. This is reminiscent of the way things were in the lead-up to the 2023 Bitcoin Halving, in that the MVRV was somewhat low relative to the price action (like way back in 2021). And yet, we must also say that the 2.25 figure has not typically been associated with major market tops. The last time the MVRV ratio had a similar reading (in the bull run leading to the 2021 Bitcoin top) was when prices were under $40,000. Although Bitcoin is now trading comfortably above $100k, its MVRV ratio is only 2.25; still far below previous cycle peaks, even after factoring in the indicator’s long-term downward drift. This indicates the market still isn't as overheated as it was during earlier peaks pic.twitter.com/4TX39NLU3s — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) June 17, 2025 Also, this relatively tame MVRV ratio occurs despite the indicator’s long-term trending downward. This drift suggests a market that is long overdue for an awesome, almost cavalier, sense of achievement (a.k.a. a market in BTC that is increasingly mature and efficient). The current MVRV reading entertains the rising BTC price not yet in a zone of dangerous overexuberance. This is being interpreted by investors, traders, and analysts as a sign that the current cycle may have more room to run. If inflation and the debasement of fiat currencies continue to drive demand for hard, decentralized assets, we might be in for quite a run. Whale Movements Signal Strategic Adjustments The overall market is fairly stable, but the recent activity of a few important traders shows the overall market is more than what’s on the surface. One of these traders, the “Mysterious Whale”—under the handle @AguilaTrades—recently made some news by not just rebalancing but by really cutting back on a huge leveraged position. Aguila started with a position that was 20 times as large as Bitcoin’s price when he bet on the cryptocurrency in October 2021. The trader initially opened a 20x long position valued at $424 million, representing a bold bet on Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. However, after recent developments in the market and price actions, he has now closed the majority of that position and reduced his holdings to just 736.5 BTC, a far cry from the original 3,952.66 BTC he controlled. The value of the remaining position, at current prices, is approximately $77 million. Exiting after a previous trade that resulted in a loss of $12.5 million, Aguila has now realized total losses of over $15 million. This retreat makes clear that even with Bitcoin trading near its all-time highs, high-leverage players are exercising a lot more caution these days. While the move may well reflect risk management on the part of Aguila, it also underscores how short-term, high-volatility trading is a bit of a crapshoot right now. Even with these adjustments being made, they don’t seem to have affected investors’ overall enthusiasm for the cryptocurrency space. “On-chain data and macro signals continue to impressed, support a longer-term bullish narrative, especially as the Bitcoin ecosystem extends its reach toward not just being a store of simple value, but also toward building a complex financial infrastructure in addition to that simple value storage.” – Wall Street Journal As the ecosystem keeps maturing, a completely realized Bitcoin-native DeFi landscape is no longer a hypothetical—it’s an emerging reality with deep institutional roots and global potential.

In an interview on the David Lin Report, Hayes says that between now and 2028, liquidity in the “realm of $9 trillion” will be injected into the US economy, initially flowing into the traditional economic sectors before trickling down to risk assets such as Bitcoin ( BTC ). “…And I think the banks are going to free, because they now don’t have to hold all this equity capital against their treasury book, they can lend more into the real American economy. And so you’re going to see the amount of loans going to manufacturing firms increase, which is again… that’s an increase in credit. And that will make its way into crypto as well.” The BitMEX co-founder says Bitcoin could skyrocket by around 139% from the current price by the end of the year. By 2028, Hayes Bitcoin could go up nearly tenfold. “So I think that we get to $250,000 by the end of the year. It will be bumpy along the way, obviously. But that’s sort of my end-of-year price target. And then a $1 million Bitcoin.” On why Bitcoin could outperform other risk assets amid the expected injection of liquidity, Hayes says, “So Bitcoin has a fixed supply. It’s obviously a much smaller market in terms of market cap. And so you have a lot of things chasing a very small door, then the price goes up on the margin. And so that’s why Bitcoin has been the best performing financial asset in the last 15 years.” Bitcoin is trading at $104,462 at time of writing. ?

In a strongly worded tweet, Farina rejected recent attempts to discredit the use of cold wallets , describing them as either “the dumbest take of the year” or “the most criminal.” His remarks were made in direct reaction to a video where the self-identified expert attacked the reliability and logic of cold wallet storage, questioning the judgment of cryptocurrency holders who use them. Clarification on Cold Wallet Functionality and Security Farina emphasized that devices such as Ledger, Trezor, or other hardware wallets do not store cryptocurrencies on the physical device itself. According to his tweet, these tools are secure mechanisms that store private keys, allowing users full access to their digital assets on the blockchain. He pointed out that ownership through cold wallets ensures users maintain control over their funds, distinguishing it clearly from custodial storage on centralized exchanges. He contrasted this with exchange-based storage, where users do not possess their private keys. Farina referred to historic exchange failures such as Mt. Gox and FTX as evidence of the risks associated with centralized custodianship. In his view, the ability to control one’s private keys represents true ownership, which is only achievable through self-custody methods such as cold storage. Be aware, $XRP holders Self-proclaimed “cyber security experts” are now telling people to avoid using cold wallets. This is either the dumbest take of the year… or the most criminal.

He drew comparisons to traditional assets such as Tesla or GE stocks, asking rhetorically why anyone would consider placing them in cold wallets. He argued that cryptocurrency should not be treated differently and claimed that storing crypto on exchanges like Uphold, Kraken, or Robinhood was a more secure option, owing to their significant investment in cybersecurity infrastructure. He also questioned the security of using a cold wallet purchased online, suggesting that connecting such a device to unsecured networks—such as public Wi-Fi—could compromise user funds. Throughout the video, he repeatedly used profanity and dismissed cold wallet usage as naive and unwise, directly addressing XRP holders and challenging their understanding of digital asset custody. Community Reactions and Ongoing Support for Cold Storage In response to the video and Farina’s tweet, various community members echoed the CEO’s concerns. One notable reply came from an X user named Lion of Judah, who criticized the speaker’s professionalism and referred to him as a “clown.” The commenter also shared that they had used a Nano Ledger for nearly eight years without issue, reinforcing confidence in the security and reliability of cold wallet solutions when used correctly.

He reiterated that, provided the seed phrase is safely stored and never shared, cold wallets remain one of the most secure methods of holding cryptocurrency. His intervention serves as a reaffirmation of long-held industry best practices surrounding self-custody and challenges narratives that favor centralized control over individual ownership.

According to the Inter-Service Public Relations (ISPR) , the media and PR relations wing of the Pakistan armed forces, both the heads discussed economic development and crypto. “Discussions also encompassed avenues for expanding bilateral cooperation in multiple domains, including trade, economic development, mines and minerals, artificial intelligence, energy, cryptocurrency, and emerging technologies,” the ISPR noted. Trump Has Personal Interest in Crypto Talks The luncheon meeting took place amid rising tensions between Israel and Iran, with Trump looking for a possible US involvement. According to South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman, Trump takes a “deep personal interest” in talking crypto. “There’s been US-Pak engagement on critical minerals, crypto, and Counter Terrorism.” Further, diplomatic sources in Washington noted that the meeting wasn’t arranged through routine diplomatic channels. Pakistan’s daily, Dawn, reported that deepened counter-terrorism cooperation and engagement with crypto-linked influence networks, helped Pakistan secure the meeting with Trump. Meanwhile, Trump also praised both Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistani Army chief for their roles in reducing and de-escalating tensions between India-Pakistan in May. “Prime Minister Modi just left a little while ago and we are working a trade deal with India and also with Pakistan,” Trump noted. “I am so happy. Two very smart people decided not to keep going with the war. Those are two big nuclear powers.” Pakistan’s Crypto Ambition Rises Pakistan has been mulling over several crypto advancements, including a plan to set up a Bitcoin reserve. The country’s Crypto Council noted that Bitcoin will be held and Pakistan will “ never sell them .” Interestingly, in April, Pakistan partnered with World Liberty Financial (WLF) , a company linked to the US President Donald Trump’s family. Per the agreement, the collaboration will explore asset tokenization, stablecoin development and DeFi regulatory frameworks. However, details of the deal remain vague. Crypto is already widely popular in Pakistan, with around 20 million users , placing it among the top nations in crypto trading. Additionally, global crypto exchange platforms like Binance are showing interest, as Pakistan has committed 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity to fuel Bitcoin mining and AI data centres. Hussain Nadeem, a policy strategist and Pakistani AI expert, said last month that Pakistan’s core interest in crypto is to gain access to the White House. “The regime has only ONE interest in Crypto: Access to Trump White House, and sadly this hype is all about that, nothing more.” Crypto is the new SIFC: The way this regime is approaching Crypto, it has unfortunately become a yet new con that has politics, not public good, as an end goal.

Data shows altcoins are still seeing selling pressure, with minimal demand from investors. Altcoin season is nowhere near, despite historical evidence of rallies in June. Currently, BTC dominance is still near peak levels, with no signs of rolling over into other assets. Some of the demand for altcoins is also shifted into short ‘degen seasons’ centered around meme tokens. The last true altcoin season happened in 2021, when older assets managed to reach new all-time peaks. This time around, an entire array of liquid coins are still drifting sideways, as investors become more selective. Altcoins, excluding Ethereum (ETH), only dominate under 20% of the crypto market capitalization. Selling dominates on altcoin markets, showing liquidity has been withdrawn from the wider altcoin market, with the exception of selected assets. | Source: CryptoQuant Based on CryptoQuant data, altcoins have seen ongoing selling pressure since January 2025. The market is not yet as low as the two-year crypto winter in 2023 and 2024, but there can be no altcoin market until a shift in demand. Competition also comes from another airdrop season and high-profile token sales, where users compete for potential new assets with the chance of rapid gains. The metric of centralized exchange of buying vs selling shows traders have liquidated $36B from altcoins. Any remaining gains from the late 2024 rally were erased in the first half of 2025, as traders aimed to abandon some of the long-term dead coins. The mix of VC-backed tokens and new, more liquid trading pairs for memes continued to drive down demand. Additionally, some of the activity switched directly to decentralized pairs, with no waiting times for listings. Altcoin season index remains near lows Based on the altcoin season index, it is clearly Bitcoin season. The index is at 20 points, meaning even top 100 coins and tokens are not outperforming. Previously, altcoin seasons lasted for weeks or even months. Currently, altcoin rallies are still happening, though within a much shorter time frame. In 2025, there have been calls to rethink what constitutes an altcoin season, and if traders would rush into all assets. Some legacy coins had separate rallies, while others recovered based on utility. In 2025, some of the top performers included Aave (AAVE), trading at $260.22, showing increased demand for DeFi lending. Other projects like Avalanche (AVAX) show increased activity, but their tokens still trade below the 2024 peak. AVAX returned to $17.95, despite near-record daily activity linked to new Web3 games. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is also breaking out of the pack, trading near a three-moth peak at $459.12. The token is seen as risky, potentially erasing its gains. However, BCH buyers bet on an asymmetric rally, as the coin is once again regaining its reputation as an alternative to BTC. In the longer run, ETF launches are also tracking legacy coins, potentially bringing external demand. Some categories, such as exchange tokens, are often outpacing the market, with outsized rallies in the case of HYPE and WBT. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

U.S. President Donald Trump targeting Iran’s supreme leader has sparked investor fear, leading to a sell-off in altcoins like Ether, Solana, and XRP have recorded a drop of nearly 5% to 9% in a week. If Bitcoin plunges, Altcoin will follow, thus investors are in fear of a further market crash. Trump’s Threat Triggered Crypto Sell-Off On Tuesday, Trump posted a warning on his social media , saying the U.S. knows the location of Iran’s Supreme Leader and could strike — but “not for now.” These words were enough to shake investor’s confidence worldwide. Soon after this post, Bitcoin dropped quickly from $108,952 to $103,371 before bouncing back slightly to $104,950 . Other major coins, including Ether, Solana, and XRP, also fell. Ether lost 1.5%, dropping from $2,618 to $2,462 before recovering to $2,526. Meanwhile, Solana and XRP dropped over 2% in 24 hours. However, Cardano, SUI, and Dogecoin saw even bigger losses of over 10% to 12% for the week. Fed’s Warning Adds More Caution On top of geopolitical worries, the U.S. Federal Reserve added more concerns . Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that global conflict and new tariffs could make inflation worse. Although interest rates stayed the same, Powell made it clear that the Fed isn’t ready to lower them yet. Bitcoin Stuck Between Roles As tensions rose, many investors shifted their funds into stablecoins or held on to Bitcoin, viewing them as safer compared to altcoins. Despite this, BTC hasn’t acted fully like a safe-haven asset like gold, nor has it rallied like risk assets. While Bitcoin is up 60% in the last 1 year, analysts say it’s still unclear which direction it’ll take next.

Bitcoin continues fighting for $105,000, going through some very moderate volatility in the interim, all the while altcoins are also stagnating. The Fed did note some changes in its economic outlook, though, so let’s take a closer look at the events that transpired throughout the past 24 hours. Bitcoin Price Battles for $105,000 At the time of this writing, Bitcoin’s price is trading at around $104,800, marking a very slight increase of around 0.2% on the daily chart seen below. Source: TradingView It’s worth noting that the cryptocurrency had declined to around $103,600 but the bulls were quick to intercept the move and pushed the price back towards $105K. This comes immediately after the US Federal Reserve decided to keep the general interest rates unchanged in the range between 4.25% and 4.5%. This is what the majority of the traders were expecting. In fact, according to Polymarket, there was less than 1% chance for the institution to go with a 25bps cut. Nonetheless, the FOMC update also included a few additional remarks, which do mark a slight change of tone. Most notably: Ups inflation forecast to 3% Cuts 2025 GDP forecast to 1.4% Sees 50bps in cuts this year Rates projected at 3.6% in 2026 and 3.4% in 2027 At the same time, president Donald Trump continues with his hostile rhetoric towards Fed Chairman Powell, calling him “stupid,” and insisting that the country is losing billions of dollars because of the institutions refusal to cut rates. The political pressure seems to be mounting. Altcoins Stagnate Perhaps somewhat expectedly, the altcoins market is also stagnating and failed to chart any notable moves throughout the past 24 hours. As you can see in the heatmap below, most of the alternative cryptocurrencies are trading at more or less breakeven, with a few notable exceptions, of course. For example, Uniswap’s native token – UNI – managed to increase by more than 5%, defying the market slowdown, as well as OKB, which is up by almost 8%. On the other hand, Hyperliquid’s HYPE continues crashing and is down another 7% in the past 24 hours, currently trading below $38.

As a result, Bitcoin has seen minimal price movement ever since. In a recent post shared to Trump Media & Technology Group-owned social media platform Truth Social, President Donald Trump did not hold back from harshly criticizing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s unwavering stance towards interest rates. “Too Late—Powell is the WORST. A real dummy, who’s costing America $Billions!” wrote Trump in his post . Not only that, he also included a link to an article published on the National Mortgage News site , which quoted an analysis from Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s regulator who called for the Federal Reserve Chairman to quit if he continues to maintain the current interest rate. Although the decision to keep the interest rates steady at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% range, it has left Bitcoin ( BTC ) at a standstill. Ever since it was announced that the Fed unanimously voted to maintain its current policy in June, Bitcoin has been stuck around the $104,000 floating around the mark, seeing weak gains of only 0.28% to as low as 0.1%. It appears that the Fed’s cautionary stance has triggered a pause in Bitcoin’s previous rally, much to the dismay of traders and the President of the U.S. himself. In the past two weeks, the largest cryptocurrency has seen a slight increase of 0.3%.

On June 18, the Federal Reserve came to a unanimous decision to maintain a “wait-and-see” approach to the current monetary stance in June. According to a CNBC report , Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a press conference that policymakers are “well positioned to wait” before moving further on rates. He also said that the market is beginning to see the effects of Trump’s tariffs on inflation. “We have to learn more about tariffs. I don’t know what the right way for us to react will be,” said Jerome Powell, as quoted by CNN Business from the press conference. “I think it’s hard to know with any confidence how we should react until we see the size of the effects,” he continued. Maintaining interest rates in the 4.25% to 4.5% is considered restrictive by many, considering that it led to a fall in investor confidence. Moreover, Bloomberg reported that the Fed has also revised its economic growth forecast, showing a decline for 2025. Lower GDP projections could suggest less consumer spending, weaker investment, or global headwinds. The inflation forecast for 2025 has been raised to 3%, which is above the Fed’s 2% target. This signals that inflationary pressures may be more persistent than previously expected. After the Fed refused to cut interest rates and foreshadowed a bleaker economic outlook, the U.S. stocks took a dive.

Meanwhile the S&P saw a decline of 0.03%. In contrast to the two exchanges, the Nasdaq Composite actually rose by 0.13%. However, overall stock prices were generally higher before the Fed’s announcement. On the crypto side of the market, the overall crypto market cap fell by 2.3% in the past 24 hours. The current crypto market cap stands at $3.3 trillion, after major tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) saw declines ranging from 1.6% to 0.2%. Even the overall crypto trading volume suffered a 15% fall following the Fed announcement, from an initial $120 billion to $101 billion on June 19. Additionally, the CBS reported that the central bank expects inflation to worsen in the coming months. It also foresaw two interest rate cuts by the end of this year. This prediction is the same as its previous projection back in March. “For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,” said Jerome Powell. The Fed’s decision goes against increasing pressures from the White House to lower interest rated by two points. Just hours before the announcement, Trump said that “stupid” Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely keep the rates at their current levels. The remarks were part of his ongoing attacks on the Fed.

While the tokens like Jito & Raydium are leading the top gainers, Story continues to drop with an elevated volume. The crypto market is never short on surprises, and the recent performance of two trending altcoins, SUI & SEI, is a perfect example. But what’s causing the opposing movements? Let’s break it down! Why is SEI Price Rising? SEI, the native token of the Sei Network, has been gaining serious momentum in 2025, network activity and network expansion playing a major role. The TVL of SEI has surged past $3 billion, recording a massive rise from $715 million. Additionally, daily active addresses on the network have grown from 61,000 to 260,000, which is a clear signal of growing adoption and utility. Besides, Sei’s decentralized exchanges have seen volumes rise to $640 million, while stablecoin supply—primarily USDC—has ballooned to over $200 million, boosting investor confidence. On the charts, SEI broke out of a long-term corrective pattern and has displayed huge room for growth. The daily chart of SEI suggests growing bullish momentum as the price is holding the ascending support. The MACD is about to undergo a bullish crossover, while the RSI is displaying a bullish divergence after rebounding from the lower threshold. With this, the SEI price is believed to rise above $0.2 and secure the resistance at $0.21. With this, the probability of the formation of ‘w-shaped’ patterns could become viable, and hence, the neckline range between $0.25 and $0.27 could be the next target. Once the SEI price rises above this range, the token may experience a 40% upswing and enter the crucial resistance zone between $0.39 and $0.4. Why is the SUI Price Falling? On the other hand, SUI, the token of the Sui blockchain, has faced significant downward pressure in recent weeks. The main reason behind the drop is the decrease in the open interest and the coiling bearish sentiment. This indicates the traders are closing positions and moving to the sidelines. Unlike SEI, SUI has dropped below key support levels and moving averages that led to holding above the $3 to $3.5 resistance zone. As seen in the above chart, the SUI price is repeating the previous pattern, where the prices remained stuck within a falling wedge. The token withstood a Death cross within the wedge that dragged the levels down by more than 25%, reaching the support of the wedge. Currently, the price is already testing the support and another Death cross; the token may break the support. On the other hand, the CMF has been juggling within a narrow range around 0 since the start of the year, indicating no major money inflow. Therefore, if the SUI price survives the current condition and recovers above $3, then it may secure levels above $3.22. Hence, by validating a breakout above the wedge, the SUI price may begin a fresh bullish wave. Until then, the bearish clouds may hover over the rally.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|SUI|SEI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-19 09:32:47

The meme-inspired coin is now trading at $0.1701, having dropped 10.41% in the past 7 days and 23.52% over the last month. The chart, published via TradingView, shows DOGE compressing into a tightening wedge bounded by descending resistance and ascending support, with price currently hovering near the lower bound of the structure. Martinez highlights the key range to watch: $0.16 to $0.22. A daily close outside of this band, he notes, will likely determine the next major trend direction. DOGE triangle. Source: Ali Martinez “Dogecoin looks prime for a 60% price move,” Martinez wrote. “All you need to do is wait for a daily close outside of the $0.16 to $0.22 range to determine the direction of the trend.” Is it possible for DOGE price? This technical pattern, known as a symmetrical triangle, typically signals an approaching breakout. However, it does not predict direction; traders must wait for confirmation either above resistance or below support. Adding to the uncertainty is a notable decline in trading activity. 24-hour volume has fallen to $919.85 million, down 11.34%, reflecting cautious sentiment and reduced conviction ahead of the anticipated breakout. Despite DOGE’s volatility and meme status, symmetrical triangles have historically produced sharp breakouts in the asset, with previous moves ranging from 40% to 70% following confirmation. A bullish close above $0.22 could target the $0.35–$0.38 zone, while a breakdown below $0.16 might open the door to a retest of $0.13 or lower.

Accordingly, Anthony Scaramucci criticized companies issuing debt instruments to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) for their corporate treasuries. The famous CEO warned that this strategy would become obsolete, describing it as a risky trend that could harm Bitcoin. “This is Risky, Bitcoin Will Suffer Damage!” Speaking at the DigiAssets 2025 conference, Scaramucci argued that it was dangerous for companies to start buying Bitcoin in the style of Michael Saylor's company MicroStrategy (Strategy). “I don’t think it’s right for companies to buy BTC by issuing debt for their corporate reserves. But this happens all the time in our industry and it feels like SPACs. “I'm worried that this could eventually create a rift and hurt Bitcoin.” While borrowing money to buy Bitcoin is currently the most popular thing to do, “it will become obsolete and it will hurt Bitcoin,” Scaramcci said. We Think Differently with Michael Saylor! While the views that Bitcoin is digital gold are increasing day by day, Scaramucci said that he is among those who think that Bitcoin is digital gold. Stating that he thinks differently from Michael Saylor on this point, Scaramucci said that Saylor sees Bitcoin as digital property. At this point, although Anthony Scaramucci and Michael Saylor are optimistic about the Bitcoin price, Scaramucci believes that Bitcoin is “digital gold”; Saylor believes that Bitcoin is a “digital asset” with a potential value of $5 trillion. “For me, Bitcoin is digital gold and that is why I think it will be traded according to market value of gold. “If Michael Saylor was here, he would say, 'No, this is digital property, it's going to be tied to the rest of the world's property.' He thinks Bitcoin will be a $500 trillion asset. I think it's going to be a $24 or $25 trillion asset.” While Strategy’s aggressive Bitcoin purchases have been closely monitored by the market, analysts at The Kobeissi Letter noted that a forced liquidation scenario for Strategy due to its BTC purchases is very unlikely.

46335651,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=749499,1750326014,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46335651.jpeg,Japan cuts 30- and 40-year bond sales by 10%,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/japan-cuts-30-and-40-year-bond-sales/,"Japan is making a rare mid-year move to ease the selloff in its debt markets by cutting back how many long-dated bonds it sells for the rest of the fiscal year. The finance ministry will shrink planned sales of 30- and 40-year Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) by about 10%, in a direct response to spiking yields and flopped auctions that rattled investors last month. This trims overall bond issuance and comes as the government tries to stop too much supply from crushing the market any further. The change was laid out in a draft seen by Reuters, and it hits right as global debt investors have started pulling back from ultra-long paper. This cut hits three key maturities: 20-, 30-, and 40-year debt. All of them will see lower issuance at every monthly auction starting July. The 20-year bond gets cut by 900 billion yen, now totaling 11.1 trillion yen for the year. The 30-year also loses 900 billion yen, bringing it down to 8.7 trillion yen, while the 40-year drops 500 billion yen, ending at 2.5 trillion yen. That’s 100 billion yen shaved off per auction for each of those long-end tenors. Japan moves to short-term debt and adds household bonds The finance ministry isn’t just pulling back. It’s also redirecting. As part of the same plan, it will sell more short-term securities, including two-year notes and shorter T-bills. Those will each get 600 billion yen more in issuance. Starting October, each auction of two-year bonds will rise by 100 billion yen, hitting 2.7 trillion yen total. On top of that, they’ll also issue 500 billion yen more in principal-guaranteed JGBs aimed at retail investors, trying to balance their investor base and soak up more demand from individuals instead of just institutions. Japan’s Ministry of Finance is also preparing to buy back older super-long bonds that carry low coupons. That’s meant to rebalance supply and demand, especially since those older bonds aren’t very appealing in a higher-yield environment. This whole revised issuance program will be discussed with primary dealers during a scheduled meeting on Friday, where officials are expected to get feedback before locking in the changes. The background to this isn’t just about Japan’s own market. The whole global bond market has been under pressure, with investors dumping long-term debt across the board as inflation and credit concerns flare up again. That’s partly why Japan’s longest-dated JGBs became a target last month. Investors didn’t want to hold duration anymore. Super-long yields surged. Auctions flopped. That’s when the finance ministry had to step in. Traders react and analysts raise warnings on credit risk The fallout has already hit the bond market. After the news of the cut in long-term issuance hit, demand for five-year JGBs soared. The most recent auction got the highest bid-to-cover ratio in almost two years. The five-year yield dropped 4 basis points, settling at 0.965% by Thursday afternoon. Meanwhile, the very long-dated stuff didn’t benefit much. The 30-year yield actually climbed 1.5 basis points to 2.945%, showing the market still isn’t calm on that end of the curve. This isn’t Japan’s first time scaling back long bonds. The original bond plan for the year already factored in smaller 30- and 40-year sales due to lower appetite from the insurance sector. Most life insurers, who are the traditional buyers of long paper, had already stocked up early to meet new solvency rules. But what really broke the system was the global selloff and a panic about debt sustainability across rich countries. That dragged Japan in too. Not everyone is impressed by how Japan’s handling this. Katsutoshi Inadome, who’s a senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management, said the move to avoid raising five-year issuance caught markets off guard. “It was a (positive) surprise to the market that the government is not increasing sales of five-year JGBs in the revision,” Katsutoshi said . But then he added a more blunt take on the broader change: “Heavier reliance on shorter-term bonds is a sign of Japan’s falling credit quality. Essentially, it’s not the Ministry of Finance’s responsibility but lawmakers’ to carry out debt management with a sense of crisis.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Economy|JPY,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-19 09:40:14

This convergence is largely happening through the growth of Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, where tangible and intangible assets from the traditional world are brought onto the blockchain. A significant stride in this direction has just been announced, involving Ethena Labs , the creators of the synthetic dollar protocol, and none other than BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, through their tokenized fund, BlackRock BUIDL . Ethena Labs, USDtb, and the 24/7 Swap Revolution At the heart of this news is Ethena Labs , known for its synthetic dollar, USDe, and more recently, its stablecoin, USDtb. Ethena has enabled a crucial functionality: 24/7 swaps between USDtb and BlackRock’s tokenized U.S. Treasury fund, BUIDL. This isn’t just a simple exchange; it’s a move that aims to provide seamless access to on-chain dollars for qualified users. The mechanism facilitating these swaps is the USDtb Liquidity Fund. This fund acts as a bridge, allowing eligible participants to move efficiently between the Ethena ecosystem’s stablecoin and the yield-bearing, tokenized Treasury asset offered by BlackRock. This round-the-clock availability is a key feature, contrasting with traditional finance markets which have specific operating hours. In the crypto world, things move non-stop, and this integration reflects that. Understanding BlackRock BUIDL: Tokenized Treasury Power BlackRock’s entry into the RWA space has been closely watched. Their BUIDL fund, or BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, is a tokenized fund that provides qualified investors with exposure to U.S. dollar-denominated cash, U.S. Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. It operates on the Ethereum network, marking a significant step for a traditional finance giant into the world of on-chain assets. BUIDL represents a fraction of ownership in the underlying assets held by the fund. By tokenizing these assets, BlackRock is making them accessible and transferable on a blockchain, opening up new possibilities for liquidity and integration within the digital asset ecosystem. For investors looking for the stability of U.S. Treasuries combined with the potential efficiencies of blockchain technology, BUIDL is a compelling option. Securitize: The Critical Bridge for Qualified Access Accessing tokenized securities like BlackRock BUIDL isn’t as simple as buying typical cryptocurrencies on an exchange. These are regulated financial products. This is where Securitize plays a vital role. Securitize is a leading platform for RWA tokenization and security tokens, specializing in compliant digital asset issuance and management. Securitize is the gateway through which users must be onboarded to become ‘qualified users’ eligible to participate in the USDtb to BUIDL swaps. This involves Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks, ensuring that the process adheres to necessary regulations. Securitize’s infrastructure provides the compliance layer that makes the interaction between Ethena’s protocol and BlackRock’s regulated fund possible within a legal framework. RWA Tokenization: Why This Integration Matters The integration between Ethena Labs, USDtb, and BlackRock BUIDL via Securitize is a prime example of the growing impact of RWA tokenization . It demonstrates how blockchain technology can be used to create new, efficient pathways for interacting with traditional financial assets. Here’s why this development is significant: Bridging TradFi and DeFi: It directly links a prominent DeFi protocol (Ethena) with a product from a major TradFi institution (BlackRock), facilitated by a key RWA infrastructure provider (Securitize). Increased Liquidity for RWAs: By enabling 24/7 swaps with a widely used stablecoin like USDtb, it potentially increases the liquidity and accessibility of tokenized Treasury assets for eligible participants. Validation for RWA Tokenization: The involvement of names like BlackRock and Ethena lends further credibility and momentum to the RWA tokenization movement. Enhanced Capital Efficiency: Qualified users can potentially move more seamlessly between stable, on-chain dollars (USDtb) and yield-generating tokenized assets (BUIDL). This specific integration showcases a tangible use case for bringing high-quality, regulated financial assets onto the blockchain, offering benefits like programmability and fractional ownership that are inherent to digital assets. What Are the Benefits of Swapping USDtb for BlackRock BUIDL? For the qualified users who can access this feature, the benefits are quite clear: 24/7 Access: Unlike traditional markets, the ability to swap between USDtb and BUIDL is available around the clock, offering flexibility. Yield Opportunity: Swapping USDtb for BUIDL allows users to potentially earn yield generated by the underlying U.S. Treasury assets held by the BlackRock fund. On-Chain Efficiency: Performing these swaps on-chain can reduce the friction and settlement times associated with traditional asset transfers. Access to Quality Assets: Provides a direct, compliant pathway to access a tokenized fund managed by a globally recognized asset manager. This creates a powerful synergy where the liquidity and accessibility of the Ethena ecosystem meet the stability and yield potential of BlackRock’s tokenized Treasury fund, all within a compliant framework enabled by Securitize . How Does Securitize Ensure Compliance and Access? The critical element ensuring this bridge between DeFi and TradFi operates correctly is the compliance layer provided by Securitize . As tokenized securities, BUIDL tokens are subject to regulations. Securitize handles the necessary processes to ensure that only eligible, qualified investors can hold and interact with these tokens. Their platform manages the investor onboarding process, including verifying investor accreditation status and performing ongoing compliance checks. This is non-negotiable for regulated assets and is what allows institutions like BlackRock to participate in the tokenization space while adhering to their legal obligations. Without platforms like Securitize, direct swaps between DeFi protocols and regulated tokenized funds would be far more challenging, if not impossible, to implement compliantly. The Future of USDtb and RWA Tokenization The integration between Ethena’s USDtb and BlackRock BUIDL through Securitize is more than just a single partnership; it’s a signal for the future direction of the digital asset space. It highlights the increasing demand for bringing high-quality, yield-bearing traditional assets onto the blockchain in a compliant manner. Stablecoins and synthetic dollar protocols like Ethena’s USDe and USDtb are looking for robust, reliable, and compliant ways to back their value and potentially generate yield. Tokenized Treasury funds like BUIDL offer exactly that. As the RWA tokenization market matures, we can expect to see more such integrations, connecting various parts of the DeFi ecosystem with a wider range of tokenized real-world assets, from real estate and private equity to commodities and credit. This move positions Ethena Labs and its USDtb as a key player in the RWA-DeFi convergence, offering a clear, liquid pathway for qualified users to interact with regulated tokenized assets like BlackRock BUIDL . It underscores the potential for blockchain technology to not only disrupt finance but also to enhance and integrate with existing financial systems. In Conclusion: A Milestone for RWA and DeFi The ability to swap USDtb with BlackRock BUIDL 24/7, enabled by Securitize , represents a significant milestone. It’s a tangible example of how Ethena Labs is helping to bridge the gap between the fast-paced, always-on world of DeFi and the regulated, asset-backed stability of traditional finance through RWA tokenization . This integration provides qualified users with enhanced flexibility and access to yield-generating opportunities on-chain, paving the way for further collaboration and innovation at the intersection of these two powerful financial realms.

The news coincides with the NYSE‘s recent approval of a new leveraged XRP ETF , marking rising mainstream interest in the cryptocurrency. Standard Chartered Analyst Predicts XRP Will Overtake Ethereum by 2028 Source: Geoffrey Kendrick, Global Head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered Key Claim: XRP could surpass Ethereum in market valuation within 3 years (by 2028) Breakdown of XRP Thesis … — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) June 19, 2025 XRP to Challenge ETH by 2028 Geoffrey Kendrick, Global Head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered Bank, believes XRP is on track to surpass Ethereum in market value within the next three years. Speaking to News.Az , Kendrick said XRP’s rising real-world use, strong financial position, and growing institutional interest set it apart as a top contender in the crypto market. Currently, XRP is valued at $130.9 billion with a price of $2.22, while Ethereum holds a market cap of $329.5 billion. For Kendrick’s prediction to come true, XRP would need to climb to around $5.60 , a goal that might seem ambitious but not impossible, especially considering the token has already surged 360% in the past year. Kendrick’s Says It’s Possible… Kendrick’s believes its possible as his view is based on XRP’s increasing utility, particularly in the global payments sector. Ripple, the company behind XRP, has been pushing into the cross-border transaction market and aims to capture 14% of SWIFT’s market share within five years. CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently shared this ambitious vision, highlighting XRP’s potential to become a backbone for international money transfers. Ripple’s legal clarity, following its partial win against the U.S. SEC , has also boosted confidence among institutional players. The company’s latest move, a $700 million share buyback at a hefty 135% premium, underscores investor trust and shows Ripple’s commitment to long-term growth. The company currently holds $3.7 billion in cash, no debt, and 41 billion XRP tokens, valued at approximately $91 billion. Kendrick encouraged investors to stay focused on long-term gains despite market ups and downs. He said the tariff issues will pass and Bitcoin’s steady performance suggests a bigger rally could be ahead. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP and Cardano Merger? CryptosRus Founder Says It Could Be “Unstoppable” , Institutional Interest Could Be a Game-Changer One of the key drivers of XRP’s potential rise lies in its appeal to institutions. As traditional finance continues to explore blockchain adoption, Ripple’s established infrastructure and regulatory progress give it an edge. Kendrick suggests that over time, institutional interest in XRP may even outpace Ethereum’s, especially if Ethereum struggles with scaling and high gas fees. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $2.16. In the past 24 hours, XRP recorded a trading volume of $2.71 billion, reflecting strong market activity and continued investor interest. To meet Kendrick’s prediction of overtaking Ethereum by 2028, it would need to rise about 2.5 times.

As per recent stats, Raydium boasts a TVL of $1.86 billion and an impressive annual revenue of $655.9 million. What has caught the attention of many is that its capital efficiency metrics shine, it holds a Revenue/Market Cap ratio of 19.2% and TVL/Market Cap of 2.84x. Moreover, with $67.2 million (11.9%) staked, investor conviction appears to be stout. As RAY’s price experiences a sharp intraday rebound, traders are closely watching to see whether this surge signals a broader recovery or short-term volatility. Join me as I derive the Raydium (RAY) price analysis for the near term. RAY Price vs Volatility: Weekly Comparison Recalling numbers from the recent past, as of April 30, 2025, RAY traded at $2.84 with a 1-week price volatility of 0.0609. Fast forward to today, that is, June 19, RAY’s current price stands at $2.27, with a 20% decline from the earlier high. However, despite this drawdown, the token has stabilized and rebounded nearly 10% in the past 24 hours, while weekly gains sit at a modest +1.05%. Volatility seems to have compressed slightly, as reflected in the tighter Bollinger Bands on the chart. This indicates a reduction in price swings and a potential build-up for a new directional move. RAY Price Analysis: Bullish Break or Temporary Spike? RAY’s recent price surge has injected fresh momentum into its price structure. The 4-hour chart reveals a breakout above the midline of the Bollinger Bands in 20 SMA at $2.15, suggesting bullish sentiment is taking hold. Price action pushed through resistance at $2.10 and briefly tested $2.64 before pulling back. At present, the token is trading at $2.27, holding above key short-term support at $2.10. The 10% daily spike was catalysed by a 609% surge in intraday trading volume, which tallied to $401.19 million. A decisive breakout and close above $2.526 could pave the way for a further push toward the target at $2.854. The RSI stands at 58.34, hovering just below overbought territory, implying room for additional upside while still allowing caution for volatility.

When tensions rise in critical regions, investors pay close attention. Recent reports citing foreign media via Odaily suggest the U.S. is considering a significant military action: a strike on Iran, potentially targeting the Fordow nuclear facility, as early as this weekend. This development introduces a significant layer of Geopolitical Risk into an already complex global landscape. Understanding the Source of `Middle East Tensions` What exactly is fueling these concerns? The reports stem from foreign media outlets, relayed by Odaily, indicating a potential U.S. military response targeting Iran. While specifics remain fluid and official confirmation is awaited, the focus on a key nuclear site like Fordow underscores the gravity of the situation. The Middle East has long been a region prone to volatility, and any direct military confrontation between major powers like the U.S. and Iran would represent a significant escalation of existing Middle East Tensions . This isn’t just about two countries; the implications ripple outwards, affecting international relations, energy markets, and global finance. Here’s a quick breakdown of the core elements based on the report: The Report: U.S. reportedly considering a strike on Iran. Potential Timing: As early as this weekend. Primary Target (Reported): Iran’s Fordow nuclear facility. Source: Foreign media reports, cited by Odaily. It’s crucial to remember that these are reports and considerations, not confirmed plans. However, the mere possibility is enough to inject uncertainty into markets. Why Does `Geopolitical Risk` Matter for Markets? Geopolitical events, especially those involving potential conflict in strategically important regions, have a profound impact on financial markets. Why? Because they create uncertainty. Investors dislike uncertainty. They struggle to price in outcomes when the future is suddenly unpredictable. Geopolitical Risk can manifest in several ways: Supply Chain Disruptions: Conflicts can disrupt trade routes, energy supplies, and production, leading to price hikes and shortages. Increased Government Spending & Debt: Military actions require significant resources, potentially leading to increased national debt and inflationary pressures. Shift in Investor Sentiment: Fear and panic can lead to rapid sell-offs in perceived risky assets and a flight to safety. Sanctions and Economic Warfare: Governments may impose sanctions, impacting international trade and financial flows. Historically, major geopolitical events have often triggered periods of intense market volatility. Think back to events like the start of conflicts, major political crises, or terrorist attacks. While the long-term impact varies, the immediate reaction is almost always one of heightened caution and price swings. Direct `Crypto Market Impact`: How Could a Strike Affect Digital Assets? While the crypto market operates differently from traditional markets, it is not immune to global events. The potential for a U.S. strike on Iran and the resulting escalation of Middle East Tensions could have a notable Crypto Market Impact . Here’s how: Sentiment Shift: Global fear and uncertainty often lead investors to reduce exposure to assets perceived as high-risk, which cryptocurrencies sometimes are, despite arguments for Bitcoin as a safe haven. Liquidity Crunch: In times of panic, investors might sell crypto assets to raise cash or cover losses in other markets. Safe Haven Narrative Test: Some argue Bitcoin is a digital safe haven akin to gold. Geopolitical crises test this narrative. Demand for Bitcoin *could* increase if investors truly see it as uncorrelated to traditional risks, but it could also fall if the overall risk-off sentiment dominates. Increased Use in Sanctioned Regions: Paradoxically, increased sanctions against Iran or other involved parties could potentially increase the use of cryptocurrencies for cross-border transactions, though this is a complex and often debated topic with regulatory implications. The immediate Crypto Market Impact is likely to be negative volatility driven by fear, followed by a period where the ‘safe haven’ narrative is either reinforced or weakened depending on how investors react globally. Will This Impact `Bitcoin Price`? As the leading cryptocurrency, the Bitcoin Price is often the primary indicator of the broader market’s reaction to macroeconomic and geopolitical events. A potential U.S. strike on Iran is highly likely to impact the Bitcoin Price , at least in the short term. Here are potential scenarios for the Bitcoin Price : Scenario Potential Bitcoin Price Reaction Reasoning Immediate Escalation & Fear Sharp Decline Risk-off sentiment dominates; investors sell perceived risky assets. Conflict Contained / De-escalation Recovery / Stabilisation Uncertainty decreases; market focuses on other factors. Protracted Conflict / Broad Instability Mixed / Potential Long-Term Decline Sustained global economic uncertainty outweighs specific crypto narratives. Bitcoin as Safe Haven (Strong Adoption) Potential Increase Investors flock to Bitcoin as an alternative asset uncorrelated to traditional markets (less likely for immediate, sharp conflict). In most immediate conflict scenarios, initial reactions tend towards risk aversion, which historically has put downward pressure on Bitcoin Price . However, the narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ means that sustained geopolitical instability *could* eventually drive demand if traditional safe havens are perceived as insufficient or if confidence in fiat currencies wavers. The key challenge is the unpredictable nature of both the geopolitical event and the market’s reaction. Navigating `Financial Market Volatility`: Strategies for Crypto Investors Given the potential for increased Financial Market Volatility stemming from rising Middle East Tensions and broader Geopolitical Risk , what can crypto investors do? While no strategy guarantees protection, here are some actionable insights: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how much potential loss you can withstand. Geopolitical events can cause significant, rapid price swings. Reduce Leverage: Highly leveraged positions are extremely vulnerable to sudden volatility. Consider reducing or closing leveraged trades. Diversify: Don’t put all your capital into one asset. While crypto may react in tandem, diversification across different asset classes (including traditional ones, if appropriate for you) can help mitigate overall portfolio risk. Have a Plan: Decide in advance how you will react to different market movements. Will you sell, hold, or buy the dip? Stick to your plan rather than making impulsive decisions based on fear. Stay Informed (Critically): Follow reliable news sources but be wary of sensationalism. Understand the potential implications without panicking. Consider Stablecoins: Moving a portion of your portfolio into stablecoins can preserve capital during periods of extreme volatility, allowing you to re-enter the market later. Managing Financial Market Volatility requires discipline and a long-term perspective. Short-term reactions to geopolitical news can be severe, but markets often recover or adjust over time. Beyond the Headlines: Long-Term Implications Should the reported potential strike occur, or should Middle East Tensions escalate significantly, the long-term implications for the global economy and financial markets could be substantial. This includes potential shifts in global alliances, increased defense spending, sustained energy price volatility, and potentially accelerated adoption of alternative financial systems if confidence in traditional ones is shaken. The Crypto Market Impact in such a scenario would evolve beyond immediate price reactions, potentially influencing regulatory approaches, institutional adoption timelines, and the perceived utility of cryptocurrencies in a more fragmented or unstable world. While the immediate focus is on the potential for increased Financial Market Volatility and its effect on Bitcoin Price due to rising Geopolitical Risk , smart investors will also consider how these events might shape the landscape for digital assets in the years to come. Compelling Summary Reports suggesting a potential U.S. strike on Iran this weekend have introduced a significant layer of Geopolitical Risk and heightened Middle East Tensions . Such events are notorious triggers for Financial Market Volatility across the board, and the cryptocurrency market, including the Bitcoin Price , is unlikely to be spared. While the ultimate Crypto Market Impact remains uncertain and depends heavily on the scope and duration of any conflict, investors should prepare for potential turbulence. Understanding the risks, having a clear strategy, and avoiding impulsive reactions are crucial steps for navigating these uncertain times. Geopolitical events underscore the interconnectedness of global finance and the importance of risk management in the volatile world of digital assets.

The Canadian company plans to register its securities with the agency and list them on the Nasdaq Exchange under the symbol STKE. The Form 40-F is a requirement by the SEC for Canadian firms seeking to register securities for trading in the U.S. market. While the agency reviews the application, SOL Strategies’ common stock will continue trading on the OTC market under the ticker CYFRF and on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) under the ticker HODL. SOL Strategies moves to U.S. markets The Nasdaq exchange is the second largest exchange in the world with a market capitalization of $30.12 trillion and more than 3,300 company listings, while the CSE has 762 total securities as of April 30. CEO of Capital Management, Anthony Pompliano, argued that too many crypto-related public companies have been boxed out of the U.S. market due to the regulatory environment. After the SEC filing, SOL Strategies’ stock surged by 4.39% in Tuesday’s trading session. The stock reached 2.42 Canadian dollars ($1.76) and ended the trading day at 2.38 Canadian dollars ($1.73). According to Google Finance, the stock is down 17% year-to-date and has fallen 61% from its all-time high of 6.1 Canadian dollars, which it reached on January 22. “Submitting our Nasdaq application represents a pivotal step in our journey to bridge institutional investment with the boundless potential of the Solana ecosystem. This milestone positions us to drive transformative growth and deliver sustained value to our shareholders as we bring our strategic vision to life.” -Leah Wald, CEO of SOL Strategies. SOL Strategies also reported a net loss in the second quarter, even as revenue from staking and validating surged. The firm reported a net loss of CAD 4.8 million ($3.5 million) for Q2 2025, while revenue for the period surged to CAD 2.54 million ($1.85 million) from CAD 67,000 in the same period a year earlier. The company rebranded from Cyberpunk Holdings in September and has since focused on Solana’s blockchain. SOL Strategies has been accumulating SOL as part of its Solana treasury reserve strategy and operating a Solana validator. SOL Strategies doubles down on Solana According to SOL Strategies’ website, as of June 2, it held more than 420,000 SOL tokens, worth approximately $61.32 million. On December 2, 2024, the company announced a letter of intent detailing plans to acquire additional validators to strengthen its position in the Solana ecosystem. The initiative would increase the SOL delegated to the company’s validators by 554,714, reaching 1,493,378 SOL, valued at CAD 470.4 million. The transaction also includes a $750,000 cash payment (or equivalent in SOL or USDC) upon closing and $750,000 in common shares issued at the agreement’s signing price. The firm said it will issue an additional $5 million in shares over three years, contingent on performance targets. On May 27, the crypto company disclosed that it had filed a prospectus with Canadian regulators, which could see the company issue its stock to raise as much as $1 billion shortly to invest in the Solana ecosystem. Wald said “filing a base shelf prospectus supports the company’s growth strategy by providing us with the flexibility to access capital as future opportunities arise in the Solana ecosystem.” In May, SOL Strategies also issued convertible notes worth $500 million to buy and stake SOL tokens. The firm also stacked more SOL and added SUI, dramatically reducing its Bitcoin holdings. Analysts from Cantor Fitzgerald said on Monday that companies investing in Solana benefit from the increased use of SOL in the financial industry.

Together, the posts have added fresh fuel to the Bitcoin conversation, drawing in both long-time believers and curious onlookers. Here’s what’s behind the latest Bitcoin buzz. Max Keiser’s ‘Satoshi’ Post Sparks Crypto Reactions Max Keiser, well-known Bitcoin maximalist and advisor to El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele, shared a cryptic post on X. It featured a GIF of a hooded figure kneeling before a sword embedded in stone – strongly resembling the legend of King Arthur and Excalibur. The post carried just one word: “Satoshi.” The tweet quickly grabbed attention. Some users called Satoshi Nakamoto a “deity,” while others took the image as a symbol of Bitcoin’s role in challenging a broken financial system. Satoshi pic.twitter.com/qezco1kjRF — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) June 18, 2025 One user wrote: “He created Excalibur, which, like Bitcoin, conquers the monetary establishment.” Whether a tribute to Bitcoin’s creator or a deeper message, the tweet added another layer to the ongoing mystery around Satoshi Nakamoto and sparked a wave of discussion. Kiyosaki Predicts Bitcoin Will Reach $1 Million Adding more to this, “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author Robert Kiyosaki made a shocking prediction: Bitcoin could be trading at $1 million per coin by 2030. PRICE vs QUANTITY Poor people focus on price. Rich people on quantity. I do not care much about the spot price of gold or silver. I do care about how many ounces of gold and silver I control. The same with Bitcoin. While I watch the price of Bitcoin I focus on how many… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 18, 2025 Kiyosaki said he started buying Bitcoin when it was just $6,000 and continues to stack it. He emphasized that it’s not about the current price – it’s about how much Bitcoin, gold, and silver you own. In another tweet, he pointed to his 2013 book Rich Dad’s Prophecy , where he warned of a major financial crash. He believes that collapse is now happening. With AI threatening jobs and many retirees seeing their savings wiped out, Kiyosaki’s advice is simple: “Save gold, silver, and Bitcoin.” Bitcoin Back in the Spotlight Keiser’s eerie GIF and Kiyosaki’s bold forecast have once again pushed Bitcoin into the spotlight – this time as both a cultural symbol and a hedge against economic chaos.

While many companies are buying Bitcoin at this point, Nasdaq-listed healthcare firm Prenetics Global has become the latest company to join the institutional Bitcoin hoarding race. Related News: Huge BTC Move Comes From The Company That Consults The Person Who Convinced Donald Trump About Bitcoin! While the increase in institutional adoption is notable, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan spoke about the demand for BTC. Matt Hougan argued that investors globally are now questioning the future of the fiat currency system and have begun to turn to Bitcoin and gold as safe havens. Hougan said he believes the world is beginning to question the very foundations of the fiat currency system that has defined the modern economy since the early 1970s. Stating that the fiat currency system is no longer stable and secure at this point, Hougan said that central banks are turning to gold to protect against currency depreciation, while investors are increasingly turning to Bitcoin as a digital alternative. The Bitwise CIO said that central banks, which were routine buyers of gold before 1971, abandoned the gold narrative and entered a period of unlimited money printing, but started buying gold again after the 2008 financial crisis due to growing concerns about fiat money. Pointing out that Bitcoin purchases with gold have also increased recently, Hougan said that a total of $45 billion has been invested in Bitcoin ETFs as of January 2024, while only $34 billion has been invested in gold ETFs in the same period. At this point, Hougan added, traditional portfolio strategies are now risky. Finally, Hougan noted that Bitcoin will emerge as a modern store of value as inflation concerns rise and trust in government-issued currencies decline, further reinforcing the need for investors to include alternatives like Bitcoin and gold in their portfolios. *This is not investment advice.

But as eyes lock on ETH’s slow march upward, a new DeFi project is quietly making noise of its own. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending protocol still in presale, has now surpassed 12,200 holders and raised over $10.8 million in its fifth presale phase—at just $0.03 per token. While ETH dominates headlines, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing attention as the DeFi divergence pick with real earning potential, passive income systems, and unmatched tokenomics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not trying to compete with Ethereum, but rather to complement its role in the DeFi ecosystem. The protocol is being built as a non-custodial, decentralized platform that allows lenders to deposit assets like ETH, DAI, or AVAX and earn interest on them. Unlike traditional lending systems, interest rates on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) adjust automatically based on the utilization of liquidity pools. When more borrowers take loans from a pool, interest rates rise. That, in turn, attracts new lenders who want to benefit from the higher earnings. The system is dynamic, responsive to market behavior, and designed to self-regulate. What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is its unique approach to liquidity and passive income through a powerful mechanism: mtTokens. When someone deposits an asset into one of Mutuum’s liquidity pools, they receive mtTokens in return. These tokens represent the depositor’s original assets and the interest that builds over time. For example, depositing 5 ETH will result in the user receiving 5 mtETH. These mtTokens automatically grow in value as interest accrues, and users can hold, trade, or even use them as collateral within the same ecosystem. A New Class of Passive Crypto Earnings Emerges While Ethereum (ETH) has solidified its reputation as the base layer for DeFi, its core utility remains infrastructure. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating actual earning opportunities for its users through both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. In the P2C model, users supply assets to a communal pool and earn yield based on borrower activity. In the P2P model, users can negotiate direct loans with custom terms, offering more tailored agreements. This versatility opens the door to higher earning opportunities while still retaining the core principle of safety through over-collateralization. Depositors will always maintain control of their assets through non-custodial smart contracts, which they can exit from at any time, assuming enough liquidity remains in the pool. Importantly, these smart contracts are audited, with a CertiK Token Scan Score of 80.00 following a detailed review and static analysis. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also introduce a powerful incentive system for long-term users. The protocol plans to use a portion of its revenue to buy back MUTM tokens on the open market. Those purchased tokens will then be sent to safety-module participants who stake mtTokens in designated contracts. This strategy not only rewards loyal participants but also adds consistent buying pressure on the token—strengthening both its demand and price stability. To illustrate the earning power at today’s presale level, consider this example: an investor who allocates $2,500 into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at the current price of $0.03 will receive 83,333 MUTM tokens. Once the project lists at $0.06, this same investment will already have doubled. But if the token rises 25x, which is not unrealistic considering its extensive use case and revenue model, those tokens will be worth $62,500. This kind of return is exactly why investors are watching the presale window closely—because early entry matters, and utility tokens like MUTM offer more than just speculative upside. Beyond this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also planning to launch a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin that will be backed entirely by the protocol’s on-chain assets. Unlike stablecoins pegged by centralized fiat reserves, this one will be algorithmically minted, allowing full transparency and real-time solvency. All interest paid by borrowers using the stablecoin will loop back into the protocol’s treasury, reinforcing ecosystem value and enhancing passive income potential for users. Beta Launch on the Horizon as Layer-2 Drives Performance In preparation for launch, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) development team has committed to a Layer-2 infrastructure, which will make transactions faster and more cost-efficient compared to traditional DeFi platforms. This decision directly addresses common bottlenecks like network congestion and high gas fees, which have held back user adoption on Ethereum-based protocols. The result will be a smoother, cheaper experience for both lending and borrowing activities—crucial to attracting consistent user engagement. According to the official roadmap, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is planning to launch a beta version of the platform at the time of token launch. That means investors participating in Phase 5 of the presale today won’t be left waiting months or years to see the protocol in action. Real features will go live quickly, with lending, borrowing, staking, and passive earning options accessible from day one for testing. Adding to the current momentum is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s $100,000 giveaway campaign, which is driving new holders into the ecosystem and accelerating social engagement. The team is actively investing in its community, marketing presence, and liquidity expansion strategies. With over 4 billion tokens in total supply and a growing base of more than 12,200 holders, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already demonstrated strong traction before hitting public exchanges. As the presale progresses and more features prepare for launch, the window to buy into this rising DeFi project at $0.03 is narrowing. The token’s planned listing price is $0.06, and expectations surrounding its DeFi utility, revenue generation, staking model, and stablecoin development are already turning heads. For those watching closely, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just another altcoin—it’s shaping up to be a cornerstone of the next wave of decentralized finance.

According to OxChain, this potential downfall could surpass the infamous collapse of FTX. ‘Strategy’s Bitcoin Tactics Resemble Ponzi Scheme’ In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), OxChain expressed concerns about Strategy’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation formula, suggesting that the company’s operations resemble a Ponzi scheme. OxChain pointed out that since 2020, MicroStrategy has transformed from a traditional software company into a significant player in the Bitcoin market, currently holding around 582,000 BTC, valued at nearly $61 billion. Related Reading: Researchers Forecast Bitcoin At $4.3 Million By 2036, Citing Institutional Demand However, OxChain claims that this impressive figure is underpinned by leverage, debt, and shareholder dilution, rather than genuine conviction in the cryptocurrency. The analyst outlined Strategy’s approach as a “cyclical financial loop”: the firm raises capital through shares or bonds, purchases Bitcoin, announces these purchases to drive up stock prices, and then raises more funds. The analyst asserts that this cycle has worked as long as Bitcoin’s price continues to rise. However, with plans for a new $1 billion share sale, OxChain believes that Strategy is increasing its risk exposure. Analyst Predicts Major Liquidation Risk OxChain warns that Strategy’s average cost per Bitcoin is approximately $70,000, creating a precarious situation. The analyst adds that if Bitcoin’s price falls significantly below this level, the company’s treasury, currently valued at around $25 billion, could quickly start to suffer losses. According to the analyst, despite Saylor’s public commitment to never sell Bitcoin, the realities of accounting and risk management may force the company to act if market conditions deteriorate. In the first quarter of 2025, Strategy disclosed $5.9 billion in unrealized Bitcoin losses, revealing the volatility of its assets. Under the new accounting standard ASC 350-60, the company is required to report fair value, eliminating the ability to hide behind book value. This transparency has already led to legal repercussions, with shareholders filing a class action lawsuit alleging that Strategy concealed the risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility while aggressively raising capital. OxChain further claimed during his social media thread that Strategy’s role as a Bitcoin access point is diminishing, especially as institutional capital flows into “more transparent and regulated options,” such as BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has amassed around $70 billion in assets under management. The analyst stressed that unlike Strategy, which reportedly faces dilution risks and operates with limited safeguards, IBIT offers a “more stable investment” for those seeking exposure to Bitcoin. Related Reading: Altcoin Alert: Expert Reveals Hottest Opportunities For The Summer Season If Strategy were to falter, the implications would be far-reaching, OxChain added. The firm holds approximately 2.77% of Bitcoin’s total supply, and a significant liquidation could send shockwaves through the market. The analyst warns that a decline in Bitcoin’s price by just 22% from its average buy price could trigger corporate liquidations, potentially leading to one of the largest liquidation events in history. Ultimately, OxChain cautions that Strategy is neither a hero nor a villain in the crypto ecosystem; instead, he said that it represents a “risk vector heavily reliant on leverage and market sentiment.” Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btcusd|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto news|Michael Saylor|Microstrategy|MicroStrategy Bitcoin|MicroStrategy bitcoin holdings|MicroStrategy news|Strategy,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-06-19 10:00:08

There has also been a lot of negativity in the crypto market, with expectations that the Bitcoin price will not make new all-time highs after failing to reclaim $111,000. Even as the market continues to bleed, crypto analysts are still predicting further crashes for the digital asset, with some expecting a break of the psychological level at $100,000. Bitcoin Price Headed For Further Breakdown Crypto analyst TehThomas had previously called the Bitcoin price crash from the $108,000 territory, suggesting that the digital asset still had to fill Fair Value Gaps (FVG) at lower levels before it could continue to soar. Then recently, the crypto analyst has once again reiterated his stance as the price had begun to fall back toward $100.000. Related Reading: XRP To End 7-Month Consolidation After 700% Surge – Is A Major Move Coming? Thomas explained that Bitcoin was already showing signs of exhaustion. Hence, the reason for the crash was due to a loss of $108,500. At this level, with the price failing to break out higher, it showed that the initial surge had been a takeout, and the right direction was actually downward. The initial bullish move was seemingly a way for an internal liquidity grab while clearing out breakout buyers at the same time. Now, the Bitcoin price has broken below an important channel at $105,000 after a successful retest. The analyst explains that this aligns with the 50% equilibrium of the high-to-low range. Naturally, this means that the asset is still bearish and could continue to decline from here. The main levels to watch were initially at $104,600, but the Bitcoin price had first broken below this level on Tuesday. Now, if the decline continues, then the next major level investors are looking at is the $102,800, where support now lies for the cryptocurrency. Below $100,000 Is Still Possible In addition to Thomas, crypto analyst Xanrox has also predicted further price crashes for Bitcoin. He points out that the formation of a bull flag does not mean the price will continue to rise, as the flag could very well break. If this happens, then the analyst sees the Bitcoin price dropping to $100,000. Related Reading: Rising Bitcoin Dominance Above 64% Dashes Hopes Of Altcoin Season, Here’s Why Unlike Thomas, Xanrox places his support levels at the much lower price of $88,000, which would suggest a major price crash from here. “When we look at the current price action, it looks like a bullish flag consolidation pattern,” the analyst said. “In this case we will probably see multiple liquidity sweeps below the previous swing lows to kick out early longs.” Another analyst, Doctor Profit, has also turned bearish, predicting a decline below $100,000. In the X post, the crypto analyst said that the Bitcoin price is likely to fall to the $94,000-$95,000 level before seeing a bounce from there. Therefore, the analyst has told investors to prepare for more red candles.

Big news is circulating in the memecoin world, specifically concerning the TRUMP memecoin ($TRUMP). Recent activity on the blockchain shows significant movements from wallets associated with the project’s team, sparking discussions and speculation across the community. Let’s dive into the details of this notable token transfer and what it might signify for the popular political-themed digital asset. What Does the Recent Coinbase Deposit Mean? According to insights shared by Onchain Lens on X (formerly Twitter), a specific wallet identified as belonging to the TRUMP memecoin team recently made a substantial move. Roughly three hours ago, this wallet deposited a significant amount of TRUMP tokens onto the Coinbase Exchange. The exact amount transferred in this single transaction was 182,068 TRUMP, which translates to approximately $1.7 million based on recent market values. This Coinbase deposit is a key piece of onchain activity that crypto market observers pay close attention to. Large transfers from team wallets to centralized exchanges often precede potential selling activity, as exchanges provide the necessary liquidity for converting tokens into other cryptocurrencies or fiat currency. However, it’s crucial to remember that deposits don’t always equate to immediate selling. They could also be for market-making purposes, providing liquidity on the exchange, or even internal team management. Analyzing the Wider Token Transfer Activity The recent Coinbase deposit isn’t an isolated event. The onchain data reveals a broader pattern of activity from the TRUMP memecoin team’s wallets over the past couple of days. Looking at the last 36 hours, the team has collectively moved a total of 254,720 TRUMP tokens to various major cryptocurrency exchanges. This larger token transfer amounts to approximately $2.4 million at current prices. The destinations for these tokens include not only Coinbase but also OKX and Bitstamp. The distribution across multiple platforms could suggest a strategy to access liquidity across different markets or potentially prepare for various types of operations on these exchanges. Here’s a quick look at the reported transfers: Coinbase: 182,068 TRUMP (~$1.7 million) OKX & Bitstamp: An additional 72,652 TRUMP (~$700,000) over the past 36 hours Total transferred in the last 36 hours: 254,720 TRUMP (~$2.4 million) Why Would a Team Move Tokens to a Crypto Exchange? Understanding the motivations behind a large token transfer from a project team to a crypto exchange is essential for interpreting the potential impact. Several reasons are common: Liquidity and Selling: The most common assumption is that the team intends to sell a portion of their holdings. This provides funding for operations, development, marketing, or simply allows early holders to realize gains. Market Making: Teams might deposit tokens to act as market makers on exchanges, providing buy and sell orders to improve the token’s liquidity and reduce price volatility. Partnerships or Listings: Sometimes, deposits are related to upcoming exchange listings or partnerships, although this is less common for established listings like Coinbase. Treasury Management: Simply moving funds for better management, diversification, or distribution to team members or advisors. Given the nature of memecoins, which are often highly speculative and driven by community sentiment, large team transfers are frequently interpreted as a precursor to selling pressure, which can negatively affect the token’s price. How Does Onchain Data Provide Insights? The ability to track these movements relies heavily on onchain data . Blockchain technology provides a transparent ledger of all transactions. By analyzing wallet addresses known or suspected to belong to project teams, early investors, or large holders (often called ‘whales’), analysts can gain valuable insights into potential future market movements. Tools and services specializing in onchain data analysis aggregate and interpret this public information, alerting the community to significant transfers like the recent TRUMP memecoin activity. While this data is powerful, it’s important to combine it with other market indicators and news, as the data itself doesn’t reveal the *intent* behind the transfers. What Could Be the Impact on the TRUMP Memecoin Price? Any large token transfer , especially from a team wallet, can create fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in the market. For the TRUMP memecoin , which has seen significant volatility and is heavily influenced by news cycles and social media sentiment, a multi-million dollar deposit onto exchanges like Coinbase is likely to be perceived as a bearish signal. Traders and investors might anticipate increased selling pressure, potentially leading to downward price movement. However, the actual impact depends on whether the tokens are sold, how they are sold (e.g., gradually vs. a large dump), and overall market conditions. Sometimes, the market absorbs such sales without a dramatic price drop, especially if there is strong buying interest. It’s a reminder that while memecoins offer potential for high returns, they also come with significant risks, and monitoring onchain data is just one tool in navigating this volatile space. In Conclusion: Navigating Memecoin Volatility The recent deposit of $1.7 million worth of TRUMP memecoin onto Coinbase, part of a larger $2.4 million token transfer to multiple exchanges, is a significant event for holders and observers of this particular digital asset. While the exact intentions behind these moves remain unconfirmed, onchain data provides transparency into the team’s activity. Large transfers to a crypto exchange like Coinbase often raise questions about potential selling pressure, a factor that is particularly relevant for the highly speculative world of memecoins. As always, staying informed through reliable sources and understanding the potential implications of such large movements is crucial for anyone participating in the cryptocurrency market.

Following Donald Trump’s win over Kamala Harris in the presidential race, the new administration wasted no time pushing forward its crypto-friendly agenda. As promised, Trump has launched multiple pro-crypto policies, including the creation of a special SEC task force focused on building a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Now, the spotlight is on the GENIUS Act — a landmark stablecoin bill that could redefine the future of digital finance in America. What Is the GENIUS Act? Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar. With a current market cap of over $261 billion, stablecoins like Tether (USDT), USDC, and USDS dominate this segment. The GENIUS Act is a new law passed to regulate this fast-growing space. While it may appear to be just another compliance step, crypto experts like Quinten believe its impact could be far greater — potentially reshaping who wins and who loses in the crypto economy. Key Features of the GENIUS Act The Act introduces strict regulations for stablecoin issuers. Here’s what it changes: Licensing Required : All issuers must be licensed by state or federal authorities. Backed by Safe Assets : Stablecoins must be backed 1:1 by cash or U.S. Treasuries . Monthly Reserve Reports : Issuers must publish detailed monthly reserve data . AML and KYC Compliance : Full adherence to anti-money laundering and know-your-customer regulations. No Political Affiliations : Issuers must not be tied to political organizations. However, critics have already raised eyebrows about the involvement of World Liberty Finance , which reportedly has links to Trump’s family. How It Could Boost U.S. Stablecoin Dominance According to Quinten, the GENIUS Act brings much-needed legal clarity, especially for banks and corporations looking to issue their own digital dollars. His viral post on X claims the act will lead to a surge in stablecoin adoption by major institutions. THE GENIUS ACT JUST PASSED The U.S. is finally regulating stablecoins and it’s bigger than you think Here’s why this bill could reshape crypto, supercharge $USDC and $USDT , and unlock the next wave of adoption pic.twitter.com/Q45IPJM9Vj — Quinten | 048.eth (@QuintenFrancois) June 18, 2025 Insider buzz suggests that giants like Amazon, Apple, Walmart, and JP Morgan are already preparing to enter the stablecoin space. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Middle East Tensions Hit Crypto Market: Altcoins Hit Hardest , Bad News for Decentralised Stablecoins? While the act supports institutional stablecoins, it could crush decentralised projects. Here’s why: Unlicensed issuers are banned from operating in the U.S. The government can freeze stablecoin assets at will. Non-compliance leads to 5-year prison terms or $1 million/day in fines . Quinten warns that this crackdown could push decentralized and foreign stablecoins out of the U.S. market entirely. Final Thoughts: Is the GENIUS Act the Beginning of a New Era? The GENIUS Act marks a clear pivot in U.S. crypto policy — one that favors regulation, institutional adoption, and dollar-backed digital assets.While it opens new doors for corporate stablecoins, it also risks sidelining decentralized innovation. With Trump’s pro-crypto task force gaining momentum, the U.S. might soon lead the world in regulated digital asset development — but at what cost? .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The license, granted through the Tbilisi Free Zone (TFZ), allows Bitget to offer digital asset exchange and custodial wallet services under the country’s forward-leaning regulatory regime. The move reflects a strategic effort to broaden Bitget’s presence in regions offering operational clarity and crypto-friendly policies. Georgia continues to attract attention as an emerging player in the global digital asset sector. With its favorable tax environment, progressive crypto regulations, and ranking as a leader in crypto mining per capita, the country is fast becoming a base for international blockchain firms. The TFZ has also become a focal point for digital asset companies seeking compliant yet flexible infrastructure. By choosing Georgia, Bitget is aligning with a jurisdiction that supports both innovation and investor protection. A Strategic Move for Eastern European Expansion Bitget CEO Gracy Chen emphasized that entering Georgia is part of the exchange’s wider mission to operate in markets that recognize crypto’s long-term potential. “Regions with strong crypto-friendly frameworks are creating the foundation for the next era of finance,” she said. “Georgia is an example of how strategic policymaking can open doors for growth while guarding users’ safety and increasing accessibility.” Major digital asset platforms are turning their focus to Eastern Europe, attracted by the region’s supportive regulations and expanding user base. Several countries are now setting the standard for clear, lawful, and transparent crypto operations. For Bitget, this means engaging with governments and regulators that support responsible innovation, ensuring compliance while facilitating expansion. Global Licensing Strategy in Motion The Georgian license is the latest addition to Bitget’s expanding regulatory footprint. The company already holds authorizations across Europe, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific, including AUSTRAC in Australia, OAM registration in Italy, and Virtual Asset Service Provider listings in Lithuania, Poland, Bulgaria, and the Czech Republic. In the UK, Bitget operates under the Financial Conduct Authority through Archax Ltd, while its registrations in El Salvador and Argentina strengthen its presence in the Latin American market. Bitget Mulls Singapore Exit After License Threat Bitget and Bybit are reportedly preparing to scale back operations in Singapore following a final warning from the country’s central bank that threatens their ability to serve overseas clients. Both firms have operated in the city-state without a full license and now face a June 30 deadline to comply or withdraw. Bitget and Bybit may exit Singapore as a looming regulatory deadline bars unlicensed crypto firms from serving overseas clients. #Bitget #Bybit https://t.co/Am244781Pq — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 12, 2025 The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) last week ordered all digital token service providers without a formal license under the Payment Services Act to cease overseas activities. The directive leaves little room for negotiation and applies even to firms awaiting full approval. Offshore exchanges with front-office teams or international customers are included in the ban, according to the MAS.

The company recently announced securing a substantial $600 million facility. This isn’t just standard corporate financing; the purpose behind this massive capital injection is particularly noteworthy for the crypto space. Lion Group intends to leverage this funding to launch an ambitious Crypto Treasury strategy, placing a specific, and perhaps unexpected, digital asset at its core: the HYPE Token . What is Lion Group’s Bold New Crypto Treasury Strategy? A corporate treasury strategy traditionally involves managing a company’s financial assets, cash flow, and risk. Companies hold reserves to ensure liquidity, fund operations, and potentially generate returns on idle capital. Historically, these reserves are held in conservative assets like cash, short-term government bonds, or money market funds. However, with the rise of cryptocurrencies, some forward-thinking companies are exploring the inclusion of digital assets in their treasury holdings. This is what Lion Group is embarking upon with its newly secured $600 million. Their strategy is centered around accumulating specific cryptocurrencies as primary or supplementary reserve assets. This approach aims to potentially benefit from the growth potential of digital assets, diversify holdings beyond traditional instruments, and perhaps even use these assets for future operational purposes or investments within the digital economy. The decision by a Nasdaq-listed entity like Lion Group to allocate such a significant sum towards a Crypto Treasury strategy underscores a growing acceptance and exploration of digital assets within mainstream finance. It’s a strategic pivot that acknowledges the evolving financial landscape and the potential role cryptocurrencies can play beyond speculative trading. Why the Focus on the HYPE Token? Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of Lion Group ‘s announcement is the prominent role designated for the HYPE Token . According to the report, the company plans to accumulate HYPE as a “primary reserve asset.” This is a strong statement, suggesting a significant allocation and a belief in the token’s long-term value proposition or utility. While the original snippet doesn’t detail the specifics of the HYPE Token itself – its purpose, technology, or market position – the fact that a traditional financial firm is choosing it as a core treasury asset alongside more established names is remarkable. Several reasons could drive such a decision: Belief in Underlying Project: Lion Group may have conducted extensive due diligence on the HYPE project and its team, believing in its future success and adoption. Utility and Ecosystem: The HYPE Token might have specific utility within an ecosystem or platform that Lion Group believes will grow, increasing demand and value for the token. Strategic Partnership: There could be an undisclosed strategic relationship between Lion Group and the HYPE project team. Risk/Reward Assessment: While potentially higher risk than Bitcoin or Ethereum, Lion Group might see a significant upside potential in HYPE that justifies its inclusion as a “primary” asset in their Digital Asset Strategy . Choosing HYPE as a primary asset, as opposed to merely holding Bitcoin or Ethereum, suggests a deeper conviction in this specific token’s potential trajectory or its strategic fit within Lion Group’s broader business objectives. This focus on the HYPE Token distinguishes Lion Group’s approach from other corporate treasury allocations seen in the past. Expanding the Digital Asset Strategy Beyond HYPE While the HYPE Token is the stated primary focus, Lion Group ‘s Digital Asset Strategy is not limited to just one token. The company also plans to expand its treasury portfolio to include SOL (Solana) and SUI . The inclusion of SOL and SUI provides diversification within the crypto holdings and indicates an interest in established, high-throughput blockchain ecosystems. SOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain, is a major player known for its speed and scalability, supporting a vast ecosystem of DeFi, NFTs, and dApps. SUI is the native token of the Sui blockchain, a newer layer 1 platform developed by former Meta employees, also focused on scalability and enabling rich on-chain assets and dApps. Including these tokens alongside HYPE suggests a multi-faceted approach: Balancing Risk: SOL and SUI are generally more established and liquid than many smaller altcoins, potentially offering a degree of stability compared to a heavy concentration in HYPE alone. Exposure to Different Ecosystems: Holding SOL and SUI gives Lion Group exposure to different blockchain technologies and their respective growth trajectories and use cases. Potential for Yield or Utility: These assets might be held purely for price appreciation, or Lion Group could explore opportunities to stake them for yield or utilize them within their respective ecosystems if it aligns with their business model. This broader inclusion of SOL and SUI demonstrates that Lion Group’s Digital Asset Strategy is designed to capture potential value across different segments of the crypto market, not just focus on a single, potentially high-growth, asset like HYPE. Institutional Crypto Investment: A Growing Trend? Lion Group ‘s $600 million allocation for a Crypto Treasury strategy is a powerful example of the accelerating trend of Institutional Crypto Investment . For years, cryptocurrencies were primarily the domain of retail investors and crypto-native funds. However, in recent cycles, we’ve seen increasing interest and participation from traditional financial institutions, publicly traded companies, and large asset managers. Several factors are driving this shift: Macroeconomic Environment: Concerns about inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies have led institutions to seek alternative stores of value. Search for Yield and Growth: In a low-interest-rate environment (at times) and with volatile traditional markets, the high growth potential of crypto assets becomes more attractive. Increased Infrastructure: The development of better custody solutions, regulated exchanges, and financial products (like Bitcoin ETFs) has made it easier and safer for institutions to access crypto. Market Maturation: As the crypto market grows, its liquidity increases, and regulatory clarity (while still evolving) improves in some jurisdictions, making it a more viable asset class for large players. Lion Group’s move adds another data point to this trend, particularly notable because they are a financial services firm themselves, suggesting a deeper understanding and integration of digital assets into their core business philosophy, beyond just holding Bitcoin. Their focus on specific altcoins like HYPE, SOL, and SUI also indicates that institutional interest is broadening beyond just the largest cryptocurrencies. Potential Benefits and Challenges for Lion Group Launching a Crypto Treasury strategy comes with both significant potential benefits and notable challenges. Potential Benefits: Asset Appreciation: If HYPE, SOL, and SUI perform well, the value of Lion Group’s treasury holdings could increase substantially, boosting their balance sheet. Diversification: Digital assets offer diversification away from traditional financial markets. Strategic Positioning: Building expertise and holdings in digital assets positions Lion Group for future opportunities in the evolving financial landscape, potentially enabling them to offer crypto-related services themselves. Inflation Hedge: Some view cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as a potential hedge against inflation, though this is debated and can vary by asset. Challenges and Risks: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for extreme price swings, which could lead to significant losses on the treasury holdings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still developing globally, posing compliance risks and potential future restrictions. Security Risks: Holding digital assets requires robust security measures against hacking and theft. Accounting and Reporting: Accounting for crypto holdings can be complex under current standards. Liquidity Risk: While SOL is highly liquid, the liquidity of HYPE might be lower, making large transactions challenging without impacting the price. Lion Group, as a financial services firm, likely has a sophisticated understanding of risk management. Their decision to proceed suggests they believe the potential rewards of their Digital Asset Strategy outweigh the inherent risks, especially with a dedicated $600 million facility specifically for this purpose. Actionable Insights and Market Impact What does Lion Group ‘s move mean for the average reader or investor? Validation of Institutional Interest: This is another piece of evidence that institutions are serious about exploring and adopting crypto. It could encourage other firms to follow suit. Potential Impact on HYPE, SOL, SUI: Significant buying pressure from a large institution like Lion Group could positively impact the prices of HYPE, SOL, and SUI, particularly HYPE given its designation as a “primary” asset. Investors interested in these tokens should monitor Lion Group’s activities (to the extent they are publicly disclosed). Observe Treasury Strategies: Pay attention to how other companies are incorporating crypto into their balance sheets. This trend is still nascent but growing. Understand the ‘Why’: Rather than just following institutional money blindly, try to understand *why* firms like Lion Group are making these moves. What are the perceived benefits and risks they are evaluating? The announcement, reported by Cointelegraph on X, highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto market and its increasing interaction with traditional finance. It suggests that institutional engagement is moving beyond just Bitcoin and is starting to consider a broader range of digital assets for various strategic purposes, including corporate treasuries. Conclusion: A Bold Step into the Digital Frontier Lion Group ‘s decision to secure a $600 million facility specifically for a Crypto Treasury strategy, with a significant focus on the HYPE Token alongside established assets like SOL and SUI, marks a bold and strategic step. It signifies a strong belief in the future role of digital assets within corporate finance and positions Lion Group as an early mover among Nasdaq-listed financial services firms in this specific type of Institutional Crypto Investment . While the success of this Digital Asset Strategy will depend on market conditions, the performance of the chosen assets, and effective risk management, the move itself is a powerful indicator of the ongoing maturation and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. It reinforces the narrative that digital assets are increasingly being viewed not just as speculative instruments, but as legitimate components of a diversified financial portfolio, even at the corporate treasury level. The coming months will be crucial in observing how this strategy unfolds and what impact it has on Lion Group and the tokens involved, particularly the intriguing focus on the HYPE Token .

Speaking in an interview published Wednesday by French outlet Le Point , Durov criticized French President Emmanuel Macron’s leadership and expressed disappointment over the country’s increasing constraints on freedom of expression and digital autonomy. “Emmanuel Macron isn’t making the right choices. I’m very disappointed. France is getting weaker and weaker,” said Durov, whose messaging app has become a popular platform for free expression and privacy-focused communication. He warned that France’s rigid political culture could take decades to reform, and if change is delayed further, the country risks being forced into extreme upheaval. Durov also pointed to an exodus of talent from France to more open jurisdictions like Dubai, saying that prolonged inaction and censorship are driving innovation and entrepreneurs away. Controversial Arrest in France The interview follows Durov’s arrest in France in August 2024 —a move that sparked widespread outrage across the tech world and among human rights advocates. Civil liberties groups continue to monitor the case, which many see as emblematic of the broader erosion of digital rights and political dissent within European democracies. Durov has since appeared in multiple interviews, including a high-profile conversation with American commentator Tucker Carlson in early June. In these appearances, he has positioned himself as a defender of free speech and has openly criticized government overreach, particularly in Europe. The Telegram founder has become increasingly vocal about the legal frameworks, such as the European Union’s Digital Services Act, which he believes give authorities broad power to suppress dissent under the guise of consumer protection and misinformation control. French Intelligence Allegedly Sought Election Censorship Perhaps most notably, Durov claimed during the interview that French intelligence services had approached him with a request to censor pro-conservative content during the Romanian presidential election in May 2025. He alleged that Nicolas Lerner, the head of French intelligence, personally made the request at the Hôtel de Crillon—an offer Durov said he firmly declined. “These laws are dangerous because they can be used against those who created them,” he warned. “Today, they target those labeled conspiracy theorists. Tomorrow, they may target their authors.” The post Pavel Durov Warns of Societal Collapse in France Over Censorship Policies appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Finance and Business News|France crypto regulation|pavel durov,EN,0,0,REGULATION,"{'name': 'The Coin Rise', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecoinrise,2025-06-19 10:13:52

Ltd., a subsidiary of BitGo, Inc., as part of its $2 billion “Trust Project.” The new system will enable institutional clients to trade digital assets on KuCoin without having to pre-fund their wallets. According to a June 19 press release revealing the partnership, the move was made possible through BitGo’s Go Network for Off-Exchange Settlement (OES), which allows clients to delegate trading access while retaining custody of their assets. The partnership is reportedly designed to improve security, regulatory compliance, and operational flexibility for institutional investors. Through Go Network, clients trading on KuCoin gain access to several benefits, including qualified custody backed by insurance coverage of up to $250 million, automated post-trade settlement, and full control over their assets. Go Network integration to cover all of KuCoin exchange services KuCoin said the integration will support all its trading services, spot, margin, options, and perpetual futures, without compromising on asset protection. “ Institutional clients trading on KuCoin now benefit from a comprehensive suite of features to upgrade security, compliance, and flexibility in the digital asset space, ” the company said in its statement. Tika Lum, Head of Institutional Business Development at KuCoin, said the partnership adds to the exchange’s long-term institutional ambitions. “ Security and trust are the foundation for institutional adoption. We are proud to integrate with BitGo Singapore’s Go Network. This partnership represents a critical component of our $2 Billion Trust Project and delivers a more resilient trading paradigm to institutional clients globally ,” she stated. Brett Reeves, who heads the Go Network at BitGo, called the collaboration a major step towards “building a more efficient trading ecosystem.” “This is how digital asset trading should be, secure, compliant, and built on trust,” Reeves stated. The model introduced by KuCoin and BitGo is almost similar to the now-defunct Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), which allowed institutions to move funds seamlessly between exchanges before its closure in March 2023. SEN’s shutdown came just prior to Silvergate Bank’s liquidation during the height of the crypto winter, against the backdrop of several industry failures, including the bankruptcy of beleaguered crypto exchange FTX . KuCoin debuts regulated exchange in Thailand Just less than a week ago, KuCoin launched a regulated local cryptocurrency exchange in Thailand. The expansion follows its acquisition of ERX Company, a licensed digital token trading platform previously operating under the oversight of Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The platform was rebranded to the name KuCoin Thailand on April 22, 2025. Existing users of ERX were migrated to the updated infrastructure, with the business formally registered with Thailand’s Ministry of Commerce as of April 30, 2025. KuCoin Thailand is the company’s first fully licensed local digital asset exchange. In its announcement last Friday, the company reiterated its focus on compliance and customer protection, citing recent certifications including SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001. Thailand’s crypto market is governed by strict regulatory oversight, and KuCoin’s acquisition of ERX, the country’s first SEC-supervised digital token exchange, gives it a foothold in one of the region’s most active crypto economies. Thailand currently hosts eight other licensed crypto exchanges, including Gulf Binance, Bitkub Online, Upbit Exchange, WAAN Exchange, Thai Digital Assets Exchange, InnovestX Securities, GMO-Z.com Cryptonomics, and Orbix Trade. The Southeast Asian country’s crypto market is expected to reach a revenue of approximately $488.9 million in 2025. Additionally, the number of users in the crypto sector is projected to amount to 7.84 million users.

However, monitoring, organizing, comprehending, and optimizing the returns from a diverse set of assets presents its own challenges. This rings as true as ever now that DeFi assets are part of the equation. Unpredictable and highly variable returns make DeFi ROI a bit more challenging to understand than the returns on many other asset types. Essentially, ROI is a metric for finding whether an asset has appreciated or depreciated. It’s quite simple at its core – compare the asset’s current monetary worth to the price the investor paid to acquire it. ROI is a straightforward calculation that reveals any changes in the value of an asset over time, helping the holder determine whether they’re satisfied with the yield and whether they want to continue holding it, sell it, or make another investment. Most investors will avoid or get rid of holdings with ROIs that are insufficient or in the red. The difficulty and ambiguity in calculating DeFi ROI To calculate ROI as a percentage, you subtract the asset’s initial value from its current monetary value, divide that number by the former value, and then multiply the result by 100. However, it’s rarely that simple with DeFi assets. You typically want to understand the ROI on an asset in the context of your diverse portfolio, which usually means seeing the metric in stablecoins or a fiat currency. It’s not sufficient to calculate ROI to convert the value of an asset to your currency of choice, as DeFi assets are purchased using cryptocurrency. The inherent volatility of crypto additionally impedes the process of calculating the returns on a DeFi asset. The value of the cryptocurrency will likely have changed dramatically even if you do find out what the returns on a DeFi investment are. RWA projects present a safer yield opportunity None of the above detracts from DeFi’s advantages: openness, transparency, lack of intermediaries, efficiency, innovation, and potentially impressive returns. Tokenized real-world assets, such as real estate, fine art, and clean energy infrastructure monetized by EcoYield Energy, present a safer yet compelling yield opportunity. Combined with DeFi’s advantages, their more grounded nature can generate real yield that is more predictable, stable, and secure. Key factors influencing ROI include the cash flow generated by the investment, ongoing maintenance expenses, and the initial investment amount. It’s far easier to measure the returns on real-world assets. Their value might not be fixed, but it’s much more stable and predictable. ROI is measured as a percentage, making it easy to compare with other investment returns and allowing the holder to compare various investment types with each other. EcoYield Energy, a platform tied to tangible, revenue-generating assets, was founded on the belief that everyone should have the opportunity to participate in clean energy funding, a process currently hindered by bureaucracy. The platform connects investors across the globe with legitimate and potentially lucrative renewable energy projects, enabling them to finance solar and battery projects and access verifiable, on-chain yields. The Hull 100kW Rooftop Solar Project in the UK is being funded through the platform, among others. The construction-ready project offers stable returns with an estimated annual percentage yield (APY) of 25%, a projected carbon offset of 40 metric tons per year, and monthly stablecoin payouts. EcoYield aggregates contributor funds in fiat or the stablecoin USDC, deploys these funds into verified battery energy storage and solar projects, collects real-world revenue, and distributes the returns back to users. The annual yield on EcoYield projects in USDC ranges from 10% to 25%, and staking $EYE tokens can further boost these rates. The platform offers real revenue, as opposed to the speculative inflation inherent in DeFi, with yield sourced from actual renewable energy sales and transparent, DAO-governed infrastructure. Essentially, EcoYield aims for real assets, real yield, and real impact on the environment. Tokenized RWAs outperform the median DeFi yield The average combined annual yield of tokenized RWAs is 10.13%, a great deal higher than the 8% median DeFi yield across blockchains and protocols. RWA projects had generated active loans of more than $12 billion and total lending of $22.42 billion as of January 2025. These numbers represent real capital flowing into carbon offset projects, SMEs, real estate, and fintech, with approx. 2,500 loans solely from emerging markets. DeFi users have access to a market worth $1.6 trillion, traditionally dominated by institutional investors, which is largely driven by tokenized private credit. They can earn real yield by investing in private loans to businesses, bridging the gap between real-world economic activity and on-chain capital. Many tokenized RWA projects offer APYs exceeding 10%, which is attractive to investors seeking high returns. The returns stem from revenue-generating assets, real estate-backed loans, and private credit markets integrated into DeFi protocols. The returns on real estate-backed loans range from approx. 9% for short-term loans to 12.5% for ones with a term of three years. For investors with higher risk tolerance, the yield on junior tranches in real estate loans can be up to 48%. Sustainable yield underlies DeFi’s shift to RWAs DeFi was known for its insane APYs for years, sometimes exceeding 100% on stablecoins; however, the majority of the projects were unsustainable. Unpredictable lending rates crashed with market cycles. Some DeFi projects would promise as much as 4,000% APY, but most rewards didn’t come from actual revenue but token emissions. Yields collapsed once rewards dried up, and so did the projects. Gone are the days of sky-high APYs from unsustainable emissions. High-yield DeFi now relies on revenue from real-world assets. Green energy infrastructure, treasuries, and real estate are bringing yields from traditional into decentralized finance. RWA investment platforms focus on high-quality, risk-adjusted lending. The APYs are humbler but remain considerable and, more importantly, stable. RWA projects resemble traditional investments but without intermediaries taking substantial cuts. For all these reasons, they are expected to dominate the next phase of DeFi.",Information,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|USDC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-19 11:29:33

Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) is fueled by steady gains and growing institutional interest. With blue-chip cryptos setting the pace, attention is shifting toward top tokens only where explosive returns are possible, enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a viral DeFi token and poised for a 44x rally before summer ends. The presale of Mutuum Finance is now in Phase 5, with MUTM priced at just $0.03, rapidly approaching the Phase 6 price of $0.035. The Mutuum Finance presale has attracted over 12,200 investors. More than $10.8 million has been raised. For traders asking what crypto to buy in 2025 or what to buy before June ends, Bitcoin and Ethereum offer stability, but the real FOMO is building around that under‑the‑radar altcoin that’s ready to skyrocket. Ethereum Consolidates Near $2,625 Amid Bullish Setup Ethereum (ETH) is trading around $2,625, having seen a 0.04% uptick from the previous session. Price action shows ETH in a tight range between $2,550–$2,700 as the market digests the impact of the May Pectra upgrade and fluctuating ETF inflows, which have notably bolstered Ethereum’s appeal in the institutional market. Technical indicators suggest a moderate bullish outlook, with key support at $2,553 and resistance near $2,589; a decisive breakout above could pave the way toward the $2,800–$2,900 zone this month. Meanwhile, emerging projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remain on the radar for traders seeking diversified upside. Mutuum Finance Presale Surpasses $10.8M with Over 12,200 Early Backers Mutuum Finance is making waves across the DeFi market, raising more than $10.8 million and attracting over 12,200 investors in its ongoing presale. This rapid momentum reflects growing confidence in the project’s long-term vision and disruptive potential. Currently in its fifth presale phase, MUTM tokens are priced at $0.03, but that won’t last long. The upcoming sixth round will raise the token price to $0.035. For early participants, the current price offers a potential 100% return when the token launches at $0.006. Redefining DeFi: Mutuum’s Two-Tier Lending Approach Mutuum Finance isn’t just another DeFi project, it’s building a smarter, more flexible lending ecosystem through its dual-lending model, combining ease of use with investor control: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): On P2C, users deposit USDT into smart contracts which earn them stable and passive revenue, and are suited to anyone who wants to earn money without playing a role. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): A more sophisticated user can lend directly according to the individual terms, ideal due to its high volatility of the assets and self-made lending agreements. This hybrid method offers the users both a good return and complete control, and all in a decentralized, safe framework. Security First: Transparent, Built To Last, and Audited Mutuum Finance is a crypto project that is unique in an environment full of dubious investments and ambiguity in governance. The platform has undergone a complete security check by Certik, one of the most defined seal of quality in blockchain security. Its infrastructure is completely transparent and uses open-source smart contracts, bringing about the reassurance that DeFi in the modern times requires. Further strengthening its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance will launch a USD-pegged, fully collateralized stablecoin on Ethereum. Designed to offer lasting value and resistance to the volatility that has plagued algorithmic stablecoins, it’s a major step toward long-term stability and institutional adoption. Bitcoin eyes $110K, Ethereum trends upward, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stealing the spotlight. With $10.8M raised from over 12,200 investors, MUTM is priced at $0.03 and launching at $0.06, offering 100% gains. Backed by a Certik audit, dual-lending model, and a USD-pegged stablecoin, this DeFi gem is built for long-term impact. Don’t wait, join the presale now before the next price jump.

In coordinated actions, the Department of Justice seized $225 million linked to widespread crypto scams, while New York officials recovered and froze $440,000 from a separate operation that targeted Russian-speaking residents with fake social media ads. DOJ Seizes $225 Million in Cryptocurrency Linked to Investment Scams as Crackdown Intensifies In a sweeping move to curb the rise in cryptocurrency-related fraud, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced the seizure of more than $225 million in digital assets allegedly tied to investment scams. The seizure, executed by the US Secret Service and announced Wednesday, marks one of the largest cryptocurrency forfeitures in US history and underscores a growing focus on consumer protection amid the proliferation of digital finance. The DOJ filed a civil forfeiture complaint — a legal mechanism allowing the government to seize property linked to illegal activity — against the assets. Unlike criminal charges, such complaints are directed at the assets themselves, not necessarily individuals, and can proceed even if no one is charged with a crime. The funds in question are reportedly tied to money laundering efforts stemming from fraudulent cryptocurrency investment schemes that duped hundreds of victims across the country. 'Pig Butchering' at the Center of the Fraud According to the DOJ, the scams involved a form of fraud commonly referred to as “pig butchering.” This tactic entails cultivating a fake relationship with a victim over weeks or months to build trust — ”fattening the pig” — before persuading them to invest increasing sums in fraudulent crypto projects or trading platforms. Tether, the issuer of the world’s most widely used stablecoin, USDT, confirmed in a blog post that it assisted US authorities in the investigation and seizure efforts. The company has previously committed to working with law enforcement to block addresses associated with criminal activity. The DOJ’s announcement comes amid growing alarm over the scale of cryptocurrency-related crime. In 2024 alone, crypto investment scams led to more than $5.8 billion in reported losses, according to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center. Total losses from digital asset fraud in the same year exceeded $9.3 billion, as scammers continued to exploit the relative anonymity and lack of consumer safeguards within the crypto ecosystem. A separate action by New York authorities, also announced Wednesday, saw $140,000 seized and another $300,000 frozen in a similar scheme involving fake investment advertisements on social media platforms. That fraud impacted at least 300 people and caused losses topping $1 million. Political and Regulatory Backdrop At a press conference unveiling the civil forfeiture case, Pirro was asked whether the Justice Department would apply a similarly aggressive approach to examining President Donald Trump’s connections to the cryptocurrency industry, especially in light of his recent public endorsements and the political momentum surrounding the space. While the forfeiture process does not automatically mean victims will receive compensation, it significantly raises the likelihood that funds will eventually be returned. In civil forfeiture cases like this one, courts typically evaluate whether the government has demonstrated, on a ”preponderance of the evidence” standard, that the assets were involved in criminal activity. Victims of the scams are expected to be contacted during the restitution phase once legal proceedings conclude. However, given the size and complexity of the case, full recovery may take years. Still, many see the move as a landmark moment for crypto enforcement. New York Authorities Disrupt Crypto Investment Scam Targeting Russian Speakers, Recover Over $440K Meanwhile, in a coordinated law enforcement effort, New York state officials have announced the recovery of $140,000 in stolen cryptocurrency and the freezing of an additional $300,000 tied to a widespread cryptocurrency investment scam that preyed on Russian-speaking residents in the Brooklyn area and beyond. The operation, which utilized deceptive social media ads to lure victims, has already led to the identification of more than 300 individuals who suffered financial losses totaling over $1 million. The investigation was spearheaded by the Brooklyn District Attorney’s office, New York State Attorney General’s office, and the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS), with the goal of dismantling what they described as a sophisticated and targeted fraud operation. “These scammers targeted Russian speakers on Facebook with enticing ads, and my office, together with DFS and the Brooklyn District Attorney’s office, took action to stop these scammers and protect New Yorkers,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James in a statement issued Wednesday. James also issued a stern warning to state residents: “I urge all New Yorkers to be vigilant of online cryptocurrency investment ads. If something looks too good to be true, it probably is.” How the Scam Operated According to law enforcement officials, the perpetrators used Facebook and other social media platforms to publish professionally designed ads written in Russian, offering lucrative returns on supposed cryptocurrency investments. These ads led users to a fake crypto investment website that falsely claimed to hold a BitLicense—New York’s official regulatory license for cryptocurrency firms operating in the state. The use of a counterfeit BitLicense was especially insidious, as it added a veneer of legitimacy to the scam and helped lower the guard of potential victims. New York’s BitLicense, introduced in 2015, is known for its rigorous regulatory requirements, and many crypto users associate it with strong consumer protections. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, cooperated with authorities and reportedly removed more than 700 fraudulent ads after being notified of the investigation. This case adds to a growing list of “Black Hat” advertisement scams—ads that exploit loopholes in social media platforms’ ad vetting systems to target unsuspecting users with false or misleading claims about cryptocurrency investments. In recent years, these scams have become increasingly difficult to track, especially when they target niche communities, such as Russian speakers or other non-English-speaking groups. By narrowing their focus, scammers can appear more trustworthy and often tailor their schemes to exploit cultural trust cues and language familiarity. Among the more high-profile examples of this tactic were fake XRP airdrops impersonating Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, which promised users free crypto in exchange for small “activation fees.” These ads misused Garlinghouse’s image and references to Ripple’s high-profile legal case against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to boost credibility. Crypto Scams Evolve with Technology The case also highlights growing concerns about the evolving tactics of crypto scammers, particularly as new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) begin to be used in fraud campaigns. AI-generated deepfakes, voice cloning, and automated scam bots have already been documented in various fraud cases. A recent report from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis revealed that illicit transaction volume involving digital assets reached approximately $51 billion in 2024. While ransomware payments saw a 35% decline, investment scams and social engineering attacks remained stubbornly high, fueled in part by the use of AI tools to craft more convincing narratives and phishing attempts. Though the seizure and freezing of approximately $440,000 in crypto assets is a promising step forward, law enforcement officials acknowledged that full restitution for all victims is far from guaranteed.

The latest 30-day Solana Exchange Liquidation Map from Coinglass shows an escalating wave of short-side leverage clustered just above current price, setting the stage for a potential $1.5 billion short squeeze if bulls push the token beyond its immediate resistance zone. At first glance, the setup looks eerily similar to what we’ve seen with Bitcoin and XRP in recent weeks: a rising cumulative short liquidation curve (green), bar clusters thick with high-leverage shorts, and a flatlining long liquidation zone (red), suggesting asymmetrical risk. But Solana’s chart takes it up a notch. A closer look at Solana’s Liquidation Map The liquidation map reveals that short positions start building heavily from around $146, just a dollar above the current price. From there, the green curve steepens dramatically through $150, $155, and all the way to $170, indicating a parabolic rise in short liquidation leverage. Solana Exchange Liquidation Map. Source: Coinglass This buildup tells us one thing: traders across Binance , OKX, and especially Bybit have aggressively shorted Solana between $146 and $170, expecting a local top or pullback. But if price begins to climb through that zone, those short positions begin to auto-liquidate, triggering forced buybacks and sending the price higher in a feedback loop. The largest liquidation clusters appear between $150 and $163, with some single levels showing more than $60–75 million in exposure, mostly on Bybit. That suggests retail and aggressive leverage traders have entered positions with tight stops and high risk profiles. Why this setup matters With low spot volume and thinning resistance levels, it doesn’t take much to push SOL into a zone where shorts get flushed out rapidly. If Solana can break and hold above $146–$148, a chain reaction becomes likely. The liquidation map shows no significant resistance zones above that level until the mid-$160s. That gives SOL at least $15–20 of clean air before encountering serious sell pressure, plenty of room for liquidation-fueled price expansion. On the flip side, failure to break above $146 could embolden bears. But with short exposure this elevated, a downside rejection becomes less sustainable because it would mean millions of dollars in still-open shorts remain vulnerable to even minor bullish spikes.

Surging Open Interest Signals Increased Institutional Bets Since an increase in futures open interest generally indicates growing market activity and trader participation, Solana is most probably witnessing new money from sophisticated or institutional investors. It also means that the Solana market is more liquid, which permits easier entry and exit positions. Given that SOL futures recently soared to 46.2 million SOL, a scenario witnessed 2-years ago, large players may be positioning themselves ahead of possible regulatory developments or exchange-traded fund (ETF) announcements. As a result, this uptick is encouraging more sophisticated strategies, such as the carry trade, where investors buy SOL on the spot market and short futures to lock in price differences. While demand from buyers equals sellers in futures markets, the increase in activity reflects renewed confidence in Solana’s long-term potential. Solana recently shook up the crypto world with a $1 billion institutional raise and launch of its first public liquid staking strategy. DeFi Development Corp. recently secured a $5B equity line to boost its Solana treasury and fast-track SOL per share growth — a bold bet on Solana’s expanding ecosystem. Is Solana $200 Target on the Horizon? Given that Solana is currently locked in the $140 to $160 range, this altcoin might be building momentum needed to soar to the $170 zone. Market analyst Lingrid, acknowledged , “Solana has pulled back into the support zone after failing to hold above short-term resistance near 160. Price is now compressing just above the support line with a potential rebound setup forming. The structure favors a stair-step recovery if buyers defend the green zone. A breakout above recent highs could open the path toward the 170 target area.” Based on this analysis, buyers will have to steadfastly defend the critical support level of $140 because this will ignite the fire needed to soar to the psychological price of $200. Therefore, time will tell how Solana plays out in the short term with an ETF approval being seen as a game-changer that will boost SOL’s bullish quest. Delving Deeper into the Impacts of a Solana ETF A Solana ETF could redefine the crypto investment landscape, unlocking mainstream access and legitimizing one of the fastest-growing blockchain ecosystems. While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have already paved the way for institutional adoption, a Solana ETF would represent a pivotal step toward broader market diversification and increased exposure to high-performance Layer 1 blockchains. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently moved closer to making a key decision on Solana ETFs. This might be the reason why the chances of a SOL ETF approval have jumped to an all-time high of 92% per Polymarket data . Mainstream Accessibility ETFs simplify crypto investing. A Solana ETF would allow retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to SOL without needing a crypto wallet or navigating decentralized platforms. This ease of access is critical for onboarding traditional investors who are interested in blockchain innovation but wary of the operational complexities of digital assets. Institutional Validation A regulated Solana ETF would signal strong institutional confidence in Solana’s long-term viability. It would likely follow rigorous regulatory scrutiny, increasing investor trust.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-19 11:39:23

He noted that this could pose challenges for the central bank in overseeing foreign exchange. In a press briefing on Wednesday, Rhee said issuing won stablecoins may not reduce the use of dollar stablecoins, but rather facilitate the exchange between dollar stablecoins and won stablecoins, which may increase the demand for dollar stablecoins. However, his warning clashed with new South Korean President Lee Jae Myung’s agenda to promote won-pegged stablecoins, mainly to prevent capital flight. The ruling Democratic Party proposed earlier this month that the Digital Asset Basic Act, designed to set up regulatory infrastructure, needs to allow local companies to issue won-denominated stablecoins. President Lee appointed Kim Yong-beom, a former crypto firm chief, as his chief policy officer in his first week in office, further boosting speculation that the government would allow issuance of stablecoins backed by the Korean won. Rhee says he is not against the issuance of a won-backed stablecoin Rhee pointed out that he is not opposed to the issuance of a Korean won-pegged stablecoin and, in fact, saw a need for it. However, he added that the impact of such a stablecoin on the monetary system would depend on the form of issuance and the type of assets backing it. Governor Rhee also pointed out that allowing non-banking institutions to issue won-based stablecoins freely could seriously weaken monetary policy. An official from a local commercial lender also said stablecoins are not yet lucrative for banks. But if the won-based stablecoin materialized, banks would, of course, want to play a central role. The proposed stablecoin seeks to reduce reliance on dollar-backed stablecoins, which the Bank of Korea said reached $41.6 billion (56.95 trillion won) on Korea’s five major cryptocurrency exchanges– Upbit , Bithumb, Korbit, Coinone, and Gopax–in Q1 2025, marking a threefold increase from 17.06 trillion won in the third quarter of 2024. An official from the BOK also said the issuance of stablecoins could increase the money supply and potentially affect the status of the won. The official reportedly said it was necessary to approach the matter cautiously, adding that another potential loophole lay in cross-border transactions, possibly threatening the country’s financial stability. South Korea pushes stablecoin bill under new president South Korea’s new president, Lee Jae-myung, is moving fast on campaign pledges as the ruling Democratic Party proposed the Digital Asset Basic Act, which was announced on Tuesday to issue local stablecoins. The bill aims to improve transparency and boost competition within the crypto sector. The move also came as stablecoin trading in South Korea surged, reaching 57 trillion won in Q1 alone. Under the proposed law, South Korean firms could issue stablecoins if they held at least 500 million won in equity capital. These issuers must maintain sufficient reserves and gain approval from the Financial Services Commission (FSC). However, Governor Rhee voiced opposition, warning that private stablecoins could undermine the central bank’s control over monetary policy. President Lee’s push for broader crypto integration also included proposals for the national pension fund to invest in Bitcoin and permitting Bitcoin ETFs. Governor Rhee said the central bank would work with the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Financial Services Commission to establish appropriate measures as soon as possible. “We would need to consider the broader implications for bank profitability and structural changes if payment and settlement functions — traditionally handled by banks — are expanded to the non-banking sector.” – Rhee Chang-yong , Governor of the Bank of Korea (BoK) The central bank argued that it should lead in regulating a local currency stablecoin. Additionally, establishing a committee to guide crypto policy will ensure the regulatory framework is comprehensive and practical. It will promote the use of digital assets while protecting consumers and ensuring the financial system’s stability. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Analysts note the price is nearing the pattern’s apex, suggesting a major rally is imminent. The technical structure suggests XRP is building momentum for a sustained upside move. After months of steady consolidation, XRP has reached a critical inflection point, according to multiple technical analysts. A massive descending wedge pattern on the daily chart has compressed the token’s price into an increasingly tight range, leading to a consensus view that a significant, high-volatility move is now imminent. While XRP has seen short-term declines, many market watchers agree that a breakout or breakdown is now imminent. The coin is currently trading at $2.16 , showing slight losses on the day and the week. However, the pattern’s structure and the timing of the current setup suggest a high-probability shift is near.

The analyst, pseudonymously known as Bluntz, tells his 320,800 followers on the social media platform X that memecoin SPX6900 ( SPX ) appears to have completed an ABC correction on the eight-hour chart, suggesting that the coin has printed a durable bottom. Bluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states that an asset is primed to ignite rallies after completing an ABC correction. “Perfect SPX pullback here after testing prior all-time high for the first time, the next test blasts through in my opinion, still one of the best charts [with a] less than $1billy (billion) market cap in my opinion.” Source: Bluntz/X Looking at his chart, the trader suggests SPX increase to $2.10. SPX is trading for $1.47 at time of writing, up 17.5% in the last 24 hours. The analyst is also bullish on the artificial intelligence (AI)-focused crypto project ai16z ( AI16Z ). According to Bluntz, the altcoin appears to be entering an uptrend after a retest of the Fibonacci retracement level at $0.16. Traders use the Fibonacci retracement tool to spot potential entry and exit points based on the Fibonacci ratio. “Long ai16z again here was one leg too early the other week, but looking like a strong reaction from the 0.78 fib here and still looks like a clear five up and subsequent abc correction.

Analyst Sets Price Target and Says Get Ready for the Decision,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-about-to-remove-the-tension-analyst-sets-price-target-and-says-get-ready-for-the-decision/,"XRP is nearing a critical inflection point, and according to prominent analyst Dark Defender, the market is about to make a decisive move. A new analysis published by the respected chartist points to a rare and powerful convergence of technical indicators that suggests XRP is primed for an imminent breakout. With the price now trading around $2.15, tension is building across key chart formations—and the next move could be explosive. Key Technical Alignment Signals Incoming Breakout At the heart of Dark Defender’s analysis is the convergence of multiple technical elements on the XRP chart. These include a major trendline, a key Fibonacci level, and the upper surface of a long-forming cup pattern. Each of these signals is significant on its own, but their combination creates what the analyst refers to as a “hot” setup—one that historically precedes sharp price action. Dark Defender notes that the price is now squeezed between the support at $2.0706 and the resistance levels aligned with the upper trendline. The presence of a fully formed cup—often part of the bullish cup-and-handle pattern—suggests that XRP has completed its accumulation phase and is now approaching a potential breakout point. #XRP is about to remove the Tension soon. The price is close to the conjunction of the trend lines, the Fibonacci level, and the Cup Surface. Exponential Moving Averages are tight, and the trend line is squeezed.

Supports: $2.0706 Cup is… pic.twitter.com/ErpRR5hSXs — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) June 18, 2025 Tight EMAs Add to the Pressure Another critical component of the setup is the behavior of XRP’s Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs). On several timeframes, these EMAs have compressed into an unusually tight range—a sign that volatility has declined and that a directional shift is looming. This “EMA squeeze” often indicates that the market is storing up energy. Once released, it typically results in a strong breakout move. According to Dark Defender, this is the final stage of coiling before the decision moment. The compressed structure leaves little room for extended sideways movement. Price Targets and Support Zones Dark Defender has set short-term price targets at $2.22 and $3.61. The initial target at $2.22 coincides with a minor resistance point and a Fibonacci extension level, while a breakout above this pattern could potentially drive the price to $3.61. Both levels are realistic in the near term, provided XRP can break cleanly above the current technical ceiling.

A breakdown below this level may lead to a short-term retest of lower zones, but there is no indication from Dark Defender that such a move is currently favored. The analyst’s tone remains strongly bullish, especially as long as the current price range holds. Market Poised for Decision Moment This isn’t just another prediction based on trend lines—it’s a culmination of several long-standing technical patterns aligning in near-perfect symmetry. As Dark Defender puts it, the setup is “hot,” and the decision moment is imminent. The market is reaching the apex of its tension, and history suggests that what comes next will be fast and decisive. With XRP already trading above $2.15 and hovering just below resistance, the next 24–72 hours may prove pivotal. Whether the asset surges toward $3.61 or pauses briefly to retest support, the broader setup suggests that the days of low volatility are coming to an end. Dark Defender’s message is clear: XRP is about to remove the tension. The chart is ready. Now it’s time to get ready for the decision.

Given that there is high speculation that a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) will get the green light, this development has also increased whale accumulation. According to Polymarket data , the chances of a spot XRP being rolled out before the close of 2025 has jumped to 90%. Therefore, growing optimism around an XRP ETF and potential U.S. regulatory clarity, such as Ripple's SEC lawsuit developments, are encouraging whale and corporate accumulation. For instance, Dubai’s financial watchdog recently permitted XRP’s operations within the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC). According to Santiment data, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is witnessing heightened growth due to the network’s low fees. Notably, XRPL has the potential of becoming the cornerstone of tokenized real-world assets (RWA). This is because XRPL is poised to offer users a cost-effective and efficient solution for buying, selling, storing, and transferring real-world assets without dependence on traditional fiat currencies. Therefore, these developments are enhancing XRP whale activity as the number of active addresses reached 1.12 million in the past week. Canada’s First-Ever XRP ETF Rolls Out Purpose Investments has set the ball rolling for Canada’s first spot XRP ETF after recently securing regulatory approval, offering investors direct exposure to the world’s fourth-largest cryptocurrency through traditional brokerage accounts. Vlad Tasevski, the chief innovation officer at Purpose Investments, acknowledged, “We’re proud to continue pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the space by offering investors simple, secure access to the infrastructure powering real-world blockchain adoption.” Why a Spot XRP ETF Is Being Waited With Bated Breath on American Soil The cryptocurrency community is eagerly anticipating the potential approval of a spot XRP ETF in the U.S., a development that could mark a major turning point for the digital asset and the broader crypto market. Unlike futures-based ETFs that derive value from contracts, a spot ETF directly tracks the price of XRP, offering investors a simpler, more transparent way to gain exposure to the asset without the complexities of managing private wallets or exchanges. One of the main reasons excitement is building is regulatory clarity. After Ripple’s partial legal victory against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2023, which ruled that XRP is not a security when traded on secondary markets, the path for institutional acceptance has become less murky. This pivotal legal precedent sets XRP apart from many other altcoins still entangled in regulatory uncertainty—making it a more attractive candidate for ETF consideration. The infrastructure and demand are also in place. XRP boasts one of the most active and scalable blockchains in the crypto ecosystem, with lightning-fast settlement times and low transaction fees. Institutional players have increasingly shown interest in XRP for cross-border payments, and the addition of a spot ETF could act as a catalyst for mainstream adoption. It would allow asset managers, retirement funds, and everyday investors to gain regulated exposure through traditional brokerage accounts—greatly expanding XRP’s market reach. Furthermore, recent precedent adds momentum. With the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 and growing interest in Ethereum ETFs, investors now see a clearer roadmap for XRP to follow suit. The launch of a spot XRP ETF could inject fresh capital into the ecosystem, increase price stability through higher liquidity, and reinforce investor confidence at a time when the crypto market is maturing. Lastly, the community’s sentiment is electric. XRP holders have long considered their token undervalued relative to its utility and global partnerships. A spot ETF would not only validate the asset’s legitimacy but also unlock a new era of growth and visibility for Ripple’s technology and ecosystem. Conclusion The wait for a spot XRP ETF in the U.S. reflects more than just market speculation, it signals a broader desire for legitimacy, accessibility, and institutional-grade crypto exposure with Canada already setting the ball rolling. With XRP’s whale count going through the roof, the roll out of an XRP ETF on American soil will ignite the altcoin’s fire when it comes to scaling heights.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-19 11:59:20

After months of delays and shifting deadlines, many users are wondering how this lawsuit will affect Ripple’s business. Rumors have been flying on social media that Ripple’s ongoing battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cost the company huge deals—some even claim JP Morgan shifted business to Coinbase, possibly costing Ripple “trillions” in revenue. But the story isn’t quite that simple. Unlike Ripple, Coinbase has not been hit with an injunction or an active lawsuit, so it’s free to continue operating without the same legal cloud hanging over it. Some XRP supporters have pointed fingers at Judge Analisa Torres, calling her repeated deadline extensions “disgusting” and demanding a corruption probe. However, former SEC lawyer James Farrell pushed back on these claims. He explained that if Ripple truly lost business because it was legally enjoined, the company could have—and perhaps should have—noted that loss in its court filings. In fact, Ripple’s own filings argue that it needs “even footing” with other market players, a situation they say only exists for firms not enjoined by the court. Farrell also reminded everyone that both the SEC’s appeal and Ripple’s cross-appeal are still active but put on hold. If the stay is lifted, Ripple’s next moves will be to respond to the SEC’s appeal and then make its own case on appeal. Until then, there’s no clear evidence that Ripple has bled “trillions” of dollars in business, even if side conversations online suggest otherwise. The real test will come when the court decides whether to lift the stay and resume full arguments on both sides.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-19 12:00:12

The partnership will add OKX wallet features to MetaMask, while ensuring MEV protection for traders. OKX, one of the leading trading platforms, and Consensys, the top provider of Ethereum-based services, will partner to expand the capabilities of wallet-based DEXs activity. OKX DEX will share its trading API, making it available through the MetaMask wallet. At the same time, Consensys will provide its MEV protection technology to the users of the OKX wallet. The SERVO solution by Consensys assures even retail traders will not be targeted by MEV bots for front-running transactions. “ We’re glad to be working together on advancing practical user protections at scale. MEV remains a complex challenge for users and developers, and OKX’s integration of Consensys SERVO reflects a strong commitment to user safety and protocol-aligned innovation,” said Consensys chief strategy officer Jason Linehan. The partnership arrives at a time when wallet-based DEXs activity is peaking, mostly based on the Binance ecosystem. Other exchanges, who do not have their own chain, aim to compete while aggregating DEX trades from multiple networks. Binance’s ecosystem not only dominates centralized trading , but also wallet-based swaps through decentralized pairs. OKX wallet and MetaMask are among the most active tools for decentralized swaps. | Source: Dune Analytics The OKX DEX wallet carries around $140M in daily decentralized trades, and is one of the major tools for token swaps. MetaMask swaps are more rare, with just around $7M in daily volumes. Nearly 75K daily traders use the OKX Web3 wallet. Currently, Binance Wallet remains the leading venue due to incentives and point farming, but OKX remains one of the most active hubs to mix centralized and decentralized trading. OKX also joined the trend of boosting DEX availability to its user base, as traders rarely want to wait for a listing. While the OKX DEX has relatively small volumes, the aggregated swaps have been growing in 2025, as more traders seek direct actions through an intuitive wallet. OKX and Consensys aim to improve Web3 infrastructure OKX has been one of the main competitors with its native Web3 wallet. The partnership will extend the abilities of MetaMask to aggregate swaps and access the best liquidity pairs. Currently, MetaMask in-wallet swaps are still relatively expensive when using the wallet’s native routing. OKX aggregates over 500 DEXs with response times under 100 ms, tapping all available sources of liquidity. For end users, the expanded access in the DEX will bring deeper liquidity and cross-chain capabilities. “ While MetaMask users will immediately benefit from faster and more cost-efficient trading, that’s just the beginning. I’m particularly excited about our work to further enhance and create new experiences across the Linea ecosystem. This is about two industry leaders joining forces to further optimize the Web3 experience and remove barriers for all users,” said OKX Ventures founder Jeff Ren. OKX will also be one of the first major exchanges to adopt the SERVO technology for MEV protection. MEV bots remain a challenge on multiple networks and Consensys aims to improve the general Web3 infrastructure. As the DEXs to CEXs ratio stand at 28.4% , OKX and Consensys will be among the first to secure a more intuitive and safe ecosystem. DEXs trading has taken over both spot demand and derivatives due to the permissionless access to exchanges and quick inflow of new trading pairs. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Injective Turns Bullish While Solana Slips,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-reaches-312m-presale-milestone-in-record-time-injective-turns-bullish-while-solana-slips/,"Injective (INJ) has drawn attention after its total value locked rose 22%, hitting $165 million, reflecting strong cash flow into the ecosystem. While enthusiasm builds around Injective (INJ), Solana (SOL) experienced a sharp 10% slide, nearing its key $130 support, sparking caution among traders. In contrast, BlockDAG’s current metrics are stealing the spotlight. Priced at $0.0018 until June 20, with a confirmed launch price of $0.05, it reflects a 2,678% possible growth. With a working testnet, integrations with 20 exchanges, and over $312 million in funding, BlockDAG (BDAG) Network’s path toward global retail traction is already well underway. Injective TVL Rises 22% While Price Holds Crucial Support Injective’s total value locked grew by 22% this week, now standing at $165 million. Developer and user confidence appear to be strengthening as activity rises across Injective’s DeFi protocols. INJ is maintaining a base near $27.50, and analysts are keeping a close eye on $28.20 as the next technical breakout. Indicators remain favorable, with RSI moving higher and buying activity showing consistent strength. The expanding ecosystem is supporting INJ’s upward trend, with fresh projects launching regularly. Those scanning for altcoins with a mix of growing use cases and stable pricing may find Injective an attractive option. Solana Sheds 10% in a Day: Bounce Soon or More Downside? Solana (SOL) dropped 10% within a day, retreating from $150 to around $135. The decline erased recent gains and broke through a short-term floor near $138. Market watchers are focusing on the $130 area as a critical level for support. Trading volume surged during this movement, with activity coming from both those cashing out and potential entries from bargain seekers. A sustained move below $130 could drag SOL down toward $120. Meanwhile, many are waiting for stability or a return to $140 before stepping in again. BlockDAG’s US-Based Deal and $0.0018 Price Bring Major Attention BlockDAG is shifting from pure crypto utility to mainstream culture appeal. Following its appearance during Inter Milan matches, it’s now poised for a significant US-based sponsorship that will amplify brand visibility across billboards and digital media before other projects even get market traction. At its current batch 29 price of $0.0276, BlockDAG remains on track for a $0.05 official launch. For a limited time until June 20, it’s also available at just $0.0018, offering an attractive entry point ahead of the next price increase. Over $312 million has been raised in crypto presale so far, signaling growing interest. Beyond branding, the project runs an EVM-compatible testnet handling up to 15,000 transactions per second, with wallets already integrated into 20 exchanges. Two million users are now actively mining on its mobile X1 miner app . These milestones reinforce the technical depth behind the growing hype. As the upcoming US campaign goes live, short-form content and online visibility are expected to rise. This momentum could push BlockDAG’s upcoming exchange listings even further, setting it apart from other projects. Summing Up! Injective (INJ) sentiment hinges on price surpassing $28.20 and continued TVL growth. Without those drivers, sentiment may fade. Solana (SOL) risks slipping further if $130 doesn’t hold, potentially falling to $120. Meanwhile, BlockDAG continues to gain momentum. With a limited-time price of just $0.0018 and a confirmed launch target of $0.05, it offers a remarkable 2,678% growth potential since its first batch, making it one of the most compelling early-stage opportunities in the market. With 20 exchanges, two million mobile miners, and a powerful backend already live, it combines momentum, reach, and reliability. While Injective and Solana navigate market swings, BlockDAG quietly advances.

The world’s biggest cryptocurrency eked out a 0.03% gain in the last 24 hours but still sits 3.5% lower than it did a week ago. According to analyst Captain Faibik, this mix of flat gains and fading strength could mean traders are buying Bitcoin at the top. Related Reading: Iran’s Top Crypto Hub Loses $82 Million To Hackers With Israeli Links—Details Bearish RSI Divergence Signals Weakness Based on data, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has drifted downward after peaking near 80, even as Bitcoin’s price pushed to fresh highs. The RSI now sits at 61.88, a clear sign that buyers are losing steam. Traders often watch for this kind of mismatch—when price goes up but RSI goes down—because it can spell a coming pullback. History shows it doesn’t always lead to a crash, but it does make a correction more likely. After carving out fresh highs, it feels like Bitcoin has hit its ceiling, according to Fabik, and a pullback into the $92,000–$94,000 zone could be on the cards. This setup usually sparks a quick correction, so many traders will be watching closely and tightening up their strategies as the market could shift in a hurry. $BTC is showing a massive RSI Bearish divergence on the weekly chart..!! It looks like Bitcoin has topped out and is now Ready for a major correction toward the 92–94k Range..📉 Just like it bottomed out at 16k in November 2022, We bought the dip and now we’re selling the… pic.twitter.com/W25HCAxkIa — Captain Faibik 🐺 (@CryptoFaibik) June 18, 2025 Resistance Levels Keep Price In Check Bitcoin has bumped into stiff barriers around $108,000 and $109,000, both set on May 19. An ascending trendline from December 2024 has also been capping gains for weeks. These levels are proving tough to clear. If Bitcoin can’t break through soon, sellers may step in. Faibik points out that hitting these walls and seeing RSI divergence at the same time often marks the high point before a drop. This Activity Points To Caution The derivatives market adds another layer to the story. Trading volume in Bitcoin futures and options rose by 1.60%, taking total activity to around $100 billion. Open interest, meanwhile, slid down 1.30% to nearly $70 billion. This suggests some players are closing their bets rather than piling on new ones. In the past 24 hours, liquidations have wiped out $71 million in long positions. That kind of pain can trigger more sell‑offs if people rush to protect their profits. Related Reading: Tether Enforces Freeze On $12 Million In Tron Funds Over Illicit Activity Past Patterns Offer Mixed Lessons Looking back, Bitcoin’s rebound in 2022 followed a different playbook. Back then, price hit a low near $16,000 and built strength even as RSI climbed from oversold levels. That setup led to a strong rally. Today, though, the RSI is nowhere near oversold territory. It’s more of a warning flag than a green light. Captain Faibik reminds traders that past wins don’t guarantee future results. Conditions now include higher interest rates and deeper institutional interest, which can change how Bitcoin reacts to the same signals.

But according to a crypto influencer, this is not a sign of failure; it is a hidden opportunity. ISO 20022 is a common messaging format for financial systems. It uses clear, structured language (based on XML) so that banks and payment providers around the world can easily understand and share information. This helps make transactions more accurate and efficient. ISO 20022 was launched in 2008. It is now replacing older systems like SWIFT, and its impact is reaching into crypto. Coins that follow this standard could be more easily adopted by banks and financial institutions. If major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum were to integrate ISO 20022, it could bring traditional finance and digital assets closer than ever before. Which Are the ISO 20022 Compliant Coins? The world prepares to go fully live with ISO 20022 by 2025. Several top crypto projects are already aligned with ISO 20022 or working closely with partners who are aligned with them. XRP (Ripple) leads with over 300 financial partners for fast global payments. XLM (Stellar) focuses on cross-border transactions and financial inclusion. XDC (XinFin) brings blockchain to trade finance, while Algorand (ALGO) offers a green, scalable solution, attracting institutional support. IOTA is building for the Internet of Things and machine-to-machine payments. And HBAR (Hedera), backed by major corporations, is designed for secure, regulated environments. QNT (Quant) also connects banks to blockchains through Overledger, with built-in ISO 20022 support. ADA (Cardano) is also moving toward ISO 20022 compatibility, focusing on identity, compliance, and finance-related use cases. Together, these projects are paving way for the next generation of global finance. Why This Dip Could Be a Golden Opportunity These coins are designed to support the next-generation financial system. The recent drop in their prices is not a sign of failure, but it’s more like a “temporary discount”. While the real infrastructure is still being developed behind the scenes, this dip is likely just a distraction. For long-term investors, it could be a smart buying opportunity rather than something to fear. ISO 20022 is set to bridge the gap between crypto and traditional finance by making transactions safer, faster, and more efficient. For compliant projects, ISO 20022 brings better system compatibility, lower fraud risk, and stronger connections with global payment networks. As more than 70 countries adopt the standard, ISO-aligned coins may gain wider use and greater trust, especially from institutions.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|XRP|XDC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-19 12:12:36

The opposition, which sought to topple the government a few months ahead of the parliamentary elections this fall, continues to push for more resignations. Fiala’s government gathers enough votes to stay in power The ruling center-right coalition in the Czech Republic rejected an attempt in parliament to bring down the cabinet of Petr Fiala, who has been trying hard to counter the political fallout from a controversial cryptocurrency donation. The scandal already led to the resignation of Justice Minister Pavel Blažek earlier in June, who took responsibility for his department’s decision to accept 1 billion koruna ($45 million) in Bitcoin from a convicted drug dealer. The no-confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Czech parliament, was initiated by the main opposition ANO party. The right-wingers were supported by the far-right SPD and the Pirates but fell short of the 101 votes needed. All parties forming the Fiala government – his conservative ODS, the centrist STAN, the Christian Democrats (KDU-ČSL), and the liberal-conservative TOP 09, largely backed the cabinet, with only a few absences and abstentions, Euractiv noted in a report. Of the 192 members of parliament present during the session on Wednesday, 94 opposition deputies backed the motion while 98 representatives of the ruling majority opposed it, the national radio broadcaster Český Rozhlas broke down the numbers . “We have just had another vote of no-confidence in the government. It went as expected and the government survived the vote,” Petr Fiala commented on X. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala updates that his administration survived a no-confidence vote over a $45 million BTC donation. Source: Petr Fiala Prime Minister’s party damaged by crypto donation scandal Pavel Blažek stepped down in May after reports emerged that the Ministry of Justice took a donation of 480 BTC from Tomáš Jiřikovský, the operator of a darknet market who had been convicted of drug trafficking, embezzlement, and illegal arms possession. Jiřikovský had served four years in prison. Both Blažek and the Czech prime minister admitted that accepting the Bitcoin without proper verification of its source was a “mistake” and “ethically problematic.” Blazek apologized for his role in the case but rejected accusations of corruption. The scandal has impacted Fiala’s Civic Democrats while the other parties in the coalition have been distancing themselves from the affair, which, according to the opposition, undermined public trust in state institutions and stained the country’s reputation abroad. Coalition partner Mayors and Independents (STAN), who criticized the way Petr Fiala handled the matter, eventually backed his administration, after warning about political instability if the government falls before the upcoming elections in October. Earlier, they had demanded that the new Justice Minister Eva Decroix, from Fiala’s ODS party, provide a detailed description of how the cryptocurrency was transferred to the ministry and identify all responsible persons. She promised an independent audit as part of a full investigation. Opposition ANO party insists on finance minister’s resignation The right-wing populist ANO party, led by former Czech Prime Minister and businessman Andrej Babiš, has made it clear it will continue to push for the resignation of Finance Minister Zbyněk Stanjura, despite the government surviving the vote of no-confidence. ANO claims that Stanjura is a key figure in the Bitcoin scandal, as he should have notified the Czech Republic’s Financial Analytical Office and called for a meeting of the National Security Council as soon as he learned about the suspicious crypto donation. Zbyněk Stanjura has already refused to quit his seat. About two weeks ago, he insisted he had not violated the law, maintaining that the Ministry of Justice was solely responsible for the embarrassing affair. While stressing his department was not involved in the decision to accept the cryptocurrency, the finance minister admitted he had been aware of Blažek’s intentions to accept the digital coin donation and even tried to talk him out of it.

However, despite the positive economic data, the FED has kept interest rates constant since January due to the uncertainty created by the tariffs. While the Fed is determined to keep interest rates steady until it provides more clarity, US President Donald Trump frequently pressures the Fed and Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. Trump even wants Powell to resign from his position as FED chairman. At this point, Trump called on the FED to cut interest rates even before the June FED decision announced yesterday. However, the FED again ignored Trump and left interest rates unchanged. Trump, who was very angry about this situation, posted on his Truth Scoial account, harshly criticizing Powell for yesterday's decision and calling for her resignation. Donald Trump criticized Jerome Powell on Truth Social, saying: “Too Late. Powell is the worst. And a true idiot who is costing the US billions of dollars.” He also shared an article calling for Powell to resign from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the nation's largest mortgage lenders. Trump argues that interest rates should be cut now that economic data is good, and has repeatedly called on Powell to cut rates. Related News: BREAKING! Surprise New Move from Donald Trump!

If so, you might have noticed something different: the cost was likely very low. Indeed, Bitcoin transaction fees have recently dropped to levels not seen since 2022. This significant decline has caught the attention of market observers and, more importantly, has a direct impact on the economics of the Bitcoin network, particularly for those who secure it. Understanding Bitcoin Transaction Fees and Miner Revenue Before diving into the specifics of the current low fee environment, it’s crucial to understand how BTC fees work and their role in the Bitcoin ecosystem. When you send Bitcoin, you include a small fee with the transaction. This fee is paid to the Bitcoin miners who include your transaction in a block they successfully add to the blockchain. Miners prioritize transactions based on the fee offered – higher fees usually mean faster confirmation times, especially when the network is busy. Miner revenue comes from two primary sources: Block Subsidy: This is the reward of newly minted Bitcoin included in each block. This subsidy halves approximately every four years (the halving event). Transaction Fees: The sum of all fees from transactions included in a block. Historically, the block subsidy has been the dominant source of income for miners. However, with each halving event reducing the subsidy, transaction fees are expected to play an increasingly important role in incentivizing miners to secure the network in the long term. Why Are Bitcoin Transaction Fees So Low Right Now? According to data cited by Decrypt from Luxor’s Hashrate Index, Bitcoin transaction fees have fallen to their lowest point since 2022. The data indicates that fees have accounted for less than 1% of the total block reward so far this June. This is a stark contrast to periods of high network congestion or intense activity. Several factors contribute to this decline: Reduced Network Congestion: The primary driver of high fees is demand for limited block space. When many people are trying to send transactions simultaneously, they bid up fees to get their transactions included in the next block. Currently, demand for block space is relatively low compared to peak periods. Decreased Activity from Fee-Intensive Use Cases: Periods like the surge in Ordinals or BRC-20 token minting significantly increased network activity and competition for block space, driving fees sky-high. The current pace of such activity is more subdued. Improved Network Efficiency: Ongoing adoption of solutions like SegWit and the Lightning Network, while still growing, can help reduce the average transaction size or move transactions off the main chain, easing congestion pressure over time. The current situation reflects a period of lower intensity on the network compared to the speculative frenzy seen during certain past cycles. The Impact on Bitcoin Miner Revenue This drop in BTC fees has a direct and significant impact on Bitcoin miner revenue . While the block subsidy remains the largest component of their earnings, the contribution from fees can provide a crucial boost to profitability, especially for less efficient operations or during times of high operational costs (like electricity). Consider the revenue structure: Total Miner Revenue = Block Subsidy + Total Transaction Fees in Block When transaction fees represent less than 1% of the total block reward, it means miners are relying almost entirely on the block subsidy (currently 3.125 BTC per block after the latest halving). This makes their profitability highly sensitive to the price of Bitcoin and their operational expenses. For miners, this presents a challenge: Lower Profit Margins: With fees contributing minimally, the margin between the cost of mining (electricity, hardware, cooling, facility) and the revenue earned shrinks. Increased Pressure on Efficiency: Less profitable periods force miners to upgrade to more efficient hardware (ASICs) and seek out the lowest possible electricity costs to remain competitive. Potential for Consolidation: Smaller or less efficient mining operations may struggle to stay afloat, potentially leading to consolidation within the industry. This isn’t the first time fees have been low, and it highlights the dynamic nature of Bitcoin mining economics. Miners are accustomed to fluctuating revenue streams, but extended periods of low fees add considerable pressure. Comparing Current Crypto Transaction Costs From a user perspective, the low crypto transaction costs on the Bitcoin network are a positive development. Sending BTC is currently cheaper and faster than it might be during peak congestion times. This makes smaller transactions more viable and improves the overall user experience for transferring value on the base layer. How do current Bitcoin fees compare to other cryptocurrencies? While direct comparisons can be complex due to different network designs and fee mechanisms, Bitcoin’s base layer fees can still become very high during peak demand. However, in the current low-congestion environment, Bitcoin transaction costs are competitive, often cheaper than sending assets on some other popular blockchains that might be experiencing higher activity or have different fee structures. It’s a reminder that the “cost” of using a blockchain isn’t static; it’s a market price determined by supply (block space) and demand (transactions waiting to be confirmed). Challenges and Actionable Insights The primary challenge highlighted by low Bitcoin transaction fees is the pressure on miner profitability. As the block subsidy continues to decrease over future halvings, the network’s security will rely more heavily on fees to incentivize mining. A prolonged period of extremely low fees in the distant future could theoretically raise questions about long-term security funding, although the network has mechanisms and market dynamics to address this over time (e.g., increased transaction volume, new fee-generating use cases, or simply a higher Bitcoin price making the reduced subsidy still valuable). For those involved: For Users: Enjoy the lower fees! It’s a good time to consolidate UTXOs or make transactions you might have deferred due to high costs. For Miners: Focus on operational efficiency, secure low-cost power sources, and explore hedging strategies. Diversification into hosting services or proprietary trading operations can also help stabilize Bitcoin miner revenue . The market is cyclical, and fee revenue is one of the more volatile components of the mining business. What Could Change the Fee Landscape? Several factors could lead to an increase in BTC fees : Increased Bitcoin Price: A significant rally could attract more users and transaction volume. Resurgence of Fee-Intensive Activity: A new wave of interest in Ordinals, BRC-20s, or other similar protocols could quickly congest the network again. General Market Bull Run: Increased speculative activity across the crypto market often leads to more on-chain movements on all major networks, including Bitcoin. Major Network Events: While the halving primarily impacts the subsidy, it often correlates with increased attention and potential transaction volume. Predicting transaction fees is difficult, as they are a function of organic demand and speculative use cases. However, the current low levels are likely a reflection of the broader market sentiment and reduced speculative fervor compared to previous peaks. Conclusion: A Mixed Bag for the Network The drop in Bitcoin transaction fees to their lowest point since 2022 is a notable development. On one hand, it’s a positive for users, leading to lower crypto transaction costs and making the base layer more accessible for smaller transfers. On the other hand, it presents a challenge for Bitcoin mining operations, significantly reducing their fee-based income and putting pressure on Bitcoin miner revenue . This situation underscores the dynamic and market-driven nature of the Bitcoin network. While low fees benefit users in the short term, the long-term health and security of the network rely on miners remaining profitable enough to continue dedicating computational power. The balance between block subsidy and fees is constantly evolving, and the current low fee environment is a temporary snapshot in Bitcoin’s journey.

The post featured a stitched surgical wound, a picture of his purchased NFT avatar, and a short message expressing pride in joining the exclusive digital art community. The Peak of NFT Mania At the time, BAYC NFTs were among the most sought-after digital assets in the NFT space, frequently selling for six figures. Celebrities, influencers, and crypto investors rushed into the trend, with BC.GAME, the popular igaming platform, invested 700 ETH in NFTs . This influx of investors boosted valuations and drove demand, with artists making millions from NFT sales . Vidu’s decision, while extreme, was reflective of the market’s sentiment and the cultural status the BAYC brand held at its peak. From 150 ETH to Under 25 ETH Crypto Beast (@cryptobeastreal), a popular crypto enthusiast on X, shared the details of Vidu’s transaction, revealing that his massive investment had not paid off. From a high point that once touched over 150 ETH in value, BAYC NFTs have plummeted to below 25 ETH as of now. This marks a decline of approximately 98% for those who bought near the top of the hype cycle and serves as a stark example of the risks associated with NFTs and speculative crypto investments. 3 years ago, someone sold his kidney to purchase a picture of a monkey.

Unlike traditional assets, NFTs lack intrinsic value and are heavily dependent on community perception and speculative momentum. As interest in NFTs cooled and broader crypto markets experienced downturns, even high-profile collections like BAYC saw sharp declines. Notable figures such as Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s creator, criticized NFTs at the time, calling them another form of gambling . Cautionary Lessons From a Bygone Era This situation is not just about one person or a single NFT. Some individuals, especially during bull runs, were willing to go to extraordinary lengths in pursuit of digital ownership and perceived prestige. However, with markets correcting, the reality for many has been losses that are far more than money. Now, experts are pushing for assets with utility, such as XRP, which are reshaping the financial landscape and offer real-world value. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is also advancing the NFT ecosystem , adding features that could make them more than just speculative assets. The era of NFTs as status symbols may be near its end, but assets with real value will take the crypto market to new heights.

However, according to market intelligence platform Santiment, this very gloom could set the stage for an unexpected rally, echoing a familiar pattern where deep fear turns into the fuel for Bitcoin’s next push up the price ladder. Sentiment Mirrors April Lows Fresh data from Santiment shows that for the first time in over two months, bearish comments on social media slightly outnumber bullish ones, with a ratio of 1.03 negative takes for every positive one. “This is typically a bullish sign,” stated the on-chain analytics firm. The last time such a scenario played out, fears over new punitive tariffs imposed by the Donald Trump administration on numerous U.S. trade partners dragged BTC below $75,000. But while sentiment flipped sharply negative, the king cryptocurrency quickly rebounded once anxiety peaked. Pointing to that April low as a textbook example of contrarian signals, Santiment declared , “markets historically move in the opposite direction of retail’s expectations.” This latest mood dip comes at a time when macro tensions are unsettling traders. Market watcher Axel Adler Jr. reported that European equity markets had opened lower amid mounting geopolitical risks, including possible U.S. military action against Iran. Furthermore, while the Federal Reserve decided to hold interest rates steady between 4.25% and 4.5%, as had been largely expected, the news was delivered alongside a cautious outlook. The Fed upgraded its inflation forecast to 3%, cut its 2025 GDP projection to 1.4%, and is facing ongoing public criticism from President Trump, adding layers of uncertainty. Price Holding Steady Bitcoin’s price, hovering around $104,800 at this writing, reflects this stagnation, showing minimal reaction to the Fed remarks. The asset lost just 0.3% of its value in the last 24 hours, with the only sign of wear coming from a 2.8% drop over the past seven days, slightly worse than the broader crypto market’s 2% loss in that period. Adler expressed more pessimism, pointing out that Bitcoin, which is currently considered a risk asset, could face accelerated selling pressure if Middle East tensions worsen and trigger a flight to safer havens. Technical voices such as Ed_NL also warned that the asset could still revisit key lower levels, with a possible double correction pattern echoing the chop from the summer of 2024. Looking at the bigger picture, however, fundamentals remain supportive. On June 18, Fidelity reported that the ancient, long-unmoved Bitcoin supply continues to grow faster than new issuance, highlighting strong holder conviction despite near-term jitters. Meanwhile, institutional appetite is also showing few signs of cooling, with spot Bitcoin ETFs recording over $1.4 billion in fresh inflows over the past week.

PYUSD stablecoin is a major catalyst, offering regulatory advantages, APY yield, and potential to boost net income by $4 billion if PayPal captures 20% market share. Valuation is attractive: PayPal trades below historical averages despite superior cash flow growth, offering investors significant upside if multiples expand. Risks from competitors and stablecoin adoption exist, but regulatory positioning and network effects make PayPal a strong buy with asymmetric upside over 12-24 months. Co-Authored by Noah Cox and Brock Heilig Investment Thesis Shares of PayPal ( PYPL ) have had a rough first half of 2025. Year-to-date, shares of the financial technology company are down nearly 17%. With the rise of stablecoins the reasons for PayPal’s underperformance has been due to fears that Apple Pay and Shopify are encroaching on PayPal’s checkout share along with stablecoins encroaching on their payment processing fees. With this, however, I really believe that these concerns are overstated. PayPal has entrenched merchant relationships and high-conversion funnels. I want to focus on management’s “ win checkout ” push for 2025 - particularly the Fastlane one-click guest checkout launched in early 2024, which I wrote about extensively during my last piece of coverage on PayPal. I view this as a direct effort to streamline purchases and defend PayPal’s core franchise. I believe that PayPal’s vast network of over 400 million accounts between both consumers and merchants creates durable scale advantages that are hard for new entrants like Apple Pay and Shopify to replicate. In my opinion, there is promising optionality in PayPal’s growth stories - most notably crypto - highlighted by the 2023 rollout of the PYUSD stablecoin, which could help lower transaction costs and open new rails for payments. With legislation moving through Washington DC that promises regulations for Stablecoins, this could be a huge catalyst. Paypal should benefit. With this, I continue to believe shares are a strong buy. Why I’m Doing Follow Up Coverage Since I published my last coverage on PayPal, shares of the company dipped by as much as 21%, but they have since rebounded, and they’re down just about 2% since late February when I last published coverage on PayPal. I think most of this recent selloff has been driven by Apple Pay and Shopify fears, echoing mid-2022 worries that ultimately proved unfounded when Apple integrated PayPal as a checkout option. I’ve seen anecdotal bear arguments gain some traction, but I think these are isolated and are definitely not reflective of PayPal’s broad merchant base. Something that keeps me bullish on PayPal heading into the rest of the year is CEO Alex Chriss relentless focus on winning back market share as his top priority. Fastlane is a big part of this story. With this, early metrics continue to reassure me. As noted on the Q4 call : 75% of Fastlane consumers are new or dormant PayPal users. This means that Fastlane not only improves conversion for our merchants, but also introduces more shoppers to PayPal and enables us to reengage in active users. With the growth of their stablecoin + stronger regulatory backing in DC for stablecoin, I think this makes now a perfect time to revisit PayPal. I believe the recent pullback is just short-term noise. I think the bull case is accelerating. Stablecoin Deep Dive To understand why Stablecoins are a big deal for PayPal, I want to focus on PayPal USD and why this is such a big development for PayPal. PayPal USD (or PYUSD) was launched in August 2023 as the first US-backed stablecoin from a major fintech company. The stablecoin was issued via Paxos Trust , is fully collateralized by dollar deposits and U.S. treasuries, and is pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. With growing adoption (and a more favorable environment in DC) we’ve seen a trend begin to develop where stablecoins are being brought into mainstream payments. PYUSD is being integrated across both PayPal and Venmo for P2P transfers, Xoom remittances, and third-party wallet payments. The goal here is to leverage blockchain rails to undercut card network fees and settlement times. I think PayPal’s 400 million+ user base and merchant integrations give PYUSD a huge distribution edge in both commerce use cases and remittances - both of which are situations where crypto-native stablecoins have struggled to gain traction. To add to this, in April 2025, PayPal partnered with Coinbase to waive fees on PYUSD buys and sells and enable one-click conversion to USD. In the future, I expect the roadmap to enable merchants to settle directly in PYUSD. This could be huge and help eliminate fees with cross-border transactions. PayPal plans to roll out a 3.7% APY yield on PYUSD balances in PayPal and Venmo wallets starting in the summer. What this means is that it will make holding PYUSD materially more attractive than cash or rival stablecoins. I view PYUSD as a catalyst for seriously accelerating the amount of cash PayPal holds on its balance sheet that it can generate interest on. In a way, PayPal becomes closer to a bank, which could have huge implications on net income margins. The potential for this market could be huge, with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent estimating that the TAM of stablecoins could exceed $2 Trillion in just a few years. If Paypal grabbed 20% market share with its stablecoin ($400 billion) and then make a 1% net income margin spread on it ($4 billion) this could go a long way to increase their bottom line. Valuation Currently, PayPal has a forward Non-GAAP price-to-earnings ratio of 13.88 . This is a 33.85% premium to fintech/financial peers, with the sector median currently sitting at 10.37. However, this 13.88 P/E ratio by PayPal is more than 51% below the company’s five-year average of 28.66. Seeking Alpha Quant gives PayPal a grade of a D+ on this metric. PayPal’s forward price-to-book ratio of 3.22 is almost 196% higher than the sector median of 1.09. Meanwhile, similar to their forward price-to-earnings ratio, this mark is about 50% below the five-year average for PayPal. The company earns a grade of a D- on this metric. In my opinion, these two metrics reflect PayPal’s profitability. The market still values the company at a higher multiple than a traditional bank (more tech savvy) but not as high as other fintech leaders. Interestingly, PayPal’s forward projected operating cash flow growth rate of 20.12% is more than double the sector median of 10.04%. This is given a grade of an B+ by Seeking Alpha Quant. In essence, the company trades at a 33.85% premium to the sector median on a forward P/E ratio yet has forward cashflow growth that is projected to be more than double the sector median over the next 12 months (4 quarters). In essence, I think the company’s forward P/E ratio should be at least a 60% premium to the sector median given this well above sector median growth. If we saw their P/E premium expand to a 60% premium, this would represent 77.25% upside from here. We get this upside by taking the projected premium (60% premium) and dividing it by the current premium (33.85%). Frankly, I think even this 60% premium may turn out to be conservative. If we price in an additional $4 billion in net income from a 20% market share in the stablecoin market, I think this will make their cash flow growth even stronger than expected. Risks PayPal (despite their share price performance) should be a winner from the stablecoin revolution. That doesn’t mean they are risk free. The biggest risk from the stablecoin revolution, in my opinion, is the intense fintech competition. I see Stripe’s global stablecoin push (their Bridge acquisition) and Apple/Shopify checkout integrations as credible threats to PayPal’s market share and fee-take rates. Another risk I see is how ingrained some of the early movers are. It’s clear to me that USDC and USDT have cemented themselves as leaders. Switching would require clear benefits (their account yield of 3.7% APY may accomplish this). The other benefit is that PayPal is going down the regulatory-sanctioned route for stablecoins. This means that as USDC and USDT (run by Tether) are subject to more audits, we should see the benefits of building a stablecoin with regulations in mind as a key strategic edge. There have been industry rumors that some stablecoins like Tether are not 1:1 backed by liquid assets. What we are about to find (thanks to the stablecoin act called the GENIUS Act) is that stablecoins are about to become a market where participants (stablecoin issuers) ask for regulatory permission. Not regulatory forgiveness. Most of finance works this way. As stablecoins move this way as well, PayPal should benefit. Bottom Line While shares have slumped year to date I remain confident in PayPal. I think they’ve established themselves as a trusted brand with high-conversion checkout funnels and two-sided network effects. I think these things underpin what I think is its durable digital-payments leadership and path to serious growth in the stablecoin space. I view PYUSD as a long-term growth engine. If mainstream stablecoin usage takes off within PayPal’s ecosystem, it could meaningfully lower processing costs and deepen engagement. I think most of the bearish concerns are coming from Apple/Shopify/Braintree headwinds, but I think all of these are manageable and are largely priced in. This sets a low bar for positive surprises in 2025-26. I think Stable coins are the biggest part of the bull thesis. Stablecoins have the opportunity to be a $4 billion lift to net income alone just on effective net interest income margins. I think the valuation is supported by really durable cash flow, which makes for a scenario where investors effectively get optional upside from new initiatives “for free” on top of the stable core business. If management can successfully execute on checkout innovation and stablecoin adoption, I still consider PayPal to be a strong-buy with asymmetric upside over the next 12-24 months. The market appears to be irrational. This should be a gift to investors who are patient.",PYPL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|USDT|PYUSD,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-19 13:32:49

This New Crypto Is Dubbed the ‘Ultimate ETH Killer’: Best crypto to look at,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/can-ethereums-etf-inflows-keep-up-this-new-crypto-is-dubbed-the-ultimate-eth-killer-best-crypto-to-look-at,"Ethereum continues to attract significant institutional interest, with recent ETF inflows signaling confidence despite price challenges. However, a new contender is emerging in the crypto space, promising to address Ethereum’s scalability and cost issues while offering investors a fresh opportunity. Ethereum ETF Inflows: Strong but Price Stagnates The spot ETFs of Ethereum have registered remarkable inflows, with $11.1 million being added yesterday alone and BlackRock alone buying 36.7 million dollars worth of ETH. This inflow of institutional capital has made the cumulative Ethereum ETF inflows surpass the $3 billion mark this year, which is an indication of increased confidence in the Ethereum ecosystem. However, in spite of these inflows, the price of Ethereum is still low, and it is now priced at 2,522.01, which is a 1.12% decrease in the last 30 days. This disconnect has brought renewed attention to the question of Ethereum scalability and gas fees, which have remained a drag on Ethereum price performance despite increasing institutional interest. Kaanch: The ‘Ultimate ETH Killer’ on the Rise With the current troubles of Ethereum, analysts have highlighted Kaanch as a possible game-changer as it is referred to as the Ultimate ETH Killer. Kaanch is a Layer 1 blockchain that aims to solve the limitations of Ethereum by providing an unrivaled speed of 1.4 million transactions per second and a gas fee that is virtually zero, which allows instant trades and smart contract execution. Kaanch is a scalable, cost-effective option to decentralized applications and payments with 3,600 decentralized nodes and the ability to tokenize real-world assets. The project is community-based and has open governance and is audited by SpyWolf and VerifyLab, which makes it transparent and secure. Kaanch Presale Gains Momentum Kaanch is already in Stage 6 of its presale, where it sells tokens at a price of $0.32, and the next stage increases the price by 2 times to 0.64. The presale has already collected more than 2.3 million, and it is driven by the fact that there are only 58 million tokens to be sold, and live staking is available with up to 30% APY. Entry is accessible by investors who can buy tokens with ETH or USDT. The next listing on Bitmart will be at a price of 30 dollars per token, which indicates a massive upside potential. With the presale moving at a fast rate and the good fundamentals of the project, investors who are interested in Kaanch are advised to visit the official presale site and invest before the prices increase. Ethereum’s ETF Inflows vs. Kaanch’s Growth Potential Although Ethereum has been experiencing large ETF inflows and institutional support, its stagnant price reflects the necessity of innovation in the areas of scalability and cost-efficiency. Technological superiority and real-life asset tokenization of Kaanch provide an interesting alternative, and its projections indicate a possible growth of up to 35,700 percent, which makes it one of the best cryptos to invest in now. This comparison creates an interesting tension between the established Ethereum inflows and the disruptive power of the Kaanch presale momentum. Why Investors Should Act Now As the price of Ethereum is feeling the pressure even with the high ETF inflows, and the presale of Kaanch is gaining momentum, the time to invest early in this new promising crypto is running out. The speed, low fees, strong decentralization, and future listing on BitMart at a price of 30 dollars per token makes Kaanch a rare opportunity. Kaanch is an alternative with a high potential to investors who want exposure to something beyond the current plateau of Ethereum. Interested persons can visit the Kaanch presale site to purchase tokens in this quickly trending presale.

The GENIUS Act will drive U.S. economic competitiveness for decades.” — Jeremy Allaire, Circle CEO The 68-30 vote marks a seismic shift for crypto regulation, validating Wall Street’s bet that clear rules could unlock a $2 trillion stablecoin market within a decade. What’s Inside the GENIUS Act? The bill's strongest provisions are already starting to change the industry. Stablecoins must now be 1:1 collateralized with cash or short-term Treasuries, so that every token can be fully redeemed and the risk of undercollateralized runs is eliminated. Issuers like Circle will need to disclose monthly public audits of their reserves, giving investors unprecedented disclosure. For the first time, issuers of stablecoins will be directly subject to the jurisdiction of the Treasury and OCC to license and supervise, alongside banks. And in a move welcomed by tech developers, the bill mandates interoperability standards, bringing stablecoins out of their insular blockchain environments to exchange freely between them. Trading Frenzy The market reacted quickly and dramatically. Circle's volume spiked to 4.5 million shares—three times its 30-day average—as the stock rose to a high of $200.90, up a jaw-dropping 500% from its June 5 IPO price. Coinbase added $4.5 billion in market cap in the meantime, as options traders bought up bets that the stock would reach $350 by July. The ripple effect was cross-industry: Robinhood jumped 4.5%, and PayPal and Block declined, as investors rebalanced their bets on whose payment rails will dominate in a stablecoin world. ”Stablecoin Summer” Analysts disagree on whether this ”stablecoin summer” will spill over into spot token prices. Some, like Bernstein, assume stablecoin growth brings fresh liquidity into the crypto system, traditionally a harbinger of Bitcoin upswings. On-chain observations already show USDC supply jumping 22% as stocks fell last week, pointing to traders rotating capital into regulated stablecoins. Others caution that Tether (USDT) is still the ruler with a 70% market share, and the GENIUS Act does not talk about other macro headwinds like Fed policy. An essential metric to follow is USDC payment adoption. Coinbase's fresh Shopify integration now makes it possible for merchants to settle stablecoin payments, a change that can shake up Visa and Mastercard's dominance of e-commerce. What's Next The bill's ride is not over yet. It now heads to the House, where the competitor STABLE Act—with tighter state-level regulation—may muddy the path to final passage. Political dawdling is to be expected, as House Republicans demand combining GENIUS with broader crypto market structure reforms. Another area of disagreement: both bills ban interest-bearing retail stablecoins, adding to a substantial source of income for issuers and potentially limiting consumer demand. The Bottom Line Senate approval of the GENIUS Act is more than a regulatory milestone—it's a force transforming crypto's role in the mainstream financial universe. For investors, the stablecoin rally could hinge on House negotiations and real-world adoption. One thing's for sure: Wall Street is betting big on the promise of ”stablecoin summer.”",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-19 13:33:41

The company has fully integrated XRPL into its operations, using it to pay salaries, manage its treasury with XRP and RLUSD, and strategically hold XRP as a reserve and store of value to secure its long-term financial stability. This bold strategy underscores Anodos Labs’ vision for XRPL as the foundation of a practical, safe, and inclusive global economy. Since its launch in 2012, XRPL has been a trailblazer in decentralized finance, introducing the first decentralized exchange (DEX) in history and pioneering advanced tokenization and payment features. Unlike many blockchains that rely on smart contracts, which can expose users to risks like exploits or wallet drains, XRPL’s native Layer 1 features are battle-tested and designed for security. This inherent safety makes XRPL an ideal platform for mass adoption, offering a developer-friendly environment that Anodos Labs is leveraging to redefine how people interact with money and financial assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Anodos has already made significant strides in the XRPL ecosystem with ANODEX, one of the leading platforms for the XRPL’s decentralized exchange (DEX) and automated market maker (AMM). ANODEX provides users with a seamless and secure way to trade assets on XRPL and has become a cornerstone for traders and liquidity providers within the XRPL community, further establishing Anodos as a key player in on-chain finance. As they revealed at XRPL Apex, Anodos Labs is now developing the first financial super app powered by XRPL, designed to bring on-chain finance to everyday users and businesses. This ambitious project aims to simplify complex blockchain interactions, offering a single platform for payments, remittances, trading, and DeFi yield opportunities. By hiding the technical complexities of blockchain, the super app will deliver a seamless experience that rivals traditional financial apps, making it accessible to a global audience, not just crypto natives. With XRPL’s low-cost, high-speed transactions, Anodos is poised to create a practical solution that fits into daily life, empowering users to manage, earn, grow, and spend their money effortlessly.

However, seasoned market participants know that the real game-changers are often low-cap, high-utility tokens trading under $1—the ones with massive potential to 10x before the giants even move 2x. This article highlights two under-a-dollar projects poised to outpace Ethereum in the coming market frenzy: Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) and Hedera (HBAR). Both projects are radically different, but each taps into a key narrative of the evolving Web3 space—memes with utility and enterprise-grade decentralization. $LILPEPE – Where Meme Culture Meets Layer 2 Innovation Listing Price: $0.003 Little Pepe isn’t just another meme coin—it’s the first dedicated Layer 2 blockchain for meme coins, and its native token, Little Pepe, is redefining meme-based investing. The project combines Ethereum scalability, lightning-fast finality, ultra-low fees, and meme virality into a cohesive, meme-powered ecosystem. Unlike typical meme coins that rely purely on community hype, Little Pepe delivers infrastructure-level innovation with a Layer 2 EVM-compatible chain optimized for speed, fun, and fairness. This is the only chain where sniper bots won’t work, making it the safest place to launch meme tokens without whales gaming the system. Tokenomics Snapshot Category Allocation Liquidity 10% – Ensures smooth trading Presale 26.5% – For early backers Chain Reserves 30% – Supports chain growth DEX Allocation 10% – Decentralized listings Marketing 10% – Memes, influencers, blitzes Staking & Rewards 13.5% – Incentivizes holders Buy/Sell Tax 0% – Pure DeFi, no friction With zero tax, high scalability, and a dedicated meme Launchpad, Little Pepe is more than just a token—it’s an incubator for meme-based innovation. Roadmap: From Meme to Movement The project’s roadmap is humor-laced but strategically sharp: Pregnancy Phase: Presale launches, partnerships roll in, and a $770,000 giveaway kicks off the hype. To partake in the presale and have a share of the giveaway, join at https://littlepepe.com/ Birth Phase: Listings on top CEXs and Uniswap, marketing blitz, and push toward a $1 billion market cap. Growth Phase: Full Layer 2 deployment, decentralized Launchpad, and entry into CMC Top 100. With anonymous experts—veterans who’ve helped build top meme tokens—backing the project and confirmed listings on two top centralized exchanges at launch, Little Pepe is being groomed for meme royalty status. Hedera (HBAR) – The Enterprise-Grade Sleeper Ready to Wake Current Price: $0.08 While Little Pepe caters to the decentralized memeverse, Hedera (HBAR) is the opposite side of the Web3 spectrum—fast, formal, and enterprise-focused. Built on Hashgraph, a consensus algorithm that differs from traditional blockchains, Hedera is one of the most scalable and secure networks in existence today. Major corporations, including Google, IBM, and Boeing, are part of Hedera's Governing Council, giving the project a level of real-world backing that few decentralized platforms can claim. Why HBAR Could 10x Feature Impact Hashgraph Technology Speeds up consensus without sacrificing security Low Transaction Fees Micro-transactions make it ideal for enterprise use Eco-Friendly Extremely low energy usage per transaction Corporate Council Global brands backing the protocol's development Use Cases Supply chains, identity, gaming, tokenized assets HBAR has been building quietly but steadily. Hedera's fundamentals make it a natural fit as governments and businesses look for regulated, efficient, and eco-friendly platforms. The market has long undervalued HBAR’s real-world applications, but that’s likely to change. Its use in areas such as carbon offsetting, decentralized identity, and real-time payments will gain attention as enterprise blockchain use matures during the bull cycle. Why These 2 Tokens Will Outpace Ethereum Ethereum remains the king of smart contracts, but its growth pace has slowed due to high gas fees, network congestion, and complex scaling solutions. Before it breaks its 2021 ATH, these nimble, focused projects are perfectly positioned to front-run gains: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) could easily increase its value by 10x just from virality and innovation in the meme sector. With CEX listings, sniper-proof token launches, and a dedicated chain, it taps into the community-first nature of crypto that made Dogecoin and Shiba Inu famous—but with real infrastructure this time. Though not as flashy, Hedera (HBAR) offers an unmatched level of enterprise-grade technology and trust. As big players start using Web3 rails, HBAR will likely be their chain of choice. Together, they offer a balanced portfolio for any investor looking to ride the bull wave with both fun and fundamentals. Final Thoughts: Position Early, Reap Massive The smart money isn't waiting for Ethereum to break its ATH. It's moving now—into micro-cap projects with vision and mid-caps with undeniable utility. With $LILPEPE positioned as the king of meme chains and Hedera set to dominate the enterprise blockchain narrative, these two tokens, currently under $1, aren’t just speculative plays—they’re strategic bets for explosive growth. Don’t sleep on the meme coin that became a chain, or the chain that Fortune 500s already trust. The bull run waits for no one—get in early, or watch from the sidelines.

NATIX Network , a pioneer in Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN), has officially announced its expansion into Decentralized Physical Artificial Intelligence ( DePAI ). This initiative represents a significant evolution in how artificial intelligence systems are trained and powered—by replacing traditional, centralized datasets with real-time, community-sourced data streams from smartphones and vehicles. The NATIX Network currently spans more than 255,000 contributors across 170+ countries, who have collectively mapped over 181 million kilometers. This crowdsourced geospatial data is collected through NATIX’s two flagship platforms: the Drive& smartphone app and the VX360 device for Tesla vehicles. “The rise of Physical AI requires more than smart algorithms—it demands real-world data diversity at scale,” said Alireza Ghods, CEO of NATIX. “With our community-driven DePIN infrastructure, we’re building the foundation for decentralized AI training that’s inclusive, adaptive, and privacy-conscious.” The Drive& app turns ordinary smartphones into AI data collectors by detecting traffic events, road signs, pedestrians, and infrastructure anomalies. This Smartphone DePIN approach has made it easy for everyday users to contribute valuable street-level metadata while earning rewards in NATIX, the network’s native token. For higher-fidelity applications, the recently launched VX360 device integrates directly with Tesla’s built-in camera systems to capture 360-degree driving footage, thus creating Tesla DePIN . This data is particularly useful for simulation-based scenario generation in autonomous vehicle (AV) development and real-time mapping updates. To enable contributors and developers alike, NATIX leverages DePIN Crypto to reward users and support decentralized governance. The NATIX token operates with deflationary mechanics, including monthly token burns and buybacks—totaling over 318.1 million tokens removed from circulation to date. By pairing this token economy with its global data stream, NATIX is empowering a wide range of AI applications, from AV safety testing and urban infrastructure monitoring to advanced map-making and autonomous robotics. “Decentralized infrastructure is no longer an experiment—it’s live, operational, and scaling fast,” Ghods added. “With DePAI, we’re turning everyday drives into datasets that train the next generation of autonomous cars and robots.” As the physical and digital worlds converge, NATIX believes the future of AI will be built not in isolated labs, but through widespread public participation. The DePAI strategy exemplifies this vision by combining token incentives, decentralized hardware, and real-time data processing into one cohesive system. About NATIX Network: NATIX Network is a decentralized mapping and AI infrastructure provider built on the principles of DePIN. Its ecosystem includes the Drive& smartphone app, the VX360 Tesla device, and the NATIX token. With contributors in over 170 countries, NATIX powers real-time geospatial data collection for AI model training, scenario simulation, and next-generation mobility services.

A crucial announcement from one of South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges requires your immediate attention if you deal with the SEI coin . What’s Happening with Upbit SEI Suspension? Upbit, a prominent Upbit crypto exchange in the global market, has officially informed its users about a temporary halt in services related to the Sei network. Specifically, the exchange will be suspending both deposits and withdrawals of SEI coin . This measure is scheduled to take effect on June 20 at 09:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) . It’s important to mark this time and date if you plan any transactions involving SEI on the Upbit platform. Why is Upbit Suspending SEI Services? The reason behind this temporary disruption is the upcoming SEI network upgrade . Blockchain network upgrades are significant events that often require exchanges and other service providers to pause related activities to ensure a smooth transition and the safety of user funds. Think of it like scheduled maintenance on a major highway. You temporarily close sections to improve them, which causes short-term inconvenience but leads to better performance and safety in the long run. Similarly, a SEI network upgrade aims to bring improvements to the Sei blockchain, such as enhanced performance, security, or new features. During such upgrades, exchanges typically suspend crypto deposit withdrawal services for the affected asset to prevent potential issues like: Deposits or withdrawals getting lost due to incompatible blockchain versions. Incorrect balances being reflected post-upgrade. Technical glitches during the transition period. This proactive step by Upbit is standard practice across the industry to protect user assets and maintain the integrity of the trading platform during network transitions. What Should Upbit SEI Holders Do? If you hold SEI coin on Upbit or plan to deposit or withdraw it, here are some actionable insights: Plan Ahead: If you need to deposit or withdraw SEI, make sure to complete your transactions well before the June 20, 09:00 UTC deadline. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on Upbit’s official announcements. The exchange will notify users when the network upgrade is successfully completed and when deposit and withdrawal services for SEI will resume. Consider Alternatives (Temporarily): If urgent SEI transactions are needed after the suspension begins, you may need to explore other exchanges that support SEI and are not undergoing a suspension during that specific period (after verifying their status). However, remember that transferring assets between exchanges also takes time. The Upbit SEI suspension is temporary, but being prepared is key to avoiding any inconvenience. Understanding the Impact of a SEI Network Upgrade While the temporary suspension might be inconvenient, the underlying reason – the SEI network upgrade – is generally a positive development for the Sei ecosystem. Upgrades are necessary for blockchain networks to evolve, adapt to new challenges, and implement community-approved proposals. For the SEI coin and its network, this upgrade likely aims to enhance its capabilities as a Layer 1 blockchain optimized for trading. Improved speed, lower transaction costs, or new functionalities could be among the benefits derived from the upgrade, potentially strengthening the Sei network in the long term. When Will Upbit SEI Services Resume? Upbit has stated the suspension is temporary. Services will resume once the SEI network upgrade is complete and the exchange has confirmed the stability and compatibility of their systems with the upgraded network. There is typically a period of monitoring and verification after an upgrade before exchanges reopen deposits and withdrawals. Users should monitor Upbit’s official channels for the announcement regarding the resumption time. Summary: Navigating the Upbit SEI Suspension In summary, the Upbit SEI suspension of deposits and withdrawals is a temporary measure starting June 20, 09:00 UTC, enacted by the Upbit crypto exchange in anticipation of a crucial SEI network upgrade . This is a standard procedure to safeguard assets and ensure system compatibility. Users are advised to complete any necessary crypto deposit withdrawal operations for SEI before the deadline and monitor Upbit’s official communications for updates on service resumption. While inconvenient in the short term, the network upgrade itself is a positive step for the SEI coin and its underlying technology.

The company’s CEO, Humayun Sheikh, stated on social media that this move was made due to the increasing platform usage and the low valuation of the token. Sheikh made the following statement in his statement: “As ASI1 and our agent platform grow in usage, we see its benefits continue to grow. I believe FET is undervalued at its current market cap. That’s why I’m pleased to announce that the Fetch Foundation, with the support of our market makers, will be repurchasing $50 million worth of FET across multiple exchanges.” Related News: What's Next for Bitcoin?

According to Fidelity Digital Assets, 550 BTC per day are now being classified as “ancient,” meaning coins untouched for over 10 years, surpassing the daily mining rate of 450 BTC. This marks a historic inversion in Bitcoin’s supply mechanics. Over 17% of the total BTC supply is now illiquid, and that figure could surge to 30% by 2026. BULLISH: Bitcoin Supply Squeeze COMING! ""Ancient"" bitcoin supply is growing faster than newly mined coins. Addresses that have held coins for 10 years or longer are now outstripping new supply. pic.twitter.com/D9Mk12gPB2 — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) June 19, 2025 Ancient BTC holders rarely sell: net outflows occurred less than 3% of the time. After the 2024 election, even long-term wallets showed brief activity. Illiquid supply growth signals firm conviction despite price volatility. This imbalance between shrinking liquid supply and ongoing demand is laying the groundwork for what analysts call a structural supply shock. Institutions Gear Up to Absorb Millions of Bitcoins The demand side of the equation is equally compelling. Asset manager Bitwise estimates that inflows into Bitcoin will reach $120 billion by 2025, growing to $300 billion in a base case and $426 billion in a bullish scenario. That could absorb over 4 million BTC, nearly 19% of the total capped supply. What’s fueling this? Public companies and pension funds are slowly increasing their BTC exposure US states and cities are exploring treasury allocations Advisors on major platforms now offer 1–3% BTC model portfolios Despite $35 billion in sidelined interest due to compliance hesitations at firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the institutional tide is shifting. With these players collectively managing over $60 trillion, even small allocations have significant implications. Technical Outlook: Bitcoin Coils Near Critical Trendline On the 2-hour chart, Bitcoin is consolidating at $104,600. Price action is tightening along a rising trendline from the June 5 low. The 50-period EMA is sloping down at $105,381 and has been rejecting upside moves. The MACD lines are flat below zero, indicating a potential breakout. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Levels to Watch: Support: $104,000 and $103,431 Resistance: $105,600-$105,800; above opens up $106,658 and $107,748 Bitcoin Trade Idea Longs look to confirm a breakout above $105,600 to $106,658 and $107,748 with a stop under $104,000—shorts below $103,400 to $102,200 and $100,449. Institutional flows are rising, and old supply is locking up BTC. Now, it’s time to see if price follows fundamentals or if volatility will shake out before the next leg up. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.2M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With BTC trading near $105K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,249,360 out of its $8,290,897 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00257 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income. With just hours left and the hard cap nearly reached, momentum is building fast. BTCBULL ’s blend of Bitcoin-linked value, scarcity mechanics, and flexible staking is fueling strong demand. Early buyers have a limited time to enter before the next pricing tier activates.

33767162,[object Object],1750340774,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,SOL балансирует на грани 30% обвала: медвежий треугольник указывает на $102,https://bitcoinist.com/sol-balansiruet-na-grani-30-obvala/,"Блокчейн Solana, ранее стремительно растущий, за неделю потерял 12,5%, несмотря на внушительный ежедневный доход в $4,79 млн. Это вызывает у трейдеров разногласия: следовать ли за медвежьими техническими сигналами или опираться на сильные фундаментальные показатели. Источник: CoinMarketCap Проблемы с ценой SOL происходят на фоне уверенного развития экосистемы. Все внимание приковано к ключевому уровню поддержки: сможет ли он удержаться или токен уступит позиции XRP в рейтинге капитализации. Solana продолжает демонстрировать доминирование среди платежных сетей и активно развивается как платформа для потребительских приложений. Количество активных кошельков на платформе превышает 3,25 млн. Это больше, чем у Ethereum, и почти догоняет Tron (2,58 млн). Источник: DeFiLlama. Хотя общий объем заблокированных средств (TVL) в DeFi на Solana составляет $8,4 млрд (для сравнения, у Ethereum $62 млрд), она лидирует по доходности среди всех крупных блокчейнов. За последние сутки доход Solana превысил $4,79 млн. Ближайшие конкуренты: Hyperliquid ($3,38 млн) и Binance Smart Chain ($2,41 млн). Эти показатели позволяют многим аналитикам считать токен $SOL недооценённым при текущей цене и капитализации. $140–145 – ключевая зона поддержки: судьба SOL на фоне надежд на одобрение ETF от VanEck Технические аналитики внимательно следят за движением цены Solana в зоне важной коррекции по Фибоначчи между уровнями 0.618 и 0.786, где часто происходят развороты трендов. Аналитик VipRoseTr указывает на формирование фигуры «падающий клин» на дневном графике SOL, которая в классическом анализе считается бычьей. Однако долгосрочные структуры пока сигнализируют о возможном продолжении нисходящего тренда. Если Solana удержит текущий уровень поддержки, краткосрочные цели находятся на уровне $204,31, среднесрочные – $229,01, а в перспективе возможно тестирование максимумов 2021 года – около $258,45. Эти цели кажутся достижимыми на фоне растущих ожиданий одобрения ETF на Solana. 18 июня VanEck зарегистрировал ETF под тикером $VSOL в депозитарии DTCC. Важный шаг, аналогичный процедуре для биткоин- и эфириум-ETF. Хотя это еще не одобрение SEC, это свидетельствует о подготовке к возможному запуску. Ранее SEC отложила решение по ETF на Solana от Franklin, но аналитик Bloomberg Эрик Балчунас сохраняет 90% вероятность одобрения, ссылаясь на продолжающиеся переговоры между регулятором и эмитентами ETF. Solaxy готовится к одному из крупнейших запусков токенов года: следующая монета с потенциалом 100x? Одна из причин, по которой токен Solana остается бычьим – его динамичная экосистема, включающая как мемкойны, так и более серьезные альткоины. Возможно, самым интересным дополнением к этой экосистеме является Solaxy (SOLX) – сеть второго уровня, недавно завершившая предпродажу, собрав впечатляющие $53,8 млн. Токен $SOLX будет запущен менее чем через шесть дней, но у инвесторов все еще есть последний шанс купить его по цене ниже листинга – он доступен на сайте Solaxy по $0.001766. Проект Solaxy добился такого успеха благодаря мощной фундаментальной базе: он запускает 2 слой для сети Solana. Он обеспечит пользователям Solana низкие комиссии и быстрые подтверждения, позволяя избежать задержек и сбоев транзакций, которые по-прежнему случаются в основной сети.

A Toronto-based player, SOL Strategies, is making waves by setting its sights on the prestigious Nasdaq stock exchange. This isn’t just any firm; it’s one with a clear focus on the Solana ecosystem. Let’s dive into what this potential SOL Strategies Nasdaq Listing could mean and why it’s generating buzz. Who is SOL Strategies and What’s Their Game Plan? At its core, SOL Strategies is an investment firm based in Toronto, Canada. While the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the headline grabber, their underlying strategy is what makes them particularly interesting in the crypto space. They aren’t just trading; they’re actively building a position within the Solana network itself. Their reported activities include: Accumulating Solana (SOL): Building a treasury of the native Solana token. This suggests a long-term bullish view on the network’s future value. Running Solana Validators: Participating directly in the network’s consensus mechanism. Validators are crucial for processing transactions, securing the blockchain, and earning staking rewards. This dual approach positions them not just as investors, but as active participants in the Solana ecosystem’s health and operation. Seeking a public listing like this suggests they aim to scale their operations and potentially offer broader access to their Solana-focused strategy. Why is a Nasdaq Listing Significant for a Crypto Firm? For a firm deeply involved in cryptocurrency like SOL Strategies, aiming for a listing on a major U.S. exchange like Nasdaq is a substantial step. Nasdaq is one of the world’s leading stock markets, known for listing technology and growth companies. Here’s why this move matters: A Crypto Firm Nasdaq listing brings several potential benefits: Increased Visibility and Credibility: Listing on a regulated, globally recognized exchange lends significant legitimacy compared to being purely a private entity or listed on smaller, less regulated markets. Access to Capital: Public markets provide access to a much larger pool of potential investors, including large institutions that might be restricted from investing directly in crypto assets or private crypto firms. This can fuel growth, expansion, and further investment in their core strategy. Liquidity for Shareholders: A public listing provides liquidity for the firm’s shares, allowing investors to buy and sell more easily. Potential for Institutional Adoption: Listing on Nasdaq could make SOL Strategies an attractive investment vehicle for institutional investors seeking exposure to Solana and the broader crypto space through a familiar, regulated structure. While other crypto-native companies have listed on Nasdaq (like Coinbase), this filing is notable because SOL Strategies’ reported core activity is so specifically tied to a single blockchain ecosystem – Solana – through asset accumulation and validation. Decoding the STKE Nasdaq Ticker The filing indicates SOL Strategies is seeking to list under the proposed ticker symbol STKE Nasdaq Ticker . Ticker symbols are unique abbreviations used to identify publicly traded shares on an exchange. The choice of ‘STKE’ is likely a nod to their staking activities, which are inherent to running Solana validators and potentially part of their yield generation strategy. The process involves filing registration statements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This filing is a detailed disclosure document providing information about the company’s business, financials, risks, and the securities being offered. The SEC reviews these filings to ensure they meet regulatory requirements and that investors have access to material information. The process can take time and involves scrutiny from regulators. For potential investors, the STKE ticker would represent shares in SOL Strategies, a company whose performance is tied to its management of Solana assets and validator operations, rather than direct investment in the SOL token itself. This distinction is crucial from a regulatory and investment perspective. SOL Strategies as a Solana Investment Firm The description of SOL Strategies as a Solana Investment Firm highlights their specialized focus. Instead of diversifying across many different cryptocurrencies or blockchain networks, they appear to have chosen Solana as their primary area of expertise and investment. Their strategy of accumulating SOL tokens is a direct investment in the potential growth and adoption of the Solana network. As Solana’s ecosystem expands, transaction volume increases, and demand for blockspace grows, the value of the SOL token could appreciate. Holding a treasury of SOL allows them to benefit from this potential upside. This specialized approach allows them to develop deep expertise in the Solana ecosystem, understanding its technology, community, and market dynamics. It’s a high-conviction play on Solana’s future success. The Critical Role of Solana Validators Running Solana Validators is more than just holding tokens; it’s an operational business activity within the Solana network. Validators are responsible for: Confirming Transactions: Validators verify the legitimacy of transactions on the network. Adding New Blocks: They participate in the consensus mechanism to add new blocks of transactions to the blockchain. Securing the Network: By staking SOL and participating in consensus, they help secure the network against attacks. Earning Rewards: Validators earn rewards (paid in SOL) for their services, typically through transaction fees and protocol-level incentives. For SOL Strategies, running validators provides a potential revenue stream through staking rewards. It also gives them a direct stake (literally) in the network’s performance and governance. It’s an operational business that complements their strategic asset accumulation. This operational component differentiates them from a simple holding company. They are actively contributing to the network’s infrastructure while simultaneously investing in its native asset. What Challenges Might SOL Strategies Face? While the potential benefits are clear, the path to a Nasdaq listing and operating as a public crypto-focused firm is not without hurdles: SEC Approval: The SEC review process is rigorous. They will scrutinize the filing, the business model, and the risks associated with operating in the volatile crypto market. Regulatory clarity around crypto in the U.S. is still evolving, which can add complexity. Market Volatility: The value of SOL and the profitability of validator operations are subject to significant market fluctuations. This volatility will directly impact the firm’s financial performance and share price. Competition: The crypto investment landscape is increasingly competitive, with other funds and firms also focused on specific ecosystems or strategies. Operational Risks: Running validators requires technical expertise and involves risks like slashing (penalties for validator downtime or misbehavior) or security breaches. Public Company Scrutiny: As a public company, SOL Strategies will face increased scrutiny from investors, analysts, and the media regarding its performance, strategy, and governance. Successfully navigating these challenges will be key to their long-term success as a publicly traded entity. Potential Impact on the Solana Ecosystem and Crypto Market If SOL Strategies successfully lists on Nasdaq, what could it mean? Increased Exposure for Solana: A publicly traded company focused on Solana could draw more traditional finance attention to the network. New Investment Vehicle: It could offer traditional investors a regulated way to get exposure to Solana’s growth without directly buying and holding SOL tokens or running validators themselves. Precedent for Other Crypto Firms: A successful listing could pave the way for other specialized crypto firms or even decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) (in some form) to explore public market access, potentially bridging the gap between traditional finance and specific blockchain ecosystems. This move signifies the continued maturation and institutionalization of the crypto space, with firms seeking familiar structures to engage with broader capital markets. What Should Investors and Solana Enthusiasts Watch For? Keep an eye on the SEC’s review process. The S-1 filing (or equivalent) will provide more detailed information about SOL Strategies’ financials, risks, and exact strategy. The timeline for approval is uncertain but will be a key indicator. Also, observe how the market reacts if and when STKE begins trading. Its performance could serve as a barometer for traditional investor appetite for specialized, ecosystem-focused crypto companies. Summary: Bridging Crypto Ambition and Traditional Markets SOL Strategies’ pursuit of a Nasdaq listing under the proposed ticker ‘STKE’ is a significant development. As a Solana Investment Firm actively accumulating SOL and running Solana Validators , they represent a specific, operational approach to participating in the crypto economy. A successful SOL Strategies Nasdaq Listing would position them as one of the few publicly traded entities offering investors exposure to a strategy so closely tied to a single blockchain ecosystem. This move by a Crypto Firm Nasdaq bound highlights the ongoing convergence of traditional finance and decentralized technology, potentially opening new avenues for investment and bringing increased visibility to the Solana network and the role of participants like validators. The journey through SEC approval and the eventual market reception of the STKE Nasdaq Ticker will be closely watched by those interested in the evolving landscape of crypto investment.

Each day, coins marked as long-term storage grow larger compared to newly mined Bitcoins. For the first time, BTC held in long-term supply is growing faster than the supply of newly mined coins. More and more wallets are crossing the 10-year mark with no coins moved, adding to the increasing scarcity of available Bitcoin. The share of ancient supply as a percentage of total BTC supply is near a record, as older holders are unwilling to sell. | Source: Fidelity Digital Assets Satoshi Nakamoto is the original ancient whales While initially intended as electronic cash for daily payments, Bitcoin has turned into a reserve asset. In the past decade, BTC also developed its strong ‘hodl’ ethic, leading to the creation of multiple whale wallets with no intention to sell or move coins. This idle supply was added to the coins held in early miner wallets, including those of Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi Nakamoto is the first big holder of wallets older than a decade. Soon after that, the supply of early miners also joined that cohort, reaching new peaks in 2025. Currently, over 566 BTC on average move into the ancient supply category, surpassing the newly mined 450 BTC per day. Over time, a peak 17% or roughly 3.5M coins of Bitcoin supply is now in the long-term holdings of ancient whales, which may not enter circulation again. Over time, the coins locked in ancient stockpiles will only increase. Some of the ancient wallets are relatively small. Currently, there are only 93 wallets with over 10K Bitcoins, as even whales are trying to secure their assets on multiple addresses. More than 2M wallets have over 1,000 BTC . Ancient BTC whales show long-term conviction The ancient supply of BTC contains coins that are considered lost, forgotten, or unmovable for some reason. On very rare occasions, an old wallet will awaken and move or sell some of the coins. However, selling Bitcoins is seen as abandoning the long-term potential of the coin, especially at a time when corporate buyers are scrambling for a dwindling supply of BTC to be locked in treasuries. Bitcoin treasuries are newer, but also hold over 3.39M BTC, catching up with the ancient supply. Scarcity is also driven by other long-term cohorts, including wallets aged 7-10 years and those over five years old. Most of the flux of BTC holdings comes from the earliest wallet cohorts, created under three months ago, as well as from buyers realizing profits from the recent bull market. Some of the whale wallets are specifically engaging in trading, but the overall trend is for even more Bitcoin to become unavailable. Bitcoin daily transactions are at around 440K, near a 12-month low. Currently, on-chain activity is extremely subdued, while traders use the derivative markets to trade “paper BTC.” The expected supply crunch may start affecting the market, as new sources of Bitcoin and willing sellers are getting depleted. Even retail holders have already sold their coins, with significant outflows at much lower prices in the past year. Exchanges and OTC desks are also decreasing their available supply. Unmoved Bitcoin may continue to expand in the coming years, as even 500 BTC would be enough to set up a treasury company. Holders may never sell, instead tapping the value of their Bitcoin through various forms of staking, reserves, or lending.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana and Dogecoin delivered 10,000% gains, now, Little Pepe, Sui, and Sei are showing early signs of similar explosive potential. Table of Contents Little Pepe: The memecoin that might outshine DOGE Sui: The institutional favorite eyeing explosive growth Sei: The sleeper coin on the verge of a breakout Conclusion Solana increased by more than 10,000%, rising from a small $1.50 to a substantial $158.93. Dogecoin went up from $0.004 to $0.74. The big question now is, where is the next 10,000% moonshot hiding? While it may be challenging to replicate those explosive gains, three coins on the radar are showing similar early-stage momentum. And one of them, Little Pepe (LILPEPE), is looking even more promising than its legendary predecessors. Little Pepe: The memecoin that might outshine DOGE From the shadows of the blockchain, a new meme-powered force is rapidly gaining traction: Little Pepe (LILPEPE). Unlike most memecoins, which rely solely on community hype, LILPEPE offers actual utility. Built on its own Layer-2 blockchain, designed exclusively for memecoins and culture-centric projects, Little Pepe is already being hailed as the next big thing to disrupt the memecoin space. With sniper bots rendered ineffective on its network, it offers a level playing field for retail investors, a rare advantage in today’s crypto landscape. Little Pepe is currently in its second presale stage at a remarkably low price of $0.0011, yet it has already raised over $450,000 in less than 48 hours. This follows the first presale stage, which sold out in just three days. This kind of presale momentum isn’t just impressive, it’s a signal. Investors are rushing in not only because of the price but also because of the token’s unique utility: ultra-fast, zero-tax transactions, a Meme Launchpad for new meme projects, and an active development roadmap that puts it far ahead of typical meme tokens. LILPEPE is more than just hype. It’s being supported by anonymous whales and market veterans who’ve successfully helped launch some of the most viral meme tokens in the past. Combine that with its revolutionary blockchain infrastructure and growing retail excitement, and it’s easy to see why many believe LILPEPE could be the next Dogecoin, only smarter, faster, and far more rewarding. To join the LILPEPE revolution, traders can download MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load their wallet with ETH or USDT (on the ERC20 chain), and visit LittlePepe.com to participate in the presale. With the token still under a penny, a 10,000% rally would take it just above $0.11, a realistic leap for a project with such momentum and backing. You might also like: Shiba Inu exploded in 2021, PEPE in 2023, this frog token under $0.002 could soar in 2025 Sui: The institutional favorite eyeing explosive growth Currently trading at around $3.00 with a market cap of approximately $10.6 billion, Sui ( SUI ) is backed by solid fundamentals. Unlike speculative tokens with no use case, Sui powers a high-throughput Layer-1 blockchain boasting over $1.94 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) across its DeFi ecosystem. Despite a recent short-term dip of -8.62%, Sui’s RSI remains neutral at 40.09, indicating potential room for a bullish rebound. For investors looking beyond memes and into infrastructure, Sui offers both the tech and trajectory to aim for that elusive 10,000% gain if adoption accelerates at scale. Sei: The sleeper coin on the verge of a breakout Sei ( SEI ) is the third selection for the next crypto rocket ship. It is now trading between $0.17 and $0.20, and its daily chart shows strong signals of consolidation right below a significant resistance level. If confirmed, its technical signs suggest it will soon break into the $0.27 to $0.43 zone. This could lead to a significantly larger gain. With a market worth of only $686 million, Sei isn’t a large company, but traders are paying attention to its derivative trading volume, which recently jumped 222.21% to $1.78 billion. This level of interest indicates a growing number of leveraged positions betting on a significant price movement. The current setup for SEI mirrors the calm before Solana’s 2021 breakout. With a neutral RSI and increasing trading interest, Sei is a solid candidate for those wanting exposure to a low-cap altcoin that could follow the same explosive path of its predecessors. Conclusion While Solana and Dogecoin captured lightning in a bottle in 2021, a new wave of promising tokens is emerging with the potential to outperform. Little Pepe (LILPEPE), with its unique Layer 2 meme ecosystem, zero-bot chain, and explosive presale growth, is capturing the spirit of Dogecoin with the technology of Solana.

The Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged also impacted the market, with prices retreating. Bitcoin (BTC) hovered around $105,000 as neither buyers nor sellers could decisively take control. The flagship cryptocurrency fell to a low of $103,695 before recovering and moving to its current levels. However, it is struggling to reclaim $105,000. Ethereum (ETH) remained in the red as well, with the world’s second-largest down nearly 9% over the past week. ETH is currently trading around $2,519 after recovering from a low of $2,469. Ripple (XRP) has been marginally down over the past 24 hours, while Solana (SOL) is down almost 2%, trading around $145. Dogecoin (DOGE) is struggling to stay above $0.170, with the price marginally down, while Cardano (ADA) is down nearly 3%, trading around $0.598. Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON) , Litecoin (LTC) , Hedera (HBAR) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial declines. However, Chainlink (LINK) bucked the bearish trend, with the price marginally up, trading around $13.10. Fed Keeps Interest Rates Steady The Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady, between 4.25% and 4.50%, expecting elevated inflation and slowed economic growth. However, the Fed expects to make two rate cuts later this year. However, it removed one reduction for 2026 and 2027, putting the expected future rate cuts at four or one percentage point. The Reserve's “dot plot” indicated continued uncertainty about future rate cuts. Each dot represents an official’s expectations for rates. Seven of the nineteen participants indicated they did not want any cuts this year. However, the Committee unanimously approved the policy statement. Economic projections also indicated growing stagflationary pressures, with officials indicating that gross domestic product (GDP) was advancing at 1.4% in 2025 while inflation was hitting 3%. The revised forecasts show a decrease of 0.3 percentage points for GDP and a similar increase for the personal consumption expenditures price index. Core PCE, which eliminates food and energy prices, was projected at 3.1%, 0.3 percentage points higher. Unemployment was up to 4.5%, 0.1 percentage point higher than March and 0.3 percentage point higher than the current level. The FOMC stated, “Uncertainty about the economic outlook has diminished but remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.” Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated there was time to wait for more clarity, stating, “For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policies.” Iran’s Nobitex Exchange Hacked By Pro-Israel Group Pro-Israel hacker group Gonjeshke Darande has claimed to have destroyed over $90 million stolen from Nobitex’s wallets. The group issued an update stating it had burned the funds across multiple blockchains using “vanity addresses” containing no recoverable private keys. This renders the funds permanently inaccessible. The news comes after the high-profile exploit of Iran’s largest exchange, which saw over $90 million in BTC, ETH, DOGE, and other tokens drained from its hot wallets. The hackers justified the breach as a response to the exchange’s alleged role in helping the Iranian regime circumvent sanctions. The group tied the hack to the ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran, which have intensified following airstrikes on Tehran’s nuclear sites. Blockchain security firm Chainalysis confirmed the stolen assets had not been transferred to crypto mixers or exchanges and were sent to irretrievable addresses with inflammatory labels. Meanwhile, Nobitex acknowledged the burn and assured users their funds were safe in cold storage. The exchange also clarified that its staff had emptied its hot wallets and that no customer funds would be lost thanks to its reserve fund and insurance pool. Circle Stock Soars As GENIUS Act Passes Circle’s stock surged over 34% on June 18, briefly touching an all-time high of $200.90 before closing at $199.59. The increase is a 6.5-fold increase from Circle’s initial public offering price of $31. The rally came after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act to establish a comprehensive federal framework to regulate dollar-backed stablecoins like Circle’s USDC. The legislation cleared the Senate with a 68-30 vote and now heads to the US House of Representatives. House Financial Services Committee staff confirmed that scheduling discussions will begin next week. However, a floor vote date is yet to be decided. Coinbase’s stock also rose 14%, while Robinhood rose 4.5% to reach a new all-time high of $78.35. The market’s reaction to the passage of the GENIUS Act indicates growing confidence that federal oversight could accelerate mainstream adoption and de-risk the regulatory landscape for US-based stablecoin issuers. President Trump Urges House To Pass The GENIUS Act United States President Donald Trump has urged the House to pass the GENIUS Act as soon as possible so he can officially sign it into law. Trump took to Truth Social to urge the House to “Get it on my desk ASAP.” “The Senate just passed an incredible Bill that is going to make America the UNDISPUTED Leader in Digital Assets. Get it to my desk ASAP — NO DELAYS, NO ADD ONS.” Trump’s message came after the Senate passed the bill 68-30. Supporters of the bill believe it will play a crucial role in maintaining the dollar’s dominance in global finance. Senator Bill Hagerty, also the bill’s sponsor, stated that it would allow businesses of all sizes and Americans across the country to settle payments instantaneously instead of waiting for days or even weeks. The bill faced early setbacks, failing a closure vote in the Senate in May after Democrats voiced concerns about Trump’s connections with the crypto industry. Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the bill's fiercest critics, stated that Trump and his family would make millions from the USD1 stablecoin if the GENIUS Act passed. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a marginal increase on Tuesday despite volatility and selling pressure. However, it is struggling to build momentum and reclaim $105,000, with buyers unable to push prices higher. The flagship cryptocurrency started the week positively, racing to an intraday high of $108,944 on Monday. Despite this, it failed to maintain momentum and settled at $106,806. Bearish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions escalated. As a result, BTC plunged below $105,000, falling to a low of $103,400 before settling at $104,518. BTC is trading within a narrow band, ranging from $103,000 to $107,500. The price has stabilized around the $105,000 mark, with analysts stating the price must hold above $103,000 to retain chances of a potential breakout. While BTC risks further downside, if it maintains its position above $103,000, it would suggest markets are absorbing the selling pressure effectively. However, the market situation also presents investors with a high-stakes yet potentially rewarding opportunity for investors. Crypto trader Matthew Hyland stated on X, “This environment now reflects a high-risk, high-reward opportunity for upside continuation if buyer confidence returns.” Andre Dragosch, head of research at Bitwise’s ETP platform ETC Group, believes that BTC’s price can suffer following an outbreak of hostilities between two or more countries. While volatility in BTC is seen as reducing, it is still viewed as a risky asset and is likely to be sold quickly if geopolitical tensions escalate. Mthink Thakore, co-founder and CEO of Bitcoin Layer2 liquidity protocol Velar, stated, “Over the longer term, geopolitical conflicts raise the prospects of higher inflation rates globally due to factors like increased fiscal spending, looser monetary policy, supply-chain disruptions, and commodity price spikes, which should all benefit Bitcoin.” BTC has shown remarkable resilience during geopolitical tensions. However, a lack of price movement does not necessarily make BTC a hedge during geopolitical uncertainty. BTC ended the previous weekend positively, registering a marginal increase to reclaim $105,000 on Sunday and settle at $105,791. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC surged past the 20-day SMA and $110,000 to settle at $110,251.

Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum's (ETH) price action remained subdued as it traded around the $2,500 mark. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency lost momentum after reaching a high of $2,878 on Wednesday as sellers overwhelmed buyers at upper levels. As a result, the price plunged to a low of $2,441 by Friday before recovering and moving to current levels. According to analysts, large holders of ETH are reinforcing the downward pressure on the asset by selling the asset. ETH has traded in a range for over a month, with neither buyers nor sellers taking complete control. With price action and volatility stalling, ETH is setting up for a decisive move. However, analysts are unsure about which way it could break. ETH has held above the $2,400 level, a crucial support zone. Analysts believe that as long as ETH continues closing above this level, the setup will favor the Bulls. A break from this level could push ETH beyond $2,800. However, if ETH loses this level, bears will gain the upper hand and drive the price below $2,000. ETH ended the previous weekend in the red, registering a marginal decline and settling at $2,511.

Raydium ( RAY ) price rose to an intraday high of $2.7040, up 40% from its lowest level this week. It then pared back those gains to trade at $2.30, giving it a market capitalization of $598 million. Third-party data shows that Raydium’s platform is under pressure. Data compiled by Artemis shows that Raydium has over 838,000 active transacting users, a figure that has dropped for six consecutive months.

Most notably, Raydium’s monthly transaction volume has dropped by 90%, falling from $124 billion in January to just $12 billion this month. Raydium monthly DEX volume | Source: DeFi Llama The decline is closely tied to the underperformance of Solana ( SOL ) meme coins. CoinGecko data shows that many of these tokens have plunged more than 15% in the past seven days, pushing their total market cap down to $9.7 billion, a steep drop from $30 billion in January. Raydium typically sees higher volume when these tokens are rallying. Lower transaction volume has also weighed heavily on Raydium’s revenue, which has plummeted from $58 million in January to $1.9 million this month.

Volume weakens on Binance, aligning with neutral RSI to confirm indecision. Key breakout zones identified as the market awaits trigger for directional move. By Sholanke Dele Bitcoin price ( BTC-USD ) has been locked in a tight range over the past week, trading between the well-defined resistance at $108,900 and support at $103,000. As of the European session today, June 19, Bitcoin is hovering around $104,700, barely moving from its earlier levels in the Asian session. This consolidation reflects growing market indecision, particularly as price trades below short-term resistance and above firm support zones. The 20-day EMA currently stands at $105,790, just overhead from Bitcoin’s present level, while the 50-day EMA sits closer to the lower boundary at $103,000. This configuration is compressing price into a narrow band, forming a technical squeeze. The 50-day EMA reinforces the recent support level, increasing the likelihood that $103,000 holds firm in the near term unless significant momentum shifts. BTC price dynamics (May - June 2025). Source: TradingView Volume data adds another layer to the picture. Binance’s spot volume on Bitcoin declined yesterday compared to the last three trading days. This weakening in participation indicates a lack of conviction from both bulls and bears. It also aligns with the Relative Strength Index on the daily timeframe, which is parked near neutral territory. The RSI reading reflects a market that is yet to favour either direction, further validating the range-bound structure. Bitcoin technical squeeze continues amid rising Middle-East tensions On the 4-hour chart, a stack of EMA layers sits above current price levels. This implies any bullish breakout will face multiple layers of technical resistance, which could slow upward moves unless volume expands meaningfully. However, a successful breakout through this EMA cluster will likely test $108,900 and, if that level is cleared, extend to $110,500. A move toward the all-time high at $112,000 may follow if the broader market turns risk-on. On the downside, if Bitcoin fails to defend the 50-day EMA and drops below $103,000, immediate attention will shift to $101,000. This level serves as the next key support before the psychologically significant $100,000 threshold, which could trigger wider selling if breached. Until then, the price action suggests Bitcoin is in consolidation, caught between opposing technical forces and a muted sentiment environment as traders observe the conflict in the Middle-East. A decisive move outside this EMA boundary will set the tone for the next directional trend. Bitcoin stalled near $103,000 as compressed EMA blocked further upside .

As part of his analysis, the analyst also declared that there is no reason to be bearish on the altcoin at the moment. XRP To Rally Above $5 Based On 5-Wave Count In an X post, XForce shared an accompanying chart that showed that XRP could rally above $5 on the Wave 3 impulsive move to the upside. The altcoin could even rally to double digits and touch $13 on this move. The chart also showed that XRP will reach this target by year-end or early next year. Related Reading: XRP To End 7-Month Consolidation After 700% Surge – Is A Major Move Coming? Based on the 5-Wave count, XRP will then witness a price correction to around $5 on Wave 4 before it then rallies to around $25 on Wave 5, an impulsive move to the upside. XForce is confident that the current price action is going according to plan. He noted that the macro direction was met with very little margin of error. Furthermore, the crypto analyst remarked that everything from the Wave 4 triangle breakout to the anticipated 1 to 2 pullback following the 5-wave impulse followed the blueprint. In line with this, he declared that there is no valid reason to adopt a bearish stance unless the market invalidates the bullish case for XRP. XForce also affirmed that XRP is within the bounds of the same two scenarios but that the ultra-bullish scenario of a rally to double digits is gaining more credibility by the day. The more conservative scenario for the altcoin is a rally to $4, which could still mark a new all-time high for XRP. The analyst earlier declared that all scenarios on the medium timeframe still show the altcoin reaching a new ATH in this market cycle. XRP Consolidation Has Reached Its Peak In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades stated that the XRP consolidation has finally reached its apex and that something big is coming next. She remarked that the altcoin could either record an explosive breakout or see one final sharp drop to support that ignites a breakout. Either way, XRP looks likely to rally to the upside soon. Related Reading: XRP Price At $27: Guardian Arch Formation Predictions 1,000% Move CasiTrades stated that the XRP price continues to struggle with the $2.25 level. As long as this level remains resistance, she claimed that it increases the likelihood of the altcoin dropping to support levels at $2.01, $1.90, and even $1.55. However, the analyst declared that these aren’t bearish targets but momentum zones, where the market grabs the liquidity it needs to build momentum for Wave 3. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.16, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Recently, Arrington Capital, a well-known thesis-driven investor in digital assets and Web3, made a significant move that caught the eye of on-chain analysts. This action involved a substantial ETH withdrawal from a major exchange, following a considerable allocation towards Crypto Staking . Understanding Arrington Capital’s Recent ETH Withdrawal and Staking According to insights shared by on-chain analyst The Data Nerd on X, Arrington Capital withdrew 2,489 Ethereum (ETH), valued at approximately $6.28 million at the time, from the Coinbase exchange. This withdrawal occurred shortly after the firm had staked a much larger amount – 8,480 ETH, worth around $20.97 million – into Figment, a leading staking infrastructure provider. These two actions, seemingly contradictory (withdrawing from an exchange versus committing to staking), paint a picture of a deliberate and potentially multi-faceted strategy by the investment firm. Let’s break down what each move signifies and why they are noteworthy, particularly when viewed through the lens of On-chain data . Why is an ETH Withdrawal from Coinbase Significant? A common interpretation in the crypto space is that assets moved off exchanges are intended for long-term holding rather than immediate trading or selling. When a large entity like Arrington Capital moves millions of dollars worth of ETH off a platform like Coinbase, it suggests they are taking custody of the assets, often seen as a signal of confidence in the asset’s future value. Keeping funds on an exchange is convenient for active trading, but self-custody is preferred by those who plan to hold for extended periods, mitigating exchange-specific risks. Exploring Arrington Capital’s Move into Crypto Staking Parallel to the withdrawal, Arrington Capital also significantly increased its exposure to Crypto Staking by allocating a substantial amount of ETH to Figment. Staking Ethereum involves locking up ETH to participate in the network’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. In return, stakers earn rewards, effectively generating yield on their holdings. For institutional investors like Arrington Capital, staking offers several benefits: Yield Generation: Earning passive income on their ETH holdings. Network Participation: Contributing to the security and stability of the Ethereum network. Long-Term Commitment: Staking typically involves lock-up periods, reinforcing a long-term investment perspective. Choosing a provider like Figment suggests a preference for institutional-grade, secure, and reliable staking infrastructure, which is crucial when dealing with multi-million dollar positions. What Does This On-chain Data Tell Us About Arrington Capital’s Strategy? Analyzing these combined moves through On-chain data provides a glimpse into Arrington Capital’s strategic thinking. The withdrawal of a portion of ETH from Coinbase, while simultaneously staking a larger amount, could indicate a diversified approach: Core Long-Term Position: The large staked amount represents a core, long-term bullish position on Ethereum , aimed at earning yield while supporting the network. Flexible Holdings: The withdrawn amount might be a portion they wish to hold in cold storage for maximum security, or potentially keep available for other strategic purposes outside of immediate trading on Coinbase, without necessarily indicating an imminent sale. This combination suggests confidence in Ethereum ‘s long-term prospects (staking for yield) while also managing their holdings strategically across different venues (withdrawing for custody/flexibility). The Value of Tracking On-chain Data for Investors The ability to track the movements of significant market participants like Arrington Capital is a key benefit of On-chain data analysis. While not financial advice, observing where ‘smart money’ is moving can offer directional cues and highlight potential trends or conviction levels among experienced players. Tools and analysts specializing in on-chain metrics provide transparency that is often unavailable in traditional markets. Challenges in Interpreting On-chain Data It’s important to note that interpreting On-chain data isn’t always straightforward. A withdrawal from an exchange doesn’t guarantee indefinite holding; the assets could be moved to another wallet for various reasons, including transfers to other parties, use in DeFi protocols, or eventual over-the-counter (OTC) sales. Similarly, staking decisions can be influenced by yield rates, lock-up terms, and broader portfolio management strategies. Therefore, while informative, on-chain analysis should be part of a broader research process. Conclusion: Arrington Capital’s Strategic Maneuvers Arrington Capital ‘s recent actions – the notable ETH withdrawal from Coinbase and the significant allocation to Crypto Staking via Figment – highlight a strategic approach to managing their Ethereum holdings. These moves, visible through On-chain data , suggest a strong conviction in ETH’s future, balancing long-term yield generation through staking with potentially enhanced security or flexibility for a portion of their assets. For those following the market, these types of transactions offer valuable data points, underscoring the transparency offered by blockchain technology and the evolving strategies of institutional players in the digital asset space.

Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Solana (SOL) Source: TradingView Solana (SOL) has seen a significant decline in its price recently. Over the past week, it dropped by 10.57%. The monthly decrease stands at 14.92%, and over the last six months, it has fallen by 23.95%. Currently, SOL is trading between $139.87 and $167.27. Technical indicators suggest that SOL might be oversold. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 42.25, which is below the neutral 50 mark. The Stochastic oscillator reads 36.91, also indicating a potential oversold condition. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is negative at -0.9517, pointing toward bearish momentum. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, at $147.98 and $150.05 respectively, showing that the price is hovering around these averages. Looking ahead, SOL faces immediate resistance at $181. To reach this level, the price would need to rise by around 8% to 29% from its current range. The next resistance is at $209. On the downside, the nearest support is at $126.67. Falling to this level would mean a drop of about 9%. The second support is at $99.27. These levels are crucial for SOL’s potential recovery or further decline, and traders are watching closely to see which direction it will take. Conclusion While SOL shows strength in the current bull run, XYZVerse’s unique sports-meme ecosystem and ambitious growth targets position it as a potential market leader.

As crypto markets recover and institutional interest builds, Lubin’s bold projection is drawing renewed attention to ETH’s long-term upside. In this article, we examine Ethereum’s current price movement, the potential for a breakout, and why Lubin remains firmly bullish. Ethereum Holds Ground Ahead of Key Breakout Levels Source: tradingview Despite recent price consolidation, Ethereum is showing signs of resilience and remains a key contender for future growth. Currently trading between $2,367 and $2,804, ETH is navigating a crucial support and resistance zone. While bears have dominated in recent months—with a six-month decline of around 27%—market dynamics could shift quickly. The $3,060 resistance level stands as a pivotal threshold; breaking above it may unlock a rally toward $3,500, representing a 20% gain. More importantly, co-founder Joseph Lubin believes this is just the beginning. His forecast of a 10x increase suggests long-term fundamentals and adoption trends far outweigh short-term volatility. As Ethereum continues to power DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise blockchain solutions, it remains uniquely positioned to lead the next crypto cycle. Conclusion Ethereum’s current price action may appear cautious, but industry insiders like Joseph Lubin see massive potential ahead. A breakout above key resistance levels could ignite a fresh wave of bullish momentum, setting the stage for long-term growth. For investors and builders alike, Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem—and if Lubin is right, the best may be yet to come.

Earlier this year, Justice Minister Pavel Blažek accepted a large donation in BTC, which he sold for about $45.8 million in March. In May, the opposition raised concerns over the source of the donation, and by the end of the month, Blažek resigned. The main opposition centrist ANO (YES) movement, with billionaire Andrej Babiš at the helm, requested a vote of no-confidence, looking to oust the current government.

In March 2025, a lawyer representing Tomas Jirikovsky, a convicted criminal, reportedly approached Blažek, saying that the client would donate 30% of his BTC stash to the ministry. Before his arrest, Jirikovsky had operated the Sheep Marketplace . In 2017, he went to prison for embezzlement, drug trafficking, and illegal trading of weapons. Police confiscated his wallet containing BTC but returned it after his release in 2021. The opposition party raised concerns over the origin of this donated BTC , since Blažek did not do any checks. But Blažek denied knowledge of wrongdoing. “I have no way to investigate the matter, and I wasn’t interested so many years after the case,” he said. Blažek also claimed that courts had not proven that the BTC came from criminal activity. During the trial, the court suspected that the coins came from Nucleus, a dark web marketplace that reportedly shut its doors the day after Jirikovsky’s arrest. Furthermore, BTC market monitors noted that a portion of the Nucleus-linked BTC, dormant since 2016, moved to new wallets in March. Jirikovsky claimed that he got to keep the BTC because he had obtained it legally. Blažek claimed he hadn’t made any promises in return for the donation.

In the following eight-part thread, the group leaked sensitive information about the exchange’s infrastructure, including server layouts, privacy tools, deployment systems, and more.

Prior to leaking the security details, the group, also known by the pseudonym “Predatory Sparrow,” claimed it had burned up to $90 million of the stolen funds across multiple chains. According to the hackers, they used “vanity addresses” that lack recoverable private keys, rendering the assets permanently inaccessible. Nobitex acknowledged earlier the same day that its internal investigation revealed the scope and impact of the attack to be more complex than initially estimated. The exchange also noted that its response efforts have been limited due to broader national tensions stemming from the ongoing Israel–Iran conflict. Widely regarded as a central pillar of Iran’s crypto economy, Nobitex was explicitly targeted by the group as part of what it described as retaliation for the conflict. Gonjeshke Darande has, on several occasions, referred to the exchange as the country’s “favorite sanctions violations tool.” In response to the crisis, Iran has imposed a curfew on domestic cryptocurrency exchanges, restricting their operating hours between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. Read more: a16z recovers X account after hack promoting fraudulent token",News|Iran|Israel|Сrypto hack,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-06-19 14:08:33

BTC has struggled to gain momentum since dropping below $110,000 on Wednesday (June 11). It plunged to a low of $102,854 before recovering and moving to current levels, marginally down over the past 24 hours as it struggles to reclaim $105,000. Trump Furious At Fed Rate Cut Stance US President Donald Trump launched a scathing attack on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for refusing to cut interest rates. The Fed left interest rates unchanged again, prompting Trump to take to Truth Social and criticize Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Trump posted, “Too Late—Powell is the WORST. A real dummy who’s costing America $Billions!” He also included a link to an article published on the National Mortgage News site. The article quoted an analysis from Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s regulator, who called for Powell to step down if he kept interest rates steady. The decision left Bitcoin at a standstill. BTC has hovered around $104,000-$105,000 since the Fed voted to maintain its current monetary policy in June. Analysts believe the Fed’s cautionary stance has triggered a pause in Bitcoin’s price action, much to the dismay of traders. Fed Chair Jerome Powell justified keeping interest rates steady, adding that “policymakers are well-positioned to wait” before moving further on interest rates. “We have to learn more about tariffs. I don’t know what the right way for us to react will be. I think it’s hard to know with any confidence how we should react until we see the size of the effects.” Federal Reserve Keeps Interest Rates Unchanged The Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady, between 4.25% and 4.50%, expecting elevated inflation and slowed economic growth. However, the Fed expects to make two rate cuts later this year. However, it removed one reduction for 2026 and 2027, putting the expected future rate cuts at four or one percentage point. The Reserve's “dot plot” indicated continued uncertainty about future rate cuts. Each dot represents an official’s expectations for rates. Seven of the nineteen participants indicated they did not want any cuts this year. However, the Committee unanimously approved the policy statement. The FOMC stated, “Uncertainty about the economic outlook has diminished but remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.” Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated there was time to wait for more clarity, stating, “For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policies.” Spot Bitcoin ETFs Continue Inflow Streak US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs continued their inflow streak, recording their eighth day of inflows despite Middle East tensions. The ETFs recorded $388.3 million in inflows on Wednesday, as institutional interest shows no sign of waning. According to data from Farside, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC), led with $278.9 million and $104.4 million in inflows. The strong inflows reiterate the fact that institutional interest and confidence in BTC remains strong. Crypto analytics platform Santiment stated, “Despite the initial panic, Bitcoin has remained in the $104K-$105K range, aided by consistent ETF inflows and a lack of follow-through in military actions, mirroring the typical ‘risk-off, then stabilize’ pattern seen in previous geopolitical crises.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to regain momentum as resistance around $105,000-$106,000 blocks a move past $110,000. Rising macroeconomic uncertainty and escalating Middle East tensions have pushed investors into a “wait-and-watch” approach, thanks to market uncertainty. As a result, BTC’s bull run has hit pause, with the $112,000 level proving to be a stubborn barrier. Rising geopolitical tensions, including the Israel-Iran conflict, have created a risk-off sentiment among investors. As a result, they have pivoted to traditional safe-haven assets like gold and US Treasurys, with gold nearing all-time highs this week. BTC and other risk assets have faced reduced demand in recent sessions, with the flagship cryptocurrency dropping nearly 4% since Israel’s first attack on Iran. The Nobitex hack added to the pressure, further weighing down the price. The Fed’s decision to leave interest rates unchanged has also dampened momentum. The Fed’s cautious approach is due to persistent inflation and concerns about tariff-induced pressures under the Trump administration. These concerns have also reduced expectations of a Fed rate cut in 2025. The Fed’s restrictive monetary policy strengthens the US Dollar and pressures risk assets like BTC . Market watchers believe the circumstances in which the Fed is fighting inflation are exceptional. QCP Capital stated in a note, “This is no ordinary inflation fight. Our base case is that the Fed may adopt a more cautious tone in its September, potentially indicating a single rate cut for 2025, in contrast to market pricing. Such a revision would likely pressure risk assets, including Bitcoin and broader digital assets, as liquidity expectations are pared back.” BTC started the previous week on a bullish note, rising over 4% to surge past the 20-day SMA and $110,000 and settle at $110,247. The price fell to an intraday low of $108,325 but recovered to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,258. BTC lost momentum on Wednesday and fell 1.43% to $108,686. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price fell nearly 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,826. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $102,854 on Friday as sellers attempted to overwhelm buyers. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase, reclaim $106,000, and settle at $106,106. Source: TradingView Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC dropped nearly 1% on Saturday before registering a marginal increase on Sunday to settle at $105,561. BTC raced to an intraday high of $108,939 on Monday as it started the week on a bullish note. However, it could not stay at this level and fell to $106,808, ultimately registering an increase of 1.18%. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as markets turned bearish. As a result, the price fell over 2%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,519. BTC recovered on Wednesday, registering a marginal increase and moving to $104,884. The current session sees BTC down 0.50%, trading around $104,358. If BTC slips below $103,000, it could drop to $100,000 or lower. On the other hand, if buyers regain momentum and push above $106,000, BTC could move to $110,000. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The token, trading at $0.1880 at press time, has climbed to become the 66th most valuable cryptocurrency after posting a 12.12% gain over the past 24 hours. This gain propels it back above the coveted $1 billion market capitalization threshold.

Crypto analyst @Four_iv believes that with $SEI building strong momentum, a breakout toward $0.80 becomes achievable , approaching 2024 highs and potentially delivering over 300% returns for traders. Can SEI Hit $0.5? Technical Patterns Signal Massive Breakout Ahead After finding support near the $0.16 region, SEI has bounced slightly and is currently trading around $0.1869, just above the 9-day simple moving average (SMA) of $0.1806, a short-term bullish signal if sustained. A critical resistance level lies at $0.26, which marks a 5-month-long descending barrier. A successful breakout above this level could open the door for a bullish rally toward the $0.35 region, which has historically acted as a significant supply zone. Source: Shattry on TradingView If momentum continues beyond $0.35, the chart outlines a potential mid-term target of $0.50 , representing a 160% gain from current levels. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 46.42, indicating that SEI remains in neutral territory, although it has rebounded from oversold conditions below 30. This rebound suggests renewed buying interest but does not yet confirm a strong uptrend. In summary, SEI needs to convincingly break above the $0.26 resistance zone to validate a bullish reversal. If this breakout occurs with rising volume, the next targets lie at $0.35 and potentially $0.50. Failure to clear this resistance may lead to continued consolidation or a retest of lower support near $0.16.

In the fast-paced world of crypto, it’s easy to focus on daily price swings and trading volumes. But a fascinating trend is quietly unfolding that speaks volumes about the conviction of early adopters and long-term investors: the significant growth in the Bitcoin dormant supply . What Exactly is the Bitcoin Dormant Supply? When we talk about the Bitcoin dormant supply , we’re referring to Bitcoin that hasn’t moved from its wallet address for a significant period. The most compelling category, and the focus of recent analysis, is Bitcoin that has remained untouched for over 10 years . Think of these coins as digital artifacts, relics from Bitcoin’s earliest days, held by individuals who acquired them long before Bitcoin became a household name. This category is particularly interesting because coins held for such an extended time are less likely to be part of active trading strategies. They represent a deep, long-term belief in Bitcoin’s future value, often associated with what the crypto community affectionately calls “ Bitcoin long-term holders ” or simply “HODLers” (Hold On for Dear Life). The Astonishing Growth: More Dormant Than Newly Mined? Recent data from a Fidelity Digital Assets report, highlighted by Cointelegraph, reveals a truly striking trend. Since April 2024, an average of approximately 566 Bitcoin that has remained unmoved for over a decade has been added to this “ancient supply” category every single day . To put this into perspective, consider the current rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation. Following the latest BTC halving event in April 2024, the reward for miners was cut in half. Miners now collectively earn around 450 Bitcoin per day (block reward of 3.125 BTC every ~10 minutes). The fact that the volume of Bitcoin becoming dormant for over 10 years surpasses the current daily issuance by miners is a powerful indicator of accumulation and holding behaviour. Here’s a simple comparison: Metric Approximate Daily BTC Amount (Since April 2024) New BTC Issued by Miners ~450 BTC BTC Becoming 10+ Years Dormant ~566 BTC This dynamic suggests that more Bitcoin is moving into the category of long-term, likely inaccessible or deeply held supply, than is being created each day. This has significant implications for overall Bitcoin supply dynamics . The Ever-Growing Treasure Trove of Ancient Bitcoin According to the Fidelity report, this ancient supply now represents a substantial portion of the total BTC supply that has ever been mined. It accounts for more than 17% of all mined Bitcoin , which is roughly 3.4 million BTC. Valuing this ancient hoard is difficult given Bitcoin’s price volatility. The report cited a value of approximately $360 billion based on a price of $107,000 per coin at the time of their analysis. While the price fluctuates, the sheer volume of 3.4 million BTC sitting unmoved for a decade highlights the immense value locked away by these conviction-driven holders. Why Are So Many Bitcoins Becoming Dormant? The Power of Bitcoin HODL The primary driver behind the growth of the Bitcoin dormant supply is the strong conviction of Bitcoin long-term holders . These individuals aren’t looking for quick profits. They likely acquired their Bitcoin when the price was significantly lower and have weathered multiple market cycles, corrections, and periods of intense volatility. Their decision not to move or sell their Bitcoin for over a decade indicates several possibilities: Unshakeable Belief: They hold a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term potential as digital gold or a global reserve asset. Early Acquisition: Many of these coins were mined or purchased in Bitcoin’s infancy, potentially at very low costs, reducing the pressure to sell for profit. Lost or Inaccessible Keys: Sadly, some portion of this dormant supply may represent coins whose private keys have been lost or forgotten over the years. Estate Planning/Inheritance: Some may be held within long-term estate plans, intended for future generations. Strategic Holding: Sophisticated investors or entities might be intentionally holding large amounts off-exchange as a long-term strategic allocation. Regardless of the exact reason, the sheer volume of Bitcoin remaining dormant for so long is a powerful testament to the Bitcoin HODL philosophy and reduces the potentially available supply on exchanges. Future Projections and the Impact of the BTC Halving The Fidelity report makes compelling projections about the future growth of this ancient supply, largely influenced by the predictable nature of the BTC halving schedule. As time passes, more and more existing Bitcoin will cross the 10-year threshold, automatically adding to the dormant count, while the rate of new Bitcoin creation continues to decrease every four years due to the halving. Fidelity projects that the ancient supply’s share of the total mined BTC supply could rise to: 20% by 2028: The year of the next anticipated BTC halving . 25% by 2034: Further increasing its dominance over the newly issued supply. This interaction between the fixed issuance schedule dictated by the BTC halving and the behaviour of Bitcoin long-term holders profoundly impacts Bitcoin supply dynamics . As the rate of new supply shrinks and the amount of old, unmoved supply grows, the effectively available supply for trading and new investment becomes increasingly scarce. Implications for Bitcoin Supply Dynamics and the Market The consistent growth of the Bitcoin dormant supply has several key implications for the market: Reduced Selling Pressure: Coins held for over 10 years are statistically far less likely to be sold in response to market fluctuations compared to newer coins or those held by short-term traders. This removes a significant potential source of selling pressure from the market. Increased Scarcity: While Bitcoin’s total supply is capped at 21 million, the circulating and *actively traded* supply is what truly matters for price discovery. As the dormant supply grows, the effectively available supply becomes scarcer, which can be a bullish factor assuming demand remains constant or increases. Indicator of Conviction: The trend serves as a strong signal of confidence from some of the earliest and most resilient Bitcoin holders. Their unwillingness to sell, even after immense price appreciation, speaks to a belief in even greater future value. Understanding these Bitcoin supply dynamics is crucial for anyone trying to grasp Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. It’s not just about how much Bitcoin exists, but how much is actually in active circulation. Are There Challenges or Risks Associated with Dormant Supply? While the growth in Bitcoin dormant supply is often seen as a positive indicator of strong holding conviction, it’s not without potential considerations: Lost Access: As mentioned, some portion is likely lost forever due to lost keys. This permanently removes those coins from circulation. Future Movement: While unlikely for the majority, a sudden need or decision by a large, ancient holder to move or sell a significant amount of Bitcoin could potentially impact the market, although the logistics of selling such a large amount without impacting the price are challenging. Concentration Risk: A large amount of supply is concentrated in the hands of early holders. While they have demonstrated resilience, this concentration is a factor in the overall supply distribution. However, the consistent growth of this category suggests that for every holder who might lose access or eventually sell, there are many more who remain steadfast in their Bitcoin HODL strategy. Conclusion: The Silent Strength of Bitcoin’s Ancient Supply The recent data showing Bitcoin dormant supply growing faster than new coins are mined is a powerful narrative. It underscores the unwavering conviction of Bitcoin long-term holders and highlights the unique Bitcoin supply dynamics at play, particularly in the wake of the latest BTC halving . As Fidelity projects this ancient supply to constitute an even larger percentage of the total BTC supply in the coming years, the scarcity factor becomes increasingly pronounced. The trend of deep-seated Bitcoin HODL isn’t just a meme; it’s a quantifiable force shaping the future availability and potential value of Bitcoin. This growth in dormant supply, exceeding the rate of new issuance, is a silent but strong indicator of the market’s long-term perspective on Bitcoin. It’s a reminder that beneath the daily noise, a significant portion of the network’s value is held by those who believe in its transformative potential over decades, not just days or months.

According to a press release shared with crypto.news on June 19, XBTO has partnered with Arab Bank Switzerland to roll out a new Bitcoin ( BTC ) yield product, marking one of the first instances of a traditional Swiss private bank offering such a service directly to clients. The product, designed for high-net-worth individuals seeking yield on idle Bitcoin, combines the bank’s established digital asset infrastructure with XBTO’s proprietary “Diamond Hands” strategy, an options-based approach aimed at generating yield while accumulating Bitcoin during market dips. You might also like: Bubblemaps V2 goes live on Open Network Romain Braud, Head of Digital Assets at Arab Bank Switzerland, said the offering is fully integrated into the bank’s wealth management services, ensuring institutional oversight and regulatory compliance. “We have seen growing demand from our wealth management clients for ways to generate yield on their Bitcoin holdings within a properly managed risk framework. This collaboration will position Arab Bank Switzerland as the first traditional Swiss private bank to offer an integrated, bank-branded Bitcoin yield product, while maintaining the personal relationship and fiduciary care clients expect from private banking,” Braud noted. The partnership represents a significant step in crypto’s slow but steady penetration into the private banking mainstream. While institutions have dipped their toes into custody and token exposure, few have ventured into active yield strategies under a regulated, client-facing structure. For Arab Bank Switzerland, the development builds on its Bitcoin custody services, which it has offered through a partnership with Taurus since 2019. The move could pressure competitors to follow suit, accelerating crypto’s assimilation into private banking’s inner sanctum. At the same time, XBTO has further cemented its role as a bridge between institutional crypto strategies and traditional wealth management. The firm’s “Diamond Hands” strategy has now gained the imprimatur of a Swiss private bank, a rare stamp of legitimacy in an industry still wary of unregulated crypto products.
