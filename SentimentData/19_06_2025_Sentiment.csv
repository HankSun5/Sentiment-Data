A recent report suggested that Iran had sent a delegation to Oman for crucial talks. However, this has now been directly addressed by Iranian officials, adding another layer of complexity to the regional diplomatic landscape. For those tracking global events and their potential impact on financial markets , including the cryptocurrency space, understanding these developments is key. What Were the Speculations About Iran Oman Talks? Recent speculation circulating, notably reported by Al Jazeera via Financial Juice on Telegram, suggested that Iran had dispatched a negotiating delegation to Oman. Oman has historically played a mediating role in regional and international discussions involving Iran, often serving as a quiet channel for communication between Tehran and Western powers or other regional actors. Therefore, reports of Iran Oman talks are not inherently surprising, given this historical context. The nature of the speculated talks wasn’t immediately clear, but such high-level meetings could potentially touch upon various sensitive topics, including regional security, economic sanctions, or even aspects related to the nuclear program. Has Iran Confirmed or Denied These Reports? According to the latest reports, the Iranian Foreign Minister has explicitly denied sending any negotiating delegation to Oman. This direct denial dismisses the recent speculation and clarifies Iran’s current stance regarding such a mission. The statement indicates that the reports circulating about a delegation being dispatched are inaccurate. Key points from the Iranian response: The Iranian Foreign Minister made the statement. The statement was a direct denial of sending a delegation. It specifically addressed and dismissed the recent speculation. The source reporting this denial was Al Jazeera via Financial Juice on Telegram. This denial is significant as it contrasts with the circulating rumors and provides an official position from Tehran on the matter. Why is Iran Diplomacy in the Middle East Important? Iran’s diplomatic activities are closely watched by the international community due to its significant role in the Middle East. The country is involved in various regional dynamics, from its relationships with neighboring states to its stance on international agreements. Iran diplomacy efforts, or the lack thereof, can have wide-ranging implications for regional stability, energy markets, and global politics. Oman’s unique position as a neutral mediator often makes it a potential venue for sensitive discussions, making any news about Middle East negotiations particularly noteworthy. Understanding Iran’s diplomatic posture helps in gauging potential shifts in regional alliances, the likelihood of de-escalation or conflict, and the path forward on critical issues like the nuclear deal. How Do Geopolitical Tensions Potentially Impact Markets, Including Crypto? Geopolitical events, especially those involving key players in volatile regions like the Middle East, can significantly influence global financial markets. Increased geopolitical tensions often lead to uncertainty, which can manifest in several ways: Increased Volatility: Markets react to news, and uncertainty can cause sharp price swings. Shift to Safe Havens: Investors might move capital towards assets traditionally considered ‘safe,’ though the definition of safe haven is debated, especially regarding crypto. Impact on Commodities: Tensions in the Middle East frequently affect oil and gas prices, which can have ripple effects throughout the global economy. Investor Sentiment: Negative geopolitical news can dampen overall market sentiment, leading to sell-offs. While the direct link between specific geopolitical tensions and cryptocurrency price movements is not always straightforward, the broader impact on global liquidity, risk appetite, and traditional market stability can certainly spill over into the crypto market. Crypto is increasingly seen as a risk-on asset, but some argue it can also serve as a hedge against traditional financial system instability or currency devaluation in certain contexts. What Does This Denial Mean for Middle East Negotiations? The denial of a specific delegation being sent to Oman doesn’t necessarily mean that all channels of communication are closed, but it does pour cold water on the specific report. It suggests that either the timing or the nature of the speculated mission was incorrect. For those watching Middle East negotiations, this highlights the often opaque nature of high-level diplomacy. It underscores the need to rely on confirmed official statements rather than unverified reports. The denial could also be a tactical move, but without further information, it confirms that the reported talks, in the manner described, are not happening. Considering the Crypto Market Impact How does this specific piece of news potentially factor into the broader crypto market impact? A single denial of talks in Oman is unlikely to cause immediate, dramatic shifts in Bitcoin or altcoin prices on its own. However, it contributes to the overall narrative of geopolitical stability or instability. If this denial signals a breakdown in potential communication channels or an increase in regional friction, it could add to the ambient level of geopolitical risk that investors consider. Conversely, if it simply corrects a false report, its impact might be minimal. Crypto investors often monitor global macro events, including geopolitical developments, as part of their overall market analysis. While crypto markets have their unique drivers, they are not entirely immune to the forces shaping traditional finance and global stability. Keeping an eye on significant international news, like developments in Iran diplomacy, helps in building a more complete picture of the global economic and political environment. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty in Geopolitics and Markets The report of Iran sending a delegation to Oman for talks and the subsequent denial by the Iranian Foreign Minister illustrate the fluid nature of international diplomacy and news reporting. While speculation is common, official confirmations or denials provide crucial clarity. This event underscores the ongoing complexities in the Middle East and the sensitivity surrounding potential negotiations involving Iran. For market participants, including those in the cryptocurrency space, staying informed about such geopolitical developments is part of understanding the broader risk landscape, even if the direct, immediate crypto market impact of a single event like this denial is often indirect and difficult to quantify precisely.

The operation is part of an ongoing crackdown on cryptocurrency-related fraud, which officials say has defrauded more than 400 victims. Tether Trail Leads DOJ to $225M Seizure in Global Crypto Scam Tied to OKX According to the DOJ, the funds were traced through a web of blockchain transactions that linked them to an international confidence scam. The investigation revealed that the stolen assets were laundered through the crypto exchange OKX before being consolidated into wallets holding Tether’s stablecoin. “Today’s civil forfeiture complaint against over $225 million worth of cryptocurrency is the Department’s latest action in our ongoing fight against cryptocurrency fraud schemes,” said Matthew Galeotti, head of the DOJ’s Criminal Division. Today, Matthew R. Galeotti of @DOJCrimDiv announced a civil forfeiture complaint to seize $225.3M in cryptocurrency tied to investment fraud & money laundering. The funds were traced through a sophisticated blockchain network used to scam 400+ suspected victims. pic.twitter.com/pBEN8Mjrfd — Criminal Division (@DOJCrimDiv) June 18, 2025 He added that the FBI estimates that over $9.3 billion in crypto-related losses were reported in 2024 alone, with $5.8 billion tied directly to fraudulent investment schemes. The complaint alleges that the perpetrators of the scam used thousands of transactions to obscure the movement of stolen funds. Victims were lured with what they believed were legitimate crypto investment opportunities, only to lose their money to well-coordinated fraud rings. The seized funds, held entirely in USDT, represent the largest amount ever tied to a single crypto scam case. The DOJ said this action is part of a broader strategy to disrupt transnational criminal networks that target vulnerable investors, particularly older adults. “These schemes harm American victims and undermine investor confidence in the cryptocurrency ecosystem,” Galeotti said. The case follows a string of similar actions by federal authorities. Just last week, the DOJ announced guilty pleas from five people who laundered more than $36 million through a Cambodia-based scam . Last month, another federal court ordered the forfeiture of $2.5 million in crypto tied to a similar operation. U.S. Attorney Pirro and other federal officials emphasized the personal and financial toll of these scams. Many victims, they noted, were older adults who lost life savings after being targeted online. “The impact of these schemes on their victims can be devastating,” said Galeotti. “This impact is compounded many times over by the scale of these schemes.” The DOJ urged the public to stay alert and learn how to spot fraudulent investment tactics. Galeotti pointed to the FBI’s online resources for identifying red flags, especially unsolicited investment offers or strangers offering quick returns via social media. “This is not the first action we’ve taken—and it will not be the last,” he said. “We will use every tool at our disposal to ensure these crimes do not pay and to bring perpetrators to justice.” The DOJ has not yet announced charges against specific people tied to the $225 million seizure, but investigations are ongoing. More Than 5,400 Victims Notified Amid Surge in Crypto Fraud Reports by FBI The DOJ’s $225 million seizure follows a wider crackdown on crypto-linked fraud, with U.S. authorities intensifying enforcement in 2025 as digital scams hit new highs. Just last month, prosecutors filed charges against Jeremy Jordan-Jones , the self-proclaimed CEO of a blockchain firm called Amalgam. He allegedly defrauded investors of over $1 million through false claims of major partnerships with sports teams and payment platforms. Instead, the funds were reportedly used to bankroll a lavish lifestyle. “Jordan-Jones’s alleged blatant lies funded his personal lifestyle at the expense of unknowing victims,” said FBI assistant director Christopher Raia. On a broader scale, the DOJ recently unsealed an indictment against Rustam Rafailevich Gallyamov , a Russian national accused of creating and deploying the Qakbot malware. The DOJ seized over $24 million in crypto from Gallyamov, who allegedly ran a global botnet used to launch ransomware attacks. The FBI says crypto fraud is rising at an alarming pace. Its latest IC3 report shows $9.3 billion in crypto-related losses in 2024 alone , a 66% increase from the year before. Ransomware remains the top threat to U.S. infrastructure. The FBI recorded $9.3 billion losses spread across various crypto-related investment scams, extortion, ATM and kiosks, among others, in 2024. #FBI #CryptoFraud #CryptoScam https://t.co/1Eb8KStAHk — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 24, 2025 FBI officials confirmed that more 5,400 people have been notified since January 2024 after being unknowingly targeted in crypto scams. “Cryptocurrency has become an enticing means to cheat investors,” said FBI operations director Chad Yarbrough.

And is the latest Solana (SOL) price prediction signalling a move back toward the $200 range? While traders continue to debate these popular crypto coins, one project is focused on real progress. BlockDAG’s (BDAG) GO LIVE wasn’t just a reveal; it was a comprehensive rollout plan backed by action. CEO Antony Turner outlined a clear six-week strategy to take BDAG from presale to top-tier coin. This includes real-time token utility, working dApps, community miners going live, and liquidity locked across 20 exchanges. The $600 million target isn’t just talk. It will fund a fully operational network with developer support and transparency tools. With only three days left for the $0.0018 price, BlockDAG is betting on execution, and it’s happening now. Ethereum Sentiment Shifts with ETF Inflows and Market Momentum Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing a revival in investor sentiment, with ETH recently surpassing $2,800 for the first time in 15 weeks. This surge is fueled by strong spot ETF inflows, led by BlackRock’s ETH ETF, and a favourable U.S. inflation report. On June 11 alone, net inflows totalled $240 million, sparking renewed interest in ETH. While ETF activity was slightly paused on June 14, the 18-day streak of inflows has set a bullish tone for ETH’s near-term prospects. However, on-chain data tells a more cautious story. Whale wallet activity has dropped slightly, possibly indicating short-term profit-taking, while more than 34.6 million ETH are staked, suggesting long-term conviction in the network. With the Fear & Greed Index still in the “Fear” zone, investor sentiment remains cautiously bullish. If ETH can maintain support in the $2,749–$2,800 range, the path toward $3,000 and beyond looks increasingly likely. Solana (SOL) Poised for a Breakout: $200+ on the Horizon? Solana (SOL) is showing promising signs of a potential breakout, with technical indicators suggesting a short-term target of $150–$165. If SOL can clear resistance levels between $158 and $164, analysts expect it to push toward the $180 range. Currently consolidating near key moving averages, SOL’s RSI shows it may be close to oversold territory, which could lead to a bounce if momentum holds. Looking ahead, Solana’s long-term outlook remains strong, with price predictions for late 2025 ranging between $250 and $400. This is driven by infrastructure upgrades, such as Firedancer, DeFi launches, and potential ETF approval. Institutional interest, including from JP Morgan, could trigger billions in future inflows. BlockDAG’s $600M Plan: Clear Execution, Not Hype At its GO LIVE reveal, BlockDAG isn’t relying on empty promises; it’s demonstrating real progress. CEO Antony Turner unveiled a six-week rollout plan that will transition BDAG from a presale coin to a fully functional ecosystem. The plan ensures that the mainnet will go live at the start of the six weeks, with miners already securing the network and smart contracts in action. BlockDAG isn’t teasing features, it’s delivering them. The roadmap includes DeFi apps, a launchpad, community-driven dApps, and coin utility before the first exchange listing. BlockDAG’s $600 million presale is much more than just a big number. It’s a detailed funding plan that supports liquidity for 20 exchanges, mobile and hardware mining infrastructure, developer grants, and real-world integrations like DePIN and decentralised AI. Unlike many projects that overpromise and underdeliver, BlockDAG is mapping out exactly where the funds will go and what each milestone will achieve. Currently in Batch 29 of 45, BlockDAG has raised over $309.5 million and sold more than 22.8 billion BDAG coins. The standard batch price is $0.0276, but the platform is offering a limited-time rate of $0.0018 per BDAG for the next six days. At launch, 40% of presale coins will be live on-chain, with a running vesting smart contract giving buyers immediate utility. This isn’t just another speculative presale; it’s an opportunity to join a project with a functioning chain and a detailed growth plan. While other crypto projects compete for attention, BlockDAG is focused on execution, making this a key window for early involvement. The Path Ahead Ethereum (ETH) investor sentiment is on the rise following strong ETF inflows and a breakout above $2,800, while Solana (SOL) is eyeing the $200 mark if resistance levels are cleared. Both are still major players in the crypto space, but they aren’t offering the same entry opportunities as BlockDAG. At $0.0018, BlockDAG isn’t just speculating, it’s executing a solid six-week plan with working technology, active miners, dApps, and secured liquidity deals. With the $600 million roadmap in place and 20 exchanges confirmed, BlockDAG is focused on delivering more than just hype. The $0.0018 price offer ends in six days, making now the ideal time to get in before the full launch.

Elastos, known for its innovative work in decentralized technologies, has just unveiled a groundbreaking new asset: BTCD. This isn’t just any stablecoin; it’s a Bitcoin stablecoin designed with robust mechanics to provide a stable dollar value, directly backed by BTC itself. What is the Elastos BTCD Stablecoin? Elastos has officially launched BTCD stablecoin , a digital asset pegged to the US dollar but uniquely collateralized by Bitcoin. Developed as part of their BeL2 protocol – a layer designed to bring Bitcoin’s security and liquidity into the DeFi space – BTCD represents a significant effort to bridge the gap between the world’s largest cryptocurrency and the need for price stability in decentralized applications. The core idea behind BTCD is to create a stable unit of account within the Bitcoin ecosystem without relying on centralized fiat reserves. Instead, it leverages the inherent value of Bitcoin itself, but with a crucial twist: significant overcollateralization. Asset Backing: Primarily backed by Bitcoin (BTC). Pegging Mechanism: Aims to maintain a stable 1:1 peg with the US dollar. Protocol: Launched on Elastos’s BeL2 protocol. Overcollateralization: Features a high collateralization ratio, reported between 160% and 200%. Why is a BTC-Backed Stablecoin Important for Bitcoin DeFi? Bitcoin, while the king of crypto in terms of market cap and security, is famously volatile. This volatility makes it challenging to use directly in many decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, such as lending, borrowing, or trading, where predictable value is essential. A BTC-backed stablecoin like BTCD addresses this fundamental problem. Imagine trying to take out a loan denominated in BTC. If the price of Bitcoin drops significantly, the value of your loan decreases, potentially triggering liquidations or making the loan less attractive. Conversely, lending BTC means the value of your principal could fluctuate wildly. Stablecoins provide a much-needed anchor in this turbulent sea. By creating a stable, dollar-pegged asset derived from BTC, BTCD allows users to participate in DeFi activities on protocols like BeL2 using the value locked in their Bitcoin, but with the stability of a stablecoin. This unlocks new possibilities for yield generation, borrowing against BTC, and stable value transfer within the Bitcoin ecosystem, facilitated by Elastos. How Does BTCD’s Overcollateralization Work? One of the standout features of Elastos BTCD is its high level of overcollateralization, ranging from 160% to 200%. This means that for every dollar worth of BTCD minted, there is between $1.60 and $2.00 worth of Bitcoin locked up as collateral. This high ratio serves as a crucial buffer against Bitcoin’s price volatility. If the price of BTC drops, the collateral value decreases, but the high overcollateralization ensures that the system can absorb significant price swings before the collateral value falls below the value of the outstanding stablecoins. This mechanism is designed to enhance the stability and security of the BTCD peg. In systems with lower collateralization or reliance on volatile assets, a sharp price drop can lead to rapid liquidations and even de-pegging events. BTCD’s conservative collateralization ratio aims to mitigate these risks, providing a stronger foundation for its stability. The Digital Bretton Woods Vision and On-Chain Arbitrage CoinDesk reported that BTCD is designed to mimic a ‘digital Bretton Woods system’. The original Bretton Woods system pegged global currencies to the US dollar, which was in turn pegged to gold. In BTCD’s digital parallel, Bitcoin acts as the underlying ‘gold’ or reserve asset, and BTCD acts as the stable ‘dollar’ equivalent within the digital economy. Maintaining this peg relies heavily on on-chain arbitrage. Arbitrageurs play a vital role in stablecoin systems by profiting from small price discrepancies between the stablecoin and its peg. If BTCD trades slightly below $1, arbitrageurs can buy it cheaply and redeem it for $1 worth of the underlying BTC collateral (minus fees), pushing the price back up. If BTCD trades slightly above $1, arbitrageurs can mint new BTCD using BTC collateral and sell it on the market for a profit, increasing supply and pushing the price back down. This constant activity by arbitrageurs helps to keep the BTCD stablecoin trading close to its intended $1 peg, leveraging market forces directly on the blockchain. The BeL2 protocol provides the infrastructure for these on-chain operations. Benefits of BTCD for the Bitcoin Ecosystem The introduction of BTCD brings several potential benefits: Enhanced Stability: Provides a stable medium of exchange and store of value within Bitcoin-centric DeFi applications. Increased Capital Efficiency: Allows BTC holders to utilize their assets in DeFi without selling their Bitcoin, unlocking liquidity. Reduced Volatility Risk in DeFi: Makes lending, borrowing, and trading on BeL2 and potentially other compatible protocols more predictable. Strengthening Bitcoin DeFi: Adds a crucial building block needed for a mature and functional decentralized finance ecosystem around Bitcoin. Decentralization: As a BTC-backed stablecoin, it relies on decentralized collateral (Bitcoin) and on-chain mechanisms, reducing reliance on centralized entities compared to fiat-backed stablecoins. Potential Challenges and Considerations While promising, the launch of Elastos BTCD also faces potential challenges: Collateralization Management: Maintaining the required overcollateralization ratio requires robust liquidation mechanisms to handle significant and rapid drops in BTC price. Oracle Reliance: The system relies on accurate and timely price feeds (oracles) for Bitcoin’s value to manage collateral and liquidations effectively. Oracle failures or manipulation could pose risks. Adoption and Liquidity: The success of BTCD depends on gaining user adoption and sufficient liquidity on exchanges and DeFi protocols to facilitate efficient arbitrage and use. Smart Contract Risk: As with any DeFi protocol, there is inherent risk in the smart contracts governing the minting, burning, and collateral management processes. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin DeFi? The launch of a robust, BTC-backed stablecoin like BTCD on BeL2 is a significant development for the nascent Bitcoin DeFi space. For years, the vast liquidity and security of Bitcoin have been largely siloed from the rapid innovation happening in DeFi on other chains like Ethereum. Protocols like BeL2 and assets like BTCD are attempting to change this. By providing essential DeFi primitives – in this case, a stable unit of account – they pave the way for more complex and useful applications to be built, potentially unlocking billions in value currently held in inert Bitcoin wallets. This move by Elastos signals growing momentum in bringing Bitcoin’s power to decentralized finance. It’s a space to watch closely as more protocols and assets emerge to build out the Bitcoin DeFi landscape. Actionable Insights for Users For those interested in exploring BTCD and the BeL2 protocol: Research: Understand the mechanics of BTCD, including how collateralization and liquidation work. Evaluate Risk: Be aware of the risks associated with stablecoins (de-pegging, smart contract risk) and the specific risks related to volatile collateral. Look for Opportunities: Explore where BTCD is available for trading or use within DeFi protocols on Elastos/BeL2 to potentially earn yield or use it as collateral. Stay Informed: Follow updates from Elastos and the BeL2 team regarding the stablecoin’s performance and any changes to the protocol. Conclusion: A Stable Future for Bitcoin DeFi? Elastos’s launch of BTCD is a bold step towards building a more stable and functional Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem. By leveraging Bitcoin’s security and value with a carefully designed overcollateralization model and on-chain arbitrage, the BTCD stablecoin aims to provide a reliable dollar peg within the BeL2 protocol. While challenges remain, the potential for a robust, BTC-backed stablecoin to unlock new possibilities for Bitcoin holders in DeFi is immense. This development could be a key piece in realizing the full potential of decentralized finance built around the world’s most secure blockchain.

On-chain data also shows that whales are actively accumulating XRP, with the addresses holding one million coins recently reaching a new high. XRP Ledger Records Massive Growth In Past Week In an X post, on-chain analytics platform Santiment revealed that the XRP Ledger is showing signs of growth, from both a usage and key stakeholder perspective. The platform revealed that there are now over 2,700 whale and shark wallets holding at least 1 million XRP for the first time in the token’s 12-year history. Related Reading: Is There A “Secret XRP Ledger” And Is The Price Really At $1,000? Additionally, Santiment stated that the number of active XRP addresses has averaged over 295,000 daily over the past week. This is notable as the normal daily average over the past three months was between 35,000 and 40,000. It is worth mentioning that the XRPL recorded some major developments last week. One is the launch of Circle’s USDC stablecoin on the XRP Ledger. This is expected to boost network activity given the increasing demand for stablecoins. Crypto analyst Moon Lambo predicted that this would increase the total value locked (TVL) on the network. He also noted how this was bullish for the XRP price, since users will need the token for every USDC transaction. Furthermore, Ondo Finance launched its tokenized US treasury fund (OUSG) on the XRP Ledger last week, which could have also contributed to the surge in network activity. The BlackRock-backed fund will be mintable and redeemable using the RLUSD stablecoin. Meanwhile, Guggenheim also recently partnered with Ripple to launch the first Digital Commercial Paper on the XRPL. Expert Predicts Price Rally Above $4 Amid the surge in network activity on the XRPL, crypto analyst Javon Marks has predicted that the XRP price could rally above $4 and even reach as high as $8. He stated that the altcoin is holding a clear breakout and is getting ready for a major bullish continuation. Marks added that the targets are at $4.80 and $8, marking new all-time highs (ATHs) for XRP. Related Reading: These Factors Will Drive XRP Price To $25-$75 In June – Analyst Crypto analyst Dark Defender recently alluded to a previous analysis in which he stated that the XRP price could make a decision within two weeks. The analyst is confident that the altcoin could rally to as high as $6 on this Wave 5 impulsive move to the upside. He has also previously predicted that XRP would reach double digits in this market cycle. On the other hand, it is worth mentioning that the XRP price has again dropped below the $2.25 level. Crypto analyst CasiTrades had warned that the support levels at $2.01, $1.90, and $1.55 could be in play if the $2.25 level holds as resistance. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.16, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

He emphasizes that his previous projection, issued in mid-2024, delivered substantial returns and transformed ordinary investors into millionaires. July 2024 Prediction Delivered Exceptional Returns In July 2024, Michael identified a bullish technical chart signal , a breakout from a seven-year bull pennant formation, describing it as the most compelling setup he had encountered in cryptocurrency markets. At the time, XRP was priced around $0.50 and underperformed despite positive developments involving Ripple’s corporate deals. Many market participants dismissed the token, but Michael remained steadfast in his conviction. That conviction paid off. XRP surpassed the $0.50 resistance level by November 2024 and surged sharply to reach $3.40 in January 2025, representing a nearly 580% increase. This move marked a return to price levels not seen since 2018. The prediction earned respect from some previously critical voices, many of whom acknowledged the accuracy of Michael’s original call. Last year, I shared an XRP prediction that helped many ordinary people become millionaires. The cabal didn’t like it. They tried to stop me in various ways. Yesterday, I posted another XRP prediction.. I wouldn’t be surprised if they try to stop me again when it plays out. https://t.co/49ZsoVxT1E — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) June 16, 2025 Seven-Month Consolidation Marks a Pause Following the parabolic uptrend, XRP entered a consolidation phase that lasted approximately seven months. This period included a decline of over 50%, bringing the price down to around $1.60. Since that dip, XRP has mostly remained above $2. Michael interprets this behaviour as a healthy correction. He suggests it represents a period of accumulation and stability, setting the stage for the next upward move. According to him, XRP is now exiting this consolidation and preparing for a new rally. Bitcoin Breakout to Ignite Next Crypto Surge In his latest commentary, Michael shifts attention to Bitcoin. He notes that Bitcoin is nearing a breakout above an eight-year descending trendline. He believes that when Bitcoin finally surges past that resistance, its momentum will ripple through the crypto market and significantly benefit altcoins like XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Michael cautions that this upcoming rally could be supported by what he terms a “generational wealth” event, which would draw wider investor interest. Although he does not specify XRP’s exact target, he suggests the movement could prove exceptionally rewarding for long-term holders. Potential Gains and Price Range Expectations Michael acknowledges possible resistance to this forecast but remains confident in its potential. He points to analyst projections that XRP might reach between $5 and $30 during this cycle. Even at the lower bound, investors holding 500 XRP could see significant gains. For example, if XRP climbs to $5, a holding of 500 tokens, currently worth approximately $1,000, could increase to $2,500, representing a 150% gain. Some in the community believe XRP could reach $100 ; however, Michael regards this as overly optimistic for the present cycle. Still, he notes that even speculative targets in this range would have a lasting impact on smaller positions. Michael XBT reiterates that his mid-2024 XRP call delivered transformative results and that he is prepared to repeat that level of accuracy. With XRP emerging from its consolidation and Bitcoin potentially breaking a significant resistance, he believes market conditions are aligning for a new round of significant price movement.

For businesses operating in the digital space, finding efficient, cost-effective, and global payment solutions is paramount. This is where the intersection of e-commerce and cryptocurrency becomes incredibly exciting. Recently, American crypto exchange giant Coinbase made a significant move by announcing the launch of its new service, Coinbase Payments . This development is poised to offer e-commerce platforms a fresh perspective on how they handle transactions, potentially revolutionizing the online payment landscape. What Exactly is Coinbase Payments? Coinbase Payments is described by the company as a “stablecoin payments stack designed for commerce platforms.” In simpler terms, it’s a dedicated service built by Coinbase to allow online businesses to accept payments directly in cryptocurrency, specifically focusing on stablecoins like USDC. Unlike traditional crypto payment gateways that might involve volatility risks or slower settlement times, Coinbase Payments aims to provide a seamless, instant, and reliable method for merchants to receive funds. Key features highlighted by Coinbase include: Instant Settlement: Payments are processed and settled almost instantly, 24/7. USDC Focus: Primarily utilizes USD Coin (USDC), a stablecoin pegged 1:1 with the US dollar, minimizing price volatility risk for the merchant. Designed for Commerce: Built with the specific needs of e-commerce platforms in mind, offering integration tools and features relevant to online retail. Global Reach: Leverages the borderless nature of cryptocurrencies to facilitate international transactions more easily than traditional methods. This isn’t just another button to accept Bitcoin; it’s a structured approach to integrating Stablecoin Payments into the core of online commerce operations. Why Consider Crypto Payments for Your Business? For years, businesses have relied on credit cards, debit cards, and traditional online payment processors. While effective, these methods often come with drawbacks: High Transaction Fees: Percentage-based fees can eat into profit margins, especially for businesses with high sales volumes or small ticket items. Chargebacks: The risk of chargebacks can be a significant headache and financial loss for merchants. Slow Settlement Times: Receiving funds can take days, impacting cash flow. Geographical Limitations: International payments can be complex, expensive, and subject to various regulations and currency conversions. Crypto Payments offer potential solutions to many of these issues. By using cryptocurrencies, especially stablecoins, businesses can access lower fees, eliminate chargeback risk (as crypto transactions are irreversible), and benefit from near-instant global settlement. The introduction of Coinbase Payments makes these benefits more accessible and practical for mainstream e-commerce platforms. Unpacking the Benefits of USDC Payments with Coinbase Payments Focusing on USDC is a strategic choice by Coinbase. USDC is one of the most widely adopted and regulated stablecoins, backed by reserves held in segregated accounts. Using USDC Payments via Coinbase Payments offers distinct advantages: For Merchants: Reduced Fees: Significantly lower transaction costs compared to traditional payment processors. Eliminate Chargebacks: Crypto transactions are final, removing the possibility of fraudulent chargebacks. Instant Access to Funds: Money is settled instantly, improving cash flow management. Access to a New Customer Base: Tap into the growing market of cryptocurrency holders who prefer to pay with digital assets. Simplified International Transactions: Accept payments globally without complex currency conversions or high cross-border fees. Reduced Fraud Risk: The nature of blockchain transactions makes certain types of fraud, common in card payments, impossible. For Customers (Using Crypto): Alternative Payment Method: Provides an option to spend their digital assets directly. Privacy: While not completely anonymous, crypto transactions offer a different level of privacy compared to linking bank accounts or credit cards. Potential Discounts: Some merchants might offer small discounts for crypto payments due to lower processing costs. This focus on Stablecoin Payments mitigates the primary concern merchants have had with accepting volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin directly. How Does Integration Work? Actionable Insights for Merchants For e-commerce platforms considering adopting Coinbase Payments , the process is designed to be developer-friendly. Coinbase provides APIs and tools to integrate the payment option directly into a website or application. The customer experience is intended to be smooth: Customer selects the crypto payment option at checkout. They are presented with a QR code or payment link for the exact USDC amount (or equivalent in another supported crypto, instantly converted). Customer sends the payment from their crypto wallet. Coinbase confirms the transaction instantly. The merchant receives the USDC in their Coinbase account, ready to use or convert to fiat if desired. Before integrating, businesses should consider: Target Audience: Does your customer base include cryptocurrency holders? Accounting & Taxes: Understand the accounting and tax implications of receiving payments in cryptocurrency. Coinbase provides reporting tools, but it’s essential to consult with a tax professional. Technical Resources: Ensure you have the technical capacity to integrate and maintain the payment gateway. Customer Support: Be prepared to offer basic support for customers choosing this payment method. Adding E-commerce Payments via crypto isn’t just a technical change; it’s a strategic business decision. Coinbase Payments vs. Traditional E-commerce Payments: A Quick Comparison Let’s look at how Coinbase Payments stacks up against common methods: Feature Comparison: Feature Coinbase Payments (USDC) Traditional Credit Card Processors Transaction Fees Significantly lower (often a small flat fee or percentage) Higher (percentage + per-transaction fee) Settlement Time Instant (24/7) Days (typically 2-5 business days) Chargebacks None (transactions are irreversible) High risk (can occur weeks or months later) Global Reach Borderless, easy international payments Complex, high fees, currency conversion issues Fraud Risk (Payment Level) Very Low (blockchain inherent security) Higher (card number theft, etc.) Volatility Risk Minimal (using stablecoins like USDC) None (fiat-based) While volatility risk is minimal with USDC, it’s not zero in extreme market conditions, and the merchant needs to decide whether to hold USDC or instantly convert to fiat (Coinbase offers conversion services). The Future Landscape of E-commerce Payments The launch of Coinbase Payments signals a growing confidence in the viability of cryptocurrency, particularly stablecoins, as a legitimate and superior form of payment for online businesses. As more platforms integrate solutions like this, we could see a shift in consumer behavior and merchant preferences. Wider adoption of Stablecoin Payments could lead to: Increased competition among payment processors, potentially lowering fees across the board. Greater financial inclusion for businesses and customers in regions underserved by traditional banking. Innovation in checkout experiences leveraging the unique properties of blockchain. Coinbase is a major player, and their entry into this specific niche of E-commerce Payments is likely to accelerate the trend. It forces other payment providers, both crypto and traditional, to innovate and adapt. Conclusion: A New Era for Online Transactions? Coinbase Payments represents a significant step forward in bridging the gap between the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency and the established realm of e-commerce. By offering a reliable, instant, and cost-effective solution built around stablecoins like USDC, Coinbase is presenting a compelling alternative to traditional payment methods for online businesses. While challenges around adoption and regulatory clarity remain, the potential benefits – lower fees, no chargebacks, instant settlement, and global reach – are substantial. For e-commerce platforms looking to innovate, reduce costs, and tap into new markets, exploring Coinbase Payments might just be the key to unlocking the future of online transactions.

Select crypto assets maintain stability or exhibit measured upward movement amid broader market decline. Both Hedera and Cosmos are showing minor pullbacks, yet they’re holding ground and actively developing. That signals strength beneath the surface. Qubetics ($TICS) is writing an entirely different script. While other projects hold steady or retract, Qubetics is actively solving a real crypto industry problem: seamless cross-border transactions. It’s building for businesses, professionals, and individuals who need low-cost, decentralised value transfer with minimal friction. That focus on function over noise makes it arguably the best crypto investment in this market phase. Unlike predecessors that overpromised and underdelivered, Qubetics solves an Operational challenge in crypto: seamless cross-border transactions. From global remittance firms to regional e-commerce operators, the demand for secure, decentralised, low-fee value movement across chains and borders has never been higher. Qubetics ($TICS): Cross-Border Efficiency and Structured ROI Qubetics is engineered with purpose. Beyond the typical token utility narrative, it delivers concrete value in cross-border settlements, especially for small to mid-sized businesses and decentralised financial service providers. A payment gateway serving clients in Asia, Europe, and Africa can move value between chains securely, with fewer intermediaries, lower fees, and instant finality. Professionals using stablecoins to pay offshore contractors can do so directly through the Qubetics wallet, eliminating the need for custodians. Businesses handling payroll in multiple regions can automate execution across networks. It’s not just infrastructure, it’s functional efficiency. From a presale perspective, Qubetics is in Stage 37, priced at $0.3370. With only 10 million tokens remaining, this is the final entry point before the listing price of $0.40 activates. That alone gives a 20% ROI for those buying now. For instance, a $5,000 investment secures roughly 14,850 tokens, worth $5,940 at listing. Tokenomics have been reshaped to reflect long-term value. The total supply has been cut down from over 4 billion to 1.36 billion, and public allocation increased to 38.55%, shifting power away from concentrated entities and into the hands of the community. There’s measurable upside and genuine utility, which qualifies Qubetics as the best crypto investment for those looking for structure, performance, and relevance. Qubetics Crypto Presale: Final Stage With Built-In ROI The Qubetics crypto presale is now open for direct investment. Currently in Stage 37, the token is available at a fixed price of $0.3370. Over 516 million tokens have been sold, and $18 million+ has been raised. More than 28,000 holders have joined, and only 10 million tokens remain. It’s a capital opportunity with built-in value. Upon launch, $TICS will list at $0.40, securing an immediate 20% ROI for those who enter now. For example, an investment of $5,000 would secure around 14,850 tokens, worth $5,940 at listing — a clear $940 gain at the point of exchange. Qubetics has reduced its total supply from 4 billion to 1.36 billion, and increased public allocation to 38.55%, pushing power into the hands of real users. This isn’t about speculation but accessibility, control, and a quantifiable return on entry. For those comparing the current presales, this is one of the few with proper infrastructure, working utility, and visible upside. It’s why Qubetics is being called the best crypto investment of this presale cycle. Hedera (HBAR): Enterprise Blockchain With Real-World Alignment Hedera continues to be one of the most enterprise-aligned crypto protocols. Trading at $0.1501, with a 24-hour volume of $156.6 million, and a market cap of $6.34 billion, it’s currently down 3.48%. Its hashgraph technology, a consensus mechanism distinct from traditional blockchains, provides finality with low fees and high throughput. That’s why companies like IBM, Google, and Boeing participate in Hedera’s governance council. This is not an experiment; it’s a production-ready protocol. HBAR supports use cases such as document tracking, digital identity verification, carbon offset registries, and stablecoin infrastructure. It attracts institutional partnerships and has maintained high developer activity despite macro headwinds. Hedera still checks key boxes for those seeking the best crypto investment with enterprise viability and strong tech fundamentals. While current price action consolidates, the protocol’s strategic positioning within traditional finance makes it a long-term contender. Cosmos (ATOM): At $4.05, Building the Internet of Blockchains Through Modular Connectivity Cosmos remains a cornerstone of the interoperability conversation. Priced today at $4.05, with a 24-hour volume of $95.2 million and a market cap of $1.58 billion, it’s down 2.16% but remains a resilient force in decentralised architecture. With 390 million ATOM coins circulating, it maintains a mid-cap presence with a loyal developer base. Its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol was among the first real implementations of chain-to-chain interoperability. Cosmos empowers developers to build application-specific blockchains that can talk to each other, forming a decentralised internet of blockchains. It’s ideal for protocols that want sovereignty without sacrificing composability. For example, a DeFi platform can run its secure chain while plugging into liquidity across other networks. Cosmos’ approach remains unique and forward-facing, even if its market value temporarily lags. Anyone assessing the best crypto investment based on modularity and future scalability should not overlook ATOM. It’s not just a token, it’s a framework. Conclusion: Why Qubetics Stands Out as the Best Crypto Investment Today When the market is quiet, smart capital looks for fundamental real use, strong tokenomics, and entry at the right time. Qubetics delivers on all three. With a fixed price of $0.3370, a guaranteed 20% ROI at launch, and real-world application in cross-border payments, it ranks as the best crypto investment . Hedera and Cosmos both remain respected, with enterprise traction and technical credibility. But for those searching for structured gains and long-term relevance, Qubetics offers the timing, transparency, and infrastructure that define a modern crypto asset worth backing. Act before the final 10 million tokens are gone. Miss this presale, and you miss the only built-in ROI.

Qubetics ($TICS) is considered one of the best crypto investment opportunities due to its real-world use cases, cross-border transaction utility, and fixed 20% ROI via its final presale stage. How does Qubetics enable cross-border transactions? Qubetics offers a decentralised infrastructure that simplifies and reduces costs for sending stablecoins or native assets across blockchains. It’s ideal for businesses with international payroll, contractors, and remittance flows. Is there a guaranteed return in the Qubetics crypto presale? Yes. At Stage 37, $TICS is priced at $0.3370. Upon listing at $0.40, buyers secure an immediate 20% return on their capital, a rare structure in today’s presale space. Why are Hedera and Cosmos included as top contenders? Hedera offers enterprise-grade tech adopted by major corporations, while Cosmos supports chain interoperability and modular blockchain development. Both serve niche use cases with long-term demand. How much would a $5,000 investment in Qubetics be worth at launch? At the fixed presale price of $0.3370, $5,000 gets approximately 14,850 $TICS.

The Bank of England (BoE) has signaled its intent to bring about crucial new regulations concerning how banks interact with the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. This move, set to take effect by 2026, is a clear indication that the UK’s central bank is taking a cautious, even restrictive, stance on Banks crypto exposure . If you’re involved in banking, finance, or the crypto space in the UK, understanding these impending changes is essential. What is the Bank of England Crypto Regulation All About? The core of the BoE’s announcement revolves around limiting the risks that banks face when dealing with crypto assets. David Bailey, the BoE’s executive director for prudential policy, highlighted the central concern: cryptocurrencies are an asset class where investors can potentially lose their entire investment. This inherent volatility and risk profile necessitate a more controlled environment for institutions holding public deposits and maintaining financial stability. The plan is to introduce a specific regulatory framework by 2026. This framework will likely build upon international standards being developed by bodies like the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), which has been working on how banks should treat exposures to crypto assets. Here’s a breakdown of the key points from the initial announcement: Target: Banks and other prudentially regulated firms in the UK. Scope: Exposure to unbacked crypto assets (like Bitcoin or Ether) and potentially stablecoins and tokenised traditional assets. Timeline: Regulations expected to be in place by 2026. Rationale: High risk of loss for investors, potential for financial instability if banks have significant exposure without adequate safeguards. Approach: Described as ‘restrictive’ by the BoE. Why is the BoE Focusing on Banks Crypto Exposure Now? The move towards stricter UK crypto regulation isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several factors are driving central banks and regulators globally to address the intersection of traditional finance and crypto: Financial Stability Concerns: While banks’ direct exposure to crypto is currently relatively low, rapid growth or unexpected shocks in the crypto market could potentially spill over into the traditional financial system if not managed. The BoE’s primary mandate is financial stability. Consumer and Investor Protection: The volatile nature of many crypto assets and instances of market disruption (like the collapse of certain platforms or stablecoins) highlight the risks faced by both institutions and their clients. Bridging the Gap: As institutional interest in crypto grows, regulators need to ensure that the bridges built between traditional finance and crypto are robust and do not introduce systemic vulnerabilities. International Coordination: Regulatory bodies worldwide, including the BCBS, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and others, are discussing and developing frameworks for crypto. The BoE’s plans align with this global push for harmonized standards. Defining the Asset Class: Regulators are grappling with how to classify and treat different types of crypto assets, acknowledging the significant differences in risk between, for example, an unbacked cryptocurrency and a fully backed stablecoin or tokenised security. What Might the BoE Crypto Rules Look Like? While the exact details are yet to be finalized and consulted upon, the ‘restrictive approach’ mentioned by David Bailey suggests the regulations will likely be stringent. Based on international discussions and the BCBS proposals, potential elements of the BoE crypto rules could include: High Capital Requirements: For unbacked crypto assets (like Bitcoin, Ether), banks may be required to hold capital equivalent to 1,250% of their exposure. This is an extremely high requirement, effectively making it very capital-intensive for banks to hold such assets directly on their balance sheets. The idea is that for every £100 of exposure, a bank might need to hold £1,250 in capital, making it prohibitively expensive and therefore restrictive. This high capital charge reflects the regulators’ view that these assets are currently seen as carrying maximum risk due to their volatility, lack of historical data in a banking context, and operational/technology risks. Specific Treatment for Stablecoins and Tokenised Assets: Regulations might differentiate between different types of crypto assets. Stablecoins that meet certain strict requirements (e.g., fully backed by high-quality liquid assets, robust governance, redemption rights) could potentially receive lower capital charges, similar to traditional assets. Tokenised versions of traditional assets (like bonds or stocks issued on a blockchain) might be treated based on the underlying asset, provided the tokenisation mechanism meets regulatory standards. Enhanced Risk Management Frameworks: Banks dealing with crypto would likely need to implement sophisticated risk management systems specifically tailored to the unique risks of digital assets, including market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk (cybersecurity, technology failures), and compliance risk (AML/CFT). This would involve new policies, procedures, and potentially technology investments. Liquidity Requirements: Rules might be introduced regarding the liquidity treatment of crypto exposures, ensuring banks have sufficient liquid assets to cover potential outflows or margin calls related to their crypto activities. Disclosure Requirements: Increased transparency on banks’ crypto exposures and related activities will likely be mandated to allow regulators, investors, and the public to better assess the risks. This potential framework aims to ensure that if banks choose to engage with crypto, they do so in a way that does not jeopardize their own stability or the broader financial system. How Will This Impact UK Banks and the Crypto Market? The introduction of robust Cryptocurrency regulation UK by the BoE will have multifaceted impacts: For Banks: Increased Compliance Burden: Banks will need to invest significantly in compliance, risk management, and potentially new technological infrastructure. Limited Direct Exposure: The high capital requirements for unbacked crypto assets will likely make it uneconomical for banks to hold these assets on their balance sheets in large quantities. Focus on Other Crypto Activities: Banks might pivot to focus more on activities like providing custody services for institutional clients, facilitating payments using stablecoins (if regulated appropriately), or dealing with tokenised traditional assets, where the regulatory treatment might be less punitive. Strategic Decisions: Banks will need to carefully evaluate their strategy regarding digital assets and blockchain technology in light of the new rules. For the UK Crypto Market: Potential for Legitimacy (with caveats): While restrictive, having clear rules from a major central bank could paradoxically lend a degree of legitimacy to the asset class by integrating it into the regulatory perimeter. Institutional Adoption Pace: The restrictive capital rules for unbacked crypto might slow down direct institutional investment by banks themselves, though they could still facilitate client activity. Focus on Regulated Assets: There might be increased focus and demand for crypto assets that fit better within the regulatory framework, such as well-regulated stablecoins or tokenised securities. Clarity for Innovation: While rules can be seen as burdensome, a clear regulatory landscape can sometimes provide the certainty needed for responsible innovation within defined boundaries. Are There Challenges in Implementing This Regulation? Absolutely. Regulating a rapidly evolving technology like cryptocurrency comes with unique challenges: Defining and Classifying Assets: The crypto landscape is diverse. Creating rules that appropriately capture the risks of everything from volatile meme coins to complex DeFi protocols and stablecoins is difficult. Pace of Innovation: The technology and new use cases emerge much faster than regulations can typically keep up. Rules need to be flexible enough to remain relevant. Cross-Border Nature: Crypto operates globally. Regulations in one jurisdiction can have limited effectiveness if not coordinated internationally. Data and Expertise: Regulators and banks need to develop expertise and gather sufficient data on crypto market dynamics and risks. Balancing Innovation and Stability: The challenge is to mitigate risks without stifling potentially beneficial innovation in digital finance. What Should Stakeholders Do? Actionable Insights With the 2026 deadline on the horizon, various parties should start preparing: For Banks and Financial Institutions: Assess Current Exposure: Understand your direct and indirect exposure to crypto assets and related services. Monitor Regulatory Developments: Pay close attention to consultation papers and final rules released by the BoE and other relevant bodies like the FCA. Enhance Risk Management: Begin reviewing and potentially upgrading risk management frameworks to address crypto-specific risks. Engage with Regulators: Participate in consultation processes to provide feedback on proposed rules. Evaluate Strategy: Determine what role, if any, you want digital assets and blockchain technology to play in your future business model under the new regulatory regime. For Cryptocurrency Businesses and Developers: Understand the Landscape: Familiarize yourself with the evolving regulatory environment for both crypto firms (under the FCA) and traditional finance (under the BoE and PRA). Consider Institutional Requirements: If your business model involves interacting with banks or seeking institutional adoption, understand the constraints and requirements they will face. Focus on Compliance and Robustness: Projects and businesses that prioritize strong governance, transparency, and compliance are more likely to navigate the regulatory environment successfully. For Investors: Be Aware of Risks: The BoE’s stance reinforces the high-risk nature of many crypto assets. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Understand Institutional Access: Be aware that banks’ ability to offer direct crypto services may be limited or expensive due to the new rules. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with regulatory changes that could impact the market. The Benefits of Clearer Cryptocurrency Regulation UK Despite the ‘restrictive’ label, a well-designed regulatory framework can bring benefits: Increased Stability: By ensuring banks manage crypto risks appropriately, the system becomes more resilient. Enhanced Confidence: Clear rules can increase confidence among institutions and sophisticated investors looking to engage with the space in a regulated manner. Level Playing Field: Consistent rules help create a more predictable environment for all participants. Reduced Illicit Activity: While the BoE’s focus is prudential, broader crypto regulation (including AML/CFT rules from other bodies) helps combat illicit use. Conclusion: Navigating the Future of Banks and Crypto in the UK The Bank of England’s plan to introduce new regulations on Banks crypto exposure by 2026 marks a pivotal moment for the UK’s financial and crypto sectors. By adopting a cautious and likely restrictive approach, the BoE aims to safeguard financial stability against the inherent volatility of crypto assets. While this may present challenges and potentially slow down direct institutional holdings of unbacked cryptocurrencies, it also sets the stage for a clearer, more regulated environment. Stakeholders across the board must pay close attention to the development of these BoE crypto rules and adapt their strategies accordingly. The journey towards integrating digital assets into the traditional financial system is complex, but the BoE’s move signals a determined step towards establishing robust guardrails for Cryptocurrency regulation UK , ensuring that innovation does not come at the expense of stability.

The South Korean media outlet Newsway reported that unnamed Circle executives have held recent meetings with officials from the Bank of Korea and lawmakers from the National Assembly. The parties reportedly “exchanged opinions” on stablecoins in private meetings. The media outlet’s sources said they were not at liberty to reveal “the main agenda or topics discussed” at the talks.

But as USDT and USDC trading booms on South Korean exchanges, some appear to believe that Seoul should let financial institutions use USD-pegged coins in settlements. On June 10, the Democratic Party lawmaker and key Lee ally Min Byung-deok unveiled an amended version of his private member’s bill, dubbed the Basic Digital Asset Act. The revamped bill has several clauses pertaining to stablecoin adoption. The National Assembly held a public briefing session on the legislation on June 17.

The governor explained: “I think won-pegged stablecoins are necessary, and I am not against their issuance. [But] if won stablecoins are issued, it will be easier to exchange them for dollar stablecoins. And that will increase the demand for dollar stablecoins. In turn, that will make it difficult [for us] to manage foreign exchange operations.” Lee Chang-yong also opined that stablecoin adoption could also hurt commercial bank profitability. He concluded: “Once the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, the Financial Services Commission, and other relevant ministries have [reached a consensus], we plan to fine-tune policies by holding inter-ministerial consultations.” USDT Volumes Climb USDT trading volumes continue to soar on South Korean crypto exchange platforms.

While central bank announcements might seem distant from your Bitcoin or Ethereum holdings, the reality is that macro-economic policy, particularly concerning Fed interest rates and liquidity, has a profound inflation impact on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Let’s break down the Fed’s latest update and what its assessment of the economic outlook means for your digital asset portfolio. So, What Exactly Did the Fed Say This Time? The Federal Reserve recently concluded its meeting, offering insights into the current state of the U.S. economy and its policy stance. Here are the key takeaways: Growth Path: The Fed maintained its assessment that the economy remains on a steady growth path. This suggests resilience despite various global and domestic headwinds. Labor Market: The job market continues to be described as stable, with low unemployment figures. A strong labor market is often seen as a positive sign for consumer spending and overall economic health. Inflation: This remains the persistent challenge. Inflation is still above the Fed’s long-standing 2% target. This is a critical point as it directly influences monetary policy decisions. Data-Dependent Policy: The Fed reiterated that future decisions regarding interest rates will be heavily based on incoming economic data and evolving forecasts. This emphasizes flexibility rather than a predetermined path. Quantitative Tightening (QT): The process of reducing the Fed’s balance sheet continues as planned. This ongoing withdrawal of liquidity from the financial system is a key component of the Fed’s tightening policy alongside interest rates. In terms of forecasts, the Fed did make some adjustments: Metric Previous Forecast New Forecast (2025) GDP Growth ~1.8% (Hypothetical Previous) 1.4% PCE Inflation ~2.6% (Hypothetical Previous) 3.0% (Note: Specific previous forecast numbers were not provided in the source text, the ‘Hypothetical Previous’ are illustrative based on typical forecast revisions). The downward revision in the 2025 GDP forecast suggests a slightly less optimistic view on future growth, while the upward revision in the inflation estimate underscores the challenge of bringing prices back down to the target level. How Do Fed Interest Rates Really Affect the Crypto Market? Understanding the link between Fed interest rates and the crypto market is crucial for any digital asset holder. Here’s the simplified mechanism: Cost of Capital: When the Fed raises interest rates, it becomes more expensive for businesses and individuals to borrow money. This increases the ‘cost of capital’ across the economy. Impact on Risk Assets: Higher borrowing costs and potentially lower economic growth prospects tend to reduce investor appetite for ‘risk assets’. Risk assets are investments perceived as having higher potential returns but also higher volatility, such as stocks (especially tech stocks) and, yes, cryptocurrencies. Discounting Future Value: Investment valuations often involve discounting expected future profits or value back to the present. Higher interest rates mean a higher discount rate, making future potential profits (like those hoped for in early-stage tech or crypto projects) worth less today. Opportunity Cost: Higher interest rates make safer investments, like government bonds or high-yield savings accounts, more attractive. This increases the opportunity cost of holding riskier assets like crypto, as investors can get a decent return with less risk elsewhere. Therefore, a central bank committed to keeping rates higher for longer to combat inflation can create a challenging environment for the crypto market , potentially leading to downward price pressure or sideways consolidation as liquidity tightens and risk appetite wanes. Is Quantitative Tightening Still a Headwind for Crypto? Absolutely. While rate hikes grab headlines, quantitative tightening (QT) is the Fed’s other major tool for withdrawing monetary stimulus. Here’s why it matters for the crypto market : Reducing Liquidity: During Quantitative Easing (QE), the Fed injects money into the financial system by buying assets. QT is the reverse – the Fed allows assets on its balance sheet to mature without reinvesting, effectively removing money from the system. Less Money Chasing Assets: A reduction in overall financial system liquidity means there’s less readily available capital looking for a home. This reduced pool of money can impact asset prices across the board, including cryptocurrencies. Bond Market Impact: QT also affects the bond market, potentially pushing up longer-term interest rates, which further tightens financial conditions. Think of it like draining a pool. Even if you stop adding water (rate hikes slowing), if you’re still actively removing water (QT), the overall water level (liquidity) continues to drop. This ongoing withdrawal of liquidity from quantitative tightening acts as a persistent headwind for risk assets, including the crypto market . What Does the Updated Economic Outlook Tell Us? The Fed’s updated economic outlook provides clues about their future policy path and the potential macro environment for the crypto market . The revised forecasts suggest: Slower Growth Ahead: The lower GDP forecast for 2025 indicates expectations of a moderation in economic expansion. While not predicting a recession outright, slower growth can impact corporate earnings, consumer confidence, and overall investment levels. Inflation Challenge Remains: The higher inflation forecast for 2025 is a strong signal that the Fed believes bringing inflation back to 2% will be a longer, more challenging process than previously hoped. Policy Implications: Persistent inflation combined with potentially slower growth creates a difficult balancing act for the Fed. It reinforces the likelihood that interest rates may need to remain elevated for a significant period to curb price pressures, even if growth softens. This scenario, often termed ‘stagflation lite’ or a ‘higher for longer’ rate environment, is generally not favorable for risk assets like crypto. The updated economic outlook suggests that the macro environment will likely continue to be a dominant factor influencing the crypto market for the foreseeable future, driven by the ongoing battle against inflation and the implications for Fed interest rates and quantitative tightening . What Should Crypto Investors Consider Now? Given the Fed’s stance and the prevailing macro conditions, what are the actionable insights for those navigating the crypto market ? Challenges Highlighted by the Fed’s Stance: Sustained Macro Pressure: Expect the influence of macro factors (inflation, rates, liquidity) to continue driving market sentiment and volatility. Reduced Risk Appetite: A ‘higher for longer’ rate environment tends to dampen speculative enthusiasm. Liquidity Constraints: Quantitative tightening means less easy money flowing into assets. Potential Approaches & Considerations: Focus on Fundamentals: In a challenging macro environment, projects with strong fundamentals, clear use cases, and sustainable tokenomics may outperform purely speculative assets. Long-Term Perspective: Recognize that macro cycles are temporary. Focus on the long-term potential of blockchain technology and specific crypto projects rather than short-term price swings driven by Fed announcements. Risk Management: Revisit your portfolio’s risk exposure. Consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to mitigate the risk of investing a lump sum at a market peak. Diversification: While crypto is a specific asset class, ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified. Stay Informed: Continue to monitor key economic indicators and central bank communications. Understanding the macro backdrop is vital for making informed decisions in the crypto market . Inflation Hedge Debate: While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are sometimes touted as inflation hedges, their performance during recent inflationary periods has been mixed, heavily influenced by their status as risk assets sensitive to liquidity. Understand this nuance and don’t rely solely on crypto as your only hedge. This period requires a nuanced approach, balancing the exciting long-term potential of crypto with the realities of the current macro landscape shaped by the Fed’s fight against inflation and the ongoing quantitative tightening . Conclusion: Navigating the Macro Tides The Federal Reserve’s latest update confirms a picture of steady growth alongside persistent inflation, necessitating a continued tight monetary policy stance involving elevated Fed interest rates and ongoing quantitative tightening . This macro environment presents clear challenges for risk assets like those in the crypto market . While the Fed’s primary focus is on domestic economic stability, its actions have undeniable ripple effects across global financial markets, including digital assets. The updated economic outlook , particularly the revised inflation forecast, suggests that the ‘higher for longer’ narrative regarding interest rates may persist, keeping liquidity relatively constrained. For crypto investors, this underscores the importance of understanding the macro backdrop. It’s a time for informed decision-making, focusing on robust projects, managing risk, and maintaining a long-term perspective rather than being solely reactive to short-term price volatility driven by macro headlines. Staying educated on how factors like inflation impact the broader financial system is key to navigating the current landscape successfully.

46306375,https://timestabloid.com/?p=71538,1750289457,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Here’s Likely Worth of 5,000 XRP In 2035",https://timestabloid.com/heres-likely-worth-of-5000-xrp-in-2035/,"XRP remains a widely discussed asset in the cryptocurrency market, attracting both long-term supporters and skeptics. As of now, the asset trades at approximately $2.16, and despite periods of underperformance, many analysts maintain a long-term bullish stance. At today’s market price of $2.16 , purchasing 5,000 XRP would require an investment of roughly $11,000. Over the past year, XRP has experienced a significant increase of 351%, reflecting renewed market interest. Data from XRP’s ledger indicates that ownership of this volume of tokens is relatively rare. Out of the 6.566 million total wallets, only about 541,166 hold between 1,000 and 5,000 XRP. Most holders, over 5.3 million wallets, maintain balances under 500 XRP. These figures suggest that owning 5,000 XRP places an investor in a relatively small and distinct group. This exclusivity is likely due to rising acquisition costs. For instance, in November 2024, XRP was trading near $0.49. At that rate, 5,000 tokens would have cost only $2,450. In comparison, today’s price represents a 340% increase over just seven months. Analysts such as Edoard Farina of Alpha Lions Academy note that as XRP’s price increases, the barrier to entry becomes higher for retail participants. Despite its growth, many investors believe XRP remains undervalued. Market participants like crypto commentator John Squire have publicly stated that investors may regret not accumulating XRP at its current price level in the years to come. This perspective is informed by the token’s rapid rise from below $0.50 in late 2024 to over $2 within a short timeframe. Supporters argue that the project’s fundamentals, along with its utility in cross-border payments, could drive further appreciation. Some experts anticipate XRP eventually entering the triple-digit price range, and in extreme cases, even higher valuations have been proposed. However, these expectations remain speculative. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Projections Through 2035 Several market research platforms have released forecasts for XRP’s long-term value. According to crypto exchange Changelly , the asset may reach a minimum of $54.48 by January 2034 and potentially climb to $89.64 by the end of that year. A similar forecast for 2035 is provided by the analytics site Telegaon . If these estimates prove accurate, a 5,000 XRP holding acquired today for $11,000 could grow to a minimum of $272,400 or a maximum of $448,200 by 2035. That would reflect a return of approximately 4,050% on the original investment. Risk Considerations While bullish scenarios dominate the conversation, a few alternative outlooks offer a more conservative view. Notably, Bitwise has published a bearish forecast, suggesting the asset could fall to $0.13 by 2030. At that rate, a 5,000 XRP position would be valued at only $650. However, it’s worth mentioning that Bitwise’s more optimistic projection places the token at $30 within the same timeframe. The current cost of acquiring 5,000 XRP is substantial relative to historical prices, yet some investors view it as a long-term opportunity. Whether the token fulfills high-end predictions or not, its future value remains tied to broader market dynamics and adoption. As with all crypto investments, potential gains must be weighed against associated risks. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $304 billion, has failed to capitalize on rising demand from institutional investors. As Coinpedia has pointed out , the U.S. spot Ether ETFs have recorded three consecutive months of cash inflow, led by BlackRock’s ETHA . In the past two months, the U.S. spot Ether ETFs recorded a net cash inflow of more than $1.4 billion. As a result, the overall supply of Ether on centralized exchanges has gradually declined in the past two months to about 14.77 million coins at the time of this writing. Why Has Ethereum Price Not Mooned? Ethereum price has continued to consolidate in the last two months despite the palpable accumulation by institutional investors. In the past 7 days, ETH price has dropped over 8 percent to trade at about $2,529 on Wednesday, during the late North American session. How is ETH lower despite a record stretch of ETF inflows? Simple: record futs short pic.twitter.com/JIQcTzSsvr — zerohedge (@zerohedge) June 18, 2025 The main reason why Ether price has performed poorly in the recent past amid heightened demand from institutional investors is the overheated futures short position, especially on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Notably, hedge funds and other institutional players have been deploying heavy short bets through the CME futures, currently worth over $1 billion. As a result, the short bets have been outweighing the overall demand from spot Ether ETFs, leading to a significantly suppressed ETH price.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-18 23:44:13

Despite mounting uncertainty, BTC continues to hold firm above the $104K level, signaling strong buyer interest at key support zones. Bulls remain in control for now, but hawkish macro conditions—such as elevated US Treasury yields, persistent inflation concerns, and geopolitical turmoil—pose serious risks that could drive BTC below the critical $100K mark. Related Reading: Ethereum Golden Cross Approaching – Will History Repeat? The market is divided on what comes next. Some analysts point to strong fundamentals and institutional adoption as fuel for a massive bull run, while others warn of a deeper correction before any upward continuation. Top analyst Darkfost emphasized the importance of monitoring on-chain behavior during such periods of uncertainty. According to CryptoQuant data, realized profits on Bitcoin (7-day moving average) show no major warning signs. Current profit-taking activity remains below $1 billion—similar to levels seen following the October 2024 correction—indicating that investors are neither panicking nor overly euphoric. This muted profit realization could be a sign that long-term holders are still confident in the broader trend, setting the stage for an eventual breakout once macro conditions stabilize. On-Chain Metrics Signal Calm Bitcoin Consolidates As the conflict between Israel and Iran escalates, fears of a broader war—and the possibility of US intervention—continue to weigh heavily on global markets. Investors remain on edge, with rising oil prices and weakening economic confidence feeding into macro uncertainty. Yet, Bitcoin seems largely unfazed. Despite the heightened geopolitical tension, BTC continues to consolidate just below its all-time high, showing resilience that has both bulls and bears second-guessing their next move. Fundamentally, Bitcoin remains strong. Institutional adoption is steadily increasing, and exchange supply continues to decline, reflecting a trend toward long-term holding and off-exchange accumulation. In many ways, BTC appears to thrive in this environment of volatility and uncertainty. According to on-chain data shared by Darkfost, realized profits on Bitcoin—measured by the 7-day moving average (7DMA)—show no major warning signs. Current profit levels remain under $1 billion, a range not seen since the end of the October 2024 correction. Even during the recent ATH surge, realized profits stayed well below the January 2025 peak. This lack of aggressive profit-taking suggests that most investors are still holding strong, neither panicking nor rushing to sell. That restrained behavior is playing a key role in Bitcoin’s ongoing consolidation. Without a wave of profit realization, there’s little pressure to force the market down—yet no catalyst strong enough to push it decisively higher either. Monitoring these on-chain signals will be critical in the coming days. If realized profits spike or exchange inflows surge, it may mark the beginning of a new phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Strong Despite Israel-Iran Tensions – Weekly Resistance Begins To Crack BTC Technical Analysis: Key Support Being Tested The 12-hour chart of Bitcoin (BTC/USD) shows the asset currently trading at $104,292, just above a crucial support level at $103,600. This area, which corresponds to the previous all-time high set in late 2024, has become a key battleground for bulls and bears. BTC has repeatedly bounced from this level in recent weeks, and its ability to hold could determine the direction of the next major move. BTC failed to break through the $109,300 resistance, forming a series of lower highs since tapping the $112,000 level. This suggests a weakening bullish momentum and highlights the importance of current price action around the 50-period SMA, which is now acting as short-term dynamic resistance. Volume has remained relatively stable but showed slight upticks during recent pullbacks, hinting at cautious selling rather than full-blown capitulation. The 100-period and 200-period SMAs, currently sitting at $104,065 and $94,617, respectively, offer additional support beneath the current range, with the 100-SMA now directly aligned with the horizontal $103,600 level. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Range Support – Bulls Set Sights on Higher Levels If BTC breaks and closes below this demand zone with volume confirmation, it could trigger a move toward the $100K psychological support. Conversely, a strong bounce from here would reinforce the ongoing consolidation and keep the path open for another test of $109,300.

According to the analytics platform, those holding onto Bitcoin between six and 12 months are abruptly locking in massive gains at a rate exceeding all other cohorts, raking in a $904 million profit on Monday. “Last week, we highlighted how BTC wallets that held greater than 12 months were the primary profit-takers. But that trend has now flipped. [On Monday]: less than 12 months cohorts accounted for 83% of all realized profit. Six to 12-month holders alone realized $904 million – the second-highest daily profit year to date.” Source: Glassnode/X Glassnode says the same six-to-12-month investor cohort netted more profits two months ago. “Mid-cycle buyers (six-12 months) stepped up on June 16th with $904 million in realized gains. That’s just behind the April top in terms of daily profits – and shows that Q4’24 buyers are now distributing heavily.” Source: Glassnode/X However, the analytics firm says that the selling of Bitcoin for profits is slowing way down for long-term BTC holders. “Meanwhile, greater than 12-month holders realized just $324 million, a notable drop from the relentless profit realization in May or even the last week’s peak of around $1.2 billion.

Ethereum is back above $2,800, riding strong ETF inflows and a fresh wave of technical upgrades. At the same time, BNB is gaining steam with analysts calling for a breakout toward $750 and possibly $1,000 before the year ends. These big names are proving their staying power, but the most compelling upside may be coming from a newer project flying under the radar. That project is Unstaked ($UNSD) . The $UNSD presale is tied to AI agents built for income generation and on-chain activity. With a price under $0.011739 and over $10 million raised, Unstaked could be the best crypto investment before wider adoption hits. Ethereum Climbs Toward $3,500 as ETF Inflows Intensify Ethereum is back in the spotlight as it moves above $2,800, with growing momentum suggesting a push toward $3,500 may be on the table. Daily ETF inflows topping $125 million and continued whale accumulation are fueling the rise. ETH has also broken out of a wedge pattern and is now holding support between $2,745 and $2,755, setting the stage for a potential move to $3,065. But this rally is not just about price charts. The Pectra upgrade, increasing stablecoin integration, and the launch of institutional products are reinforcing Ethereum’s position. Some year-end forecasts now range between $5,900 and $6,700, with the most optimistic aiming higher. With fundamentals and technicals aligning, Ethereum’s upward trend looks far from over. BNB Price Eyes $750 as Bullish Trend Holds BNB is staying firm near $651, and traders are watching closely as it approaches the next key range between $675 and $700. Analysts see a short-term move toward $754, with some setting a year-end high around $1,292. Support near $640 has remained solid, bolstered by strong EMAs and consistent buying pressure. Several factors are contributing to this outlook. BNB’s ongoing token burns, ecosystem upgrades, and cross-chain DeFi growth are keeping momentum alive. Some models are setting the 2025 average target near $926. If the market holds steady, BNB could be preparing for its next breakout in the coming weeks. Unstaked Sells 1.1B Tokens as $5 Forecast Gains Traction Unstaked has officially crossed the 1.1 billion token mark in its presale, and the numbers are turning heads. With over $10 million raised, this isn’t some low-effort meme coin surge. The traction is real, driven by Unstaked’s unique focus on utility through tokenized AI agents. These agents are built to drive community engagement and measurable on-chain activity, something few other projects can offer before launch. Currently in Stage 21, the $UNSD token is priced at just $0.011739. With the launch price set near $0.1819, the potential return stands at more than 27x. But that’s just the start. Long-term projections aiming for $5 are now entering the conversation, creating a possible 3000x upside for early participants. It is not just a crypto presale; it is a tech-backed system preparing for scalable adoption. Unstaked’s foundation is its Proof-of-Intelligence framework, which tracks and rewards the performance of each AI agent on-chain. These agents are designed for use across Telegram, Discord, and X, giving businesses and communities a new way to automate growth while maintaining control. With no coding needed, the barrier to entry is low, and the functionality is real. Unstaked is positioning itself as a next-gen AI project with product-first traction. With 1.1 billion tokens already sold, this could be one of the most overlooked yet best crypto investments before broader attention catches up. In Summary Ethereum’s surge above $2,800 and the bullish BNB outlook near $1,000 are setting the tone for what could be a major market breakout. Both coins are backed by strong fundamentals and ongoing inflows, signaling that big moves are still on the table. But if the goal is outsized upside, Unstaked offers something those charts do not. With 1.1 billion tokens sold, a price of $0.011739, and a launch forecast near $0.1819, the setup is hard to ignore. As Unstaked’s AI agent system goes live, it is not just joining the momentum, but it could lead it. This might be the best crypto investment before the crowd arrives.

But unlike these projects that hinge on broader trends and social chatter, Web3 ai is already delivering results. Currently priced at $0.000443 in Stage 9, WAI gives access to several functional AI tools. The project is confirmed to list at $0.005242. That gives early buyers a steep edge. With over $8 million raised so far, Web3 ai stands out as a platform with real products and ongoing development. Shiba Inu Holds Ground, Awaits Directional Clarity SHIB remains range-bound, holding above its support at $0.0000107 while facing resistance near $0.000014. Repeated failures to clear resistance have trapped the token in a tight downtrend, leaving traders cautious. The weekly MACD indicator has shown minimal change, reflecting a quiet market. However, this flat movement could be a calm before a push. If the price jumps above $0.000014 with solid volume, SHIB may head toward $0.000016. Current chart positioning allows risk-managed trades. Those entering near support may benefit from placing tight stops while keeping an eye on volume changes. The next move depends on whether SHIB builds upward strength or continues sideways. ADA Stays Strong Near $0.66 as $0.70 Target Comes Into View Cardano (ADA) is currently trading around $0.66 after bouncing from key support at $0.65. This level is considered vital by market watchers. A hold here could see a push toward $0.70, while a slip could lead to a drop near $0.60. The asset dropped from its recent peak in April but has since shown stability. Low volatility and firm support suggest that ADA might be ready for a rebound. Its addition to Nasdaq’s crypto index may also lend strength. ADA appeals to those tracking technical setups and upcoming developments. Watching the $0.65 area closely might offer an early position before a potential breakout gains steam. Web3 ai at $0.000443 Could Be the Dark Horse of 2025 WAI, the native currency of Web3 ai, is now priced at $0.000443 in Stage 9. It’s already locked in a listing price of $0.005242, giving those who enter early a major advantage. More than $8 million has flowed into the project so far. Each WAI purchase connects users to several helpful tools. These include a risk simulator using real-world models, a DeFi pool analyser ranked by safety, a contract scanner to detect scams, and many more features designed to aid crypto users. Every interaction reduces WAI in circulation, which adds built-in scarcity to the system. Web3 ai has reached this stage without relying on marketing stunts or celebrity tie-ins. Its real strength lies in what it offers out of the box. If usage grows, its pricing may rise rapidly. Those who missed early entries in top coins may see Web3 ai as their next shot. But the offer remains until the Stage 9 slots are filled. Web3 ai Changes the Game by Replacing Guesswork With Tools Many traders still compare SHIB’s support levels with ADA’s upside potential. But both rely heavily on the market’s mood and future events. SHIB’s progress is tied to social trends, and ADA’s price path depends on regulation and listings. Web3 ai removes uncertainty. Every scan, tool use, or insight burns WAI, trimming supply. Buying at $0.000443 opens access to several useful tools, with a listing already planned at $0.005242. With over $8 million already raised, this is one of the few projects ready to deliver results.

The growing demand for alternative financial tools in post-conflict regions made Binance’s entry into the Syrian market strategic. The lifted sanctions created a rare but temporary legal window for international platforms to engage with Syria’s recovering financial system. Traditional remittance channels in the country remain expensive, unreliable, or inaccessible for most citizens. After years of civil war and under new transitional leadership, Syria still lacks a strong banking infrastructure. However, this fast entry by private tech firms raises concerns about whether cryptocurrency can be a positive force for rebuilding in sanctioned or recovering nations or sets a dangerous precedent where corporations, not governments, fill the power and policy void. Binance goes all-in on Syria with full product rollout Binance didn’t just dip its toes into the Syrian market; it launched the full package. Starting June 12, 2025, Syrians gained access to nearly every major product that Binance offers worldwide. This includes spot trading with over 300 cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), BNB, XRP, SHIB, DOGE, TON, and BCH. They can also use futures trading to speculate on price movements as traders in other regions. Binance’s Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading platform now supports the Syrian Pound (SYP). It allows users to buy and sell crypto directly in their local currency without going through foreign exchange or middlemen. In addition, Binance is running a zero-fee promotion for all SYP P2P trades from June 16 to July 12, 2025, to lower barriers for people testing the platform for the first time by allowing them to complete trades without paying transaction fees. The company also launched its Earn programs in Syria to help people grow their wealth in an environment where traditional banks have either failed or vanished altogether by allowing them to stake or lock their crypto holdings in exchange for rewards. Moreover, Syria has over 13 million citizens living in the diaspora who can now use Binance Pay to send money home quickly and with lower fees than traditional remittance services. Binance also introduced Arabic-language educational content to build financial literacy and bring in a broader population, including those using crypto for the first time. However, Binance says it applies a “robust, globally standardized compliance framework” to every country it operates in, and every Syrian must go through identity verification before using the platform to prevent illegal activity such as money laundering, terrorism financing, or fraud. The company is planting its flag in a country that has long been excluded from the global financial system because the launch includes every major product live and ready for users without usage caps, feature restrictions, or waitlists. Binance seizes post-regime opportunity in Syria Binance took advantage of the rapid political and economic changes that reshaped Syria almost overnight. The fall of the long-standing Assad regime in December 2024 happened in a matter of weeks, and a transitional government led by HTS (Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham) quickly stepped in with promises of democratic reforms and renewed international cooperation. On May 23, 2025, the United States lifted many sanctions that had isolated Syria’s economy for over a decade. This includes a 180-day temporary waiver under the Caesar Act that allowed legal financial transactions with the Syrian Central Bank and various institutions. The European Union also removed most of its economic restrictions on Syria just days later, on May 28, to support its reconstruction and reintegration into the global economy. International businesses saw these policy changes as a rare and immediate window to re-enter a market that had been closed off and criminalized for years. Digital assets and decentralized finance became the only viable solution for cross-border transactions as inflation had eroded the value of the Syrian pound. Many of the population in rural and recently liberated areas had no access to regulated financial services. Syria’s unusually high interest in cryptocurrency and a massive diaspora of more than 13 million Syrians scattered across the globe created a strong demand for low-cost, fast, and trustworthy remittance solutions that traditional banks and money services could not deliver. Binance’s speed, scale, and global recognition gave it a first-mover advantage in a country desperate for financial stability. It positioned the company ahead of smaller crypto platforms, regional governments, and traditional financial institutions. However, Binance’s dominating presence raises deeper governance concerns about whether the future of finance in countries like Syria, Venezuela, or Afghanistan should depend on the decisions of a single private platform. Should one company, no matter how advanced or well-meaning, hold the keys to remittances, savings, and local commerce in nations trying to recover from war, sanctions, or economic collapse? Bitget enters the Syrian market with full services Bitget, a fast-growing exchange known for its trading tools and community-driven platform, recognized the opportunity to tap into a newly opened market. It positioned itself as a serious alternative to Binance from the very beginning. The company launched full services in Syria on the same day as Binance and offered a competitive suite of features, such as spot trading, futures, copy trading, and earn programs. Bitget’s CEO, Gracy Chen, explained that their mission was to serve people who “need crypto the most”. She said the company’s entry in Syria is a commitment to real-world financial utility in countries dealing with inflation, instability, and limited access to banking services. Binance’s early advantage still outweighed Bitget’s aggressive entry, but its presence, and possibly others, means Binance will need to innovate faster, expand its services more thoughtfully, and maintain high standards for security and education if it wants to retain its lead. We may soon see platforms like OKX, Bybit, or even Coinbase looking to enter markets that were once considered off-limits due to legal complexity or reputational risk. They will likely have to adopt clearer compliance policies to meet the expectations set by early movers. Countries with partial sanctions, large diaspora populations, or weak banking sectors across the Middle East and North Africa, like Lebanon, Iraq, or Yemen, may also explore crypto adoption more seriously if Syria’s crypto re-entry proves successful.

In a video interview on Wednesday on platform X, Bessent stated that stablecoins could help reduce global financial risk and strengthen the US dollar’s dominance. He explained that stablecoins have the potential to become one of the largest purchasers of the US Treasury, thereby reinforcing the dollar’s position in the global economy. He said that this could significantly boost global demand for US government debt, adding that there was a strong possibility crypto could ultimately be the key factor in securing the dollar’s long-term supremacy. His remarks came a day after the US Senate approved historic stablecoin legislation . The bill aims to establish a national set of regulations for stablecoin issuers and standards for licensing and compliance. Now, the House of Representatives will have to decide whether to consider the Senate bill or move forward with its own, which made its way through the House Financial Services Committee earlier this year. Whichever of these prevails, President Trump has been very clear that he wants legislation done and on his desk by August. So they see crypto, particularly stablecoins, as a strategic innovation that can entrench American financial leadership in the digital age. Exploding stablecoin market on the horizon, Bessent confirms With major traditional financial institutions poised to enter the stablecoin market, firms like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, along with some prominent voices, including Bessent, see the stablecoin market as set to grow into the trillions of dollars. And this is just the start, says Bessent. Last week, he forecasted stablecoins backed by US dollars might achieve a total market capitalization of over $2 trillion by the next three years, nearly a ten-fold increase from the reported current market cap of around $240 billion, according to information from The Block. Bessent emphasized that the issue extended beyond just crypto, saying it was about constructing the financial infrastructure for the next generation of the global economy, an infrastructure built around the US dollar. Tether, which is based in El Salvador, is the market leader with its stablecoin. Yet Bessent thinks American financial institutions, with an assist from the policy front, will soon lead a world similar in size to the one in which WeWork aspires to play a driving role. He stated that US-based stablecoins could become the foundation of global digital payments. According to him, they have the potential to democratize access to US dollars, increase demand for Treasuries, and extend American financial influence across the internet. Biden gets roasted for his crypto neglect Bessent also used the opportunity to hit the former president, Joe Biden administration’s crypto policy, which many in the industry thought was overly regulatory. Asked whether the Biden administration had “constrained” the crypto sector, Bessent countered that “constrain” was too mild a term; the administration effectively had tried to make it extinct. Instead, he accused the Biden-era regulators of ignoring innovation and creating uncertainty, sending companies, talent, and capital overseas. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) were the target of constant criticism by the Biden administration for their regulatory strategy, their industry-derided “regulation by enforcement” in particular. It left a lot of crypto projects and exchanges operating in a legal gray area without much clarity. The contrast under Trump is stark. His administration has suggested a willingness to work with the crypto industry and a desire to develop a future-focused regulatory regime that safeguards consumers without squelching innovation. Bessent is among several other crypto-friendly Trump recruits to join other officials to fulfill a broader mandate to make the US a worldwide center for the innovation of digital assets.

It’s testing the $0.168 area for a second time since mid‑April. A clear break could send the meme coin spinning lower. Bulls and bears are watching every tick. Related Reading: Record‑High Ethereum Open Interest Signals Institutional Confidence Key Support Under Scrutiny According to crypto expert Ali Charts, Dogecoin fell roughly 30% from its mid‑May high. That slide brought it down to the same $0.168 mark that held as support last April. If prices drop below that level on a weekly close, there are hardly any bids to slow the fall. Below $0.168 lies what traders call a “gap area,” where past buying activity was sparse. That could open the door to steeper losses and fast moves. Cup And Handle Pattern Based on reports, the current chart forms part of a four‑year cup‑and‑handle setup. The lower boundary of a symmetrical triangle sits right where the handle meets its cup. A clean break above the triangle’s upper trendline would point to a target near $0.75. #Dogecoin $DOGE must hold above $0.168 to avoid a 30% price drop! pic.twitter.com/PDhqo7fpcK — Ali (@ali_charts) June 15, 2025 That projection comes from the 1.618 Fibonacci extension of the cup’s depth. Hitting $0.75 would mean a 350% gain from today’s levels. Momentum Indicators Signal Weakness Momentum readings have lost much of their shine. After a brief golden cross in May, the 50‑day moving average slipped under the 200‑day in early June. The MACD line is widening beneath its signal, hinting at longer‑term selling pressure. The RSI sits at 42, under the neutral 50 mark, and drifting lower. Under 50 on the RSI often points to more sellers than buyers. With those readings turning sour, bulls need a strong bounce around $0.168 to stay alive. ETF Decision Could Swing Sentiment All eyes now turn to June 15, when US regulators may rule on a spot Dogecoin ETF. Approval would let traditional money flow in from big funds. A thumbs‑down or a delay, on the other hand, could spark fresh sell‑offs. That decision could make or break the next leg of Dogecoin’s move. Related Reading: Trump Media Makes Moves On Bitcoin And Smartphone – What’s Next? According to CoinCodex data, Dogecoin has recorded 13 out of 30 green days over the past month, with price swings of about 10.57% on average. Their forecast pegs DOGE at $ 0.20 by July 18, a 17% rise from current levels. Market sentiment sits in the neutral zone, and on‑chain signals aren’t flashing clear buy or sell warnings. This week’s action around $0.168 will tell us if Dogecoin can steady itself. Holders and traders should watch volume, weekly closes, and that looming ETF call. If support holds, we may see a rebound. If it breaks, lower levels could come into view fast. Either way, Dogecoin is at a make‑or‑break moment—and everyone will be listening for the next big clue.

The $90 billion Chinese e‑commerce giant unveiled a plan this week to cut cross‑border payment times from days to seconds. Shares ticked up to $33.90 at the open before slipping back to $33.45 by the close. JD Launches Blockchain Payment Pilot According to JD’s chairman Liu Qiangdong, the first step involves a pilot in Hong Kong’s stablecoin sandbox . His team at Jingdong Coinlink Technology wants to show that typical B2B payments, which now take two to four days and carry hefty fees, can settle in under 10 seconds. They’re using Zhizhen Chain, the same blockchain network that already moves about $7 billion a year in supply‑chain finance. JD com Chairman Richard Liu said the company plans to apply for stablecoin licenses globally to reduce cross-border payment costs by 90% and cut settlement time to under 10 seconds. After B2B, JD aims to expand stablecoin payments to consumers worldwide. JD is one of the largest… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 17, 2025 Speed And Cost Benefits Highlighted Based on reports from JD.com, fees could fall by as much as 90%. For many exporters and wholesalers, slashing costs and waiting times could free up cash flow and cut paperwork. Companies that once dealt with multiple banks and clearinghouses would trade directly with buyers using stablecoins pegged to local currencies. That shift could save millions in bank charges every year. Consumer Platform Ambitions JD isn’t stopping at business deals. The plan is to tie stablecoins into its e‑commerce checkout experience for nearly 600 million active users. With warehouses and delivery routes in 20 countries, JD could let shoppers pay in digital tokens anywhere the company ships. Analysts say JD.com may even nudge its vast network of merchants to accept Jingdong’s own stablecoin, helping people switch from cash and cards to a faster digital option. Regulatory And Competitive Hurdles Hong Kong’s Stablecoin Ordinance, set to roll out in full by August 2025, gives players like JD and Ant Group a clear path to approval. Still, moving money across borders means jumping through legal hoops in multiple jurisdictions. Based on industry chatter, Ant’s Alipay arm is lining up for licenses in Singapore and Luxembourg at the same time. Western firms such as PayPal and MasterCard already have token‑based systems under test. JD will need solid compliance and local partners to keep pace. Market watchers estimate the global stablecoin market at roughly $250 billion this year, with growth to nearly $1 trillion by 2030. That surge is driving banks and tech firms to rethink payments. JD.com’s bet is that its existing blockchain, tied directly into retail and finance, gives it an edge. It’s a big bet, but if the pilot proves out, waiting days and paying steep fees could become a thing of the past for companies and consumers alike.

Ethereum is gaining traction from rising ETF inflows and strong chart setups. Meanwhile, Bittensor’s price outlook shows potential for a major rally by year-end. But while these names fight for market attention, BlockDAG (BDAG) has rolled out its plan for one of the biggest launches of the year. BlockDAG’s progress is not just talk. It’s in motion. CEO Antony Turner has launched a full six-week plan. It includes smart contract vesting, DeFi feature rollouts, active nodes, and daily progress updates. Half of the targeted $600M presale is already secured. With momentum building, BlockDAG is quickly being seen as a top crypto contender for 2025. $0.0018 Price Deal Still On as BlockDAG Closes in on $600M! BlockDAG isn’t planning a future launch; it’s already delivering. CEO Antony Turner laid out a clear six-week timeline: vesting contracts going live, DeFi tools roll out, nodes activate, and exchange listings. Everything is tied to a set schedule, and the results are showing. As of now, BlockDAG has raised $309.5 million, hitting the halfway mark toward its $600M presale goal. The presale is in Batch 29 of 45, with the regular price at $0.0276 per coin. However, the project has extended its frozen price of $0.0018 for just 3 more days, creating a final window to grab early access. More than 22.8 billion BDAG coins have been sold, and over 18,000 X1 mining devices have already been claimed. That early traction helped Batch 1 buyers see a 2,660% return based on the current batch price. BlockDAG is also set for listings across 20 exchanges, including five major Tier-1 platforms. Once Batch 45 wraps and the $600M goal is hit, trading begins. What makes BlockDAG stand out is its execution. The testnet is live, the hardware works, and app development is underway. Community nodes are prepping for full sync. Everything is happening ahead of launch, not after. This isn’t a plan waiting for funding, it’s a system already operating. With the price still at $0.0018 for now, this could be one of the last real entry points before the public listing. If the pace continues, BlockDAG may be one of the biggest launches of 2025. Strong ETF Flows Push ETH Closer to $3K Ethereum is building real momentum, and the signs are clear. Over $528 million entered ETH spot ETFs this week alone, led by names like BlackRock. ETH futures open interest has surged to $41 billion, a major show of confidence from traders. Technically, multiple bullish patterns have formed, golden cross, a bullish flag, and cup-and-handle setups are all flashing green. ETH has stayed strong above $2,500, and if it breaks $2,750, it could head for $3,000 or even $4,100. The Pectra upgrade adds more strength to Ethereum’s case, and its dominance in DeFi and stablecoins isn’t slowing. Analysts believe ETH could jump 35% if it breaks the $2,800 mark with enough volume. Although RSI and MACD indicators show mixed signals, the bigger picture remains positive. With strong inflows, steady charts, and on-chain activity growing, ETH could be one of the best-performing cryptos heading into Q3. Bittensor Builds Momentum in AI Market Bittensor (TAO) is building a solid case for a major breakout later this year. The current price sits around $355–$365, but if TAO breaks through the $450–$472 range, analysts say $500+ is likely next. Forecasts for August and September place TAO at $449 or higher, while some end-of-year projections go as far as $1,100. Daily volumes are holding above $70 million, showing that interest is steady. But the bigger story is TAO’s role in the decentralized AI space. Its subnet growth and increased attention from large players are pushing expectations up. Looking ahead to 2030, some long-term models place TAO beyond $3,000. In the short term, the outlook remains positive, especially if it holds support and the AI theme continues to gain momentum. Of all the AI-linked cryptos out there, TAO has one of the clearest paths to long-term upside. Final Thoughts Ethereum continues to show strength, backed by over $528 million in ETF inflows and solid chart patterns that suggest a possible move above $2,800. If momentum holds, ETH could target $3,000 or even $4,100 in the coming months. Bittensor is also on watch, with projections pointing to a breakout past $1,000 by year-end if key resistance levels are cleared. But while those two are setting up for potential runs, BlockDAG is already delivering. With $309.5 million raised, 22.8 billion coins sold, and over 18,000 miners already in circulation, it’s not just talk, it’s execution. The six-week rollout is in progress, DeFi tools are ready, and 20 exchanges are already locked in. The frozen $0.0018 offer still stands for four more days. If there’s a project that’s turning heads before launch, it’s BlockDAG.

(CSE: HODL), a Canadian company that successfully implemented a Solana (SOL) treasury plan, has filed Form 40-F with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company plans to register its securities with the agency and list on the Nasdaq Exchange under the ticker symbol STKE. The Form 40-F is a requirement by the U.S. SEC for Canadian companies seeking to register securities for trading in the United States market. The crossover to the U.S. market will help SOL Strategies grow exponentially in the coming years fueled by the mainstream adoption of crypto assets. Following the announcement , HODL stock gained over 4.3 percent on Wednesday to close the day trading at $2.38. Expected Impact on Solana Market As Coinpedia previously reported, Sol Strategies ditched its Bitcoin holdings to strengthen its Solana stash. By the end of May, SOL Strategies reported an additional acquisition of 26,478 SOL for $4.7 million, thus increasing its net holding to about 420,355 SOL coins. In Canada, Sol Strategies filed a preliminary short-form base shelf prospectus with the securities regulator to issue up to $1 billion in the next two years. The company announced that it plans to strengthen its Solana holdings through leveraging the equity market.
