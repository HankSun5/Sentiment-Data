Stepping away from the helm of Binance, Changpeng Zhao faced legal consequences that led to a significant period of incarceration. His reflections offer a rare glimpse into the personal impact of such an event on one of the most influential figures in the crypto news landscape. What Was CZ Binance’s Prison Experience Like? Speaking with Rug Radio, CZ described his time incarcerated as both “scary” and “extremely hard.” This period marked a stark contrast to his previously relentless schedule building and running Binance. While physically confined, the experience seems to have initiated a significant internal shift. Key takeaways from his description include: Initial Fear and Difficulty: Acknowledging the inherent fear and hardship associated with imprisonment. Mental Challenges: Emphasizing the significant mental toll the experience took. Finding Connection: Developing unexpected friendships with fellow inmates, highlighting the human element within the system. How Did the Experience Change Changpeng Zhao’s Priorities? Perhaps the most impactful revelation from CZ’s interview is the fundamental shift in his priorities. He stated unequivocally that the prison experience strengthened his focus on personal well-being and family, moving these aspects ahead of his previous singular dedication to work. This change is a powerful testament to the transformative potential, even within challenging circumstances. For a figure synonymous with the non-stop world of cryptocurrency, this re-evaluation of life’s most important aspects provides valuable perspective. Why is Accountability Important, According to the Binance Founder? Despite the personal hardship, CZ touched upon the broader theme of accountability. According to reports, he noted that while he wouldn’t wish imprisonment on anyone, he believes it’s important for individuals to be held accountable for their actions, particularly in instances of bad behavior. This viewpoint aligns with the ongoing efforts within the crypto space and regulatory bodies to establish clearer rules and consequences. What’s Next for the Binance Founder? Looking ahead, Changpeng Zhao plans to delve deeper into his experiences. He revealed intentions to detail his time in prison and the lessons learned in an upcoming book. This offers the public a potential opportunity to gain further insight into the mindset of one of crypto’s pioneers after undergoing such a significant life event. The interview provides a brief but impactful look into the personal journey of CZ Binance post-incarceration.

When SUI launched last year, it went from low-key to trending in what felt like a blink. Those who spotted it early turned modest allocations into serious profits. But most people didn’t. They were either late, skeptical, or still stuck debating whether it was worth the risk. And just like that, it was gone—another missed opportunity that blew up without them. If that sounds like your story, you’re not the only one riding the regret wave. Now comes a chance to flip the script. Qubetics is gaining traction as a popular crypto coin to buy before the next big surge—and this time, you’re early enough to act. With its developer-first approach, real-world asset tokenization tools, and a ticking presale clock, Qubetics is doing more than just launching a token. It’s building infrastructure. And here’s the kicker: while the project has already crossed major milestones, it’s still within reach. That window won’t stay open long, and missing out again might be a move your future self won’t forgive. Qubetics Might Just Be the Popular Crypto Coin to Buy Before It Gets Too Expensive Those who slept on Qubetics in its earliest stages are already counting what could’ve been. Back in September 2024, early whitelist participants grabbed $TICS at just $0.01—and they didn’t even need to pay upfront. Since then, multiple stages have passed, each offering lower entry points than today. But even now, Qubetics is still priced at a point that screams potential. The platform has locked in a spot as a popular crypto coin to buy , and with its Stage 33 presale currently active at $0.2302, it’s far from overpriced. Over 511 million tokens have already been sold, 25,800+ holders are in, and more than $16.7 million has been raised so far. With every stage lasting just seven days and introducing a 10% price increase, this is a fast-moving train—and it hasn’t left the station yet. Just to make it real: if you drop $2,000 into Qubetics at the current price, you’ll receive 8,684 tokens. Let’s say $TICS reaches $10 after mainnet launch. That single $2,000 investment becomes $86,840—over 4,243% ROI. If it hits $15, you’re looking at $130,260, a massive 6,414.9% return. This isn’t theoretical—it’s based on real-time, on-chain data from the Qubetics presale. That’s why it’s being widely talked about as the best crypto presale this year. What truly sets Qubetics apart is its real-world utility—especially its tokenization marketplace, which isn’t just hype, but a fully integrated tool for transforming physical and digital assets into secure, tradable tokens. It’s one of the main reasons Qubetics is quickly becoming a popular crypto coin to buy in 2025. A small art gallery in New York could tokenize its entire collection, allowing global collectors to buy fractional ownership in prized artworks. A local farm in India could tokenize its future crop yield, giving early supporters returns once the produce sells. Or an independent game developer could tokenize early access to future game updates and assets, giving community members a stake in the project’s success. It’s an ecosystem that goes way beyond DeFi—it’s practical, scalable, and tailored for real adoption. SUI Was Slept On—But It Delivered When It Mattered Most SUI wasn’t the flashiest name in crypto when it launched, but those who knew where to look saw a winner forming early. Its ICO price hovered around $0.03 in 2023, and while skeptics questioned the network’s vision, those who backed it watched SUI explode past $1.50 at its peak. That’s a 50x return if you had the conviction—and the timing. But for many, it was another case of too little, too late. It came quietly, gathered steam, and rewarded those who took action early on. Since then, SUI has evolved into one of the more respected Layer 1 chains on the market. Its tech stack drew in developers, its user base grew steadily, and it maintained relevance even during market dips. Those past missed gains are now sealed history, and while SUI still holds value today, the window to 50x it? That’s already closed. It’s still a top performer, but the chance to multiply returns exponentially has passed. And that’s exactly why the crypto crowd is now searching for the next big entry—and Qubetics is quickly filling that gap. You Still Have Time—Don’t Let Another Popular Crypto Coin to Buy Slip Away If you’ve ever sat on the sidelines watching others post their wins from coins you almost bought, you know how brutal it feels. But here’s the honest truth: the next breakout doesn’t always come with fanfare—it comes with solid fundamentals, community backing, and smart tech. That’s what makes Qubetics a popular crypto coin to buy right now. It’s still under $0.25, it’s built for real-world use, and it’s got momentum that’s impossible to ignore. If you missed the SUI wave, this might be your bounce-back move. The current stage is still open, but it won’t be for long. Every week, the price ticks up by 10%, and each stage only lasts seven days. The Qubetics mainnet is launching in Q2 2025, and when that day hits, prices are expected to rise—fast. You can still join this best crypto presale while it’s affordable, or sit back and read stories about it later, just like SUI. The difference is, this time, you’ve been warned.

44209711,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157419,1746487207,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Coinbase Issues Urgent Update on ETH Transactions for Ethereum Pectra Upgrade,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-eth-suspension-update/,"Are you an Ethereum user on Coinbase? Pay close attention, because a significant, albeit temporary, change is coming. Major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has announced it will be pausing certain ETH transactions in anticipation of the upcoming Ethereum Pectra upgrade . What Exactly is Being Paused on Coinbase for the Upgrade? According to recent announcements, Coinbase is taking proactive steps to ensure a smooth transition during Ethereum’s scheduled network enhancement. Here’s a breakdown of the specific services that will be temporarily unavailable: Ethereum (ETH) Deposits: You will not be able to deposit ETH into your Coinbase account during the specified window. Ethereum (ETH) Withdrawals: Similarly, withdrawing ETH from Coinbase will be paused. New ETH Staking Requests: If you planned to stake new ETH via Coinbase, this process will be paused. It’s crucial to note the timing for this temporary halt. Coinbase states these services will be suspended from 2:50 a.m. to 3:45 a.m. PT on May 7 . This is a relatively short window, designed to cover the critical phase of the upgrade’s deployment. Understanding the Ethereum Pectra Upgrade and Why it Matters You might be wondering, what is the Ethereum Pectra upgrade , and why does it necessitate a pause in services on a major platform like Coinbase? Pectra is the next significant hard fork planned for the Ethereum network. The name ‘Pectra’ is a combination of ‘Prague’ (the execution layer upgrade) and ‘Electra’ (the consensus layer upgrade), indicating it will bring changes to both fundamental components of Ethereum. While the full scope of Pectra is still being finalized and includes several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), some key areas of focus are expected to include: Staking Enhancements: Improvements related to staking, potentially including changes to validator maximum effective balances (EIP-7251). Account Abstraction Improvements: Further steps towards making Ethereum accounts more flexible and user-friendly, possibly building on EIP-3074. Overall Network Efficiency: Various technical improvements aimed at optimizing network performance and stability. Major network upgrades like Pectra are complex technical events. They involve coordinating changes across the entire network of nodes. For exchanges and service providers like Coinbase, pausing deposits and withdrawals is a standard safety measure during such critical periods. It helps prevent potential issues that could arise from transactions being initiated during the brief window when the network is transitioning, ensuring the safety and integrity of user funds. How Does This Coinbase ETH Suspension Impact You? For most users, this temporary Coinbase ETH suspension is a minor inconvenience. The pause window is short, less than an hour. However, if you absolutely need to deposit or withdraw ETH from Coinbase during that specific time frame on May 7th, you will need to adjust your plans. Existing ETH staking positions held through Coinbase will remain unaffected; the pause only applies to initiating *new* staking requests during the window. This is important Crypto news for anyone actively trading or moving ETH on Coinbase around the upgrade date. Being aware allows you to plan your activities accordingly and avoid any frustration from attempted transactions failing during the suspension period. Actionable Steps: Navigating the May 7th Pause Here’s what you should do: Check the Time: Note the specific Pacific Time (PT) window: 2:50 a.m. to 3:45 a.m. PT on May 7. Convert this to your local time zone. Plan Ahead: If you need to deposit or withdraw ETH on Coinbase, do so well before or wait until after this specific window. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from Coinbase for any potential updates or changes to the schedule. Looking Ahead: The Benefits of Ethereum’s Evolution While a temporary pause might seem disruptive, it’s a necessary step in the ongoing evolution of the Ethereum network. Upgrades like Pectra are vital for improving Ethereum’s scalability, security, and functionality, ultimately benefiting all users in the long run. The smooth execution of these upgrades is crucial for the health and growth of the entire crypto ecosystem. Conclusion: A Brief Pause for Long-Term Growth In summary, Coinbase’s temporary suspension of certain ETH transactions and new staking requests on May 7th is a standard procedure to ensure a safe and seamless transition during the important Ethereum Pectra upgrade . While brief, this pause highlights the ongoing development of the Ethereum network and the steps platforms like Coinbase take to support its evolution.

The digital RUB had been slated to launch on July 1, 2025. But earlier this year, the Central Bank abruptly postponed the launch “indefinitely,” giving no alternative launch timeline. Digital Ruble Rollout: Russians to Wait Until 2027 for CBDC? Per the state-owned Russian newspaper RIA Novosti , Alexey Voylukov, an MBA professor of business practice in digital finance at the Presidential Academy in Moscow, said that the Central Bank will need to provide incentives if it wants people to use its coin. The blackouts across Spain and Portugal are bad news for central bank digital currencies and stablecoins… but good news for cash #CBDCs #DigitalEuro https://t.co/MTlXFb7fwm — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 29, 2025 Voylukov also said that in the most optimistic of scenarios, ordinary Russians will be able to start paying in stores with the digital ruble in the second half of 2026. However, he said that a national rollout in 2027 was “a more realistic scenario.” Voylukov’s comments came after claims to the contrary last month from the finance ministry. The ministry said the digital RUB was “almost ready” for a nationwide launch. Earlier, Interfax reported that Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said that the digital ruble would launch next year. The minister said: “Last year and the year before, we carried out several transactions, including budgetary transactions, using the digital ruble. The digital ruble is 100% reliable.” Siluanov said that Moscow would focus on the token’s use in the commercial banking sector for the remainder of 2025. Some 15 major banks, including Sberbank and T-Bank (formerly Tinkoff Bank), are currently testing the token. However, while Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina has continued to champion the CBDC, the banking sector has expressed grave doubts . Russian ruble prices versus the USD over the past 12 months. (Source: Google Finance) Russians Still Unsure About Digital RUB Citizens have also expressed their misgivings about the coin, leading the Central Bank to respond with assurances that “nobody will be forced” to use the CBDC. But the digital ruble’s future was thrown into doubt in late February when Nabiullina announced a “delay.” Voylukov also opined that most Russians are still very wary about the CBDC. He said: “Firstly, the digital ruble does not provide any tangible advantages compared to existing means of payment. Secondly, it uses QR codes. This kind of technology requires stable cellular networks and internet connections. This makes payment less convenient and slower compared to regular bank cards.” The Presidential Academy in Moscow, Russia. (Source: WL959 [CC BY-SA 3.0]) Connectivity Problems? Around 88% of Russian households have internet access, per 2023 data. However, while that figure is much higher in urban areas, some think that it may be as low as 83% in rural parts of the country. The central People’s Bank of China has attempted to get around similar connectivity issues by launching offline digital yuan wallets . The European Union will on Tuesday announce a roadmap to phase out the bloc's remaining gas ties with Moscow, but in the absence of sanctions it will be difficult for buyers to exit gas contracts using legal options such as force majeure https://t.co/PIanL3c5yp — Reuters (@Reuters) May 5, 2025 Russia is yet to pilot similar solutions, but may look to Beijing for inspiration as both nations look for more ways to collaborate in the financial sphere. Voylukov concluded that it was “most likely” that the digital ruble would “be of interest to people who are already accustomed” to using QR codes and similar solutions to make payments. He said: “Mass adoption success or failure will depend on what advantages the Central Bank and the commercial banks working with the digital RUB will be able to offer people.” The post Russian Economist: Digital Ruble Rollout May Be Pushed Back to 2027 appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|CBDC|Russia,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-05 23:30:00

For readers tracking companies with significant funding and market potential, news from firms like 11x is highly relevant. A major shift has just occurred at the top of AI sales automation startup 11x, co-founded by Hasan Sukkar, who has announced he is stepping down from the CEO role. Leadership Transition at 11x: Prabhav Jain Takes the Helm Effective immediately, Hasan Sukkar is transitioning from Chief Executive Officer to a Non-Executive Chairman position at 11x. The announcement came directly from Sukkar via a LinkedIn post this morning. Stepping into the CEO role is Prabhav Jain, previously the company’s Chief Technology Officer. Sukkar explained his decision, stating a preference for building companies from the ground up and recognizing that leading an ‘enduring enterprise grade scale-up’ requires different skills. He emphasized his deep love for 11x and belief in its mission, framing the move as knowing ‘when to pass the CEO baton for the next leg of the race.’ In his new chairman role, Sukkar intends to support Jain on strategic direction, product vision, industry relationships, and market expansion, continuing to assist 11x ‘into the future’. Prabhav Jain is described by an 11x spokesperson as a former Brex executive and a three-time founder, bringing a wealth of experience to the CEO position. The company spokesperson framed the change as a strategic move aligned with 11x’s growth trajectory, evolving from a single-product company to a platform serving ‘hundreds of the world’s leading GTM teams’. Past Challenges and Strong Investor Backing This leadership change comes after a period where 11x faced scrutiny. As reported by Bitcoin World in March, the company was previously showing customer logos on its website from companies that were not active clients, leading to potential legal threats from one. Sources also indicated that the 11x product experienced issues and that the company struggled with customer retention. Furthermore, some employees described the startup’s work environment as particularly demanding. Despite these reported challenges, 11x has attracted substantial Venture Capital funding, raising over $70 million to date. This includes a $24 million Series A round led by Sarah Tavel, a general partner at Benchmark, and a significant $50 million Series B round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). Both key investors publicly defended the company and its leadership when the previous reports surfaced. Investor Confidence and the Road Ahead for 11x Joe Schmidt, the a16z partner involved in the 11x deal, publicly reiterated his support for the company and Hasan Sukkar on X in March, calling the team, product, and metrics ‘world class.’ Sarah Tavel of Benchmark also posted on X, stating her conviction in the team and the opportunity was ‘stronger than ever’ based on her view as a board member. It’s worth noting that Tavel recently announced she would be transitioning to a more limited role as a venture partner at Benchmark. The transition to Prabhav Jain as CEO signals a new phase for 11x. While the company spokesperson highlights strategic growth and platform evolution as the drivers, the move also occurs in the wake of past operational and customer-related challenges. The continued support from major venture capital firms like Benchmark and a16z underscores the potential they still see in the company and its new leadership team. The future trajectory of 11x under Jain’s leadership will be closely watched, particularly how the company addresses scaling, product development, and customer relationships while leveraging the substantial funding it has secured.

This was the case when, according to a report from Walter Bloomberg on X, U.S. President Donald Trump indicated his belief that Canada’s Mark Carney would be seeking a significant deal during his visit on Tuesday. This simple statement opens up a multitude of questions, particularly concerning the potential implications for global economic relations and, by extension, the increasingly interconnected world of cryptocurrency. Understanding the Players: Trump, Mark Carney, and the US Canada Dynamic To fully grasp the potential weight of Trump’s comment, it’s essential to understand the key figures involved and the context of US Canada relations . Donald Trump, as a former U.S. President and a likely future contender, has a distinctive approach to international negotiations, often favoring bilateral deals and expressing clear expectations publicly. His past interactions with Canada, particularly regarding trade agreements like the USMCA (formerly NAFTA), have demonstrated a willingness to push for terms he perceives as favorable to the United States. On the other side is Mark Carney. A highly respected figure in international finance, Carney has served as the Governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England. He has also held significant global roles, including Chair of the Financial Stability Board and currently serves as the UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance. Carney’s expertise spans monetary policy, financial stability, and increasingly, the intersection of finance and global challenges like climate change. His perspective is rooted in multilateralism and systemic risk management, contrasting sharply at times with Trump’s more transactional approach. The relationship between the United States and Canada is one of the closest and most complex in the world, marked by deep economic ties, shared borders, and intertwined political interests. While generally strong, the relationship has seen periods of tension, particularly during Trump’s previous presidency, often centered on trade disputes. A high-profile visit from a figure like Mark Carney, coupled with Trump’s explicit expectation of a ‘deal,’ suggests discussions of significant substance are anticipated. What Kind of US Canada Deal Could Be On the Table? Trump’s comment was notably brief, offering no specifics about the nature of the expected deal. This lack of detail fuels speculation across various potential areas: Trade Adjustments: Despite the USMCA being in place, specific sector-by-sector trade issues (like dairy, timber, or critical minerals) often remain points of negotiation between the two countries. Regulatory Alignment: Given Carney’s background, discussions could involve aligning financial regulations, approaches to digital currencies, or frameworks for managing economic risks. Energy and Climate Finance: As UN Special Envoy, Carney is deeply involved in climate finance. Discussions could touch upon cross-border energy infrastructure, carbon pricing, or investment in green technologies. Global Economic Strategy: The visit could be a platform to discuss coordinated approaches to global economic challenges, supply chain resilience, or responses to international financial shifts. Digital Assets and CBDCs: While less likely to be the primary focus, given Carney’s and global central banks’ interest in digital currencies and stablecoins, discussions around the future of finance could touch upon these topics, potentially exploring cross-border implications or regulatory stances. The context of Trump expecting a deal implies a negotiation where concessions or agreements are sought by one or both sides. The exact nature of this potential US Canada deal remains the central mystery. Trump’s Evolving Stance: Is Trump Crypto’s Unexpected Ally? Interestingly, Donald Trump’s public stance on cryptocurrency has seen a notable evolution. Previously skeptical, even critical, he has recently expressed more openness, particularly as crypto has become a significant factor in campaign finance and voter interest. This shift is relevant because any major economic or financial deal discussed during Carney’s visit could indirectly or directly impact the regulatory or economic environment in which cryptocurrencies operate. While it’s highly improbable that a deal between Trump and Carney would be solely focused on Bitcoin or Ethereum, discussions around financial innovation, cross-border payments, regulatory frameworks for digital assets, or even the future role of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could feature, especially given Carney’s background in central banking and financial stability. Trump’s recent pivot suggests he is more aware of the crypto landscape, potentially making it a subtle consideration in broader financial discussions. Mark Carney’s Perspective: Stability, Sustainability, and the Future of Finance Mark Carney’s involvement signals a focus on systemic issues. His work has consistently emphasized financial stability, the transition to a sustainable economy, and the need for international cooperation to address global challenges. His views on digital currencies have typically been cautious, highlighting potential risks to financial stability and the need for robust regulation, particularly for stablecoins. However, he has also acknowledged the potential for innovation in payments and finance. A meeting involving Mark Carney Canada representing potentially Canada’s interests (or acting in a broader advisory capacity given his international roles) and Trump could involve discussions on how to integrate new financial technologies safely into the existing system, or how cross-border financial flows might be affected by regulatory changes or the emergence of digital assets. His presence suggests the ‘deal’ could have significant implications for the financial architecture shared by the two nations and potentially influence global norms. Potential Implications for Global Finance and Cryptocurrency While the specifics of the expected deal are unknown, any significant agreement between the US and Canada, particularly one touching upon finance, trade, or regulation, could have ripple effects. For the cryptocurrency market, these implications could manifest in several ways: Regulatory Clarity or Uncertainty: Discussions on financial regulation could signal future approaches to crypto, either leading to more clarity or highlighting divergent paths between the US and Canada. Economic Stability: Deals that enhance US-Canada economic stability or address potential risks could positively influence overall market sentiment, including for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Cross-Border Payments: While speculative, discussions on modernizing financial infrastructure could, in the long term, open doors for new payment technologies, potentially including those leveraging blockchain. Investor Confidence: High-level discussions between key economic partners can influence investor confidence in the North American market, which has significant ties to the global crypto ecosystem. The fact that Trump Mark Carney are potentially engaging in high-stakes discussions underscores the interconnectedness of global finance. Crypto, as a nascent but growing part of this system, is sensitive to shifts in regulatory postures, economic stability, and international cooperation (or lack thereof). Challenges and Opportunities on the Path to a Deal Negotiating any significant deal between two sovereign nations presents challenges. Historical points of friction, differing domestic priorities, and the complex web of existing agreements must be navigated. The personalities and negotiating styles of the individuals involved also play a significant role. However, the opportunity exists for a deal that could strengthen the economic ties between the US and Canada, potentially setting precedents for international cooperation on emerging financial issues or trade challenges. A successful negotiation could bolster confidence in North America’s economic future, which could have positive spillover effects, including potentially creating a more favorable environment for innovation in sectors relevant to crypto. What Should Crypto Enthusiasts Watch For? While waiting for details on the expected deal, those interested in cryptocurrency should pay attention to any official readouts or leaks regarding the topics discussed during Carney’s visit. Specific mentions of financial regulation, digital currencies, cross-border payments, or trade policies impacting technology sectors would be particularly relevant. Observing the market’s reaction to any news emerging from the visit could also provide insights into how investors perceive the implications of potential agreements between these two major economies. A Compelling Summary: Anticipating the Outcome President Trump’s assertion that Mark Carney will seek a deal during his visit has set the stage for potentially significant discussions between the United States and Canada. While the exact nature of this anticipated US Canada deal remains under wraps, the involvement of figures like Trump and Carney suggests topics of considerable economic and financial weight are on the agenda. For the cryptocurrency world, these high-level talks, though not directly centered on digital assets, are a reminder that the broader macroeconomic and regulatory environment is constantly evolving. Any agreements reached could influence the landscape for finance, trade, and potentially the future integration of new technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies into the traditional system. All eyes will be on the outcomes of this visit to see what deal, if any, materializes and what its implications might be.

If so, you’ve likely noticed the increasing attention regulators are paying to the cryptocurrency space. A recent report highlights just how significant this focus has become, with SEC filings mentioning ‘cryptocurrency’ reaching an all-time high. Why Are SEC Filings So Important for Cryptocurrency? Before diving into the numbers, let’s quickly touch upon what SEC filings are and why their content matters. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires companies to file various documents, providing transparency to investors and the public. These filings, such as 10-K (annual reports) and 10-Q (quarterly reports), disclose crucial information about a company’s financial health, risks, and business operations. When a company starts mentioning cryptocurrency or digital assets in these formal documents, it signals a few key things: Formal Engagement: Companies are actively involved with crypto, either directly through holdings, services, or indirectly through exposure. Risk Disclosure: They perceive crypto-related factors (like market volatility or regulatory uncertainty) as material risks to their business that must be disclosed to investors. Strategic Direction: Mentions can indicate a company’s strategic plans or investments in the crypto sector. Therefore, tracking the frequency of crypto mentions in SEC filings provides a valuable pulse on both institutional adoption and regulatory focus. Breaking Down the Record-Breaking Numbers According to data cited by The Block, April 2025 marked a significant milestone: Total Mentions: SEC filings mentioning ‘cryptocurrency’ hit a record 786 . Month-over-Month Growth: This represented a substantial 38% increase compared to March 2025. Year-over-Year Growth: The numbers were also up by 8% compared to April 2024. This isn’t just a small uptick; a 38% jump in a single month is quite dramatic and suggests a rapid acceleration in companies feeling the need (or being required) to acknowledge their connection to the crypto world in their formal disclosures. Stablecoins Take Center Stage: A Double in Mentions The report also highlighted another crucial trend: mentions of stablecoins have more than doubled in recent months. Why the sudden surge in stablecoin focus? Stablecoins , digital assets designed to maintain a stable value relative to a reference asset (like the US dollar), have attracted significant regulatory attention globally. The increased mentions in SEC filings likely reflect: Systemic Risk Concerns: Regulators worry about the potential impact of large, widely used stablecoins on financial stability if they were to fail or lose their peg. Reserve Standards: There’s intense scrutiny on what assets back stablecoins and whether these reserves are sufficient and transparent. Consumer Protection: Ensuring users understand the risks associated with stablecoins and that issuers operate responsibly is a key regulatory goal. Companies involved with issuing, holding, or facilitating transactions with stablecoins are clearly taking these concerns seriously and disclosing them in their official documents. What Does This Surge in SEC Filings Tell Us? The dramatic rise in crypto and stablecoin mentions in SEC filings paints a clear picture of the current state of the digital assets market’s interaction with traditional finance and regulation. It primarily signals: Growing Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC is clearly paying close attention to how companies interact with crypto. This could precede or coincide with increased enforcement actions or new regulations. Increased Institutional Engagement: More companies, beyond just native crypto firms, are getting involved with cryptocurrency and need to disclose this. This could include banks, payment processors, tech companies, and even non-financial corporations exploring crypto for treasury management or services. Maturation of the Asset Class: As digital assets become more integrated into the broader financial system, they naturally become a more frequent topic in formal financial disclosures. Navigating the Evolving Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities This heightened visibility in SEC filings presents both challenges and opportunities for the crypto industry and traditional businesses engaging with it. Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: The increase in mentions reflects, in part, the ongoing lack of clear, comprehensive crypto regulation in many jurisdictions, forcing companies to disclose potential risks broadly. Compliance Burden: Companies must invest significant resources in understanding and complying with evolving disclosure requirements related to digital assets . Potential for Negative Sentiment: Disclosing risks, while necessary, can sometimes be interpreted negatively by investors unfamiliar with the asset class. Opportunities: Increased Clarity (Eventually): The focus from regulators, while sometimes challenging, is a necessary step towards establishing clear rules of the road, which could ultimately foster greater confidence and adoption. Legitimization: The fact that major companies are discussing cryptocurrency and stablecoins in formal SEC filings lends legitimacy to the asset class in the eyes of traditional finance and investors. Informed Investment: Greater disclosure allows investors to make more informed decisions about companies with crypto exposure. What Should Investors and Businesses Do? Actionable Insights Given this trend, what are the practical takeaways? For Investors: Pay attention to SEC filings of companies you invest in or are considering investing in. Search for terms like ‘cryptocurrency’, ‘digital assets’, ‘stablecoins’, and ‘blockchain’ to understand their exposure and disclosed risks. For Crypto Businesses: Ensure robust internal controls and legal counsel are in place to navigate potential future crypto regulation and disclosure requirements. Transparency is key. For Traditional Businesses Engaging with Crypto: Work closely with legal and compliance teams to accurately assess and disclose material risks and involvements with digital assets in your formal filings. Conclusion: A Clear Signal of Mainstream Integration The record number of mentions of cryptocurrency and stablecoins in SEC filings is far more than just a statistical anomaly. It’s a powerful indicator of how deeply digital assets are becoming integrated into the considerations of publicly traded companies and, by extension, the traditional financial system. While increased regulatory focus can bring challenges, this surge in formal disclosure ultimately represents a step towards greater transparency and, potentially, clearer crypto regulation in the future. It signals that crypto is no longer on the fringes; it’s a topic requiring serious attention from boardrooms to regulatory bodies.

44210920,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157445,1746489625,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial SEC Delay Hits Canary Spot Litecoin ETF Decision,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-delays-litecoin-etf/,"The world of cryptocurrency investments is constantly evolving, with the prospect of regulated financial products like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) being a major focus. Investors keen on gaining exposure to digital assets through traditional brokerage accounts have been closely watching regulatory bodies, particularly the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A recent development has introduced a new layer of anticipation: the SEC delay on a significant filing. What is the Latest on the Litecoin ETF ? According to reports, specifically from Solid Intel on X, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has postponed its ruling on the proposed Canary Spot Litecoin ETF. This particular filing seeks approval for an ETF that would directly hold Litecoin (LTC), mirroring the structure of the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs. The delay means that the SEC requires more time to review the proposal before making a final determination – whether to approve, disapprove, or potentially delay it further. This is a standard part of the regulatory process for complex financial products like cryptocurrency-based ETFs, but each delay adds to the market’s anticipation and, at times, uncertainty. Why Does an SEC Decision Matter for a Spot ETF ? The SEC’s role is to protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets. When considering a Spot ETF for an asset like Litecoin, the commission evaluates several factors: Market Surveillance: Can the market for the underlying asset (Litecoin) be adequately monitored to prevent manipulation? Investor Protection: Are there sufficient safeguards in place to protect retail investors? Product Structure: Is the ETF’s design sound and compliant with existing securities laws? Liquidity and Valuation: Is there reliable pricing data and sufficient liquidity for the underlying asset? An approval from the SEC is seen as a significant step towards mainstream acceptance for a cryptocurrency. It provides a regulated, accessible investment vehicle that bypasses the complexities of direct crypto ownership, such as setting up wallets or navigating exchanges. This is why the outcome of any SEC decision regarding a crypto Spot ETF is closely watched by investors and the industry alike. How Does This SEC Delay Compare to Other Crypto ETFs? The path to getting a crypto Spot ETF approved in the U.S. has been lengthy and marked by numerous delays and rejections. Bitcoin spot ETFs faced years of setbacks before finally receiving approval in January 2024. Ethereum spot ETFs are currently undergoing a similar process, with deadlines approaching and the potential for delays or even rejections still high. The delay on the Canary Litecoin ETF decision follows this established pattern. It underscores the SEC’s cautious approach to digital assets beyond Bitcoin, where they have expressed concerns about market size, surveillance capabilities, and potential manipulation. Key Considerations Following the Delay: Increased Review Time: The SEC is using the maximum allotted time under its rules to thoroughly examine the filing. Potential for Further Delays: Depending on the filing’s specifics and the SEC’s ongoing evaluation, additional delays are possible before a final decision is reached. Market Impact: While perhaps not as impactful as Bitcoin or Ethereum ETF news, a delay on a Litecoin filing can still contribute to broader market sentiment regarding regulatory progress for altcoins. Focus on Regulatory Clarity: This event highlights the continued need for clearer regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies in the United States. What’s Next for the Proposed Canary Litecoin ETF ? Following this delay, the SEC will continue its review. There will be new deadlines established for the next steps in the process. These deadlines are statutory, meaning they are set by law, but the SEC has the power to extend them up to a certain point if they deem it necessary for a complete review. Market participants interested in the prospect of a Litecoin ETF will need to monitor official SEC announcements closely for updates on the new review timeline and the eventual decision. The outcome for this specific filing could also potentially influence the regulatory path for other smaller-cap altcoins seeking ETF approval in the future. Benefits and Challenges of a Crypto ETF Like Litecoin’s Potential Benefits: Accessibility: Easier access for traditional investors via brokerage accounts. Convenience: Eliminates the need for self-custody of crypto. Liquidity: ETFs typically trade on major exchanges, offering liquidity. Regulatory Oversight: Operates within a regulated framework, potentially offering more investor protection than unregulated exchanges. Challenges and Considerations: Regulatory Hurdles: As seen with this delay, getting approval is a significant challenge. Tracking Error: The ETF’s performance might not perfectly mirror the underlying asset’s price due to fees and operational factors. Fees: ETFs charge management fees, which can impact overall returns compared to direct ownership. Limited Control: Investors don’t directly own the underlying Litecoin, limiting options like staking or using it in DeFi protocols. Actionable Insight: Staying Informed For investors tracking the potential of a Litecoin ETF or other crypto investment products, the key action is to stay informed directly from official sources. Rely on announcements from the SEC and the ETF filers themselves rather than unverified reports for critical timeline information and decisions. Understanding the regulatory process provides valuable context for interpreting delays and potential outcomes. Summary: The Waiting Game Continues The U.S. SEC’s decision to delay the proposed Canary Spot Litecoin ETF decision is a reminder that the regulatory journey for cryptocurrency investment products, particularly those tracking assets other than Bitcoin, remains ongoing and complex. While the delay is not a rejection, it signifies that the commission is taking its time to thoroughly evaluate the proposal.

Unstaked, a new crypto to invest in, is drawing interest not because of market swings but because of structure. Its AI agent-based platform provides a clear approach to on-chain interaction, linking rewards to actual performance instead of price moves. With its focus on use-case delivery, clear token design, and a presale that’s gaining speed, Unstaked brings a different kind of value. It may be the most under-the-radar project with the biggest potential right now. Ethereum (ETH) Activity Slows as Whales Wait at Technical Crossroads Ethereum (ETH) whales are stepping back as the asset nears a critical technical point. The volume of large ETH transactions between $1 million and $10 million has fallen recently, showing that major players are hesitant. This trend extends to mid-sized moves too, with activity in the $100,000 to $1 million range also decreasing, which points to rising caution. Traders are paying attention to an ascending triangle pattern forming on the four-hour chart. A move above $1,840 could open the door for further gains. However, if the price slips below $1,690, the tone may shift toward selling pressure. Despite the quiet spell, Ethereum is still holding above the 200 EMA, a long-term support level for many technical watchers. With volumes tapering off and investors becoming more selective, ETH whales might be waiting for a stronger signal. The coming trading days may offer more clarity on which direction Ethereum will take next. Sui (SUI) Price Gains Point to $4.40 as Bullish Setup Builds Sui (SUI) is drawing a wave of attention with its latest price increase, and traders are now watching for a possible push toward $4.40. The token has already passed its $3.45 resistance level, and this move is backed by higher volume and positive signals from the RSI. The near-term test lies at $3.80, where another breakout could confirm further strength. This suggests a 26% upside from current prices, reinforcing positive market sentiment. The MACD also supports this view, showing growing interest from buyers and a potential continuation of the trend. As long as support near $3.20 holds, the setup looks ready for another upward push. Analysts believe $4.40 is within reach if momentum remains steady. With these indicators lining up, the recent Sui price surge is shaping up to be one of the more important developments this week. Could Unstaked Be the Next 27x Token? Unstaked is emerging as a new crypto to invest in, with early signs suggesting that a 27x return might not be out of reach. The platform brings together two of the most talked-about trends in blockchain AI and Web3 into one token-powered system. Its network is designed around autonomous agents that support real community growth. At its core is a “Proof of Intelligence” model that links each agent’s actions to on-chain data, offering rewards based on verified outcomes. This setup ties the token’s value to engagement rather than speculation. Now in stage 2 of its ai crypto presale and priced at $0.006695, Unstaked has raised nearly $1 million in just a few days. The expected launch price is $0.1819. If the AI and Web3 momentum continues, early participants could potentially see the price reach $0.67 to $0.70, pointing to a possible 27x return. What separates Unstaked from others is its focus on use, not just price. Its AI agents are expected to go live once the token launches, giving users the ability to earn $UNSD by deploying agents across platforms like X and Telegram. Along with a plan for decentralized governance and a public-first release, this adds utility to the token’s base. As interest in AI-linked platforms grows, Unstaked shows signs of being an early project with clear function and open metrics, making it one to watch for anyone seeking a real breakout opportunity. Why Unstaked May Outshine Popular Market Names Market trends often catch attention, but long-term value depends on use. Ethereum’s whale slowdown and Sui’s price moves show short-term momentum, but that alone may not bring lasting growth. Unstaked takes a different approach. It is building a space where performance earns rewards and AI agents support on-chain activity in a meaningful way. With its ai crypto presale still early and core features set for release at launch, the project is aiming to deliver more than a temporary jump. For those searching for a new crypto to invest in , Unstaked offers a model driven by structure, purpose, and early traction. That makes it stand out in a market where real action matters more than noise.

In a new report, Santiment says that memecoin mindshare is making a comeback despite the recent high-profile collapses of several assets in the sector. Santiment says that the rise in memecoin-centered discussions on social media suggests an increase in speculation and short-term investing mentality. “Memecoins, in particular, are once again gaining considerable attention. Online discussions about these high-risk tokens have proliferated as traders embrace a ‘gamble’ mindset, rather than a calculated investment approach. Notice how social volume has been creeping up for top market cap meme coins, and declining for layer-1s and layer-2s. This is a telltale sign that traders are increasingly investing based solely on speculation and short-term gains.” Source: Santiment Santiment says that currently, the rise in online discussions about altcoins, altseasons and bull markets suggests that the crypto market will likely witness a correction. “Historically, the best times to invest in altcoins have been when crowd interest is between low and practically nonexistent. But at this current stage, with buzzwords like ‘altcoin,’ ‘altseason’ and ‘bull cycle’ trending, caution is advised, with retailers looking for any opportunity to buy minor dips. Markets move opposite to crowd expectations, so when the crowd’s excitement peaks, it often signals that prices are nearing exhaustion.” Source: Santiment Read the full Santiment report here .

While well-known names like Bittensor (TAO), Render (RNDR), and NEAR Protocol (NEAR) are gaining traction, a rising project called BlockDAG is quickly becoming a standout. With solid foundations and strong presale performance, it’s drawing attention from across the crypto world. These projects are doing more than just gaining short-term attention. They are showcasing long-term use cases, from artificial intelligence to decentralized computing and scalable smart contracts. The stage is now set for a major move in crypto, and this shortlist captures the top trending crypto performers to follow closely. Bittensor (TAO): Technical Setup Looks Strong Bittensor (TAO) continues to hold its spot among the top trending crypto names this month. With a current price near $362.19 and a 7.72% daily jump, TAO has outpaced Bitcoin. The formation of a bullish pennant suggests a likely breakout, possibly taking the coin up to $451.07. That’s a projected 30% jump in the short term. Longer-term views are even more promising, with estimates ranging from $365 to $1,718 by the end of 2025. That’s a potential return of over 370%. Despite a neutral overall sentiment, price activity suggests growing market trust. As an AI-driven blockchain, TAO offers a unique angle. Its blend of deep learning and decentralized networks keeps it in the spotlight as one of the top trending crypto contenders in 2025. Render (RNDR): Fueling Decentralized Creativity Render (RNDR) has emerged as a key player in creative tech and decentralized GPU rendering. Its current price of $4.47 and a 12% rise over the past week puts it high on the list of top trending crypto projects. A sharp rise in trading volume by 79% shows increasing interest. The technical chart reveals a bullish reversal, with swing targets at $5.22, $6.21, and even beyond $7. Analysts expect RNDR to potentially reach $10.13 this year, delivering returns close to 50%. The project also shows a double-bottom pattern, which adds weight to its upward momentum. Render’s practical use in graphics, AI, and cloud computing gives it staying power in the 2025 crypto landscape. It’s one to watch as a top trending crypto with real-world purpose. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Bullish Pattern in Play NEAR Protocol has re-entered the top trending crypto charts thanks to a rebound from long-term support. At a current price of $2.38, the coin is forming an ascending triangle, suggesting an upcoming breakout if it crosses the $2.69 resistance line. Short-term price targets are set between $7 and $8, while the most bullish projections aim for $13. The RSI indicates a possible overbought condition, so short-term caution is advised. Still, exchange outflows and activity between $2.20 and $2.50 hint at rising demand. NEAR’s edge comes from its strong developer tools and efforts to boost scalability. As DeFi and cross-chain applications grow, NEAR could turn into a dark horse among top trending crypto choices in the coming months. BlockDAG Presale Surges Past $226M With Limited-Time Offer While other top trending crypto projects ride market waves, BlockDAG is building solid ground. Its presale has now raised over $226 million, with more than 19.7 billion coins sold. Batch 28 is priced at $0.0262, reflecting a profit of 2,520% from its start. A limited-time entry price of $0.0019 is available until May 13, before the launch price hits $0.05. BlockDAG ’s network offers full EVM support, letting Ethereum-based dApps migrate seamlessly. It uses DAG-based architecture to improve speed and scalability. More than 17,310 mining rigs have already been sold, and miner sales have topped $6.9 million. The project’s user base is also growing rapidly, with over 1 million X1 app users. Strategic tech partnerships with HackerEarth and SpaceDev strengthen its developer resources. It has secured listings on 10 centralized exchanges, creating a ready launchpad for mass adoption. BlockDAG isn’t chasing trends, it’s setting them. Its early infrastructure, massive user base, and unique offer price make it a standout in the current market. Among all top trending crypto projects, this one is building the strongest case for long-term relevance. Final Thoughts: Who Leads the Top Trending Crypto Race? As 2025 unfolds, coins like Bittensor, Render, and NEAR show why they remain top trending crypto players. Each has carved out a strong niche backed by real-world applications and solid technical charts. But BlockDAG is making a case of its own. With over $226 million raised and powerful features ready to go, it could leap ahead of more established names. It blends early access with real tech, giving it a strong shot at leading this year’s crypto race.

One remarkable project taking cues from Avalanche’s brilliance is Ruvi AI, which aims to redefine blockchain’s potential by integrating it seamlessly with artificial intelligence (AI). Promising to reshape industries and provide unparalleled opportunities, Ruvi AI is a platform to watch. What is Ruvi AI? Ruvi AI brings a revolutionary approach to blockchain by marrying its transparency and security with the problem-solving power of AI. This unique blend creates a platform capable of addressing real-world problems, from enhancing supply chain efficiency to fraud detection and beyond. With blockchain ensuring immutable, safe, and transparent transactions, Ruvi AI adds value by harnessing AI to analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and predict outcomes. Industries like logistics, finance, and healthcare can benefit greatly from Ruvi AI’s efficient solutions, which streamline operations and improve decision-making. Unlike many blockchain-centered projects, Ruvi AI focuses on being user-friendly. It offers tools that allow businesses to integrate its technology smoothly without disrupting their existing workflows. By prioritizing usability and practical outcomes, Ruvi AI stands out as more than just another innovation in the blockchain field. Historic Presale Achievements The excitement around Ruvi AI’s potential is already evident in its presale performance. Within days, the platform sold over 10 million tokens, raising more than $100,000. This achievement reflects investor confidence in Ruvi AI’s vision. Currently, Ruvi tokens are priced at just $0.01 in Phase 1. Early adopters enjoy access at this highly competitive rate, but time is of the essence. Phase 2 will see a 50% price increase, boosting token value to $0.015. This structured growth strategy mirrors Ruvi AI’s anticipated rise in popularity and demand. Adding credibility to its impressive presale progress, Ruvi AI has launched a beta version of its platform. By offering this early access, Ruvi AI demonstrates transparency and a commitment to its roadmap. The beta allows users to experience firsthand how blockchain and AI integrate seamlessly to solve challenges. VIP Tiers for Every Investor Ruvi AI further distinguishes itself through its rewarding VIP-tier program, designed to accommodate a diverse range of investors while offering substantial bonuses. Two notable tiers, VIP Tier 3 and VIP Tier 5, showcase the platform’s commitment to maximizing investor incentives. VIP Tier 2 Ideal for entry level investors, VIP Tier 2 requires holders to accumulate at least 50,000 RUVI tokens, which amounts to a $500 investment during Phase 1’s pricing of $0.01 per token. Participants in this tier earn a 40% bonus, adding 20,000 additional tokens to their holdings. This brings the total to 70,000 RUVI tokens. At the listing price of $0.07, the investment would be worth $4,900, and when Ruvi AI achieves its projected $1 valuation, the total value could soar to an eye-popping $70,000. VIP Tier 5 For committed investors seeking maximum rewards, VIP Tier 5 offers an unmatched opportunity. A minimum investment of 500,000 RUVI tokens, or $5,000, qualifies users for this tier during Phase 1. What sets VIP Tier 5 apart is its 100% bonus, doubling the investor’s holdings to 1,000,000 tokens. At a listing price of $0.07, this amounts to $70,000. Should Ruvi AI’s valuation reach $1 per token, this investment could yield an extraordinary $1,000,000, showcasing the immense potential of deep engagement with Ruvi AI. Leaderboard Benefits for Early Adopters Ruvi AI’s presale doesn’t stop at boosting token holders directly. The platform has introduced a leaderboard rewards system to incentivize and recognize its top contributors. The Top10 contributors during the presale phase will each receive 500,000 RUVI tokens. At the conservative listing price of $0.07, this amount is worth $35,000. If Ruvi AI achieves its $1 valuation projection, this becomes a life-changing $500,000 reward. Similarly, the Top 50 contributors are awarded 250,000 RUVI tokens each. At $0.07, this reward equals $17,500, which would rise to $250,000 when the $1 valuation is met. Even those who secure a position in the Top 1000 receive 20,000 tokens, valued at $20,000 post listing.With such exciting incentives, Ruvi AI not only drives participation but also creates a strong sense of community and shared success. Pioneering the Future of Blockchain and AI Ruvi AI is more than an innovative project; it is a bold leap toward a future where blockchain meets AI in ways that enhance productivity and transparency. Its seamless integration of these two disruptive technologies promises to redefine how industries function and how investors benefit. Whether it’s through its record-breaking presale, the accessible beta platform, or its lucrative reward tiers, Ruvi AI offers a unique opportunity at the cutting edge of technology and finance. For early investors and forward-thinking businesses, joining Ruvi AI’s movement represents a chance not just to adopt but to lead in this groundbreaking space.

At this moment, sharp investors are monitoring five names that may drive the 2025 narrative: XRP , Cardano , Bitcoin , Ethereum , and the rising force that is MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . While the dominant players continue to show resilience, it’s newer tokens like MAGACOINFINANCE that offer the outsized upside potential. The early-stage window is narrowing—and those who’ve played this game before know that timing can define outcomes. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Moving From Undiscovered to Unmissable Plenty of projects launch with noise and vanish. Not this one. MAGACOINFINANCE is methodically building momentum—organically and strategically. Wallet growth is climbing. The community is expanding. And deeper circles of capital are quietly accumulating before wider awareness takes hold. This isn’t hype—it’s real structure, planned expansion, and long-term alignment. The project is walking the same early path as many of today’s leaders did in their first cycles: clear goals, consistent updates, and a growing base of long-term holders—not quick flippers. Other Movers Gaining Traction: Solana, Toncoin, Optimism, and Sei Solana is rising again, driven by high-speed functionality and widespread dApp integration. Toncoin is gaining fast in the mobile-first blockchain segment, unlocking access for non-native users with simplicity. Optimism leads the way in Ethereum’s Layer-2 growth story, improving speed and cost without compromise. Sei is positioning itself around trader-optimized infrastructure, appealing to users focused on performance and reliability. These are all strong bets—but for asymmetric upside from an early starting point, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining the edge. Final Word From $850 to $880K ? While ambitious, that’s exactly how major wins have happened in crypto. Bitcoin , XRP , Cardano , and Ethereum are well-established anchors in the space.

44211222,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157447,1746490222,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Walkout: House Democrats Boycott Key Congressional Hearing on Crypto Regulation Over Trump Ties,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/democrats-boycott-crypto-hearing/,"A political storm is brewing on Capitol Hill, set to impact the future of crypto regulation in the United United States. In a dramatic move, House Democrats are reportedly planning a walkout from a crucial congressional hearing focused on digital asset legislation. This unprecedented action highlights the deep political divisions currently shaping the debate around cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Why the Planned Walkout by House Democrats? The planned walkout by House Democrats stems from significant concerns regarding former President Donald Trump’s increasing involvement and influence in the digital asset space. Led by figures like Rep. Maxine Waters, Democrats are voicing apprehension that the legislative process could be unduly influenced by interests tied to Mr. Trump. According to reports confirmed by a Democratic source, the intention is not merely to abstain but to stage a counter-hearing. This suggests a desire to control the narrative and present their own perspective on how crypto regulation should proceed, separate from the main committee proceedings they view with suspicion. The core of the Democrats’ concern appears to be the potential for the regulatory framework to be shaped in a way that benefits specific individuals or entities connected to the former president, rather than establishing clear, fair rules for the entire industry and protecting consumers. Navigating the Political Divide in a Congressional Hearing The scheduled congressional hearing is hosted by the House Financial Services Committee, chaired by Republican French Hill. Chairman Hill has publicly urged his Democratic colleagues to participate, emphasizing that bipartisan discussions on crypto legislation have been ongoing. However, the Democrats’ planned boycott signals that, despite some areas of agreement, fundamental distrust and political maneuvering are overriding collaborative efforts. The committee’s work is critical as it involves reviewing a draft bill aimed at creating a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. This clash underscores the challenges inherent in legislating a complex and rapidly evolving technology like cryptocurrency within a highly polarized political environment. Reaching consensus on issues ranging from consumer protection and market integrity to innovation and national security is proving difficult. Examining the Draft Crypto Regulation Bill and Stablecoin Legislation The congressional hearing is specifically set to review a draft bill. While details of this particular draft are central to the hearing, it’s important to view it within the broader context of ongoing legislative efforts. For instance, recent attempts to pass dedicated stablecoin legislation have also faced significant hurdles and criticism, particularly from Democrats. Stablecoins, digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, are seen by many as a critical bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world. However, concerns persist regarding their reserves, potential for systemic risk, and the appropriate regulatory oversight. The criticism directed at past stablecoin legislation attempts by Democrats indicates a pattern of dissatisfaction with the proposed regulatory approaches coming from across the aisle. This adds another layer of complexity to the already fraught landscape of digital asset policy. The Trump Crypto Factor: What’s the Connection? The direct link between the planned walkout and Trump crypto involvement is the stated reason by the Democratic source. While the exact nature of Mr. Trump’s current digital asset holdings or specific industry ties prompting this concern are not fully detailed in the initial report, his recent public statements and embrace of cryptocurrencies represent a shift. Having previously expressed skepticism about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Mr. Trump has recently adopted a more favorable stance, even launching NFTs and accepting crypto donations for his campaign. This pivot, combined with his significant political influence, appears to have fueled Democratic fears about potential conflicts of interest or attempts to shape legislation to favor certain factions within the crypto space aligned with his interests. Understanding the perceived influence of Trump crypto activities is crucial to grasping the intensity of the political opposition now impacting legislative processes. Implications for Crypto Regulation and the Industry This political standoff and the potential boycott of a key congressional hearing carry significant implications for the cryptocurrency industry. Uncertainty surrounding regulation remains one of the biggest impediments to mainstream adoption and institutional investment in the U.S. Challenges Highlighted by the Standoff: Delayed Clarity: Political gridlock slows down the creation of clear rules for digital assets, leaving businesses and investors in limbo. Fragmented Approach: A lack of bipartisan consensus could lead to piecemeal or ineffective regulation. Increased Political Risk: The industry becomes more susceptible to partisan battles and shifts in political winds. Perception Issues: Public perception of crypto can be negatively affected by association with intense political conflict. While the benefits of effective crypto regulation include greater consumer protection, market stability, and fostering innovation within clear boundaries, achieving this goal appears increasingly difficult amidst the current political climate. The planned walkout is a stark reminder that the path to comprehensive digital asset legislation in the U.S. is fraught with political peril. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for US Crypto Policy The planned walkout by House Democrats from a vital congressional hearing on crypto regulation , explicitly linked to concerns over Trump crypto ties and set against the backdrop of ongoing debates like stablecoin legislation , marks a critical and potentially damaging moment for the future of digital asset policy in the United States. It underscores the deep political rifts that threaten to delay or derail efforts to create a clear and effective regulatory framework. As the crypto industry continues to grow, the need for regulatory clarity is paramount, yet this latest development suggests that political considerations may, for now, overshadow the collaborative effort required to achieve it. The coming days will reveal whether dialogue prevails or if this dramatic protest further entrenches the partisan divide, leaving the crypto landscape in the U.S. more uncertain than ever.

For those tracking the convergence of AI and blockchain, understanding the landscape of foundational AI models and the companies building them is crucial. This is where Mistral AI steps in, a French startup making significant waves. What is Mistral AI and Why Does it Matter? Founded in 2023, Mistral AI quickly positioned itself as a significant European tech contender. It’s often regarded as potentially the only European company capable of competing directly with OpenAI. Despite a valuation reported around $6 billion, its global market share is still developing. However, Mistral AI gained notable attention, particularly in France, with the launch of its AI assistant, Le Chat, on mobile app stores. French President Emmanuel Macron even publicly endorsed Le Chat, encouraging its use over competitors like ChatGPT. Mistral AI’s stated ambition is to “put frontier AI in the hands of everyone,” emphasizing a commitment to openness in AI development. This stance offers an alternative perspective compared to some of the more closed approaches in the industry. The company faces the dual challenge of scaling to compete globally while upholding its self-defined goal of being a leading independent and environmentally conscious AI lab. Exploring Mistral AI’s Range of AI Models A core part of Mistral AI’s strategy is its diverse portfolio of AI models , catering to various needs. These models form the foundation of their offerings, including the Le Chat assistant. Here’s a look at some key models: Mistral Large 2: The company’s flagship large language model, replacing its predecessor. Pixtral Large: Introduced in 2024, this model is part of the multimodal Pixtral family, capable of processing more than just text. Codestral: A specialized Generative AI model designed specifically for generating and assisting with code. Les Ministraux: A family of smaller models optimized for deployment on edge devices like smartphones. Mistral Saba: A model specifically focused on the Arabic language. Mistral OCR: Launched in March 2025, this API converts PDFs into text files, aiding AI models in data ingestion. This range shows Mistral AI’s effort to cover different applications, from large-scale language processing to device-specific and specialized tasks. Is Mistral AI an OpenAI Competitor? The comparison to OpenAI is frequent and intentional. Mistral AI is actively building products and models that serve similar markets. Their chat assistant, Le Chat , is a direct alternative to ChatGPT. It saw rapid adoption after its mobile launch, reaching 1 million downloads in two weeks and topping app store charts in France. While OpenAI has a significant head start and market dominance, Mistral AI’s rapid development, strong funding, and political backing in Europe position it as a credible challenger. The competition isn’t just on features but also on philosophy, with Mistral AI advocating for greater openness in AI technology. Funding and Partnerships Driving Mistral AI’s Growth Mistral AI has demonstrated remarkable success in attracting investment since its founding. As of February 2025, the company had raised approximately €1 billion (around $1.04 billion). This includes: A record $112 million seed round in June 2023, valuing the one-month-old startup at $260 million. A Series A round of €385 million ($415 million) in December 2023, at a reported $2 billion valuation. A €600 million mix of equity and debt ($640 million) in June 2024, led by General Catalyst, valuing the company at $6 billion. These funding rounds, attracting major global investors like Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Nvidia, and Microsoft, underscore the market’s belief in Mistral AI’s potential. Strategic partnerships are also key to its growth and distribution. A significant deal in 2024 with Microsoft included a €15 million investment and distribution of Mistral AI’s models via the Azure platform. Other notable partnerships include agreements with Agence France-Presse (AFP), France’s army and job agency, shipping giant CMA, German defense tech startup Helsing, IBM, Orange, and Stellantis. These collaborations help expand Mistral AI’s reach and integrate its technology into various sectors. The People Behind Mistral AI Mistral AI was founded by individuals with deep roots in AI research at major U.S. tech companies. The co-founders are: Arthur Mensch: CEO, previously worked at Google’s DeepMind. Timothée Lacroix: CTO, a former Meta staffer. Guillaume Lample: Chief Scientist Officer, also a former Meta staffer. Their background provides the technical expertise necessary to build frontier AI models . The founding team also includes notable advisers from the French tech and political scene, adding valuable strategic insight and connections. Mistral AI’s Open Source Approach Mistral AI adopts a mixed approach to open source. While some of its premier models are proprietary, with weights not available for commercial use, the company also offers free models with weights accessible under the Apache 2.0 license. An example is Mistral NeMo, a research model built and open-sourced in collaboration with Nvidia in July 2024. This dual strategy balances the need for proprietary models to generate revenue with a commitment to contributing to the open AI ecosystem. Monetization and Future Outlook Mistral AI generates revenue through several channels. While many initial offerings were free, monetization includes paid tiers for its Le Chat assistant, introduced in February 2025 with a Pro plan priced at $14.99 a month. For businesses, Mistral AI offers API access to its premier models with usage-based pricing and enterprise licensing options. Strategic partnerships also contribute significantly to revenue. Despite rapid growth and high valuation, reports suggest Mistral AI’s revenue is still in the eight-digit range, highlighting the challenge of translating valuation into revenue at this stage. Regarding the future, CEO Arthur Mensch stated in January 2025 that Mistral AI is “not for sale” and that an IPO is the plan. Given the substantial capital raised and the desire for European sovereignty in AI, an IPO appears to be the most likely path forward. However, realizing a valuation near $6 billion through an IPO will require substantial revenue growth in the coming years. The journey for Mistral AI is just beginning, and its progress will be closely watched as it navigates the competitive global AI landscape.

44211897,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157450,1746491419,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Coinbase PAXG Addition: Major Opportunity for Tokenized Gold,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-paxg-roadmap-addition/,"Get ready for potentially exciting developments in the world of tokenized assets! Major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has announced a significant addition to its asset roadmap: PAX Gold (PAXG). This move has sparked considerable interest within the crypto community, hinting at the possibility of expanded access to gold-backed digital assets for millions of users. Understanding PAX Gold (PAXG): More Than Just a Crypto Before diving into the implications of the Coinbase roadmap inclusion, let’s clarify what PAX Gold (PAXG) actually is. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that are native digital creations, PAXG is a unique ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain that represents ownership of physical gold. Here’s a quick breakdown: Backed by Physical Gold: Each PAXG token is directly backed by one fine troy ounce of London Good Delivery gold stored in secure, Brink’s vaults. Ownership Rights: Holding PAXG means you own the underlying physical gold. Token holders can even redeem their tokens for physical gold bars (though this typically involves minimums and logistical considerations). ERC-20 Token: It operates as a standard token on the Ethereum network, allowing for easy transfer and storage using compatible wallets. Think of PAXG as a digital wrapper around a physical asset, bringing the stability and historical value of gold into the modern, digital economy. This concept of tokenized gold is gaining traction as investors seek ways to diversify their portfolios within the crypto space. The Significance of the Coinbase Roadmap When Coinbase adds an asset to its roadmap, it’s a strong signal that the asset is under consideration for a potential future listing on the exchange. While it’s not a guarantee of an immediate or even eventual listing, it indicates that the asset has passed initial reviews and meets certain criteria for further evaluation. For Coinbase , adding PAXG aligns with a broader trend of exchanges exploring and listing assets that bridge the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Tokenized assets, particularly those backed by stable, real-world commodities like gold, offer a new avenue for user engagement and investment. What does this mean for PAXG specifically? Increased Visibility: Being on the Coinbase roadmap instantly puts PAXG in front of a massive global audience of crypto investors. Enhanced Legitimacy: Consideration by a regulated and prominent exchange like Coinbase adds a layer of credibility to PAXG and the broader tokenized gold concept. Potential Liquidity Boost: A future PAX Gold listing on Coinbase could dramatically increase trading volume and liquidity for the token. This move highlights Coinbase’s continued effort to expand its offerings beyond native cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, potentially paving the way for more real-world assets (RWAs) to be tokenized and traded on their platform. PAX Gold Listing: What to Expect Next? The inclusion on the Coinbase roadmap is just one step in a multi-stage process. There is no set timeline for when, or if, PAXG will move from the roadmap to an official listing announcement. Coinbase has a rigorous review process that considers various factors, including legal, compliance, technical, and market-related aspects. Investors and interested parties should keep a close watch on official announcements from both Coinbase and Paxos (the issuer of PAXG). Speculation around potential listing dates can be rampant, but reliable information will only come directly from the involved parties. Should a PAX Gold listing occur, here are some potential impacts: Easier Access: Millions of Coinbase users would gain direct access to buying, selling, and holding PAXG alongside their Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto assets. Price Impact: Increased demand and liquidity from a major exchange listing often lead to price appreciation, though this is not guaranteed and depends on overall market conditions. Integration into Coinbase Ecosystem: If listed, PAXG could potentially be integrated into other Coinbase services, such as Coinbase Earn, Coinbase Card, or institutional offerings. Exploring PAXG Crypto: Benefits and Risks for Investors For investors considering adding PAXG to their portfolio, the potential accessibility via Coinbase makes exploring PAXG crypto a timely exercise. Investing in PAXG offers a unique blend of traditional asset exposure with crypto-native advantages. Potential Benefits: Gold Exposure: Gain direct exposure to the price movements of physical gold without the hassle of storage or insurance. Fractional Ownership: Unlike buying physical gold bars, you can buy fractions of a PAXG token, making gold investment accessible at lower price points. Liquidity: As a token on major exchanges, PAXG can potentially be bought and sold more easily than physical gold or certain gold investment vehicles. Portability & Transfer: Transferring PAXG is as simple as sending a crypto transaction, much easier than moving physical gold. Potential Hedge: Gold is traditionally seen as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, offering potential portfolio diversification benefits. Potential Risks & Considerations: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for tokenized assets is still evolving and could impact PAXG. Smart Contract Risk: As an ERC-20 token, PAXG is subject to potential risks associated with the underlying blockchain technology and smart contracts. Counterparty Risk: While Paxos is a regulated trust company, there is still a degree of reliance on the issuer to manage the physical gold reserves and token mechanics. Market Volatility: While backed by gold, PAXG’s price can still experience volatility influenced by both gold market dynamics and overall crypto market sentiment. Fees: Be aware of potential network transaction fees (gas fees on Ethereum) and any exchange-specific trading or withdrawal fees. The Rise of Tokenized Gold and Real-World Assets The addition of PAXG to the Coinbase roadmap isn’t an isolated event; it’s part of a larger trend towards the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). This involves issuing digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership of tangible or intangible assets outside the traditional crypto space, such as real estate, art, commodities, or even equities. Why is tokenized gold , and RWAs in general, gaining traction? Increased Accessibility: Tokenization can break down large, illiquid assets into smaller, more accessible units. Improved Liquidity: Bringing assets onto a blockchain can facilitate easier trading on digital exchanges. Transparency: Ownership and transaction history can be recorded on a public ledger. Efficiency: Streamlining processes like transfer of ownership and settlement. PAXG is a leading example in the tokenized commodity space. A successful listing and adoption on a platform like Coinbase could significantly boost confidence in the RWA sector and encourage the tokenization of other asset classes. Actionable Insights for the Reader Given this development, what steps should you consider? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand exactly how PAXG works, its backing mechanism, and the reputation of its issuer, Paxos. Monitor Official Announcements: Keep an eye on Coinbase’s official channels for any updates regarding a potential PAXG listing. Assess Your Portfolio: Consider whether exposure to gold, via a tokenized asset like PAXG, aligns with your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Understand the Risks: Be fully aware of the potential challenges and risks associated with both crypto investments and tokenized assets. The roadmap addition is a positive signal, but it’s crucial to approach any potential investment with caution and a thorough understanding of the asset. Compelling Summary Coinbase’s decision to add PAX Gold (PAXG) to its asset roadmap is a noteworthy development for both the token itself and the broader tokenized gold market. It signals potential future accessibility for millions of users on one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, offering a new avenue for investors seeking exposure to gold within the digital asset space. While not a guarantee of listing, this step underscores the growing importance of tokenized real-world assets in the crypto ecosystem. As the process unfolds, staying informed and conducting diligent research will be key for anyone interested in this exciting convergence of traditional commodities and blockchain technology.

Crypto Market Has Enjoyed Net Capital Inflows Over The Past Month In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about the latest trend in the capital inflows for cryptocurrencies. In the digital asset sector, capital mainly flows in and out through three asset classes: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the stablecoins. The altcoins usually only see a secondary rotation of capital from these coins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sandwiched Between Major Support & Resistance Levels—Can Bulls Win Out? As such, the netflows related to the three of BTC, ETH and the stables can provide a sufficient-enough estimation for the situation of the entire cryptocurrency market. For calculating the capital inflows/outflows related to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the “Realized Cap” indicator can be used. The Realized Cap is an on-chain capitalization model that finds the total value of any asset’s supply by assuming the value of each individual token as the same as its last transaction price. This is different from the usual Market Cap, which just sums up the supply at the current spot price. In short, what the Realized Cap reflects is the amount of capital that the investors of the cryptocurrency as a whole have put into it. Changes related to the metric, therefore, reflect the inflow or outflow of capital. In the case of the stablecoins, the change in the Market Cap is enough to gauge the capital netflow. This is down to the fact that the Realized Cap is no different from the Market Cap for them, as a result of their price never varying from the fiat currency that they are pegged to. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 30-day aggregate cryptocurrency market netflow based on these indicators over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the combined 30-day Bitcoin and Ethereum Realized Cap change is currently at a positive $12.58 billion. This means that these two cryptocurrencies have enjoyed a notable net capital inflow during the past month. Similarly, the stablecoins have seen a net inflow of $6.19 billion in the same period. Thus, it seems the digital asset sector as a whole has witnessed the incoming of $18.77 billion in capital. Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLer Selling Expected Around This Level, Report Says While this trend has occurred, Bitcoin and the other assets have gone through their price recovery runs, so it’s possible that as long as these inflows keep up, the rallies could be sustainable. It only remains to be seen how the investors will behave in the coming days, however, as it often doesn’t take much for sentiment to shift in the cryptocurrency sector. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $94,200, down 1% in the last seven days.

Here are the key figures: Direct XRP Holdings: Ripple reported holding 4.56 billion XRP tokens. This represents the amount of XRP directly controlled by the company, outside of its escrow accounts. Quarter-over-Quarter Change: Compared to the end of Q4 2024, these direct holdings saw a modest increase of 1.7%. While seemingly small, any change in a holding of this magnitude is noteworthy. XRP in Escrow: The report also detailed the amount of XRP held in cryptographic escrow accounts. These accounts are designed to release a set amount of XRP back to Ripple on a predetermined schedule, adding predictability to the supply. As of the end of Q1 2025, escrow holdings stood at 37.1 billion XRP. This figure decreased from the previous quarter as tokens were released from escrow. Understanding both direct holdings and escrow is essential to grasp Ripple’s overall potential influence on the XRP supply and market dynamics. The escrow mechanism is a key feature of the XRP Ledger designed to manage the release of the total XRP supply over time. How Do We Calculate the XRP Market Value of Ripple’s Holdings? Putting a dollar value on digital asset holdings requires using the prevailing market price at a specific point in time. According to the report, the XRP market value used for calculation was based on the price of $2.15 per token as of March 31, 2025. Using this price, the value of Ripple’s direct holdings of 4.56 billion XRP comes out to approximately $98.6 billion. This nearly $99 billion valuation underscores the immense financial stake Ripple has in the success and value of the XRP ecosystem. It’s important to remember that market prices for cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, and this valuation is a snapshot in time. The actual dollar value fluctuates constantly with the market. While the direct holdings value is substantial, the vast amount of XRP still locked in escrow represents a much larger potential future value for the company as those tokens are released over time, assuming the price of XRP remains stable or increases. Beyond Holdings: What Else Did the Ripple Q1 2025 Report Highlight? The Q1 2025 report wasn’t just about token counts and valuations. It also shed light on Ripple’s strategic corporate moves, indicating a proactive approach to expanding its business lines and market reach. These Ripple business updates are critical for understanding the company’s long-term vision. Two significant points highlighted in the report, as noted by sources like U.Today, were: Acquisition of Hidden Road: Ripple successfully completed the acquisition of Hidden Road, a prime brokerage firm. This move is significant as it expands Ripple’s institutional offerings and capabilities, particularly in the areas of trading, financing, and prime brokerage services for digital assets. Acquiring established financial infrastructure can accelerate Ripple’s push into serving larger institutional clients. Ongoing Interest in Acquiring Circle: The report also reiterated Ripple’s continued interest in acquiring Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin. While not a completed deal, expressing this interest publicly (or having it reported) signals Ripple’s ambition to play a major role in the stablecoin market and potentially integrate USDC into its payment solutions. An acquisition of Circle would be transformative for Ripple, significantly broadening its product suite and regulatory footprint. These strategic acquisitions and potential acquisitions demonstrate Ripple’s focus on building a comprehensive suite of financial services built around digital assets, extending beyond just cross-border payments facilitated by XRP. Why Should Investors Pay Attention to This Crypto Investment News? For anyone involved in the digital asset space, especially those holding or considering XRP, this crypto investment news from Ripple’s Q1 2025 report offers several key takeaways: Transparency: Ripple continues to provide quarterly reports detailing its XRP holdings and sales, which is a level of transparency welcomed by many in the crypto community. This helps manage expectations regarding potential supply increases from the company. Company Strength: A nearly $99 billion valuation of direct XRP holdings (at the time of the report) indicates significant underlying value for the company itself, separate from its operational revenue. This financial strength can fuel further investment, development, and strategic acquisitions. Strategic Expansion: The acquisitions of firms like Hidden Road and the pursuit of others like Circle show a clear strategy to diversify and strengthen Ripple’s position in the broader digital finance ecosystem. These moves could potentially increase the utility and adoption of Ripple’s technologies, which proponents argue could positively impact XRP in the long run. Market Influence: While Ripple has reduced its programmatic sales of XRP over time, the sheer volume of their holdings means their actions regarding these assets are always relevant to market participants. However, it’s also important to consider potential challenges. The release of XRP from escrow, while scheduled, adds a predictable supply increase that the market must absorb. Furthermore, the success of Ripple’s new ventures and acquisitions will depend on execution and market adoption. What Does This Mean for the Future of Ripple and XRP? The Q1 2025 report paints a picture of a company actively leveraging its resources (including its XRP holdings) to grow and diversify. The focus on institutional services through acquisitions like Hidden Road, and the ambition shown by targeting a major stablecoin player like Circle, suggests Ripple is aiming to be a central figure in the future of digital finance, not just cross-border payments. The value of Ripple XRP holdings is intrinsically linked to the market performance of XRP. While Ripple’s business success doesn’t directly guarantee an increase in XRP’s price (as price is driven by many factors including speculation, utility adoption, and macro trends), a strong and expanding Ripple ecosystem could potentially contribute to increased demand and utility for the digital asset over time. Investors and market watchers will be closely watching how these acquisitions integrate into Ripple’s existing business and what further strategic moves the company makes. The regulatory environment also remains a significant factor influencing both Ripple’s operations and the perception of XRP. In Conclusion: Ripple’s Q1 2025 report demonstrates the company’s robust financial position, highlighted by the substantial value of its XRP holdings, and signals aggressive strategic expansion through key acquisitions. While the nearly $99 billion valuation is impressive, it’s the underlying business growth and diversification efforts that truly underscore Ripple’s ambitions in the evolving digital finance landscape.

Many people are exploring AI tools, specifically AI Chatbots, for quick health information, especially with long waits for traditional care. However, a recent study highlights significant challenges users face when seeking useful health advice from these systems. Why is Getting Health Advice from AI Chatbots Difficult? According to a study led by Oxford researchers, there’s a “two-way communication breakdown” when people use AI Chatbots for health advice. Users struggle to provide the right information, and the chatbots often give answers that are hard to understand or contain a mix of good and bad recommendations. This means people using chatbots didn’t make better decisions about potential health issues compared to those using traditional online searches or their own knowledge. What Did the Chatbot Study Involve? The Chatbot Study included about 1,300 participants in the UK. They were given medical scenarios written by doctors and asked to identify possible conditions and actions using chatbots and other methods. The study tested popular models like GPT-4o, Cohere’s Command R+, and Meta’s Llama 3. The findings were concerning: Participants were less likely to identify relevant health conditions when using chatbots. They were more likely to underestimate the severity of conditions they did identify. Users often left out key details when querying the chatbots. Chatbot responses frequently blended helpful information with poor suggestions. The Push for Medical AI in Healthcare Despite these challenges, major tech companies continue to develop Medical AI applications for healthcare. Apple is reportedly working on tools for exercise, diet, and sleep advice. Amazon is exploring AI to analyze medical data for social health factors. Microsoft is assisting in building AI to manage patient messages for care providers. However, the medical community and AI companies themselves express caution. The American Medical Association advises against doctors using chatbots for clinical decisions, and companies like OpenAI warn against using their chatbots for diagnoses. Risks of Relying on AI Healthcare Tools for Self-Diagnosis The study underscores the risks of relying on current AI Healthcare tools for self-diagnosis. Misidentifying conditions or underestimating their seriousness can lead to delayed or incorrect treatment, potentially worsening health outcomes. Experts recommend using trusted sources for health decisions. Moving Forward with AI in Health Experts suggest that, like new medications, AI systems intended for healthcare use should undergo thorough testing in real-world settings before widespread deployment. Current evaluation methods don’t fully capture the complexity of human interaction with these tools. Conclusion While the potential for AI in healthcare is significant, this Chatbot Study highlights the current limitations of AI Chatbots for providing reliable Health Advice. Users face difficulties in interacting effectively with these tools, leading to potentially dangerous outcomes when seeking Medical AI for self-diagnosis within AI Healthcare systems. Caution and reliance on professional medical guidance remain essential.

From crushing it in the market to finally closing its long-running legal battle with the SEC, Ripple’s start to the year has been exciting. SEC Case Closed: Ripple Walks Away a Winner In one of the biggest stories of the year for crypto, the SEC officially dropped its appeal against Ripple, bringing their multi-year legal fight to an end. The regulator also agreed to lower the proposed penalty from $125 million to $50 million and asked the court to cancel the injunction against Ripple. And it’s not just Ripple catching a break. The new U.S. government has already rolled back some of the old restrictions on crypto. A $1.25 Billion Power Move The company bought Hidden Road, a global prime broker, for a whopping $1.25 billion. The deal gives Ripple new tools to expand its institutional services. Hidden Road will start using Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin as collateral and will rely on the XRP Ledger for faster and cheaper post-trade operations in foreign exchange, swaps, and repo markets. Ripple’s XRP Holdings on the Rise By the end of March 2025, Ripple held 4.56 billion XRP, up from 4.48 billion at the start of the year. Another 37.13 billion XRP remains locked in escrow, gradually releasing over the next 42 months. XRPL Activity Cools, but DeFi Stays Strong After a big spike in late 2024, on-chain activity on the XRP Ledger settled down a bit. Transaction numbers and new wallet creations both dropped about 30–40%, which tracks with what’s been happening across the broader crypto market. But one bright spot stood out — DeFi activity held up better than most blockchains. Trading volumes on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) only dipped by 16%, while other major chains saw much steeper drops. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin also gained ground, crossing a $90 million market cap with over $300 million traded on DEXs. XRP Outperforms the Market While Bitcoin and Ethereum struggled for gains in Q1, XRP stole the spotlight. It jumped nearly 50% in early February and held steady while other big names dropped. Even with market ups and downs, XRP proved to be one of the strongest-performing assets in the space. The numbers tell the story. XRP-based investment products saw $37.7 million in inflows in just three months, pushing its 2025 total to $214 million — now just $1 million away from surpassing Ethereum’s global funds. But there’s one big change — after eight years of publishing these detailed reports, Ripple announced this will be the final one in its current format. The company says it’s time to evolve how it communicates with the market. “After careful consideration, Ripple has made the decision to sunset the report in its current form starting in Q2 2025,” the report read.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-06 00:54:15

This comes after the agency delayed several other applications for spot crypto ETFs last week, including XRP, Hedera, and Dogecoin but hadn’t done so for the Canary Litecoin ETF, sparking hopes that the regulator might have different plans for this fund. But on Monday, the official deadline, the regulator announced the delay and asked for public comments regarding the proposal’s compliance with regulatory requirements. ""In particular, the Commission seeks comment on whether the proposal to list and trade Shares of the Trust, which would hold LTC, is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices or raises any new or novel concerns not previously contemplated by the Commission,"" the agency wrote in a filing . Canary Capital, which was founded by former Valkyrie Funds co-founder Steven McClurg last year, had submitted initial paperwork for the fund in October. LTC, which stands at a $6.6 billion market cap, is the native cryptocurrency of Litecoin, an open-source blockchain project whose code is copied from Bitcoin’s (BTC).

History shows that many of the biggest gains came not from chasing hype, but from recognizing fundamentals before the crowd. Cardano (ADA) was once that quiet opportunity, trading below $0.05 back in early 2020 — before going on a multi-year rally that surprised even seasoned traders. Today, some analysts are pointing to another early-stage token following a similar path: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Currently available at $0.025 through its presale, MUTM is drawing serious attention from investors who believe it shares ADA’s early DNA — not in branding or community culture, but in development-first focus, real utility, and a token model built for long-term traction. And if forecasts are accurate, MUTM could hit the $1 mark much faster than ADA ever did. Why MUTM’s Position Resembles Early ADA Cardano’s breakout wasn’t overnight. It came after years of consistent network upgrades, peer-reviewed research, and increasing utility. The reason ADA saw such strong growth was because it transitioned from speculation to actual ecosystem adoption. Mutuum Finance is at a similar crossroads. Though still in development, its foundations are already attracting serious participants in the decentralized finance space. Mutuum Finance is fundamentally a non-custodial protocol designed for lending and borrowing, with a clear focus on ease of use, transparent operations, and generating passive income for participants. Instead of just issuing a token and promising returns, the team has built a structure where utility is baked into the user experience. Participants can deposit assets into the platform, receive mtTokens in return, and earn interest over time. These mtTokens act as a user’s share of the liquidity pool, passively tracking interest as long as they hold them. Unlike many early-stage cryptocurrencies, Mutuum isn’t designed around speculation. It’s engineered to offer practical tools to users — allowing access to on-chain liquidity without giving up asset ownership. Whether for passive income or capital deployment, the platform gives investors ways to stay flexible while putting their assets to work. Momentum behind MUTM is growing quickly. The presale has already raised over $7.5 million, with more than 9,300 holders now on board and over 440 million tokens sold. MUTM is currently priced at $0.025, though the upcoming presale stage will increase it to $0.03, with the official launch price already set at $0.06. That means early participants are locking in a 2.4x return even before listings go live. But many believe that’s just the start. The $1 forecast isn’t built on empty projections — it’s based on a blend of platform potential and investor behavior. Once the token hits exchanges and the beta version of the Mutuum platform launches, user adoption is expected to grow quickly. As more participants engage with the system, interest from borrowers generates yield for depositors, and revenue for the protocol increases. This revenue isn’t left idle either. A portion of it is used to purchase MUTM tokens from the market, which are then distributed to active users — creating a feedback loop that supports demand while rewarding long-term engagement. It’s a practical, scalable system that closely mirrors what successful DeFi cryptos have done — but in a cleaner, more streamlined way. When MUTM climbs from its current $0.025 price to $1, that would mark a 3,900% surge in value. For example, a $1,250 investment today would secure around 50,000 MUTM tokens. At $1, that’s $50,000 — a transformation that resembles ADA’s early returns and explains why so many are keeping a close eye on this token. Another key point working in MUTM’s favor is its upcoming stablecoin — an overcollateralized asset minted from supplied collateral. Unlike centralized stablecoins, this one will be fully decentralized and algorithmically backed by on-chain assets. All interest from stablecoin borrowing will feed into Mutuum’s treasury, reinforcing platform health and sustainability. The protocol is also undergoing a CertiK audit, one of the most trusted names in smart contract verification. This move adds an additional layer of credibility and is a clear signal that the team is focused on long-term viability and user trust. ADA’s journey to the top was built on strong fundamentals. Today, MUTM stands at a similar moment. It has the product vision, the early community, and the groundwork to build something meaningful in DeFi. And with the token still priced at just $0.025, many believe this could be one of the best cryptocurrency investments to make before the next market wave hits. With analysts already forecasting a potential move to $1, and platform infrastructure set to go live around launch, the opportunity here isn’t just early — it’s ticking.

The latest Chainlink (LINK) price update shows promise, but it’s stuck just below $15.30. Ethereum (ETH) price drop has pulled it to $1,780, shaking market confidence. These two might recover, but BlockDAG (BDAG) is locking in wins. It just passed its CertiK audit, proving top-tier security, and has already sold over 19.6 billion coins. Unlike LINK and ETH, BlockDAG is not waiting for charts to turn it’s already delivering. With a 2520% ROI and a $0.0019 entry open until May 13, it is ranked as the top crypto to buy right now. Chainlink (LINK) Price Update: Will the $15.30 Barrier Finally Break? Chainlink (LINK) price update shows bullish momentum after weeks of sideways trading. Currently at $15.02, LINK is testing the key $15.30 resistance. A breakout here could send the price toward $17. The technical setup includes an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and an EMA crossover, both hinting at rising buying pressure. However, the breakout needs confirmation with a strong move above $15.30. If that fails, Chainlink might stay between $14.50 and $15.30. On the data side, exchange reserves dropped 1.03%, a positive sign, but a 37.46% spike in netflows hints at possible short-term selling. For now, the Chainlink (LINK) price update stays cautiously optimistic. Traders are watching the next Chainlink (LINK) price update. Ethereum (ETH) Price Drop Follows Sharp 2.59% Daily Decline Ethereum (ETH) price drop hit hard on April 30, 2025, falling 2.59% to $1,780.25. This happened during a low-volume trading day with rising market uncertainty. Ethereum (ETH) price drop also pulled its market cap down by 2.70%, landing at $214.93 billion. Volume dropped nearly 10%, showing a slowdown in trader activity. RSI now shows neutrality, with traders watching for the next move. ETH’s supply stayed stable at 120.73 million tokens, signalling no inflation pressure. Meanwhile, the ETH/BTC pair bounced back from its monthly low of 0.0180 BTC and now holds steady above 0.0185 BTC. This level is key. If it holds, Ethereum could aim for higher resistance areas, but rising volatility keeps things uncertain. CertiK Verified: BlockDAG Locks in Top-Tier Smart Contract Security BlockDAG has officially cleared the CertiK audit – a major milestone that highlights its serious commitment to blockchain security. As one of the most trusted names in blockchain verification, CertiK’s involvement brings confidence and credibility to the project. This isn’t just a rubber stamp. It’s the final stage of BlockDAG’s rigorous three-tier security strategy designed to protect its treasury and vesting smart contracts. The project doesn’t stop at technical checks; it extends protection through strict internal controls, organizational safeguards, and an ongoing partnership with CertiK for deeper code review and continuous monitoring. Security is the backbone of BlockDAG’s architecture. With its frequent audits, and strict listing protocols, BlockDAG is building a network where trust isn’t just promised, it’s enforced. This level of readiness, especially before launch, puts BlockDAG in a different league. The numbers back it up. BDAG has already crossed 19.6 billion coins sold. ROI from Batch 1 to Batch 28 stands at 2520%. With the launch price set at $0.05, the current limited-time entry point of $0.0019 (available until May 13) is turning heads. All signs point to BlockDAG as the top crypto to buy right now. Crypto Moves That Deserve Attention The Chainlink (LINK) price update reflects cautious optimism, but the $15.30 resistance still holds firm. Ethereum (ETH) price drop has slowed its momentum, with no clear signal of recovery yet. While these two remain uncertain, BlockDAG continues to deliver results. It has successfully completed its CertiK audit, reinforcing strong smart contract security. With over 19.6 billion coins sold and a 2520% ROI from early batches, the numbers show steady growth. The current $0.0019 entry price is available until May 13, offering one last window before listings begin. All signs point to BlockDAG being the top crypto to buy right now—based on real progress, not speculation.

According to information inadvertently published on their website and a blog post that briefly appeared, the evolution of their design language is moving from “Material 3” to something called “Material Design 3 Expressive.” The core idea behind this update is to create interfaces that are not only functional but also emotionally resonant and delightful to use. While the full details are still under wraps until the official reveal at Google I/O , the leaked information points to key characteristics: Bold Use of Shape and Color: Expect interfaces that are visually striking and use these elements to guide the user and create memorable interactions. Emotional Connection: The goal is to move beyond purely functional design to interfaces that users feel a positive connection with. Improved Usability: The design aims to draw attention to key elements and actions, potentially making apps easier and faster to navigate. This evolution impacts app developers directly, influencing how they build and customize experiences, and ultimately affecting the overall User Experience for everyone using an Android device. Tracing the Evolution: From Material Design to Material You To understand Material 3 Expressive, it helps to look back at Google’s design history. The journey began in 2014 with the introduction of Material Design . This open-source system provided a comprehensive guide for developers on creating user interfaces across Android, covering visual style, motion, and interaction patterns. The system received a significant update in May 2021 with the reveal of “Material You,” also known as Material You (or Material 3). This version introduced a new level of personalization. A prime example is the dynamic color feature, where the entire Android interface could adapt its color scheme based on the user’s chosen wallpaper. This made the device feel more personal and unique to the individual. Material 3 Expressive appears to be an iteration building upon the foundation of Material You , pushing the boundaries further into the realm of emotional and visually engaging design rather than being a complete overhaul. Why Focus on Expressive User Experience? The leaked blog post offered insights into the research behind this design shift. Studies indicated that people often prefer a more expressive design style because it actually improves usability. By using bold shapes and colors, the design can effectively highlight important elements and user actions. Google noted that this approach leads to “significant gains in performance” because users can more quickly identify and interact with what they need. Interestingly, Google also highlighted that this type of expressive design can make using apps easier for older adults. By making key elements more prominent and visually distinct, it helps level the playing field, ensuring that the User Experience is accessible and intuitive for people of all ages. However, Google did caution that expressive design isn’t a universal solution. Developers still need to adhere to established design patterns and standards while incorporating these new expressive elements. It requires a thoughtful approach to ensure the design is both expressive and functional. What to Expect at Google I/O? The accidental blog post, initially spotted by 9to5Google and saved via the Wayback Machine, has since been removed. However, the presence of a session titled “Build next-level UX with Material 3 Expressive” in the official Google I/O schedule confirms the upcoming reveal. Developers attending this session will learn how to leverage these “new emotional design patterns” to enhance engagement, usability, and the overall appeal of their products. Google plans to release files and alpha code during the conference, allowing developers to start experimenting with Material 3 Expressive ahead of its wider public release. This early access is crucial for the ecosystem to adapt and begin implementing the new Android Design principles. Conclusion: A More Emotional Android Future? The leak of Material 3 Expressive details gives us an exciting glimpse into the future of Android Design . Moving beyond pure function, Google is pushing towards interfaces that connect with users emotionally, using bold visuals and thoughtful design to create delightful and highly usable experiences. This focus on expressive User Experience promises benefits for users of all ages and presents developers with powerful new tools to build engaging apps. The full picture will emerge at Google I/O , but the direction is clear: Android is aiming for a richer, more personal, and more emotional visual identity.

In a May 5 letter to a Manhattan federal court, lawyers for Samourai co-founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill said prosecutors disclosed that the US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) representatives told them six months before they charged the pair “that under FinCEN’s guidance, the Samourai Wallet app would not qualify as a ‘Money Services Business’ requiring a FinCEN license.” “Shockingly, six months later, the same prosecutors criminally charged Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill with operating just such a business without a FinCEN license,” the lawyers added. The letter claimed that prosecutors were required to share their discussions with FinCEN over Samourai two weeks after they unsealed charges, making the deadline May 8 last year, but instead “suppressed this information for over a year, disclosing it only on April 1, 2025.” Prosecutors charged Samourai CEO Rodriguez and its technology chief Hill with conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and money laundering conspiracy in February 2024, unsealing the charges and arresting the pair in April that year. Samourai’s mixing service took crypto from multiple users and blended it together to hide its origins. The government alleged the platform helped with over $2 billion in illegal transactions and facilitated over $100 million worth of money laundering transactions from online black markets and scammers. Rodriguez and Hill both pleaded not guilty. In the letter, their lawyers said prosecutors shared details of a call with Kevin O’Connor, chief of FinCEN’s Virtual Assets and Emerging Technology Section in the Enforcement and Compliance Division, and Policy Division staffer Lorena Valente. According to an email from one of the prosecutors summarizing the call, FinCEN said that “because Samourai does not take ‘custody’ of the cryptocurrency by possessing the private keys to any addresses where the cryptocurrency is stored, that would strongly suggest that Samourai is NOT acting as an MSB [money services business].” An excerpt of an email from prosecutor Andrew Chan said FinCEN “did not have a sense” of what it would decide on Samourai. Source: CourtListener The email said O’Connor and Valente agreed that the government could try to argue that Samourai functionally controlled the crypto, “but that has never been addressed in the guidance, and so it could be a difficult argument” for prosecutors. Samourai’s lawyers asked the court for a hearing “to determine the circumstances surrounding the Government’s late disclosure” and to administer a remedy. Samourai to renew dismissal bid if case goes on Rodriguez and Hill’s lawyers said that, using this latest information, they would again ask for the charges to be dismissed, arguing they lacked fair notice and “understood they were acting lawfully.” Related: US Treasury’s OFAC can’t restore Tornado Cash sanctions, judge rules Prosecutors and Samourai asked the court for more time on April 28 to consider potentially dismissing the case after the Justice Department rolled back its crypto enforcement. Rodriguez and Hill bid to dismiss the case in early April, arguing it should be dropped as Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in an April 7 memo that the Justice Department wouldn’t prosecute crypto mixers for “unwitting violations of regulations.” In the latest letter, their lawyers said if the government “were to resist the Blanche Memo’s directive and push forward,” then they would bid to dismiss as “if they were not money transmitters under FinCEN’s guidance, then they could not possibly be prosecuted for not having a license.” Magazine: Tornado Cash 2.0 — The race to build safe and legal coin mixers",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-06 01:17:18

This week, XRP dropped slightly by about 0.3%. While some cryptocurrencies saw a bit of selling, this small dip in XRP isn’t a big concern for most investors. The price is still holding above key support levels. There’s still uncertainty about whether XRP has started its next big move up. On smaller timeframes, no clear breakout has formed yet, though the price is making higher highs and higher lows — a positive sign. Price Correction Could Be Ending Crypto analyst Dark Defender said that XRP recently faced resistance at $2.22 and $2.36, with the price pulling back to $2.13. He believes this pullback was expected and that the market is preparing for the next move up, as long as XRP holds above the $2.00 level. Dark Defender also shared his long-term outlook. He said XRP is in the final phase of a fifth wave structure and expects this to lead to higher prices. He predicts the first move toward $3, followed by further gains with targets of $4.40 and $6.30 if the pattern continues. The key support to watch in the short term is $1.88. However, some analysts warn that short-term trends are still unclear. The recent price movement has been choppy, and there is no strong sign of an upward impulse yet.

Projects like Ethereum (ETH) , Bitcoin (BTC) , Solana (SOL) , and Kaspa (KAS) are showing renewed momentum based on strong fundamentals and expanding ecosystems. Meanwhile, early-stage contender MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining serious ground—emerging as one of the most-watched altcoins heading into the new market cycle. MAGACOINFINANCE: Quietly Becoming 2025’s Breakout Narrative MAGACOINFINANCE is no longer under the radar—it’s accelerating. With over $7.8 million raised and a growing global community, this project is proving that early-stage execution matters. Its appeal lies in a powerful combination: professional rollout, high engagement, and rising traction across both influencers and analysts. While other altcoins are climbing from established baselines, MAGACOINFINANCE still offers rare discovery-phase potential. Early buyers are already benefiting from insider positioning—supported further by an exclusive 50% bonus using the code MAGA50X during checkout. The listing target remains $0.007 , making the entry point today extremely attractive. Bitcoin (BTC): The Macro Foundation Keeps Growing Bitcoin continues to lead the market narrative. With ETF inflows pushing institutional demand and supply-side constraints after the halving, Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of long-term portfolios. Ethereum (ETH): Strengthening Through Upgrades and Institutional Backing Ethereum has climbed over 11% in the past week, fueled by increased DEX volume and ecosystem activity. With upcoming Layer-2 integrations and ETF traction, ETH could challenge $2,100 in the short term, with projections reaching up to $5,174 by year-end. Solana (SOL): Powering the DeFi and NFT Landscape Solana continues to thrive in high-performance blockchain applications. As developers lean toward its fast, low-fee architecture, price forecasts suggest a move toward $400 by late 2025. Kaspa (KAS): Momentum Grows with Unique Architecture Kaspa is riding a bullish wave, with recent price surges and continued adoption. Its blockDAG model differentiates it from other proof-of-work coins, and analysts are watching closely as it targets $0.222 later this year. Final Thoughts For investors targeting high-performance portfolios in 2025, Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana remain essential. But it’s MAGACOINFINANCE that’s drawing growing attention as the standout early-stage play with structured upside. When the market shifts, those positioned early often see the most substantial returns.

The SEC’s most recent action comes after the regulator decided to postpone verdicts on active altcoin ETF filings until June 17. The agency is seeking public comments on whether the listing proposal satisfies regulatory requirements, specifically preventing deceptive and manipulative practices. “In particular, the Commission seeks comment on whether the proposal to list and trade Shares of the Trust, which would hold LTC, is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices or raises any new or novel concerns not previously contemplated by the Commission,” the agency wrote in a filing. James Seyffart’s prediction becomes a reality The SEC revealed in a statement that it has further delayed deciding on Canary Capital’s proposal for a spot Litecoin (LTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF). In light of this action, the agency is requesting an inquiry into whether Nasdaq’s proposal to list the ETF conforms with legal requirements. Canary Capital, which was founded by former Valkyrie Funds co-founder Steven McClurg last year, had submitted initial paperwork for the fund in October. The decision by the SEC has generated conversations within the crypto community. James Seyffart , a Bloomberg analyst with extensive experience, especially with Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), offered commentary on the subject. Based on Seyffart’s argument, he correctly predicted that the SEC would postpone making a decision on the Litecoin ETF, as it had done with other cryptocurrency ETFs so far, such as Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF filing. Moreover, according to Seyffart, Litecoin is the asset with the best chance of receiving early approval . Recently, the analyst predicted that there was a 90% chance that an LTC ETF would be approved this year, which gave the price of Litecoin a positive outlook. According to CoinMarketCap, Litecoin is currently down by 2.2% over 24 hours, trading hands for over $83. Litecoin (LTC) is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency and the 25th biggest digital coin by market cap. The asset is a forked version of Bitcoin established in 2011 by ex-Google employee Charlie Lee. The SEC has delayed Canary Capital’s Litecoin ETF just like other crypto ETF proposals The SEC was set to decide on the proposed spot in Canary Capital’s Litecoin ETF on May 5. In the meantime, market observers had become more hopeful. In support of this, on Polymarket, approval odds had risen to their highest level since the middle of March. In January, Nasdaq reportedly filed Form 19b-4, a proposed rule change, to list and trade Canary’s Litecoin ETF shares. The proposal was then made available for public comment in the Federal Register on February 4. This was the first day of the 45-day review period, which ended on March 21st. However, the SEC decided to make this time frame longer by 45 days, setting a new 90-day deadline of May 5. The statement said, “Accordingly, the Commission, under Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 6 designates May 5, 2025, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change (File No. SR-NASDAQ-2025-005).” For other cryptocurrency ETF applications, the regulator has taken similar actions. The SEC delayed its decision on Bitwise’s Dogecoin (DOGE) proposal until June 15 and Franklin Templeton’s spot XRP (XRP) ETF until June 17. This was also the case with Grayscale’s Ethereum (ETH) staking ETF. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The post quickly went viral, with some calling it unnecessary fear-mongering and others suggesting it hints at possible market manipulation. What Was Said? The post argued that Ripple’s monthly XRP sales, unusual network patterns, and historic price movements — particularly during XRP’s famous 2017 rally — hinted at possible price suppression. It even cited a study that found a negative connection between XRP’s transaction network and its price performance. Naturally, this raised plenty of questions within the crypto community. Expert Clears The Air However, attorney and XRP supporter Bill Morgan explained that the post made several exaggerated claims. For starters, he clarified that Ripple doesn’t own 43% of XRP’s supply, as the post suggested. According to CoinMarketCap data, around 58.5% of XRP is in circulation, excluding what Ripple holds in escrow. Morgan also said that Ripple’s monthly sales from escrow make up just a small fraction of the total market volume and have no impact on price. In fact, evidence presented in the SEC lawsuit revealed that Ripple took measures to support XRP’s price, such as locking up large amounts of tokens in escrow to reduce market pressure. This post in the thread is over generalised to begin with. Firstly, Ripple does not own 43% of supply. even @CoinMarketCap publishes that the circulating supply (excluding what ripple holes outside escrow) is 58.5%. Secondly, what Ripple releases from escrow and sells each month… https://t.co/XnTBuHaZJ7 — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 5, 2025 He added that the SEC spent over 18 months investigating Ripple before filing the lawsuit, and if any proof of price manipulation existed, it would have been used in court. This, he argued, makes the suppression claims hard to believe. Further clarifying the situation, Morgan said that XRP’s price has historically followed the crypto market, moving in line with Bitcoin and Ethereum. This trend has remained consistent for the past four years, and little has changed to challenge that pattern.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-06 01:52:25

In the analysis, CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Aleman noted that these addresses have increased their exposure to ETH, even as the asset trades well below recent highs. Ethereum Holders Are Staying Put Despite Unrealized Loss Since reaching its cycle high of $4,107 in December 2024, ETH has experienced a sharp pullback of over 50%, currently trading around the $1,800 mark. Despite this steep correction, long-term ETH holders – particularly those behind accumulation addresses – have not been deterred. Instead of exiting their positions, they continue to hold firm.

Key On-Chain Metric Reveals Insights Interestingly, since March 10, on-chain data reveals that many of these accumulation addresses have entered unrealized loss territory. For context, ETH fell to a local low of $1,866 while its Realized Price stood at $2,026. For the uninitiated, an accumulation address is a crypto wallet that steadily receives and holds a particular asset – like Ethereum – without sending it out. These addresses are typically long-term holders, ones who have held ETH for more than 155 days. When accumulation addresses continue to acquire assets in the face of declining prices, it often signals that investors expect a bullish reversal in the near future. These wallets essentially represent “strong hands” in the market. Similarly, Realized Price is the average price at which all coins in a cryptocurrency network were last moved, calculated by dividing the total realized market cap by the circulating supply. It reflects the aggregate cost basis of holders and is often used to assess whether the market is in profit or loss. Since March 10, the Realized Price for these addresses has dropped by 2.32%, from $2,026 to $1,980 as of May 3. Yet, rather than scaling back, these addresses have increased their ETH holdings significantly. Aleman adds: Despite the continued downtrend, and even while in unrealized losses, accumulating addresses have not abandoned their strategy. Instead, they increased their ETH exposure: on March 10 they held 15.5356M ETH, and by May 3 this rose to 19.0378M ETH, a 22.54% increase, as seen in the ETH Cohort analysis and Balance on Accumulation Addresses. Has ETH Hit Market Bottom? While some analysts warn that ETH could fall further – possibly to as low as $1,200 – others believe that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap may have already bottomed out for this cycle.

A sudden $17 million whale activity spike has renewed focus on the Shiba Inu price prediction. AAVE, on the other hand, is holding its ground above key averages. The AAVE crypto price is pushing toward $196, possibly heading to $240 if bulls stay in control. But both face hesitations that leave room for doubt. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) skips the waiting game. Its Buyer Battles drop 50 million BDAG daily, with leftovers going to the day’s biggest buyer. This system turns buying into a smart move. Compared to SHIB and AAVE, BlockDAG isn’t reacting to market mood, it’s driving it. Among the top names right now, BlockDAG clearly runs the best crypto presale. Whale Surge Sparks Fresh Shiba Inu Price Prediction Buzz Shiba Inu (SHIB) is back in focus as whale activity jumps by 228%, moving $17 million worth of tokens daily. This sudden interest follows a quiet period and hints at renewed confidence. The Shiba Inu price prediction is gaining attention again, especially as May historically brings upward moves. While retail traders stay cautious, large holders are quietly accumulating. SHIB trades at $0.0000126, with major resistance between $0.0000140 and $0.0000190. Breaking that level could trigger a strong rally. The Shiba Inu price prediction also leans on Bitcoin’s recovery and easing macro fears. With sentiment shifting from fear to neutral, the Shiba Inu price prediction shows potential for a breakout if momentum continues. Aave Crypto Price Could Rally to $240 if Bulls Succeed The Aave crypto price is holding firm above key moving averages, showing positive sentiment as buyers step in on dips. Bulls are eyeing the $196 level, but resistance is expected there. If support holds near the 20-day EMA and the price breaks $180, a move to $220 or $240 is possible. Minor resistance at $190 might not hold back the momentum. However, if bears drag the Aave crypto price below the 50-SMA, it could slip to $155 and even touch $130. For now, steady buying and strong support levels hint at a bullish setup unless sellers regain control. Watching the $180–$196 zone is crucial for the next move. BlockDAG Buyer Battles Drop 50M BDAG Daily, Winner Takes the Leftovers BlockDAG has flipped the usual crypto game with something fresh – Buyer Battles. It has no private rounds, no gatekeeping, just a daily challenge open to everyone. Each day, 50 million BDAG coins are set aside. Buyers compete by purchasing, and the day’s biggest buyer takes home any unsold coins as a bonus. It’s not just a fair system, it turns buying into a strategy where bigger moves can lead to bigger wins. This model drives steady action and encourages frequent, bold participation. With BDAG priced at just $0.0019 until May 13, the timing works in favour of early buyers. Once listings go live and the price hits $0.05, those early gains show real weight. The daily battle setup doesn’t just engage users, it rewards them. It creates a path where retail buyers can win big without needing deep pockets or early access. This makes BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles more than just a promo, they’re a key reason it’s being seen as the best crypto presale in 2025. BlockDAG has already raised over $225 million and sold 19.6 billion coins, with 10 exchange listings confirmed, including one tier-one. Since Batch 1, the return has climbed by 2520%, highlighting strong momentum. Best Buys Right Now Shiba Inu is catching fresh attention with a $17 million whale move, reviving the Shiba Inu price prediction ahead of May’s typical uptrend. AAVE is also holding strong, with the AAVE crypto price aiming for $196 and beyond – if buyers stay in charge. But both rely on market shifts. BlockDAG isn’t waiting. Its Buyer Battles drop 50 million BDAG daily, giving leftover coins to the top buyer. No VIP access needed, just daily action. With a short-time discounted price $0.0019 entry and confirmed exchange listings, BlockDAG is setting the pace. Its early gains make it 2025’s best crypto presale.

The Dogecoin bullish signal is hard to ignore as patterns on the charts suggest a possible 200% price increase. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) whale action has sparked fresh discussion, with over $160 billion SHIB purchased by large holders within just two days. These developments are stirring speculative interest. However, beyond memes and volatility lies a more calculated opportunity. Web3 ai is not driven by hype but by real-time utility and AI-driven trading support. Powered by its $WAI token, the project delivers usable products now, not promises for later. With a presale targeting a 1747% ROI and a complete AI toolset already live, Web3 ai may quietly be the best crypto coin to buy at this pivotal market moment. Dogecoin Bullish Signal Points to a Possible Major Upswing Dogecoin has once again captured the attention of traders and analysts. The Dogecoin bullish signal is now supported by a visible cup-and-handle pattern that traditionally precedes large breakouts. If this pattern follows its usual trajectory, Dogecoin could experience gains of up to 200% from current levels. Investors watching Dogecoin must weigh the bullish setup against these longer-term concerns. While the upside is tempting, staying mindful of resistance levels and overall sentiment shifts is critical. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Whale Action Signals Confidence, But Questions Remain The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price has yet to break out, but whale wallets are making bold moves. In just 48 hours, over $160 billion SHIB tokens flowed into large holder addresses, suggesting growing confidence among seasoned market participants. This significant accumulation has renewed optimism around SHIB’s prospects. At the same time, price movements have not mirrored these inflows. Often in meme-based markets, whale activity can foreshadow major price shifts. Still, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) whale action must be viewed in context. The token continues to face challenges regarding sustainability, particularly around token burns and ecosystem growth. For SHIB to truly capitalize on whale interest, further development within its Layer 2 Shibarium and increased utility will likely be necessary. Until then, the moves by large holders serve as a speculative signal rather than a guaranteed breakout indicator. Web3 ai ($WAI): Combining AI, Utility, and a 1747% ROI Advantage While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu capture headlines, Web3 ai takes a much more strategic approach. It addresses the growing demand for tools that convert market data into meaningful, real-time trading decisions. Web3 ai’s AI-powered suite includes features like arbitrage discovery, sentiment analysis, yield optimization, and liquidity tracking, all actively working across Ethereum, Solana, BNB, and Polygon networks. What separates Web3 ai from traditional meme tokens is the depth of its ecosystem. The $WAI token is not just speculative. It serves multiple functions across the platform, including: Unlocking advanced AI trading and analysis tools Enabling staking for passive income and tiered access Facilitating governance and decision-making on future upgrades Supporting a deflationary model with revenue-driven token burns At the moment, Web3 ai’s crypto presale offers a unique advantage. Early investors can enter across 50 stages, starting at $0.0003 and concluding at $0.003267. With a confirmed listing price of $0.005242, this structure sets up a clear path to a 1747% ROI for early buyers. This positions Web3 ai firmly in the discussion for the best crypto coin to buy right now. Its combination of real products, growing adoption potential, and clear token utility presents an appealing alternative to hype-driven assets. Last Words Dogecoin’s bullish signal could result in significant gains if price patterns hold. Shiba Inu’s whale action demonstrates confidence that may lead to an eventual price surge. However, both remain heavily influenced by sentiment and market cycles. Web3 ai offers something far more aligned with forward-looking crypto trends. Its AI-enhanced platform is already live, helping traders make smarter decisions today. The $WAI token unlocks access to essential AI tools, while the presale offers a rare early-stage opportunity for impressive returns. As the platform grows and AI adoption expands throughout crypto markets, Web3 ai could quickly shift from promising newcomer to established market leader. For those seeking the best crypto coin to buy now , Web3 ai represents a logical and compelling choice. Early access does not just offer profit potential, it offers the chance to be part of crypto’s next major innovation wave.

You’re not chasing viral tokens or recycled ideas, you’re after real tech, solid use cases, and sustainable traction. That’s exactly what this guide brings. The following four crypto picks aren’t here because of temporary popularity, they’re driving real progress, backed by usage and development. Whether your focus is security, privacy, strong ecosystems, or practical utility, these projects check the right boxes. Cold Wallet, Chainlink, Monero, and Binance Coin continue to build and maintain relevance with actual usage and forward movement. Rather than short-term spikes, this list focuses on tokens tied to clear roles, ongoing development, and actual adoption. These are the top crypto gems to buy now if long-term value matters more to you than speculative hype. Cold Wallet: Top-Notch Security and Huge ROI Cold Wallet is reshaping what users expect from digital storage. By using zero-knowledge architecture and avoiding trackers, it offers a rare combination of privacy and usability. Its design brings cold storage safety with the flexibility found in hot wallets. With features like stealth address creation, private balances, and anonymous transfers already built into its MVP, users get powerful privacy tools without needing to master complex tech. The presale price of Cold Wallet’s $CWT token began at $0.00714, with a projected listing value of $0.3517, hinting at a potential return of 4,900%. It’s more than just a coin; $CWT activates features, grants governance rights, and unlocks loyalty perks within the ecosystem. More importantly, Cold Wallet isn’t focused on buzz, it’s executing a roadmap packed with exchange listings, cross-chain compatibility, and anonymous dApp access planned across Q3 and Q4. For those seeking digital privacy and real upside, Cold Wallet stands among the top crypto gems to buy now. Chainlink: Core Infrastructure Powering Web3 Chainlink is not focused on headlines, its value lies in being essential to Web3’s backbone. With a current trading price of $24.50 in April 2025 and over $120 million exiting exchanges lately, there’s growing belief in its long-term importance. The CCIP feature is now active on Hedera and heading to Ronin, enabling secure, multi-chain data and asset flow unmatched in scope. New updates to the developer suite, including the rollout of Chainlink Functions across networks and added support from partners like Monad under the SCALE initiative, show its ongoing technical evolution. Chainlink holds its spot by being the tech foundation others rely on. For those wanting exposure to dependable Web3 infrastructure, Chainlink is one of the top crypto gems to buy now. Monero: Real Privacy Without Shortcuts For anyone who wants complete control over financial privacy, Monero remains a go-to option. Now priced at $215.29, the coin saw a sharp jump from $150 to $165 in minutes during mid-April, reflecting renewed activity and belief in its utility. It’s more than just trading behavior, it shows strong faith in a privacy protocol that resists intrusion. With its latest upgrade (v0.18.4.0) and the Cuprate node redesign, Monero continues refining speed and future performance. Privacy features like stealth addresses, ring signatures, and hidden transaction values remain central. Long-term predictions suggest growth toward $454 this year and possibly $1,500 or more by 2031. For those serious about anonymity, Monero is clearly among the top crypto gems to buy now. Binance Coin: Key Asset Behind the Biggest Exchange BNB, currently priced at $610.67, is showing solid progress. Its recent Kraken listing broadens access to a wider audience. Alongside this, Binance is rolling out fresh chain integrations, product features, and enhanced trading tools. A major push by founder CZ also aims to simplify staking tools and unify yield systems. BNB remains deeply tied to Binance’s offerings, from reduced fees to early access to product launches and blockchain fuel. Owning BNB connects you to one of crypto’s busiest and most integrated platforms. Forecasts expect its price to touch $667 soon and possibly cross $1,000 within this year. With a strong use case and platform links, BNB is one of the top crypto gems to buy now if you’re seeking reliable utility. Wrapping Up! Cold Wallet, Chainlink, Monero, and BNB each deliver value that goes beyond short-term trends. Cold Wallet leads on privacy with real functionality and zero-knowledge features.

Bitcoin redefined digital assets as a global store of value. XRP reshaped international payments. Solana became the benchmark for fast, efficient decentralized applications. Now, MAGACOINFINANCE is entering the frame with early momentum and rising credibility. With shifting market dynamics, these four projects are not just chasing recovery—they’re setting the stage to break past their all-time highs. And investors tuned into early momentum are already paying attention. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Showing the Traits of a Future Leader While many new tokens enter the market, few manage to gain meaningful early traction. MAGACOINFINANCE is proving to be an exception. Rapid wallet growth, increased community engagement, and disciplined rollout strategies are already visible. The project’s leadership is actively engaging, and investor interest is rising steadily—quietly but significantly. This is a token being built with purpose. No gimmicks. No overhype. Just structured growth and strategic delivery. For those who recognize early-stage patterns, MAGACOINFINANCE is looking more like a contender than a question mark. Supporting Momentum: Tron, Sei, and the New Builders Tron continues to dominate in volume-based on-chain activity, particularly across markets demanding low fees and high-speed settlement. Sei is gaining developer attention for its speed-oriented infrastructure—tailored specifically for high-frequency trading applications. These are strong ecosystem players—but their early growth phase has already passed. MAGACOINFINANCE , on the other hand, is just getting started—where real upside often lies. Final Word Can XRP , Bitcoin , Solana , and MAGACOINFINANCE.COM set new highs in the next cycle? Momentum is aligning, sentiment is improving, and early entries are becoming harder to find. Of them all, MAGACOINFINANCE may be the one still hidden in plain sight—quietly preparing to lead the next wave.

BNB was once overlooked, trading for pennies—until it soared and left many regretting they didn’t jump in sooner. That opportunity’s long gone. Now, in 2025, a new contender is drawing major attention: Qubetics ($TICS). This isn’t just another token riding a wave of hype—it’s built to solve real problems with tools that support global payments, cross-border work, and practical blockchain applications. Already crowned the Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential, Qubetics is in presale mode and gaining serious momentum. For those who missed the BNB breakout, this might be the second chance they’ve been waiting for. Crypto’s Missed Jackpot: BNB’s Rise and the Lesson It Left Behind Crypto has always been about timing. Back in 2017, BNB was just a low-cost token linked to a new exchange. Nobody thought it would break records. But those who grabbed it early? They saw it climb from mere cents to over $600 at its peak. That kind of return isn’t just rare—it’s unforgettable. What made BNB so big was simple: use case and accessibility. It gave discounts, worked across Binance tools, and built hype. But today, the crypto crowd is more demanding. They want real-life use. They want something that’s not only tradable but useful outside exchanges. And that’s where the next big story begins—with Qubetics ($TICS), a fresh entry gaining traction fast and now crowned as the Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential by analysts and crypto circles alike. Why Qubetics Isn’t Just Another Coin—It’s the Bridge to Real-Life Financial Freedom Unlike meme tokens or single-use cryptos, Qubetics is designed for function. It’s a toolkit for freelancers, remote workers, creators, and business owners who want to get paid fast and send money across borders without stress. And it’s doing that through smart tech like: A non-custodial, multi-chain wallet that puts control back in users’ hands Built-in support for cross-border transactions Smart routing that reduces wait times and fees That’s why it’s being called the Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential in 2025. It’s not just crypto—it’s a business utility stack wrapped in blockchain. Here’s the current presale data: Stage: 33 Token Price: $0.2302 Tokens Sold: 511 million+ Holders: 25,800+ Funds Raised: $16.7 million+ Analysts are now projecting: $TICS at $1 = 334% ROI $TICS at $5 = 2071% ROI $TICS at $15 = 6414% ROI And there’s even buzz that $TICS could reach $10–$15 after mainnet launch. With applications this practical, the hype isn’t speculation—it’s demand. The Presale Pressure Is Building—But Time’s Running Out Stage 33 of the Qubetics crypto presale is almost sold out. At $0.2302, it’s still within reach—but not for long. Those watching it closely remember what missing BNB felt like. This feels oddly familiar.

Non-profit corporations and exchanges can now sell crypto in South Korea. Analysts think political interests are behind the new crypto guidelines. The South Korean Financial Services Commission has enacted a new set of guidelines, allowing the Asian country’s citizens to engage in cryptocurrency transactions. The latest development marks a landmark decision, setting June 2025 as the date when the new rules will kick in. According to reports, the Commission will allow non-profit corporations and virtual asset exchanges to sell digital assets. However, exchanges must structure their trading processes to minimize market impact when selling. In the meantime, the Commission will create a “Donation Review Committee” charged with supervising external audit corporations engaging in digital asset transactions.

The discussion draft, led by the House agricultural and financial services committee chairs Glenn Thompson and French Hill, is an “incremental, albeit meaningful, rewrite” of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), Paradigm’s vice president of regulatory affairs Justin Slaughter said in a May 5 X post. One-pager of the digital asset market structure discussion draft submitted by House Republicans on May 5. Source: US House Agriculture Committee One of the major changes from FIT21 is that the draft defines an affiliated person as anyone who owns more than 1% of a digital commodity issued by the project — down from 5% in the FIT21 bill — a move Slaughter said may curb the influence of big crypto firms and lead to more participation in the crypto market. “This is a portent of the entire bill. There are often criticisms of crypto being too dominated by a few large firms. This bill makes clear the regulatory regime proposed is going to push against that fact and strongly encourage more small-d ‘democratization’ of the space.” The draft also defines a “mature blockchain system” as one that, together with its related digital commodity, is not under the “common control” of any person or group. Source: Justin Slaughter The Securities and Exchange Commission would be the main authority regulating activity on crypto networks until they become sufficiently decentralized, Slaughter noted. The draft also clarified that decentralized finance trading protocols are those that enable users to engage in a financial transaction in a “self-directed manner.” Protocols that meet this criterion are exempt from registering as digital commodity brokers or dealers. The draft also referred to digital commodities as “investment contract assets” to distinguish their treatment from stocks and other traditional assets under the Howey test. According to Slaughter’s analysis, securities laws won’t be triggered unless the secondary sale of tokens also transfers ownership or profit in the underlying business. Crypto firms would also have a path to raise funds under the SEC’s oversight while also having a “clear process” to register their digital commodities with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the committee members said in a separate May 5 statement. Joint rulemaking, procedures, or guidelines related to crypto asset delisting must be established by the CFTC and SEC should a registered asset no longer comply with rules laid out by the regulators. A ‘clear opportunity’ to advance crypto innovation, rules once and for all Speaking about the need for a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework, the House committee members said crypto is a “clear opportunity” to advance innovation in the US — most notably through modernizing America’s financial infrastructure and reinforcing US dollar dominance. The Republicans criticized the previous Biden administration and the Gary Gensler-led SEC for adopting a regulation-by-enforcement strategy rather than creating clear rules for market participants. Related: VanEck files for BNB ETF, first in US Many crypto firms were stuck in “legal limbo” as a result of the unclear rules, which pushed some industry players overseas, where clearer rules exist, the House committee members said. “America needs to be the powerhouse for digital asset investment and innovation. For that to happen, we need a commonsense regulatory regime,” said Dusty Johnson, chairman of the subcommittee on commodity markets, digital assets and rural development. Slaughter added: “This is the bill that will, finally, provide a clear regulatory regime on crypto that many have been calling for.” Republicans already facing roadblocks over discussion draft House Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Maxine Waters plans to block a Republican-led event discussing digital assets on May 6, a Democratic staffer told Cointelegraph. The hearing, “American Innovation and the Future of Digital Assets,” is expected to discuss the new crypto markets draft discussion paper pitched by Thompson, Hill, and other committee members. However, according to the unnamed Democratic staffer, the current rules require all members of the House Financial Services Committee to agree on such hearings.

That’s exactly what’s happening with Bitcoin , Ethereum , Solana , and the rising contender, MAGACOINFINANCE . As the heavyweights strengthen their base, its early-stage players like MAGACOINFINANCE offer something even more compelling: early positioning before wider market recognition kicks in. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Quietly Building Toward Its Breakout Moment The quiet accumulation phase is often the most important—and MAGACOINFINANCE is deep in that zone right now. Wallet growth is increasing steadily, community expansion remains organic, and every update aligns with disciplined execution rather than overhyped noise. The signs are clear: this project is focused on longevity, not short-term swings. It’s moving like many successful early plays have before—purposefully, structurally, and with staying power. Those entering now aren’t chasing—they’re positioning. The Pillars: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Are Strengthening Foundations Bitcoin (BTC) continues to serve as the leading store of value in the crypto space, with institutional backing and ETF integration reinforcing its role in long-term portfolios. Ethereum (ETH) remains the infrastructure backbone for decentralized applications, with recent upgrades driving new levels of scalability and security across its ecosystem. Solana (SOL) is holding strong with developer momentum, fast execution speeds, and renewed attention from builders migrating to low-cost, high-performance networks. These three continue to define the top layer—but early-stage projects like MAGACOINFINANCE represent where the outsized return potential still exists. Strengthening Forces: Optimism, Aptos, and Chainlink Optimism is expanding Ethereum’s utility by reducing cost and congestion across smart contract activity. Aptos appeals to developers and users looking for next-gen performance and an improved user experience across decentralized platforms. Chainlink dominates the oracle space, integrating real-world data into blockchain environments with ever-growing reach and reliability. Each of these projects is valuable—but MAGACOINFINANCE offers the rare combination of early momentum and undervalued market position that few others still provide. Final Word Is a $1.5 million path truly unfolding? The combination of consolidation among market giants and strategic early-stage movement often leads to some of the crypto market’s most remarkable outcomes. Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana are showing strength—but MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is the one creating fresh momentum today. Those watching now may be the ones leading tomorrow.

Stablecoin legislation nearing next vote It is widely believed that two key pieces of legislation need to be passed into law in the US to cement the position of stablecoins. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act sets out clear definitions for “payment stablecoins” and reserve rules for stablecoin issuers. Lawmakers in the US Senate will move forward with a vote on the GENIUS stablecoin bill before May 26, according to reports. Meanwhile, the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act, which governs the approval and supervision of “federally qualified nonbank payment stablecoin issuers,” is also going through Congress. Tether is also planning to launch a US-based stablecoin later this year, with timing dependent on the passing of legislation.

In a post on X, Saylor shared a screenshot of Strategy’s Bitcoin portfolio tracker with the caption: “Too much blue, not enough orange.” Saylor Drops ‘Orange Dot’ Hint on X This cryptic message suggests the software firm may soon expand its already record-setting Bitcoin holdings. Notably, orange dots on the tracker represent each instance of Strategy buying Bitcoin. Strategy’s Massive Bitcoin Bet Deepens The company holds 553,555 BTC, worth approximately $52.8 billion, accounting for more than 2% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply. Saylor’s remark indicates plans to increase that total. Notably, similar posts in the past have often preceded Bitcoin acquisitions, typically announced on Mondays.

Naturally, traders are hunting for the next best altcoin to buy , and ADA and SOL often top those shortlists. But a fresh contender is storming onto the scene. While Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) may offer respectable upside (perhaps 150% gains over the next year), RCO Finance (RCOF) is carving out room for a potential 50,000% surge by year-end. Its trailblazing AI trading platform and DeFi innovations were already turning heads, but now, RCO Finance (RCOF) has secured a hefty $7.5 million VC check. That influx of institutional capital has ignited sky-high forecasts as retail money is expected to flood the presale following the news. Here’s why everyone’s pivoting to RCO Finance. Investors Tread Lightly Despite Cardano (ADA) and Solana Rebound (SOL) Bitcoin’s bounce back into the $95k level has traders buzzing about another bull run, shining a light once more on utility-driven tokens like Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL). Cardano (ADA) has clawed its way up to challenge the $0.71 barrier after dipping under $0.50 not long ago. Solana (SOL), meanwhile, has rallied past $160 after consolidating in the $140s. Momentum is there for sure, yet market veterans are advising restraint. They point to late 2024 when under-the-radar utility alts outpaced the big names by leaps and bounds once the rally really kicked in. In other words, the next 100x winners might not be the household names. Cardano vs. Solana vs. RCO Finance As traders scope out the best crypto to buy before the next explosion, many are passing on ADA and SOL, noting their upside feels capped at around 80%–150% in the coming 12 months. In contrast, RCO Finance (RCOF) presents a very different picture. Early presale investors have already zipped up 1,300%, and projections hint at another 18,000% boost when RCOF hits major exchanges. Now, with a top-tier VC plowing in $7.5 million, RCOF’s chance at 50,000% returns by the end of 2025 seems more than theoretical. The combination of institutional endorsement and grassroots enthusiasm is turbocharging the adoption of RCO Finance’s native token and setting the stage for some truly unprecedented price moves. Why VC Is Backing RCO Finance (RCOF) With $7.5 Million In under three months, RCO Finance (RCOF) has hit milestones that most projects have chased for years. Its Beta platform swelled from 10,000 to 285,000 active users, relying on its AI to steer trades. The presale racked up $17.3 million and has now secured a landmark $7.5 million VC injection in round 6. This kind of institutional involvement shifts RCOF from mere speculation to real contender status. What sets RCO Finance (RCOF) apart from other emerging crypto projects is democratizing advanced trading strategies. The Robo Advisor engine combs through over 100,000 assets (from crypto and stocks to bonds), using predictive analytics to flag patterns before they explode. It gauges everything: social sentiment spikes, clustered wallet moves, oddball liquidity surges. Picture how this would have worked during SHIB’s early breakout. The system would’ve logged on-chain accumulation by whale wallets, noticed a spike in tweets, and pinged users to buy in. As SHIB rocketed 100,000%, the Robo Advisor could’ve auto-sold when liquidity ebbed and sentiment cooled, locking in gains ahead of the slump. The same model applies to tokens like PEPE and TRUMP. RCO Finance (RCOF) watches post-tweet pumps, decodes chatter that precedes 100x runs, and refines its approach each cycle. With institutional-grade tools now in the hands of every RCOF holder, it’s no wonder a major VC just placed a $7.5 million bet after RCO Finance (RCOF), especially after passing a thorough SolidProof security audit . RCOF Presale: Round 6 Backers to See 50,000% Gains by EOY The RCO Finance presale is making headlines, and for good reason. With $17.3 million raised and the user base exploding from 10,000 to 285,000 in mere months, m fomentum is off the charts. Now, a fresh $7.5 million VC injection has lit a fire under Round 6 demand. Priced at $0.13, early backers are already up 1,300%, and experts insist that’s just the opening act. Analysts are now eyeing 50,000% gains by year-end, meaning a $600 bet today could flip into north of $300,000 before 2026. Of course, institutional capital and retail FOMO won’t wait for stragglers. Once Round 6 closes, the entry point will be a whole lot steeper on the open market. If you’ve been eyeing Cardano (ADA) and Solana’s (SOL) moves but want something with both rocket-fuel potential and real-world utility, RCO Finance (RCOF) could be the best altcoin to buy now. But round 6 won’t stay open long, so if you’re serious about securing life-changing gains, now’s the time to act.

BOSes – we did it. On May 4 2025, we successfully demoed the first *bridgeless* transfer of BTC between Bitcoin and Cardano mainnet. Performed with @SundialProtocol and @adahandle , using our all-new unchained token standard. Here’s what happened. pic.twitter.com/JO9xZKrLUE — BitcoinOS (@BTC_OS) May 5, 2025 BitcoinOS was able to successfully bring 1 BTC token to the Cardano blockchain, before sending it back to Bitcoin without issues. But that news failed to ignite much excitement, with the Cardano price last around $0.65, having broken below key technical support. After a solid recovery rally in recent weeks on hopes that US President Donald Trump would back off from his trade war, crypto markets are coming under pressure once again. Now down well over 10% from late-April highs, ADA has slipped back below its 21 and 50DMAs, as well as short-term support in the $0.67 area. Nerves are understandably high ahead of an FOMC rate decision on Wednesday – the central bank could issue hawkish monetary policy guidance, potentially pressuring risk assets. Traders also seem to be weighing fresh trade war-related developments, which have been the catalyst for a lot of crypto market volatility in recent weeks. These macro themes are for now stealing the attention from bullish Cardano developments behind the scenes, such as BitcoinOS’s latest successful Cardano bridging demo. Cardano is setting out to become the go-to Bitcoin DeFi side chain in the year’s ahead. According to popular crypto analyst Dan Gambardello, this makes Cardano “the best positioned bluechip altcoin for a crypto bull market”. Bitcoin has officially been sent to Cardano and back to Bitcoin. Cardano is the best positioned bluechip altcoin for a crypto bull market. pic.twitter.com/WpQmD11mJd — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) May 5, 2025 Cardano Price Prediction – New Lows Coming? Whilst Cardano might be positioned to perform well in a future crypto bull market, that bull market is not currently here. Macro risks remain elevated – trade tensions might have peaked for now, but upside risks to US inflation and downside risks to the US economy are high. The US Treasury Yield Curve has steepened SHARPLY: The difference between the 10-year and the 2-year Treasury yields has been positive for over 6 months. In the past, once the yield curve turned sharply positive, the US economy was in a recession. Is history repeating? pic.twitter.com/HxP38DbIOz — Global Markets Investor (@GlobalMktObserv) May 5, 2025 Prior altcoin seasons have come in environments of major Fed policy easing. That doesn’t appear to be on the horizon any time soon. So traders would do well not to get overly aggressive chasing Cardano price rallies on the anticipation that “a new altcoin season is here”. It won’t be hear until the Fed and other major global central banks are pumping liquidity, and optimism about the economy’s long-term outlook has returned. In such an environment, its better to embrace the choppy and directionless nature of the market, and trade what you see on the charts. ADA’s short-term technical outlook has soured so far this week. That suggests a retest of recent lows in the $0.50s could be on the cards. Accumulate ADA on the Dip? Despite a bearish short-term outlook and a uncertain medium-term outlook, Cardano presents a compelling long-term investment opportunity. While trailing rivals such as Ethereum and Solana in terms of adoption, Cardano’s robust fundamentals and strategic roadmap position it for significant growth, potentially reaching $10 by the end of Trump’s term in 2029. Investors should thus view the current range-bound price action as a chance to accumulate. Cardano’s blockchain excels in scalability, sustainability, and security, leveraging its Ouroboros proof-of-stake protocol. Its focus on rigorous academic research ensures a resilient foundation, distinguishing it from competitors. A key bullish narrative is Cardano’s ambition to become the premier Bitcoin DeFi chain, enabling seamless integration of Bitcoin’s liquidity into decentralized finance applications. Initiatives like the Midnight protocol, enhancing privacy, and partnerships in emerging markets further bolster its ecosystem. BREAKING NEWS MIDNIGHT WILL BRING MILLIONS OF USERS TO CARDANO @IOHK_Charles reveals that Midnight has been very well received and could bring millions of users to the Cardano network. The concept of hybrid applications, whether $BTC , $ETH , $SOL , or $ADA to Midnight,… pic.twitter.com/PDYrcZWr4N — Mintern (@MinswapIntern) April 12, 2025 Macro uncertainties may cap near-term gains, but Cardano’s methodical development and growing use cases—spanning DeFi , supply chain, and identity solutions—signal substantial upside. That’s especially the case against the backdrop of a historically favorable global regulatory backdrop for the crypto industry, spearheaded by the ardently pro-crypto Trump administration’s efforts to bolster the industry. However, with a market cap still modest compared to rivals, Cardano offers asymmetric return potential. Strategic investors can capitalize on current consolidation to build positions in a blockchain poised for exponential growth over the next four years.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, the Tron public relations team confirmed that on May 2, the Tron DAO account posted a contract address and sent direct messages to solicit payments in exchange for promotional advertising on the Tron account. “Our security team quickly identified the intrusion and cut off access to the hacker, but we ask the community to continue to be vigilant. We will never ask anyone for payments like this via DM or otherwise,” they said. The team said that based on the illicit contract address the hacker posted, the amount improperly solicited appeared to be around $45,000. Asked whether the same hacker could be responsible for the supposed New York Post’s X account hack on May 3, the Tron team told Cointelegraph that there “appear to be some similarities” between the two security incidents; however, they also cautioned that the investigation is ongoing and “any definitive connection would be premature.” After regaining access, Tron DAO said in a May 2 X update that they suspect the hack resulted from a team member being “targeted in a malicious social engineering attack, which led to their account being compromised.” Source: Tron DAO “Even after the perpetrator was logged out and our access restored, they continued contacting others, offering posts from our main account in exchange for payment,” Tron DAO said. The Tron team is still investigating and says they are in contact with law enforcement. Tron founder Justin Sun also accused crypto exchange OKX of failing to act on a law enforcement request to freeze stolen funds connected to the attack. OKX founder and CEO Star Xu has publicly denied the allegation, and Sun has removed the original post with the accusation. Curve Finance joins list of X account hacks Decentralized lending protocol Curve Finance also recently suffered an X account takeover by a bad actor, adding to the growing list of high-profile firms and individuals “silently” accessed by social media hackers. In a now-deleted May 5 X post, a scammer posing as Curve Finance shared a link to a CRV airdrop with a weeklong registration period, which some eagle-eyed X users quickly suspected could be fraudulent. Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov confirmed in a reply to analyst CrediBULL Crypto that it was a bad actor posting sham links so far, “No other account appears to be hacked — the control over X account was just silently taken by someone.” Source: CrediBULL Crypto The Curve Finance team has since regained access with the help of a team that included the cybersecurity group SEAL, and found that aside from posting scam links, the hacker also blocked some users who flagged the account takeover, including CrediBULL Crypto. The cause of the hack has yet to be shared publicly, but in response to a user’s query, the Curve finance team said it’s still “unclear how account” access was taken, and there was “No sign of any client-side compromise.” Source: Curve Finance Other high-profile X account hacks A slew of other high-profile X accounts have also been taken over by bad actors this year. On April 15, a member of the UK’s Parliament, Lucy Powell, had her account taken over to promote a scam crypto token called the House of Commons Coin (HOC). Crypto data aggregator Kaito AI and its founder, Yu Hu, were the victims of an X social media hack on March 15 , when scammers posted that the Kaito wallets were compromised and users' funds were at risk.

The bears even pushed the price below the $1,800 level, but the price found support near the $1,785 support level.

On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $1,820 level. The next key resistance is near the $1,830 level and the trend line. The first major resistance is near the $1,880 level. A clear move above the $1,880 resistance might send the price toward the $1,920 resistance. An upside break above the $1,920 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,000 resistance zone or even $2,050 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,830 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,785 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,734 swing low to the $1,872 high. The first major support sits near the $1,750 zone. A clear move below the $1,750 support might push the price toward the $1,720 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,685 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,640.

Right now, four assets are catching the attention of strategic investors: XRP , Ethereum , Bitcoin , and the fast-rising MAGACOINFINANCE . While the larger caps hold steady, it’s early-phase entries like MAGACOINFINANCE that could define the next growth wave—and the window may still be open. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Preparing for a Major Lift-Off Spotting a strong project before the crowd is rare—but MAGACOINFINANCE is offering just that kind of window right now. Wallet growth is consistent. Community engagement is rising without artificial spikes. Developer updates are arriving on time, and early-stage capital is quietly moving in before mainstream exposure. There’s no shortcut being taken—just disciplined execution and strategic growth. For investors seeking uninflated value and authentic early-stage positioning, MAGACOINFINANCE may be one of the final high-upside opportunities in this cycle. Other Movers in the Spotlight: Cardano, NEAR Protocol, Kaspa, and Arbitrum Cardano continues to lead with its research-driven approach to secure smart contract deployment and sustainability. NEAR Protocol is accelerating adoption through its developer-friendly design and seamless onboarding for dApp builders. Kaspa appeals to performance-focused users with its proof-of-work blockDAG model—offering speed, scalability, and security. Arbitrum is dominating the Ethereum Layer-2 space, delivering efficient scaling and lower gas costs for decentralized applications. While each of these platforms is building critical infrastructure, MAGACOINFINANCE offers the kind of early-stage, undervalued momentum that is increasingly rare. Final Word Can $750 really become $850K ? For those who’ve studied crypto cycles, it’s clear: timing and early conviction matter. XRP , Bitcoin , and Ethereum offer enduring strength. But MAGACOINFINANCE.COM offers discovery-phase growth—and that’s exactly where major wealth shifts have historically begun.

After briefly climbing late last month, Bitcoin has struggled to maintain upward momentum since then. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at approximately $94,305, reflecting a modest 1.3% decline over the past day. While price action has slowed, activity on the backend of the market suggests underlying shifts in investor behavior. New on-chain data points to a significant decrease in Bitcoin reserves held on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Related Reading: Bitcoin ATH Incoming? Analyst Flags Indicators That Preceded Every Major BTC Rally One of CryptoQuant’s contributors, Amr Taha, highlighted the development in a recent QuickTake post, signaling that over 51,000 BTC have been withdrawn from Binance wallets since mid-April. This drop from roughly 595,000 BTC to around 544,500 BTC could indicate a recalibration in investor strategy, with growing interest in long-term holding or redeployment of assets outside centralized platforms. What’s Driving the Bitcoin Outflows from Binance? According to Taha, multiple factors may be contributing to this steep decline in exchange-held reserves. One explanation involves institutional investors and long-term holders moving their Bitcoin into cold storage. This off-exchange behavior is typically interpreted as a signal of longer-term conviction, as these participants seek to secure assets while reducing the likelihood of short-term selling. Given the rise of custodial solutions and more institutional-grade wallets, this trend may reflect maturing market behavior. Another key factor could be the increasing use of Bitcoin within decentralized finance (DeFi) and cross-platform arbitrage strategies. Taha noted that entities may be withdrawing BTC to access yield opportunities or deploy capital in other blockchain ecosystems. Additionally, the recent positive flows into Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), especially between April 21 and May 1, where daily net inflows crossed the $2 billion mark on several occasions, may have encouraged larger players to accumulate and withdraw Bitcoin in anticipation of further price appreciation. Exchange Reserve Trends Offer Signals Amid Price Consolidation Though Bitcoin’s price has remained largely stagnant over the past week, the shift in exchange reserve data could carry significant implications for future price action. Historically, a decrease in exchange reserves, particularly from major venues like Binance, has been associated with supply tightening. As fewer coins are readily available for sale, reduced liquidity can amplify the impact of incoming demand, especially in bullish phases. Taha emphasized that while short-term market performance may appear indecisive, tracking reserve metrics offers important clues about underlying sentiment.

A consistent drawdown of BTC from exchange platforms often sets the stage for renewed price movement, especially when accompanied by institutional accumulation and long-term holding behavior. If these patterns persist, they may contribute to reduced sell-side pressure, enabling Bitcoin to challenge its next resistance zones, including the psychological $100,000 level.

This makes Gemini the 15th exchange to support RLUSD, adding momentum to its growing adoption. The announcement was teased earlier with a cryptic acrostic message that highlighted “RLUSD,” sparking buzz within the XRP community. NEW: $RLUSD is now available for trading on Gemini Deposits & withdrawals are enabled Buy, sell, and store today: https://t.co/Vd2sae45kn pic.twitter.com/4g4t226sF7 — Gemini (@Gemini) May 5, 2025 Following the Gemini listing, RLUSD’s 24-hour trading volume soared to over $43 million, marking a 15% increase. The growing bullish sentiment shows RLUSD is gaining traction fast, both among retail users and institutions. Crypto influencer Amelie pointed out that Gemini may have subtly teased Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD by using a sentence with capitalized letters spelling “RLUSD”, sparking buzz in the XRP community. However, Gemini has not responded anything on this cryptic message format. RLUSD’s Bold Moves On May 5, Ripple donated $25 million in RLUSD to support public education in the U.S., distributing funds through DonorsChoose and Teach For America. The initiative is aimed at equipping underserved classrooms with supplies and tech, reinforcing Ripple’s mission to tie real-world use to its digital assets. Ripple is also integrating RLUSD into its enterprise-grade Ripple Payments product, allowing institutions to use the stablecoin for cross-border transactions. In a strategic move, Ripple acquired prime brokerage Hidden Road for $1.25 billion and plans to use RLUSD as collateral in institutional settlement services. What’s Next in Stablecoin Regulations? Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD is now listed on 15 exchanges, including Gemini, Bitstamp, Uphold, and Revolut, making it easier for people to buy, trade, and use it worldwide. Moreover, the U.S. was close to setting rules for stablecoins through the GENIUS Act, but things are now on shaky ground. Some Democrats who once supported it are pulling back, saying the latest version isn’t strong enough on safety and fraud prevention. On top of that, controversy over a Trump-linked stablecoin deal in Dubai is making the situation messier.

In November 2023, both CZ and Binance pleaded guilty to several charges related to money laundering and regulatory violations. To settle the case, Binance agreed to pay over $4.3 billion in fines. Initially facing a three-year prison sentence, CZ’s punishment was reduced to four months after his legal team argued he was not directly involved in the wrongdoing. In an interview with Farokh Radio, CZ opened up about his experience and described prison as an extremely difficult experience. Despite his calm personality and high tolerance for stress, he admitted the process was frightening. From strip searches to sharing a cell with a double-murder convict, CZ said nothing about prison was easy or glamorous. “It was extremely hard when you go through it. I can laugh about it now, but it’s not funny — it’s not fun at all. I wouldn’t wish that experience on anyone. My first cellmate was a double murderer. Once you’re in there, no one cares who you are. They just treat you like anyone else,” he said. He explained that while he was not mistreated, he was not given any special treatment either. Most guards and inmates did not know who he was, and he was monitored like any other prisoner. Since he is not a U.S. citizen, CZ was placed in a low-security prison instead of minimum-security, which is typical for white-collar offenders. CZ said that prison was mentally stressful. One of his biggest fears was that his sentence could be extended unexpectedly, which he said happens to many inmates. Even after serving his four months, immigration issues caused delays in his release, and he was temporarily held in a detention center. Despite the challenges, CZ said that most of the inmates were respectful and that he had no conflicts during his time in prison. He also revealed that he’s writing a book that will include more details about his experience.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-06 03:37:04

Released by the House Financial Services and Agriculture Committees , the new draft attempts to draw a clear line between who regulates what in the crypto space. SEC vs CFTC: A Split in Oversight Unlike the earlier FIT21 proposal , which drew heat for weakening the SEC’s role, this updated bill strikes a more balanced approach. The SEC will continue to oversee crypto tokens that are considered investment contracts, while the CFTC will take the lead on crypto commodities. According to Paradigm’s Justin Slaughter , the bill keeps the CFTC in the driver’s seat but allows the SEC some control until projects prove they are truly decentralized. Interestingly, there’s now a formal “decentralization test.” A project must not be under the control of a single party, and large holders (those with over 10%) must be disclosed while it remains centralized. The bill also defines when a blockchain is considered “mature.” Notably, a blockchain must be open, functional, and not centrally owned — with no more than 20% held by any single party. Retail investors also get a break. They no longer need to meet high income or wealth requirements to participate. This opens the door for everyday people to invest in crypto, not just the wealthy elite. DeFi and Stablecoins Get Some Clarity DeFi protocols that are fully automated and don’t hold user funds might also avoid strict regulations under this bill. It also addresses stablecoins , providing a definition for them but not classifying them as securities.

Despite a recent pullback from its all-time high (ATH) of over $109,000, BTC has rebounded from its April lows near $75,000 to consolidate above $94,000, putting 88% of its circulating supply in profit. Market Reset with Strong Fundamentals Glassnode reported that Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has cooled off to its long-term mean of 1.74. According to the analytics firm, historically, such a reset level often corresponds with phases of market consolidation, with the latest seen in an August 2022 drawdown where unrealized gains were similarly trimmed before another leg upward. Meanwhile, the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio has gone above 1.0 again, pointing to a change in sentiment as traders move from underwater positions to take modest profits. Per Glassnode’s analysis , the development indicates that the market has enough liquidity and confidence to absorb the realized gains, which is an important sign of strength. Macro indicators seem to agree, with analyst Axel Adler Jr indicating that the 30-day change in Bitcoin’s Composite Volatility Index remains at -3.5%, suggesting that the market is still in an accumulation phase. According to Adler, panic-selling phases usually emerge when the index climbs above 15%, further strengthening the notion that the majority of market participants are quietly positioning for a bigger price boost. Consolidation Before the Next Move? However, BTC’s current market movement paints a more tempered short-term picture. At the time of writing, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap was down a slight 1.3% in the last 24 hours and was trading at $94,306 after oscillating between intraday opposites of $93,806 and $95,741. It had also slipped 0.9% over the past week, but still remained up 8.5% across two weeks. Additionally, the asset has gained 13% in the last 30 days, and is also just 13% away from its ATH. Still, risks remain. As BTC approaches the psychological $100,000 mark, a level linked with aggressive distribution by long-term holders in past cycles, observers are wary of a potential influx of supply. Glassnode warns that sustaining upward momentum from here will require equally strong demand to absorb any profit-taking. Whether this comes from continued ETF inflows , corporate treasury buys , or retail interest remains the key question as May rolls along.

Trump Price Prediction After Sudden $800M Volume Dump,https://cryptonews.com/news/smart-money-exiting-trump-price-prediction-after-sudden-800m-volume-dump/,"Trump Coin (TRUMP) price predictions are becoming more bearish, amid a sudden $800 million volume dump at the start of the week amid speculation that smart money might be exiting the meme coin. The TRUMP price was last around $11 per token, a 5% drop from earlier Monday highs, putting its market cap around $2.2 billion per CoinMarketCap . However, trading volumes spiked up to $800 million in the past 24 hours, possibly a sign that smart money might be on the move out of the meme coin with President Trump seemingly in hot water in Congress. Senate Democrats came together to block the passage of an important stable coin bill amid concerns that the bill might directly help to line the pockets of the Trump family.

Trump Coin Price Prediction – More Downside Coming Macro uncertainties remain exceedingly high heading into this week’s FOMC meeting, where the Fed could dampen risk appetite if they come across overly hawkish. The US economy faces both upside risks to inflation (thanks to tariffs and associated supply chain disruptions) and downside risks to economic growth (again, thanks to tariffs and associated supply chain disruptions). That’s a very difficult environment for the Fed, and investors more broadly to operate in. And this isn’t exactly the right environment for a new meme coin season. Quite the opposite in fact. That suggests that the TRUMP price is likelier to fall in the weeks and months ahead than it is to rally. That said, the ever present risk that President Trump, the Trump family, of the White House manipulates the price is there.

The legislation would establish federal oversight for payment-focused stablecoins and create standards aimed at promoting safety and transparency in digital asset markets. Initially, GOP leaders argued that codifying clear rules would encourage innovation and help the US maintain its edge over rivals in the burgeoning crypto sector. Fast-Track Move on GENIUS Triggers Democratic Withdrawal They moved quickly after Senate Majority Leader John Thune launched a fast-track process last week to tee up the floor text without further committee revisions. However, nine Democrats who once backed the bill announced on Saturday that they could not vote for its current form . “We have approached this process constructively and with an open mind, with the understanding that additional improvements to the bill would be made,” they said.

Floor Text Surprise Adds to Democratic Discontent Moreover, key senators who advanced the measure in March faulted leadership for stripping out negotiated improvements. Sen. Ruben Gallego wrote on X that Democrats “were trying to negotiate with the Republicans for weeks.” He added that the version heading to the floor “back-pedaled on a lot of the progress we made.” Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers complained that they saw the floor text for the first time when it went public. Critics Say Trump’s Crypto Ties Warrant Deliberation Next, critics flagged new crypto ventures by former President Trump and his family. They argued these deals warranted a slowdown. World Liberty Financial unveiled a proposed $2b transaction with Binance that would use its own stablecoin. Sen. Elizabeth Warren referenced this deal , while urging colleagues to delay the bill. She warned “the Trump family stablecoin surged to seventh largest in the world because of a shady crypto deal with the United Arab Emirates.” In response, House Democrats scheduled a separate hearing to examine Trump’s crypto activities, including his meme coin and the World Liberty arrangement. They argue that rushing a broad regulatory framework without addressing potential conflicts could open the door to corruption. As Democratic support erodes, the GENIUS Act’s prospects become increasingly uncertain. Republicans and the White House had aimed to secure stablecoin and trading-structure reforms by August. Now they face the risk of postponement or significant rewrites if the floor vote fails to win bipartisan backing.

MAGACOINFINANCE Is Moving Faster Than the Market Realizes Smart investors watch for subtle but steady signals—and MAGACOINFINANCE is delivering exactly that. Wallet numbers are increasing rapidly. The community is expanding without artificial hype. And developer updates are landing on schedule, building consistent trust. Momentum isn’t speculative anymore—it’s structural and strengthening. This setup feels familiar: similar to early Bitcoin cycles and Solana’s breakout stages. Those who enter now could find themselves ahead of the curve—before the broader market arrives. Accelerating Momentum: Watch These Additional Movers Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the smart contract world, though network congestion and high fees keep alternative chains and Layer-2s in focus. Polygon remains a leader in Ethereum scaling, with major partnerships and real-world integrations driving continued growth. Tron still commands impressive on-chain volume, particularly across stablecoin and international payment flows. Arbitrum leads Ethereum Layer-2 scaling efforts, attracting dApp developers who demand lower fees and higher performance. All are relevant—but when it comes to pure early discovery opportunity, MAGACOINFINANCE stands apart with clear upside potential. Final Word Could $1,100 realistically become $3.2 million ?

It has announced the agenda and panelists for the event, where top Wall Street leaders will join to discuss the future of finance. The event titled “Tokenization — Moving Assets Onchain: Where TradFi and DeFi Meet” is scheduled for May 12 at the agency’s headquarters in Washington, D.C., where the event will explore how TradFi and DeFi meet through blockchain-based asset movement. The event will be open to the public and webcast live on the SEC’s website. SEC’s Peirce Calls Tokenization Game-Changer SEC Chair Paul Atkins will deliver the keynote address at the event. Commissioner Hester M. Peirce opened up about the importance of the event, calling Tokenization a technological development that could change many aspects of the financial markets. “I look forward to hearing ideas from our panelists on how the SEC should approach this area,” she said. The event has two key sessions scheduled: “Capital Markets 2.0,” led by Jeff Dinwoodie from the law firm Cravath, and “The Future of Tokenization,” headed by Tiffany Smith from WilmerHale. The session will focus on the long-term implications, use cases, and how regulators may react to tokenized assets in capital markets. BlackRock, Fidelity, Robinhood Join In The roundtable will feature panelists from Wall Street Giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, Nasdaq, and Robinhood. Participants include Robert Mitchnick (BlackRock), Cynthia Lo Bessette (Fidelity), Eun Ah Choi (Nasdaq), Will Geyer (Invesco), Sandy Kaul (Franklin Templeton), Christine Moy (Apollo Management), among others. Representatives from Robinhood, Maple Finance, Securitize, and Blockchain Capital will also share their views at the event.

The quarterly XRP Markets provides transparency into Ripple’s XRP holdings and updates on the state of the crypto markets and the XRP ecosystem. “However, the reality is that the report has not had the intended effect,” Ripple said in its Q1 2025 report Monday. “In many instances, Ripple’s transparency has been used against the company, most notably by former SEC leadership.” “As more institutions engage with XRP, additional perspectives and insights are expected to follow, pushing the market conversation forward,” it added. This comes amid a flurry of XRP-based ETF filings in the U.S. and Brazil, with a leveraged XRP ETF already offered to investors since April. XRP delivered one of the strongest performances among major cryptocurrencies in Q1 2025, surging nearly 50% in early February and outpacing both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) during a period marked by market turbulence and rising macroeconomic uncertainty. While BTC remained range-bound and ETH trended lower, XRP stood out for its relative strength, with the XRP/BTC ratio rising more than 10% during the quarter, the report noted. That strength was matched by growing institutional interest. XRP-based investment products recorded $37.7 million in net inflows during the quarter, pushing the year-to-date total to $214 million, just $1 million shy of surpassing ETH-focused funds. XRP spot market activity remained robust throughout the quarter. Average daily volumes hovered around $3.2 billion, with Binance maintaining a dominant share at 40%, followed by Upbit and Coinbase. Price volatility spiked in February, pushing realized volatility to around 130%, as XRP touched levels not seen since early 2018. On-chain activity on the XRP Ledger moderated after a period of expansion in late 2024. Wallet creation and transaction volume dropped by 30–40%, in line with broader slowdowns across Layer 1 networks. However, XRP DeFi activity showed resilience, with DEX volume slipping just 16% quarter-over-quarter. RLUSD was a key driver of activity, with its market cap surpassing $90 million and cumulative DEX trading volume crossing $300 million.",Markets|News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-06 04:34:18

That’s what Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, laid out during a market segment this week, where he broke down why he thinks the rebound in crypto points directly to more upside for equities. This came as investors braced for the Federal Reserve decision, while stocks pulled back slightly on Monday. Tom said the bottom was already in. He reminded viewers that he’d called 5500 for the S&P 500 weeks ago, and the market hit that without resistance. “Bitcoin is above its April 2nd level,” Tom said. “Bitcoin is telling us the S&P should recover towards the 5800 level in the near term. That’s still upside from here.” He pointed to how the crypto’s performance tends to lead risk-on sentiment, and this pattern is still intact. Tom Lee says tariff fears are fading fast Tom said that although tariff fears could resurface, the macro picture looks better now than it did in early April. He said April 7 was the peak for tariff panic and conditions since then have improved. Tom also pointed to signs from other assets that lead stocks. Credit markets, high-yield bonds, and the VIX are all signaling reduced stress. “High yield has recovered almost all the widening that happened since April 7,” he added. Tom explained that the VIX term structure is now inverted, which tells him volatility is calming down. He said that sets the stage for stocks to move higher. Looking ahead, he said 2026 offers potential confidence, especially if there’s deregulation and better comparisons for corporate earnings. If new tariff rules open the door to more exports, then earnings could get another boost. Tom wasn’t pretending the rally to new highs will be easy though. “The bar for recovering to all-time highs is of course higher,” he said, but made it clear that the current setup is favorable. “The risk reward is actually still positive here,” he added. He said the market can still go higher, even with all the noise. Tom Lee points to crypto and commodities for direction Tom said companies have proved they can handle shocks. He pointed to Covid, inflation, and even the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes. “Companies survived a bullwhip effect on the economy. They survived a surge in inflation. They survived the Fed hiking at the fastest rate ever,” he said. He expects earnings to beat forecasts again, especially if conditions stabilize. Tom listed off names that had been dragging the market down—Tesla, the Magnificent Seven, and Bitcoin—but said they’re all rebounding now. “They’ve begun to recover,” he said, before stressing again that Bitcoin is already ahead of its April 2 price and that’s the biggest clue that stocks should follow. Fundstrat’s Tom also slammed the Fed for sitting on their hands while the European Central Bank is already cutting rates. He pointed out that the ECB’s inflation measure leaves out shelter costs. If the Fed did the same, Tom said, “Core inflation here would be lower than Europe’s.” Still, US interest rates are 125 basis points tighter than the ECB, which he said makes no sense. He said it’s easy to see the argument for the Fed to start cutting now, even before the full effects of tariffs show up. But he also questioned if Trump’s pressure might have boxed Chair Jerome Powell in. If inflation drops but growth slows, Powell might get blamed. “It sets him up to possibly be the fall guy,” Tom said .

Despite initial momentum, price action has leveled off after failing to break out of this corridor in March. XRP ( XRP ) is currently trading at about $2.14, down 1.2% over the last day and more than 8% over the previous week. On-chain activity shows a similar picture to the stalling of price movement. According to Santiment data , the number of daily active addresses on the XRP Ledger has significantly dropped, averaging roughly 40,000, the lowest since November 2024. This is a huge drop from March, when daily activity consistently hovered around 300,000 and peaked at over 612,000 on March 19. XRP price and daily addresses.

The moving average convergence divergence indicator points to a short-term downward trend. XRP price analysis.

Only the 200-day estimated moving average, which is currently trading at $1.99, is providing some support. A deeper correction toward the 200-day average or even lower may be possible if XRP breaks below $2.03 with significant volume, particularly if on-chain activity stays weak. However, a clean move above $2.30 might lead to a breakout in the direction of the next significant resistance level, which is close to $2.45. XRP appears to be in a holding pattern at the moment. Low user activity and a decline in transaction volume may hurt sentiment, despite the Securities and Exchange Commission’s legal pressure having eased and new developments growing.

According to data from crypto.news price tracker , Pi Network’s ( PI ) trading volume has dropped by over 35% in the past 24 hours, to about $46.8 million. This is a significant decrease from the over $800 million at the start of mainnet trading. Pi is currently trading at about $0.59, 80% below its peak of $2.99. The token has dropped 11.4% over the past month, continuing a gradual decline that doesn’t appear to be stopping anytime soon. In a shorter timeframe, it has decreased 3.3% in the last week and 0.1% in the last 24 hours. A key reason for the decline is supply pressure. According to PiScan data , the network is set to unlock 231 million new PI tokens in May and another 222 million in June. Over the next year, over 1.4 billion tokens, worth over $850 million, will enter circulation. Due to dwindling demand and fewer liquidity outlets, this supply pressure could lead to further price declines.

In terms of listing , PI is still unavailable on popular exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Even though trading is available on OKX, Bitget, and MEXC, setbacks like BitMart’s trading pause and HTX’s delisting have undermined market confidence. Development on the network offers a more promising outlook. By June, a full SDK release is expected, which could facilitate the development of third-party decentralized applications and boost actual on-chain activity. On the technical side, PI is trading sideways just below the $0.60 resistance with mixed signals from momentum indicators. The relative strength index is 40.87, which suggests that the market is weak but not oversold. PI has continuously hovered below all significant moving averages from the 10- to 50-day range, indicating that the overall trend is still downward.

Credit: crypto.news A short-term recovery toward $0.67 is possible if the price can break above and hold the $0.62 level.

Bitcoin Is Currently Retesting A Major Supply Cluster In a new post on X, analyst Checkmate has talked about how Bitcoin is looking based on its UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD). The URPD is an on-chain indicator that tells us about what part of the BTC supply was last purchased at the different price levels that the cryptocurrency has visited in its history. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovery Fueled By Almost $19 Billion In Crypto Inflows, Data Shows Below is the chart for the metric that the analyst shared in the post. As is visible in the graph, a notable part of the Bitcoin supply was purchased around the price range that BTC has been trading inside recently. In particular, there seem to be two massive supply clusters at these levels. When Checkmate shared the chart yesterday, the cryptocurrency’s price was trading right between the two supply walls. That is, investors who bought in the lower of the walls were in the green and those who did at the upper one were underwater. The analyst called the asset’s location as being “right in the middle of a decision point.” This is because of the fact that any large move up or down from that point would have an effect on the profit-loss status of a large amount of addresses. In on-chain analysis, large supply walls under the spot BTC price are assumed to be locations of probable support, as the investors who bought there might defend their break-even mark during a retest. Similarly, the levels above can act as resistance, as those holders might take the opportunity to sell the cryptocurrency and get out with the whole of their investment back. Since the post, Bitcoin has seen a small pullback, so the asset is now leaning toward the green supply zone. It’s possible that this area would help keep BTC from falling under, given the large amount of supply that was purchased inside it.

As Checkmate puts it, “all it will take is one big red or green candle from here to convince people of a lower high, or bull continuation, respectively.” Bitcoin is currently also near a macro on-chain support level: the short-term holder Realized Price. As CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has explained in an X post, this level is situated at $93,364. The short-term holder Realized Price refers to the average cost basis of the Bitcoin holders who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. This level has historically served as a boundary between bullish and bearish trends for BTC. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $94,000, down 1.5% in the last 24 hours.

MAGACOINFINANCE and XRP are climbing the ranks quickly, with a clear uptick in engagement and positioning. Meanwhile, names like Solana (SOL) , Kaspa (KAS) , and Injective (INJ) are gaining quiet traction, especially among technical analysts and long-horizon investors looking for sustained momentum. MAGACOINFINANCE – Smart Positioning in a Crowded Market MAGACOINFINANCE isn’t aiming to compete through hype—it’s aiming to win through precision. With over $7.8 million raised , rising pre-sale demand, and a $0.007 listing price in view, the fundamentals are aligning fast. Its message, branding, and consistency in execution make MAGACOINFINANCE stand out among early-stage contenders. Investor communities across X, Telegram, and YouTube are increasingly focused on this project—not as a trend, but as a calculated long-term position. Use code MAGA50X at checkout to unlock a 50% bonus and secure early access before the broader listing surge begins. XRP – Strong Foundation and Institutional Appeal Current Price: $2.15, XRP continues to show impressive resilience, supported by rising ETF volume and on-chain strength. Analysts are closely monitoring the $2.45 breakout level, which could trigger renewed upward movement as institutional investors deepen their positions. Solana (SOL) – Strengthening as a Scalable Leader Current Price: ~$148, Solana has regained momentum after a robust 41% surge in April , positioning itself as a core platform for high-performance decentralized apps and real-world tokenization. If buying pressure holds, SOL is likely to test resistance around the $180 mark—opening the door to new upside in Q2. Kaspa and Injective – Quiet Builders with Real Fundamentals Kaspa (KAS) continues to gain ground among proof-of-work advocates. Trading around $0.10, the project is benefiting from rising interest in blockDAG tech and scalable architecture. If demand continues, a breakout above $0.30 remains a plausible scenario. Injective (INJ) remains anchored near $35. While not making headlines daily, its developer adoption and cross-chain ecosystem give it solid long-term fundamentals. Smart money continues to accumulate INJ quietly, anticipating future infrastructure relevance. Final Thoughts In a market where timing and traction are everything, XRP and Solana offer strength backed by structure, while Kaspa and Injective quietly build. But for those looking at pure early-stage upside, MAGACOINFINANCE continues to shine through with increasing conviction.

In a May 5 letter to a Manhattan federal court, the attorneys for Samourai co-founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill revealed that prosecutors had been informed by officials from the US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) months before the charges were filed. FinCEN had reportedly told prosecutors that Samourai Wallet did not need a license to operate. “Shockingly, six months later, the same prosecutors criminally charged Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill with operating just such a business without a FinCEN license,” the lawyers noted in the letter. The disclosure came after a year of suppression, with prosecutors only revealing the information on April 1, 2025, despite a legal requirement to share it months earlier. Notable update in the Samourai Wallet Case: Today, devs’ lawyers revealed that despite being *explicitly* told by FinCEN that non-custodial software such as Samourai Wallet is most likely not a money transmitter, DOJ prosecuted the devs anyway… pic.twitter.com/uTms4i99iR — DeFi Education Fund (@fund_defi) May 5, 2025 Samourai Wallet Founders Were Arrested Despite FinCEN’s Clear Stance on Legal Status Rodriguez and Hill were charged in Feb. 2024 with conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and money laundering conspiracy. The charges were unsealed and the pair arrested in April . The allegations stem from Samourai’s mixing service, which allegedly helped launder over $100m through over $2b in illegal transactions. Prosecutors claimed the service aided in transactions involving black market dealings and scammers. The defense team pointed out that FinCEN had informed prosecutors that Samourai Wallet, which does not hold custody of cryptocurrencies, did not qualify as a “money services business” under existing guidance. Despite FinCEN’s Position, Prosecutors Push Forward with Charges Against Samourai Wallet This information came after a conversation between prosecutors and FinCEN officials, including Kevin O’Connor and Lorena Valente. They considered whether Samourai met the criteria for a money transmitter. The officials noted that Samourai did not take custody of crypto. Therefore, it does not control the private keys to any stored assets. This suggested that Samourai was not operating as a money services business. Despite this, prosecutors proceeded with the charges, arguing that Samourai could still be accused of functional control over the cryptocurrency. However, FinCEN had not addressed this argument in their official guidance, and it was considered a weak position by the officials. Samourai Lawyers Demand Hearing Over Delayed Disclosure and Call for Case Dismissal Now, Samourai’s lawyers are seeking a hearing to investigate the delay in disclosure. They want to determine an appropriate remedy. If the government resists dismissing the case, the defense will renew their request for dismissal . They argue that the charges were brought without fair notice. The defense also claims the company acted in good faith based on the available guidance at the time. Further, the defense team pointed to a recent memo from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. The memo stated that the Justice Department would no longer prosecute crypto mixers like Samourai for regulatory violations. Issued on April 7, 2025, the memo prompted the defense to demand that the case be dismissed. They argued that, under FinCEN’s guidance, Samourai was not a money transmitter and could not be prosecuted for lacking a license. The outcome of the hearing could impact the broader industry. It is especially important for developers of non-custodial platforms like Samourai Wallet. If successful, it could set a precedent for how crypto mixers are regulated in the future. This would particularly affect their classification under US financial laws.

SOL price is now consolidating near $145 and might extend losses below the $142 support. SOL price started a fresh decline below the $150 and $148 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $150 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a short-term rising channel or a continuation pattern forming with support at $144 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

Solana Price Consolidates Gains Solana price formed a base above the $142 support and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL gained pace for a move above the $145 and $150 resistance levels. However, the bears were active below the $155 resistance zone. A high was formed at $153.90 and the price started a fresh decline. The price dipped below $150 and $148. A low was formed at $142.64 and the price is now consolidating losses.

There is also a short-term rising channel or a continuation pattern forming with support at $144 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $147 level. The next major resistance is near the $150 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $153.90 swing high to the $142.64 low. The main resistance could be $155. A successful close above the $155 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $165. Any more gains might send the price toward the $180 level. More Losses in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $150 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $145 zone. The first major support is near the $142 level. A break below the $142 level might send the price toward the $135 zone. If there is a close below the $135 support, the price could decline toward the $122 support in the near term.

Alexander Gurevich will be investigated for his alleged involvement in several “computer crimes,” including laundering millions of dollars and transferring stolen property allegedly connected to the Nomad Bridge hack in 2022, The Jerusalem Post reported on May 5. Gurevich returned to Israel from an overseas trip on April 19 but was ordered to appear before the Jerusalem District Court for an extradition hearing soon after, according to the report. On April 29, Gurevich changed his name in Israel’s Population Registry to “Alexander Block” and received a passport under that name at Israel’s Ben-Gurion Airport the next day. He was arrested at the same airport two days later, on May 1, while waiting to board a flight to Russia. Gurevich allegedly identified a vulnerability in the Nomad bridge, which he exploited and stole roughly $2.89 million worth of tokens from in August 2022. Dozens of copycat hackers discovered and capitalized on the security vulnerability soon after, leading to a total loss of $190 million . Gurevich allegedly reached out to a Nomad executive on Telegram Prosecutors allege that shortly after the hack, Gurevich messaged Nomad’s chief technology officer, James Prestwich, on Telegram using a fake identity, admitting that he had been “amateurishly” seeking a crypto protocol to exploit. He allegedly apologized for “the trouble he caused Prestwich and his team” and voluntarily transferred about $162,000 into a recovery wallet the company had set up. Prestwich told Gurevich that Nomad would pay him 10% of the value of the assets he had stolen, to which Gurevich responded that he would consult his lawyer. However, Nomad never heard back from him after that. Alleged messages between Gurevich and Nomad’s James Prestwich were shared on X by Israel-based Walla News journalist Yoav Itiel. Source: Yoav Itiel At some point during the negotiations, Gurevich demanded a reward of $500,000 for identifying the vulnerability. Related: Do Kwon is in US custody after extradition battle US federal authorities filed an eight-count indictment against Gurevich in the Northern District of California on Aug. 16, 2023, in addition to obtaining a warrant for his arrest. California is where the team behind the Nomad bridge is based. The US submitted a formal extradition request in December 2024, the Post noted. The money laundering charges that Gurevich faces carry a maximum of 20 years, significantly harsher than the penalties he would face in Israel. Gurevich is believed to have arrived in Israel a few days before the $190 million exploit occurred, prompting Israeli officials to believe he carried out the attack while in Israel.

Right now, four names are aligning as early movers: XRP , Ethereum , Bitcoin , and the breakout contender MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . As dominant players consolidate, new opportunities are taking form—and for investors seeking aggressive upside, this may be the time to pay close attention. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Laying the Foundation for Breakout Growth Momentum in crypto is earned—not manufactured—and MAGACOINFINANCE is earning it in all the right ways. With over $7.8 million raised , the project is showing real strength: wallet activity is up, the community is expanding organically, and development milestones are being met with precision. Rather than chasing trends, MAGACOINFINANCE is focusing on structure and sustainability. It’s laying a true foundation for breakout growth—something few early-stage projects achieve. Those entering now aren’t late—they’re early, and they may be entering just as the wider market starts to notice. Other Assets on the Move: Optimism, Arbitrum, Sei, and Litecoin Optimism remains a leader in Ethereum Layer-2 scaling, drawing demand for fast, cost-effective smart contracts. Arbitrum is thriving on strong developer activity and a vibrant dApp ecosystem, pushing Ethereum usability to new levels. Sei is gaining attention with its trading-focused architecture, built for speed and reduced congestion. Litecoin continues to hold its place as a reliable peer-to-peer transfer coin, especially where simplicity and speed are essential. Each of these assets has a clear use case—but none offer the raw early-stage momentum of MAGACOINFINANCE at this moment. Conclusion The next wave of crypto wealth won’t be built by those holding yesterday’s champions—it will come from those spotting what’s quietly emerging today. Bitcoin , Ethereum , and XRP continue to command relevance. But MAGACOINFINANCE is the rising player offering one of the rarest setups in the space: early access to a project that’s already raised $7.8 million and is just getting started.

According to the 7-day active address count, Solana continues to lead by a wide margin with over 24 million addresses, followed by Tron, Base, BNB Chain and Aptos.

The reason for this is that the ETH network is slow and expensive. On the other hand, layer-2 networks, which can be explained as performing transactions on an external network and finalizing them on the Ethereum network, maintain their popularity. These networks include Base, Arbitrum and Optimism. Related News: Will Success Finally Come This Time?

In two separate but closely timed developments, asset manager VanEck has filed with US regulators to launch the country’s first BNB-based exchange-traded fund, while Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has recommended that Kyrgyzstan use BNB and Bitcoin as the foundation of its national cryptocurrency reserves. VanEck Files First-Ever BNB ETF Application in the US as Crypto ETF Race Heats Up According to a newly published S-1 registration statement , the proposed VanEck BNB ETF is structured to directly hold spot BNB tokens and may periodically stake a portion of its assets through trusted staking providers. If approved, this fund would become the first ETF in the US to offer exposure to the BNB token — a digital asset with a market capitalization of approximately $84 billion and a staking yield near 2.5%, according to StakingRewards.com. BNB, initially launched to support trading fee discounts on the Binance exchange, has since evolved into a key component of the BNB Chain ecosystem — a leading smart contract platform. BNB Chain is among the most popular blockchain networks (Source: DeFILlama ) With over $6 billion in total value locked (TVL) as of early May, according to DeFiLlama, BNB Chain ranks among the top blockchain networks globally. It powers a wide range of decentralized applications, including DeFi platforms, games, and NFT marketplaces. The VanEck proposal comes at a critical time for Binance and its ecosystem. Despite regulatory headwinds in the US and abroad, Binance continues to maintain its position as one of the largest global crypto exchanges. The potential listing of a BNB ETF in the United States could serve as a symbolic turning point in the token’s institutional legitimacy. Riding the Bitcoin ETF Wave VanEck’s filing also reflects a broader momentum shift in the crypto ETF landscape, particularly in the wake of the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs last year. Since their approval in January 2024, spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted more than $40 billion in cumulative inflows, according to data from Farside Investors . Total inflows for US spot Bitcoin ETFs (Source: Farside Investors) Speaking at the recent Token2049 conference in Dubai, Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said he expects this ETF-driven enthusiasm to spread beyond Bitcoin. “This cycle so far has been the ETFs. And it’s almost all Bitcoin,” CZ said. “Ether hasn’t had as much success, but Bitcoin’s success will spill over to the others eventually.” That “spillover” appears to be in full swing, with a growing list of asset managers seeking SEC approval for ETFs that track a wide variety of cryptocurrencies — including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and now BNB. VanEck’s BNB filing is just the latest in a series of moves by asset managers to gain a foothold in the altcoin ETF market. Over the past few months, VanEck has also submitted applications for ETFs based on Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX), both prominent Layer-1 blockchains. Meanwhile, other firms have taken bolder steps, floating ETF concepts tied to meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE), capitalizing on the speculative energy in the crypto market during the 2025 bull run. The SEC, under increased pressure to modernize its approach to digital assets, has formally acknowledged dozens of these filings since Jan. 20, when President Donald Trump returned to office. The Trump administration has so far signaled more openness toward crypto-related financial products, though the SEC's ultimate stance on altcoin-based ETFs remains uncertain. Staking Could Add a Yield Component to ETFs An interesting detail in the VanEck BNB ETF filing is its potential to stake a portion of its BNB holdings. Unlike traditional ETFs, crypto staking provides an opportunity for funds to generate yield while maintaining exposure to the underlying asset. This could enhance the fund’s appeal to yield-seeking investors in a high-inflation environment and further differentiate it from Bitcoin and Ethereum-based ETFs, which do not yet widely integrate staking. As of May 5, BNB staking yields around 2.5% annually, providing a modest but consistent reward to long-term holders. BNB price chart (Source: CoinMarketCap ) While the VanEck BNB ETF still faces a potentially lengthy regulatory review process, its filing marks a new chapter in the US crypto ETF narrative. Institutional interest is clearly growing beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the door now appears open — at least slightly — for altcoin ETFs to follow the same path toward approval. If the SEC gives the green light, the VanEck BNB ETF could act as a bellwether for other altcoin ETFs and help usher in a new wave of digital asset investment products designed specifically for mainstream markets. CZ Proposes Bitcoin and BNB for Kyrgyzstan's National Crypto Reserve as Country Pushes Ahead with Web3 Ambitions The proposal follows a string of developments that suggest Kyrgyzstan is positioning itself as a forward-thinking crypto hub in Central Asia. From launching a national crypto payments platform to piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), the Kyrgyz government appears to be embracing digital assets as part of a broader financial modernization strategy. In a post shared on X, CZ confirmed he had advised Kyrgyzstan’s government to accumulate Bitcoin and BNB as part of its reserve strategy. “Start with the strongest,” CZ wrote, suggesting that Bitcoin’s status as the leading decentralized asset and BNB’s connection to one of the world’s largest blockchain networks make them ideal candidates for foundational crypto reserves. Zhao’s influence in the crypto world cannot be understated. According to Forbes, he holds approximately 94 million BNB tokens — over 64% of the total circulating supply — valued at around $55 billion at current prices. While he no longer leads Binance, CZ remains a powerful figure in shaping global crypto policy, and his endorsement could carry significant weight for emerging economies looking to integrate digital assets into their financial systems. CZ’s proposal comes shortly after Binance signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Kyrgyzstan’s National Investment Agency (NIA) to introduce Binance Pay — the exchange’s crypto payment platform — to the country. The partnership aims to allow both residents and visitors to conduct transactions using cryptocurrencies, and it marks a significant step toward real-world crypto adoption. In addition to the payments initiative, Binance Academy is working alongside Kyrgyz institutions to provide blockchain education and help establish a skilled local workforce capable of supporting the country’s growing digital asset ecosystem. Binance CEO Richard Teng also revealed in a Financial Times interview that the exchange has been advising various nations on the formation of crypto reserves. Kyrgyzstan appears to be among the first to act on that advice. Government Embraces Web3 Future The Kyrgyz government has shown a strong willingness to integrate digital assets into its national strategy. On April 17, President Sadyr Zhaparov signed into law a framework enabling the country’s central bank to pilot a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Under the new legislation, the digital version of the Kyrgyzstani som has been granted legal tender status, putting the country on a short list of nations ready to test government-backed digital currencies in the real economy. The pilot program aims to improve financial inclusion, modernize monetary infrastructure, and reduce dependency on foreign intermediaries in domestic transactions. Kyrgyzstan’s ambitions don’t end there. The country reportedly plans to launch a gold-backed stablecoin called the “Gold Dollar” (USDKG), pegged to the US dollar but backed by $500 million worth of gold reserves held by the Ministry of Finance. If confirmed, the stablecoin would act as a hybrid between traditional commodity backing and modern digital finance — a concept that could appeal to countries seeking to hedge against inflation and dollar volatility. Regional and Global Implications CZ’s advisory role in Kyrgyzstan is part of a growing trend of crypto leaders acting as informal diplomats for blockchain adoption. He previously disclosed that he had been officially and unofficially advising governments on regulatory and technological frameworks for the crypto sector. In April, similar news emerged from Pakistan, where Zhao was reportedly appointed to advise on digital asset policies. If Kyrgyzstan follows through on building national crypto reserves and launching a gold-backed stablecoin, it could set a precedent for other nations in Central Asia and beyond. By combining decentralized digital assets like Bitcoin with sovereign-backed instruments such as stablecoins and CBDCs, the country may be laying the groundwork for a unique hybrid monetary system. Changpeng Zhao’s proposal to use Bitcoin and BNB as the foundation of Kyrgyzstan’s national crypto reserve shows the rapid evolution of global finance. Backed by Binance’s ongoing educational and infrastructure initiatives in the country, Kyrgyzstan is emerging as a surprising but determined player in the race toward blockchain integration at the national level. With a CBDC pilot underway, a potential gold-backed stablecoin in development, and direct collaboration with major industry leaders, Kyrgyzstan’s crypto experiment is one to watch closely in the months and years to come.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-06 05:30:00

This latest acquisition brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 555,450 BTC, valued at approximately $38.08 billion, with an average purchase price of $68,550 per BTC. Strategy Announces New $21 Billion ATM Offering The acquisition was financed through a strategic combination of common and preferred stock sales. Specifically, Strategy raised $128.5 million through its common stock at-the-market (ATM) program and an additional $51.8 million from the sale of STRK preferred shares. Notably, this latest transaction exhausts the company’s previous $21 billion ATM offering that was initiated last year. Related Reading: BNB Bulls Target $644 As Classic Chart Formation Emerges Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy and a well-known advocate for BTC, also shared on social media that the company has achieved a year-to-date Bitcoin yield of 14.0% as of May 4, 2025. He emphasized that the firm currently holds 555,450 BTC, acquired for approximately $38.08 billion. In a bid to further bolster its BTC accumulation strategy, Strategy announced last week plans to double its capital raising capacity. This includes introducing a new $21 billion ATM offering and expanding its debt purchase program to $42 billion. These initiatives indicate the company’s commitment to enhancing its BTC-heavy balance sheet, even in light of recent financial challenges, including five consecutive quarterly net losses. Institutional Demand For Bitcoin Surges During its latest earnings call, Strategy unveiled the “42/42 Plan,” a roadmap aimed at raising $84 billion in capital over the next two years. The plan involves splitting the funding equally between equity and fixed-income instruments, all earmarked for future BTC acquisitions. Despite reporting ongoing losses, investor sentiment remains optimistic. Strategy continues to be the largest corporate holder of BTC, with its holdings representing nearly 3% of Bitcoin’s maximum supply. At current market prices around $94,000, the company’s bitcoin assets are valued at over $52 billion. Related Reading: Analyst Says $2 XRP Price Is Low As It Still Isn’t “Activated” This recent purchase comes amid a backdrop of strong institutional demand for BTC, particularly through regulated investment vehicles. Notably, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) has experienced significant inflows in the past two weeks, reflecting growing interest from institutional investors. However, despite the positive outlook on its BTC strategy, Strategy’s shares were down 2.7% in pre-market trading on Monday, following a gain of over 3% last Thursday. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is trading at $94,596, a slight decrease of 0.2% in the 24-hour time frame, and gains of up to 13% in the monthly period for the market’s largest cryptocurrency.

Stake4Ads offers new way to reach Web3 audiences Due to dispersed audiences and difficult-to-measure returns, Web3 businesses frequently struggle with their marketing initiatives. Some startups have wasted immense budgets on a mix of traditional media, online promotion, KOL outreach and more. Stake4Ads brings predictability in a volatile market Businesses can obtain dependable monthly email ad credits by staking EMT tokens. This strategy was developed especially for dependable, tried-and-true interaction with crypto communities.

With interest rate decisions and Powell’s speech on the agenda, the market is on edge. After a long pause following aggressive hikes in 2022–2023, the Fed began cutting rates in late 2024, bringing the current rate to 4.25%–4.50%. Now, with a 94% probability that the Fed will hold rates steady, investors are watching closely. Despite strong job numbers, inflation remains slightly high, clouding the timeline for future cuts. Experts say more rate cuts may come later in 2025, but there’s still no clear roadmap. Volatility Ahead of Powell Speech Market analyst King Baldwin shared his pre-FOMC outlook on X, pointing to the high odds of no change in interest rates. However, he warns that a hawkish tone from the Fed could send Bitcoin down to a support zone between $91,500 and $92,000. If Jerome Powell Jerome Powell Jerome Hayden ""Jay"" Powell is an American attorney and investment banker who has served since 2018 as the 16th chair of the Federal Reserve Finance signals a dovish stance or hints at near-term cuts, Bitcoin could rebound toward the $100,000 mark . Baldwin notes that Core PCE inflation stands at 2.6%, and recession odds are at 60%—both factors keeping investors cautious. All eyes are now on Powell’s press conference, with hopes for a June rate cut signal. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Bull Run 2025 at Risk as Fed Rate Cut Doubts Grow , No Rate Cut Expected, Says Michaël van de Poppe Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe believes a rate cut is highly unlikely at this FOMC meeting. He suggests the Fed will stay cautious due to sticky inflation. A surprise cut would shock markets. Adding to the pressure is Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President who continues to push for cuts amid rising tariffs. But the Federal Reserve is expected to focus on inflation control rather than bow to political pressure. Crypto Market Braces for Powell’s Speech Trump’s aggressive stance on trade and monetary policy is stirring debate about the Fed’s independence. With fiat volatility rising, many investors are turning back to Bitcoin as a hedge. With Powell’s speech scheduled for May 7, both traditional and crypto markets are bracing for volatility. Analysts are urging traders to avoid leverage and expect short-term turbulence. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Following a strong rally in April, the token has lost some of its recent gains, falling 7% in the last day and more than 22% this week. Trading activity in Worldcoin ( WLD ) has increased 64% despite of the price drop, indicating that traders are responding swiftly to any changes. This comes at a time when Worldcoin is increasingly dealing with global regulatory issues. In one of the latest developments, the Worldcoin Foundation was ordered by a Kenyan High Court on May 5 to remove all biometric information it had gathered in the nation, including facial and iris scans. As reported by local media outlet Kenyans.co.ke, the ruling also bans the project from collecting any new data. It criticized Worldcoin’s past use of crypto incentives in exchange for sensitive information. This came after a lawsuit from the Katiba Institute challenged how the company handled personal data using its app and orb devices.

One of the businesses that operated under the Worldcoin umbrella, according to the Ministry of Communication’s May 4 statement , was not properly registered. As a result, authorities put a hold on Worldcoin’s certification and summoned the relevant parties for additional questioning. From a technical perspective, WLD is currently trading close to $0.88 after declining from its April highs of $1.20. The price has been stable since late April and is trading just above support, which is around $0.86. Worldcoin price analysis. Credit: crypto.news However, the token has indicated short-term weakness by breaking below the 20-day moving average. After cooling from overbought levels to 47, the relative strength index indicates less buying pressure but not yet complete bearish momentum. The next area to keep an eye on is $0.80 or even $0.75 if WLD loses support close to $0.86. Conversely, a rebound might drive the price back toward the $0.94 resistance level, but regaining bullish momentum might require high volume and positive developments. The future of Worldcoin now depends on how it handles mounting regulatory pressure in key markets.

However, if the Fed fails to deliver these cuts, the market narrative will shift, choking these speculative flows. “For Bitcoin, which thrives on liquidity and risk appetite, the absence of rate cuts could stall momentum or even trigger a drawdown.” The Fed is expected to keep rates unchanged at its meeting on Wednesday, May 7. Finally, event risk, or unforeseen macro-level shocks that cannot be predicted in timing or magnitude, can cause severe disruption to financial markets. “For Bitcoin, these risks bypass conventional forecasting tools and risk models, creating sharp breaks from trend behavior.” Peterson cited examples that included nuclear accidents, large-scale terrorist attacks on critical infrastructure, cyberattacks on financial systems, another pandemic, or massive natural disasters. Bitcoin behaves like a “high-beta asset” under these conditions, “subject to indiscriminate selling, access limitations, and temporary narrative collapse,” he said , concluding the analysis on May 5. BTC Price Outlook Doom and gloom aside, Bitcoin was still trading within its rangebound channel, where it has been for the past fortnight. The asset has swung from below $93,750 in late trading on Monday to retap $95,000 during Tuesday morning trading in Asia.

The company and existing stockholders are aiming to raise $500 million through offering a total of 10 million shares priced between $46 to $50 apiece, eToro said on May 5. A filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission shows eToro is offering 5 million shares, with a further 5 million being put up by the likes of the company’s co-founder and CEO, Yoni Assia; his brother and executive director, Ronen Assia; along with venture firms Spark Capital, BRM Group and Andalusian Private Capital, among others. The company offers stock and crypto trading targeting retail and plans to list on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker “ETOR.” It's slated to compete with Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), which saw crypto trading dip in the first quarter but whose shares have climbed by nearly 30% so far this year, according to Google Finance. In the filing, eToro said some BlackRock funds and accounts indicated interest in buying up to $100 million worth of shares at IPO . eToro has also put aside 500,000 shares to sell through a directed share program, typically targeted at employees. The company reported that its revenue from crypto in 2024 was $12.1 billion, up from $3.4 billion in 2023. It expected crypto to account for 37% of its commission from trading activity in the first quarter of 2025, down from 43% in the year-ago quarter. Source: Matthew Sigel In a section of its filing listing possible risks to the business, eToro warned its users could leave, or it could struggle to get more users, due to negative perceptions of the cryptocurrencies it lists, “either as a result of media coverage or by experiencing significant losses.” Other crypto-related risks the eToro flagged included US state-level crypto regulation, which it said “may place strain on our resources and make it difficult to operate in certain jurisdictions, if at all.” It also said it expects “to continue to incur significant costs” due to the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets ( MiCA ) laws “on an ongoing basis.” IPOs ready to push after Trump tariff jolt EToro initially made confidential filings with the SEC in January for a public offering, before publicly announcing the plans on March 24. The company reportedly delayed its IPO after President Donald Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” tariff announcements tanked global markets and stopped many in-the-works public offerings.

In a tweet posted on May 3, Ali highlighted that 71.54% of traders with open XRP positions are betting on the price going up. Only 28.46% are taking short positions. The resulting long/short ratio stands at 2.51. 71.54% of traders on Binance Futures with open $XRP positions are leaning bullish! pic.twitter.com/zDHbN1o1sl — Ali (@ali_charts) May 4, 2025 This data indicates a significant bullish bias among traders using the Binance Futures platform. The long/short ratio is a metric that helps gauge market sentiment by comparing the number of accounts holding long positions versus those holding short positions. A ratio above 1 suggests more traders are expecting price appreciation, while a ratio below 1 indicates bearish expectations. At 2.51, the current figure shows that more than twice as many traders are betting on an XRP price increase than a decline. The chart shared by Ali also reflects the movement of this ratio over time. At earlier timestamps, the bullish dominance was slightly lower, with a visible decline before rebounding and stabilizing above the 2.0 mark. This recent shift upward in the long/short ratio shows increasing confidence among long-position holders. Price Performance Diverges from Trader Sentiment Interestingly, this bullish sentiment appears to be forming in contrast to recent price performance. According to CoinMarketCap data, XRP has declined by 4.34% over the past seven days and by 0.37% in the last 24 hours. These figures show that despite the falling price trend, many traders maintain their optimistic outlook. The divergence between market sentiment and price action could be interpreted in many ways. Some traders might view the recent decline as a short-term correction within a broader bullish structure. In contrast, others may expect a price rebound based on technical indicators or anticipated news developments related to XRP or the crypto market. Implications for the Market The dominance of long positions can impact price movements if sentiment begins to unwind or traders begin to take profits. If the price continues to drop despite long-term exposure, there may be an increased risk of liquidations, which could intensify downward pressure in the short term. Conversely, if market conditions begin to favor upward movement, the current positioning could lead to rapid price recovery, amplified by the existing bullish bias. It is worth noting that while the long/short ratio provides useful insights into trader sentiment, it does not predict price direction on its own. It should be interpreted alongside broader market indicators and price trends. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This critical detail was only disclosed to the defense almost a year later, which prompted calls for case dismissal and hearings over prosecutorial conduct. Meanwhile, OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer criticized the SEC’s past enforcement-heavy tactics under the Biden administration, and described them as stifling innovation. He praised the Trump-era regulatory shift that led to dropped cases against Coinbase, Ripple, and others. At the same time, the trial of former SafeMoon CEO Braden Karony is beginning under new DOJ leadership, adding further complexity. Overall, it seems like there is a growing clash between US federal prosecutors and the crypto industry cross multiple high-profile cases. Samourai Wallet Fights Back Samourai Wallet’s legal team is accusing federal prosecutors of withholding critical information that could have changed the course of the criminal case against its co-founders. In a letter that was submitted to a Manhattan federal court on May 5, attorneys for Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill revealed that prosecutors were informed by the US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in late 2023 that Samourai Wallet did not qualify as a Money Services Business (MSB) under existing guidance. Despite this, prosecutors still moved forward six months later with criminal charges alleging that the crypto mixing service was operating as an unlicensed money transmitter. The defense claims this guidance should have been disclosed by May 8, 2024, but was only shared with them on April 1, 2025, almost a year late. Rodriguez and Hill were charged in February of 2024 and arrested in April for allegedly facilitating over $2 billion in unlawful transactions, including $100 million linked to online black markets and scams, through Samourai’s crypto-mixing technology. Both men pleaded not guilty. Samourai Wallet website Their lawyers argue that FinCEN explicitly told prosecutors in a call that the Samourai app, which does not take custody of funds or hold private keys, would not be considered an MSB. According to a prosecutor's email summarizing that call, FinCEN representatives said that without custody, Samourai would likely not require a license, and that any attempt to argue otherwise would be legally difficult due to lack of precedent. The defense is now requesting a court hearing to examine the government's delayed disclosure and explore potential remedies. They also plan to renew a motion to dismiss the case, due to the new evidence and a recent Justice Department policy shift. In an April 7 memo , Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche stated that prosecutors should not pursue cases against crypto mixers for accidental regulatory violations. The defense argues that if Samourai was never required to register as a money transmitter under FinCEN’s own guidance, the entire basis of the criminal charges collapses. Both sides already asked the court for more time on April 28 to consider whether to continue the case in light of the Justice Department’s changing stance on crypto enforcement. OpenSea CEO Slams SEC Others in the industry are also not very happy with how crypto enforcement was treated. OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer recently criticized the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SECs) prior approach to crypto regulation, and described it as overly broad and harmful to innovation. In a recent interview , Finzer argued that under the Biden administration, the SEC unfairly targeted legitimate players in the digital asset space, including OpenSea, by treating all digital assets with a one-size-fits-all approach. This, he said, created a persistent regulatory overhang that stifled progress in the sector. OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer OpenSea received a Wells notice from the SEC in 2024, signaling a potential enforcement action over claims that it operated as an unregistered securities exchange. Finzer pushed back against the charge, and called it an example of “regulation by enforcement.” Finzer is very optimistic that the new leadership under SEC Chair Paul Atkins will take a more nuanced and innovation-friendly stance. He firmly believes that there is a need for regulation that protects consumers while still allowing space for experimentation and growth. Since the transition to the Trump administration, the SEC greatly reduced its legal pressure on crypto firms, including dropping cases against Coinbase, Kraken, Uniswap, Yuga Labs, and OpenSea. It even dismissed its years-long battle with Ripple. This change followed strong support from the crypto industry during the 2024 US elections, with pro-crypto candidates receiving over $119 million in donations. While the broader crypto market suffered after the FTX collapse in 2022 , Finzer is still confident in the long-term future of NFTs. He said that despite low trading volumes, innovation in areas like gaming and digital art continues to thrive. OpenSea, meanwhile, is now working to expand beyond NFTs to support a wider range of on-chain assets. SafeMoon Trial Opens During DOJ Shake-Up The US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) underwent a leadership change just as the criminal trial of former SafeMoon CEO Braden John Karony is set to begin. On May 5, the office announced that Joseph Nocella will take over as interim US Attorney for a period of 120 days or until a Senate-confirmed nominee is appointed. Statement from the United States Attorney’s Office Nocella was appointed by President Donald Trump, replacing Acting US Attorney John Durham. He vowed to focus on prosecuting narcotics traffickers, gang members, terrorists, and other serious offenders. The timing of Nocella’s appointment happened as jury selection begins in the high-profile crypto fraud case against Karony. This raised some questions about whether the leadership transition could affect the prosecution’s direction. SafeMoon CEO Braden John Karony Karony, along with co-defendants Kyle Nagy and Thomas Smith, was indicted in November of 2023 on charges of securities fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy. Prosecutors allege the trio misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth of SafeMoon (SFM) tokens between 2021 and 2022. Karony maintained his innocence and has been out on a $3 million bond since February of 2024. Earlier this year, Karony asked the court to consider delaying the trial due to proposed changes to US securities laws under the Trump administration, which he argued could influence the legal grounds of the case. However, jury selection is proceeding as scheduled under US Magistrate Judge James Cho, with District Judge Eric Komitee set to oversee the full trial starting May 6. While EDNY has not traditionally been the focal point for high-profile crypto enforcement actions, it has handled several cases involving digital assets, including a SEC complaint against Hex founder Richard Heart. Its neighboring jurisdiction, the Southern District of New York, will oversee the sentencing of former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky on May 8.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-06 05:58:34

Caroline D. Pham, acting chairperson of the CFTC, spoke at the Medici Conference, and she said they intend to monitor multiple tokenization pilot schemes . She noted that they must understand how tokenized securities can function within legacy financial infrastructure and ensure that laws are written to support that vision. Through studying these pilots, the CFTC wants to gain technological expertise that could help provide input on future regulations. The agency’s observer role signifies a proactive approach to engaging with emerging financial technologies without direct market intervention. The approach permits the CFTC to closely watch developments without giving up its regulatory oversight. Crypto community members are pleased with the CFTC’s planned tokenization pilot initiative The CFTC wants to learn more about the practical impact of tokenized assets and how they operate in the real world. In an interview at the Medici Conference with Journalist Eleanor Terett, Pham argued that they wanted to understand tokenization tech. Terett even posted on X: CFTC plans to be an observer on a handful of industry tokenization pilot programs in order for the agency to learn first hand how well-tokenized assets can function in the real world and gain experience with the technology. Eleanor Terett Responding to Terett’s post, most crypto members seemed pleased with the CFTC’s initiative, with some arguing that it’s the best approach. The Department of Government Efficiency also commented on the matter, posting an automated message on X. It described the CFTC’s decision as smart, saying that using stablecoins as collateral could modernize financial systems and reduce bureaucratic insufficiencies. The CFTC declared it would host a CEO forum to talk about a pilot program for stablecoins In February, the CFTC announced it would hold a CEO forum to discuss a pilot program focused on non-cash collateral like stablecoins. The forum would include Circle, Coinbase, Crypto.com, MoonPay, and Ripple’s leaders. Back then, Pham insisted that the agency was geared toward innovation and would engage with market participants to achieve Trump’s crypto agenda. In September 2023, she also suggested having a pilot initiative focused on regulating crypto. In her proposal, she detailed they would start discussions with multiple stakeholders, and then the agency would propose and adopt rules around registration requirements and risk management. Then, the agency would assess whether to modify the rules permanently. Last year, The CFTC’s Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC), sponsored by Acting Chairman Pham, also proposed expanding the use of non-cash collateral through distributed ledger technology. At the time, Pham believed the GMAC’s recommendation on tokenized non-cash collateral represented a meaningful first step toward achieving regulatory clarity for digital assets in the U.S. She said this development would help unlock opportunities for the derivatives markets while maintaining the same guardrails and protections already in place.

Lawyers acting for Mashinsky argued in a May 5 reply memorandum filed in a New York district court that he should receive no more than 366 days, because the DOJ hasn't taken into account his status as a nonviolent first-time offender with a previously unblemished 30-year history in business. “The government's venom-laced submission recasts this case as one involving a predator with an intent to target victims, harm them, and steal their money,” they said. “It concludes by recommending that a first time, nonviolent offender who pled guilty and accepts responsibility receive a death-in-prison sentence.” Lawyers acting for Mashinsky argue the DOJ has ignored their client's background in its sentencing request. Source: Court Listener Mashinsky pleaded guilty to two out of seven charges As part of a plea agreement, Mashinsky pleaded guilty in December 2024 to commodities fraud and manipulating the price of CEL, earning $48 million by selling his holdings before Celsius collapsed in June 2022. Prosecutors initially filed seven charges in July 2023. Lawyers acting for Mashinsky allege the DOJ’s push for a 20-year sentence is because their client is unwilling to “capitulate to the government’s exaggerated characterizations of his actions,” specifically that he was a “fraud from the get-go.” “Alex is inserted as the scapegoat for every corporate action, every group decision, every unanimous vote, every market fluctuation, and every employee's watercooler speculation,” they said. As part of its April 28 sentencing request, the DOJ said Mashinsky’s guilty plea showed that his crimes were deliberate, calculated decisions to lie, deceive and steal. Days earlier on April 23, US federal prosecutors also filed statements from hundreds of victims who lost money due to the Celsius collapse. They detailed how some had entrusted their life savings to the protocol, believing Mashinsky’s assurances that it was safe. Related: What do crypto users want to happen to Alex Mashinsky? Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 13, 2022, owing $4.7 billion to creditors after halting withdrawals in June, citing volatile market conditions. In November 2023, a US bankruptcy court approved Celsius' restructuring plan to repay customers, and in August 2024, $2.53 billion was paid to 251,000 creditors. Former Celsius chief revenue officer Roni Cohen-Pavon also pleaded guilty in September 2023 to similar charges, but his Dec. 11 sentencing has been delayed until after Mashinsky is sentenced.

The long-standing limit was originally a “gentle signal that block space should be used sparingly for non-payment proof of publication data,” has outlived its utility, he added. The proposal ( PR 32359 ) was created by Bitcoin pioneer Peter Todd at the request of Chaincode Labs. OP_RETURN is a special type of Bitcoin ( BTC ) transaction output that allows storing small amounts of data on the blockchain, popularized during the ordinals inscriptions craze in early 2024. Unlike regular transaction outputs, OP_RETURN outputs are not spendable and don’t bloat unspent transaction outputs ( UTXOs ). The original limit is no longer effective as people found ways around it, such as using fake output addresses, which are actually worse for the network, while some mining services were already ignoring the limit, said Sanders. “Large-data inscriptions are happening regardless and can be done in more or less abusive ways; the cap merely channels them into more opaque forms that cause damage to the network.” Related: Bitcoin block size could grow to 4 MB with inscriptions: Research Benefits of removing the limit include a cleaner UTXO set, or database of spendable outputs, more consistent behavior across the network, and better alignment with how Bitcoin is actually being used, he added. Three possible paths were considered: keeping the cap, raising the cap and removing the cap, which was ultimately decided upon after earning “broad, though not perhaps unanimous, support.” A controversial change to Bitcoin “Many users find this to be an undesirable change for a number of reasons,” said Bitcoiner Samson Mow on X on May 5. He added that users “can refuse to upgrade and stay on 29.0 or run another implementation” of the network. Critics said that the proposal was introduced without a proper consensus process. “I think one thing is pretty clear, there is no consensus at the moment on this OP_RETURN issue,” said Ten31 Fund managing partner Marty Bent. Some also expressed concerns about deprioritizing Bitcoin’s financial utility and raised questions about undisclosed conflicts of interest. Critics of OP_RETURN limit removal.

That’s just how it is in 2025. But London startup SpacePay is trying something different. They’ve created a system where merchants don’t need expensive new equipment – just a software update to their existing terminals. Their platform lets over 325 different crypto wallets work with regular card machines, charges just 0.5% per transaction, and has pulled in more than $1 million during their ongoing presale. Solving the Merchant Adoption Problem Store owners don’t want the hassle of accepting crypto payments. Who can blame them? They worry about price swings, expensive equipment, and complicated setups. Most just stick with what they know. SpacePay’s approach is pretty straightforward. They update existing Android payment terminals with new software. That’s it. No new machines to buy or complicated systems to learn. Shops keep their setup, and customers get to use their crypto. The beauty is in the simplicity. Customers use what they already have in their digital wallets, and shops don’t need to change much on their end. With support for hundreds of different crypto wallets, it works for most crypto users without extra steps. Redefining the way you pay with $SPY pic.twitter.com/OasS0KIIrZ — SpacePay (@SpacePayLtd) April 26, 2025 The Economics of the 0.5% Fee Small fees add up fast in retail. Every percentage point matters when you’re running a small business. SpacePay charges 0.5% per transaction – noticeably less than what most payment processors take. Think about it. Regular card processors often take 1.5% to 3.5% of each sale. For a coffee shop doing $2,000 in daily sales, that difference could mean saving hundreds or even thousands monthly. Lower costs make a real difference for small businesses trying to stay profitable. This fee setup helps everyone involved. Stores pay less per transaction, and the fees collected help keep SpacePay running. Some of that money goes back to people holding $SPY tokens through their revenue-sharing program. It’s a practical approach that works for the long run. Volatility Protection – The Missing Piece Let’s be honest – crypto prices jump around a lot. This scares shop owners. Who wants to accept $100 worth of crypto only to find it’s worth $80 tomorrow? That’s just bad business. SpacePay handles this with a simple fix. When someone pays with crypto, the shop gets their local currency right away. No waiting for conversions, no worrying about price drops. The money hits their account in dollars, euros, or whatever currency they normally use. This also helps with cash flow – something every small business owner thinks about daily. Unlike traditional systems that might hold funds for days, shops get their money immediately. This matters when you’ve got bills to pay and inventory to order. Presale Progress and Token Generation Timeline So far, SpacePay has raised over $1 million from people interested in what they’re building. Each token is priced $0.003181 right now. Their presale uses tiered pricing, which means the price goes up as more tokens sell. Originally, they planned to launch their token earlier, but they’ve pushed it back to sometime between April and June 2025. They say this is about getting things right – lining up the right partners and picking the best market conditions. Sure, waiting longer isn’t ideal for people who got in early. But rushing to market has killed plenty of good ideas before they had a chance. The team seems focused on getting the details right rather than just launching quickly. Visit SpacePay Presale The $SPY Token Economy The $SPY token sits at the center of how SpacePay works. With 34 billion tokens total, they’ve divided them for different purposes. About 20% goes to public sale, with the rest split between user rewards, development work, partnerships, marketing, reserves, and the team who built it. Holding these tokens comes with some perks. You get to vote on decisions about the platform’s future. You receive monthly rewards just for holding. You get early access when they roll out new features. And you can join quarterly online meetings with the people running the show. The most interesting part might be the revenue sharing. Token holders get a piece of those transaction fees mentioned earlier. As more stores use the system and more people pay with crypto, that could mean ongoing income for token holders. Their success becomes your success, basically. How to Participate in the SpacePay Presale If you’re thinking about jumping into the SpacePay presale, getting started isn’t complicated – go to their website and hook up whatever wallet you normally use. They take pretty much whatever crypto you’ve got lying around – Ethereum, Binance Coin, those MATIC tokens collecting dust in your wallet, AVAX, or just plain old stablecoins if you’re not feeling risky. Haven’t bought crypto before? No sweat – they’ll take your regular bank card too, which honestly saves a ton of hassle for first-timers.

That’s the big question after over 5,000 options contracts were placed betting on a $300K BTC target by June 26, totaling $484 million in notional open interest. Meanwhile, Ethereum bulls are circling as a key technical level—one that previously drove a 450% surge—has just resurfaced on charts. And amid all this heat, a fresh wave of attention is hitting an early-stage contender: Qubetics . While Bitcoin and Ethereum battle headlines, Qubetics is building something very different—and it’s still in presale. What’s driving all this sudden noise? It isn’t just hype—it’s politics. Trump’s recent appointment of David Sacks as his so-called crypto czar has flipped sentiment almost overnight. Sacks, a former PayPal executive and known Web3 advocate, is expected to create a more stable and serious tone for U.S. crypto regulation. And while that’s great news for Bitcoin and Ethereum, it also breathes credibility into new infrastructure-layer projects like Qubetics that aim to solve the mess of fragmented chains. In a space where interoperability is still mostly just a buzzword, Qubetics is shaping up to be the most potential crypto of 2025—and the presale window is still open. Qubetics Is Fixing Blockchain’s Biggest Flaw: Isolation Between Chains At the heart of Qubetics is a single mission: solve the silo problem. Right now, major chains like Ethereum, Solana, and even Bitcoin are stuck in isolated ecosystems that don’t talk to each other. That lack of interoperability limits every application—from DeFi to logistics—and creates serious friction for both users and developers. Qubetics addresses this directly by acting as a Web3-aggregated chain, where tokens, data, and smart contracts from different blockchains can interact seamlessly. This isn’t a theoretical concept—it’s a working model. Let’s take real scenarios. A supply chain company operating across Solana and Ethereum can use Qubetics to sync all its contract records without bridging or duplicating data. A developer building a dApp that needs liquidity pools from both Uniswap (Ethereum) and Raydium (Solana) no longer needs workarounds or middle layers. Even an everyday user sending funds across chains benefits—Qubetics does it in one click, without wrapping tokens or relying on insecure bridges. This ease of use is what pushes Qubetics into the spotlight as the most potential crypto—not because it’s trendy, but because it fixes what’s broken. Qubetics Presale: The Most Potential Crypto Investment Opportunity in 2025 The Qubetics presale is currently in its 33rd stage, with a strict seven-day structure that ensures scarcity and steady price appreciation. Every Sunday at midnight, a new stage begins, and the price automatically increases by 10%. Right now, $TICS is priced at $0.2302, and over 511 million tokens have already been sold. That’s not small change—$16.7 million raised and over 25,800 token holders prove the interest isn’t just surface-level. This rapid growth is a clear indicator that Qubetics is being recognized as the most potential crypto in the market today, and the window is getting smaller by the week. Here’s where things really get interesting for early participants. If someone puts in $100 at the current stage, they receive 434.20 tokens. If $TICS hits just $1 post-presale, that turns into $434.20, a 334.33% ROI. At $5, that’s $2,171.00. Go higher? $10 means $4,243.26, and $15 rockets that $100 investment to $6,414.90. Those are serious figures—and they’re backed by clear math. Unlike speculative plays on the open market, this crypto presale gives a structured growth path. And with the mainnet launching in Q2 2025, this isn’t just a token play—it’s a roadmap-based infrastructure project. That’s why this isn’t just any crypto presale. It’s currently being labeled one of the best crypto presale offers for this cycle, especially for those who missed early-stage entries on now-dominant coins. Bitcoin’s $300K Bets Are More Than Just Hype—Here’s the Real Story At Deribit, the world’s top crypto options exchange, over 5,000 open contracts are now betting on a $300,000 BTC price by the end of June. That’s not some random call—it’s a calculated play with $484 million in open interest, making it the second most popular trade for Q2 2025. The $110K strike still leads in volume, but this $300K bet has grabbed the spotlight because of its boldness and the sheer volume backing it. This surge in derivatives trading is a strong signal that community members are looking beyond short-term dips and betting big on long-term blowouts. But it’s not just about price—it’s also about who’s in the room now. The appointment of David Sacks as Trump’s crypto czar is reshaping the narrative. Sacks, with his deep tech roots and a serious track record, is expected to inject a level of policy clarity and structure that’s been missing for years. That’s music to the ears of early adopters holding long positions—and a clear signal that regulatory uncertainty may finally be giving way to a more builder-focused environment. Ethereum’s 450% Signal Is Back—And Traders Are Watching Closely Back in 2019, Ethereum’s ETH/BTC pair dropped over 90% after the ICO crash. Fast-forward to now, and it’s down 80% from its 2021 peak—but something’s changing. According to analysts like Chartist Jimie, the “bearish parabola” that’s held ETH down since December 2021 is finally losing steam. This key resistance level, which once preceded a 450% pump, is now back in play—and traders are watching it closely. Breaking above this pattern could signal a new bullish phase. Of course, there’s still risk—Ethereum could retest 0.016 BTC, but the pressure is building, and the charts don’t lie. While Bitcoin is riding a wave of macro and derivatives-based momentum, Ethereum’s strength right now is all about technicals. Combined with Sacks’ appointment, it sets the stage for a potential dual-surge scenario—one where both legacy coins could regain dominance amid shifting market sentiment. Why Today’s Crypto Shift Affects Bitcoin, Ethereum and Qubetics Equally The appointment of David Sacks as crypto czar is more than just a political play—it’s a message to the market. The days of regulatory fog might finally be ending, and that optimism is already trickling into charts, calls, and presale dashboards. For Bitcoin, it’s opened the door to bold predictions and six-figure option plays. For Ethereum, it may be the final push needed to break resistance and return to a growth phase. And for Qubetics, this new stability gives early adopters confidence that a long-term infrastructure bet might finally pay off. Qubetics stands in a unique position. It’s not reliant on spot market trends because of its structured weekly price increases. Every 7 days, the Qubetics presale adds 10% to the token price. That offers a built-in form of measured growth, something rarely seen in today’s volatile environment. For anyone trying to avoid short-term chaos but still wants meaningful ROI potential, that matters. It’s this blend of timing, tech, and structure that’s giving Qubetics its spotlight alongside the giants. Conclusion: These Three Cryptos Are Writing the 2025 Narrative The first half of 2025 has made one thing clear: speculation is back, but it’s smarter this time. Bitcoin’s $300K options tell a story of bold conviction. Ethereum’s resurging chart signals technical strength that could catch fire. And Qubetics—the most potential crypto—offers something entirely different: real interoperability across chains, and a token sale that’s still accessible. For those looking to make meaningful plays instead of chasing late-stage runs, now might be the time to join this best crypto presale and get in before the gate shuts. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is the current stage of the Qubetics presale?

It is down over 80% from its all-time high, with a market cap of over $4 billion. Token Unlocks Increase The Selling Pressure Pi Network’s demand is dropping as more and more tokens are entering the market. Data from PiScan shows that 231 million Pi tokens will be unlocked in May, and another 222 million will be unlocked in June. Over the next year, more than 1.4 billion new tokens worth over $850 million are expected to enter the market. Today, 10.4 million Pi tokens are set to be unlocked, which could further increase the selling pressure. Pi Coin’s price has remained in a tight range since early April, along with a lower trading volume. The price action suggests that it has entered the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory. This phase usually comes before a big price jump, where prices spike due to a fear of missing out among traders. Exchange Listing Concerns Prevail A major event like an exchange listing could help determine the next move. HTX has hinted at a possible listing for Pi Coin. Also, users have recently spotted Pi being mentioned in Binance test pages and backend updates, sparking rumors of an upcoming listing. However, Binance has not confirmed anything. If confirmed, this could be Pi’s biggest turning point. A Binance listing could help Pi Coin gain momentum, improve liquidity and accessibility, and help show its real market value. Will Pi Reach $1? Pioneers believe that the coin could reach $314,159, but experts believe it’s an unrealistic target since Pi currently trades around $0.60. A rise in its price could push the token to $0.7932. If it breaks through this level, the road to the big $1 milestone could be just around the corner.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-06 06:17:14

TRON (TRX) , Bitcoin (BTC) , XRP , and Ethereum (ETH) remain among the most closely tracked coins. But in the background, MAGACOINFINANCE is building serious momentum—quietly becoming a top candidate for early-stage upside this year. MAGACOINFINANCE – Strategic Growth With Sustained Momentum While leading coins grab the spotlight, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining traction for its calculated rise. With a strong branding, and increasing investor engagement, this project isn’t reacting to trends—it’s establishing one. Community traction is growing across channels, and top analysts are beginning to recognize MAGACOINFINANCE as more than a passing opportunity. The 50% bonus offer (code: MAGA50X) is still live—providing an edge to those who act before listings go public. TRX and Bitcoin Are Holding Strong in the 2025 Rotation TRX is trading near $0.245 , maintaining long-term network reliability and steady ecosystem usage. While not always in headlines, TRON’s user base and DeFi integrations continue to expand, making it a stable presence among Layer-1s. Bitcoin (BTC) , currently hovering around $95,000 , remains the macro pillar of the crypto market. Following April’s ETF-driven growth and institutional accumulation, BTC continues to show strength. Analysts still maintain targets ranging between $120,000–$132,000 by mid-year, with many viewing it as both a hedge and a leader in capital inflows. XRP and Ethereum Continue to Anchor Market Confidence XRP , priced around $2.15 , is gaining new institutional credibility through futures ETFs and expanding real-world payment solutions. Traders are watching for a breakout above the $2.45 resistance mark, which could open the door to significant rallies through Q2. Ethereum (ETH) trades near $1,830 , sustaining strong fundamentals thanks to growing Layer-2 adoption, AI integration, and whale interest. It remains the core foundation for decentralized innovation, with analysts forecasting a potential climb above $2,700 in coming weeks. Final Thoughts Bitcoin , Ethereum , XRP , and TRX each present compelling stories backed by fundamentals and ecosystem leadership. But MAGACOINFINANCE is shaping a new narrative—one defined by timing, community strength, and early-stage positioning.

Two proposed bills — House Bill 487 and Senate Bill 550 — were officially withdrawn from the legislative process on May 3, according to the Florida Senate . The legislative session had adjourned a day earlier, on May 2, without taking action on the crypto-focused proposals. Florida Extends Session, But Crypto Bills Left Behind Though lawmakers agreed to extend the session until June 6 for budget negotiations, the crypto bills will not be reconsidered. HB 487, introduced in February, would have authorized Florida’s chief financial officer and the State Board of Administration to allocate up to 10% of select state funds into Bitcoin. SB 550, filed in parallel, aimed to facilitate similar investments of public funds into the digital asset. Their removal places Florida alongside a growing list of states — including Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Oklahoma — that have recently failed to pass legislation allowing Bitcoin-based investment strategies. The data comes from Bitcoin Laws, a site tracking crypto-related state policy efforts. During the recent Florida legislative session, lawmakers passed roughly 230 bills addressing a wide range of issues, from banning smartphones in schools to protecting state parks. However, cryptocurrency initiatives were noticeably absent from the final tally. Arizona has two more chances to be the first in the nation to establish a Bitcoin Reserve. The most likely to pass (HB 2749) was authored by @JeffWeninger , and it offers a budget neutral method to fund the reserve using profit from the unclaimed property fund. @EleanorTerrett pic.twitter.com/yGlrz2saql — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) May 5, 2025 Florida’s move follows closely behind developments in Arizona, where a promising crypto initiative was also halted. Arizona’s House Bill 1025, which had advanced further than any other similar bill nationwide, was vetoed on May 3 by Governor Katie Hobbs. She called digital assets “untested investments,” effectively stopping the proposed Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Act in its tracks. Crypto Advocates Slam Politicians Over Bitcoin Veto The veto sparked backlash from crypto advocates, including investor Anthony Pompliano, who criticized political leaders for dismissing Bitcoin’s potential. Dennis Porter, CEO of the Satoshi Action Fund, pointed out that Arizona still has two remaining bills under consideration — HB 2749 and SB 1373 — that could revive the state’s efforts to become the first in the U.S. to create a Bitcoin reserve. HB 2749 is particularly notable for being budget-neutral, as it proposes using profits from the state’s unclaimed property fund. SB 1373, meanwhile, would allow the treasurer to invest up to 10% of state funds in digital assets, though it has not yet faced a final vote. As reported, the US Senate is also facing a sudden breakdown in negotiations over a landmark cryptocurrency bill, placing one of former President Donald Trump’s top financial policy priorities in jeopardy. The legislation, aimed at establishing the country’s first federal regulatory framework for stablecoins—digital assets pegged to the U.S. dollar—has hit a bipartisan snag, following pushback from key Senate Democrats. On Saturday, nine Democratic senators, including some who had previously backed the bill in committee, issued a joint statement rejecting a revised version of the legislation introduced by Republicans last week.

In a new Crypto Prime interview, Matt Hougan points out a key difference between the current Bitcoin bull market and the one witnessed in 2020. According to Hougan, the current market cycle is being driven by major institutions laying the groundwork for Bitcoin’s evolution into a trusted store of value. “The Bitcoin of today really is different than the Bitcoin of five years ago. That was a Bitcoin driven by retail investors and crypto-native investors. This is increasingly a Bitcoin driven by institutions, corporations, governments and macro hedge funds. And you’re seeing it behave differently. You’re seeing it behave more like a hedge asset. I think it’s maturing before our eyes. Bitcoin’s a teenager. It’s 15 years old. It’s in a transition phase from a risk asset to a hedge asset. But I think that’s the direction of travel. I think you’re going to see it act like that more and more in the future. And as it does, it’s going to bring more investors into it because it’s a really useful tool in the macro quiver.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $94,703.

The CEO wants Ripple Labs to improve its transparency following the end of a prolonged legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Garlinghouse made the announcement via a post on social media platform X, in which he described the first quarter of 2025 as “incredible” for Ripple for the acquisition of institutional crypto firm Hidden Road, the conclusion of the SEC’s appeal, and a surge in global institutional interest in XRP-based exchange-traded products (ETPs). “Moving forward, the XRP Markets Report will look a little different,” Garlinghouse wrote. “Our commitment to transparency doesn’t change with this evolution.” SEC withdrew appeal, but Ripple case not fully resolved Ripple has been publishing quarterly reports since 2017 to provide insight into the company’s XRP holdings and market activity. However, Garlinghouse noted that this transparency was “unfortunately… used against us by the SEC and others,” referencing the commission’s past arguments that relied in part on Ripple’s own disclosures. Q1’25 was an incredible quarter for Ripple, with our acquisition of Hidden Road and end to the SEC case, not to mention institutional interest in XRP ETPs globally. Moving forward, the XRP Markets Report will look a little different. As some may remember, the objective of… https://t.co/0f9oarmi70 — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) May 5, 2025 The SEC relinquished its challenge to a landmark July 2023 decision by US District Judge Analisa Torres. The judge had ruled that XRP sales by Ripple on public exchanges did not constitute securities transactions. Still, the court also delivered a partial win to the regulator, concluding that $728 million in XRP sold to institutional investors did fall under securities laws. Ripple was fined $125 million in August 2024, though the penalty remains suspended as Ripple appeals the ruling to the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan. Market reports go from formal to flexible In his social media post, Garlinghouse said future updates related to XRP markets and Ripple’s holdings will be distributed via Ripple’s website and social channels rather than consolidated into a formal quarterly report. The company will continue to publish holdings data on its website. One X user commented on Garlinghouse’s post, speculating that the shift might be a precursor to an initial public offering (IPO). “ Until then, I believe that if you collate it into quarterly reports and publish them to the Ripple website, it is more legitimate than social channels ,” the commenter said. “ Social media is rife with misinformation, and your posts could be used to manipulate the market .” Another user disagreed, suggesting that an IPO would lead Ripple to “lose operational control and be answerable to shareholders.” The original commenter responded, “ Yes IPO… they need funds for acquisitions, and they need the legitimacy being registered with the SEC will provide. It’s the next logical step. January 2026 .” Institutional demand for XRP grows Meanwhile, XRP ETPs recorded $37.7 million in net inflows during Q1 2025, pushing year-to-date inflows to $214 million, just $1 million short of surpassing Ethereum-based funds, according to market data. Trading activity in the spot market also remained high, with average daily volumes reaching $3.2 billion. Binance retained a dominant market share at 40%, followed by South Korea’s Upbit and US-based Coinbase. On-chain usage of the XRP Ledger, Ripple’s blockchain, moderated after experiencing strong growth in late 2024. Wallet creation and transaction volumes fell by 30–40%, much like the slowdown witnessed across Layer 1 blockchain networks during the same period. A significant portion of that activity was driven by RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. RLUSD surpassed a $90 million market cap during the quarter, with cumulative DEX trading volume exceeding $300 million. Per Coingecko data , at the time of this publication, XRP was changing hands at $2.11, a 2.8% downtick intraday and a 7% drop from its weekly highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) prices held above $94,000 after briefly dipping below that level on Sunday, continuing its recent range-bound behavior. ADA price dropped nearly 4% while XRP slid similarly. Ether (ETH) fell nearly 1%, BNB Chain’s BNB rose 1.3% and memecoin dogecoin (DOGE) was down 2% in the past 24 hours. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index that tracks the largest tokens by market capitalization, dropped a little over 1.8%. Elsewhere, some DeFi tokens such as AAVE, Curve’s CRV, and Hyperliquid’s HYPE have seen a bump in demand over the past week in a sign of trader interest toward projects with utility and yield mechanisms, some say. “As memecoins fall out of favor, traders are turning to projects with stronger fundamentals and token economics,” said Kay Lu, CEO of HashKey Eco Labs, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “DeFi ecosystems are benefiting from this pivot, especially as Bitcoin shows decreased volatility and macro uncertainty lingers. We're hopeful to see the DeFi trend continue as Bitcoin maintains decreased volatility and crypto acts as a hedge for economic uncertainty,” Lu added. HYPE led gains among the top 100 tokens with a 72% surge in the past week, with AAVE and CRV up as much as 40%. Powell's comment in focus Traders across both crypto and traditional finance markets are eyeing this week’s FOMC interest rate decision, with consensus expectations pointing to a pause in rate hikes. However, uncertainty around inflation, tariffs, and the broader U.S.–China trade tensions has left many participants cautious. “We don’t expect the FOMC to trigger a major move in markets,” said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus, in a Telegram message. “It’s a coin flip on direction. Crypto will likely take cues from broader earnings growth and how the economy digests the impact of recent trade policies.” Recent stock market strength suggests that investors are pricing in only a mild recession risk, around 8%, according to historical drawdown models. That contrasts with more bearish signals from bond markets and macroeconomic forecasts, Fan added. Last week, President Trump confirmed no immediate plans for talks with China, dampening hopes for a breakthrough in U.S.–China trade negotiations. Still, the possibility of separate trade agreements has helped keep risk sentiment intact, as reported Monday .",Markets|Cardano|XRP|Bitcoin|FOMC|Top Stories|News,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-06 07:08:01

This rally is characterized by increased participation from the ""smart money"" wallets, according to on-chain data tracked by Nansen. VIRTUAL has rallied 207% to $1.66 in 30 days to rank as the best performer among the top 100 tokens by market value, according to data source CoinDesk. Prices have risen 11% in the past seven days. Market leader bitcoin, meanwhile, has gained just 13% in four weeks, with flat performance over the past seven days. VIRTUAL is also the most traded token by smart money—wallets identified by Nansen as owned by institutions, funds, and influential whales. The token has attracted smart money inflows of $14.2 million over the past 30 days and $8.56 million in the past week. EBTC, LINK and PEPE are the other smart money favorites. The table shows the top tokens traded - bought or sold on a DEX or sent/received from centralized exchanges - by smart money wallets. Per Nansen's explainer , the buying activity is represented in green and the selling activity in red. VIRTUAL's leadership is likely led by excitement about the debut of the Genesis launchpad two weeks ago. The new system, designed to reward genuine contributors and not mere speculators, uses a ""proof of contribution"" points system, where participants earn Virgen points through activities like staking or staking AI projects. ""Since its debut, most tokens launched through it have 2x'd or more, fueling demand for Virgen Points and showing there's still room for creativity in token design,"" Bankless said on X. Other key features of the new system include contribution-based allocations, automatic refunds if goals aren't met, and transparent vesting schedules. ""Genesis breathes fresh life into Virtuals while also showcasing a novel mechanism for designing token launches,"" Bankless said, adding that while the contribution-based system is not perfect, it certainly ""rivals"" who-knows-who or other primitive systems prone to manipulation.",Markets|virtual|Markets|Top Stories|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|LINK|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-06 07:11:45

This is a big deal, as it opens the door for global buying and selling of Pi. According to reports, Banxa had earlier purchased over $30 million worth of Pi, and now plans to sell it worldwide. Pi Coin Price Fails To React? However, the price of Pi Coin (PI) is currently under pressure. It has been stuck in a consolidation phase for around 40 days and is now trading just above $0.58. The coin needs to reclaim the $0.60–$0.62 range with strong volume to regain momentum. Technical indicators show weakness: the price is below its 10, 20, and 50-day moving averages, the RSI is near 40 (indicating weak buying interest), and the MACD shows no sign of a bullish reversal. Traders remain cautious while major token unlocks continue. Pi Coin launched at around $2 and quickly rose to $2.90. It was listed on five exchanges and even appeared in the top 11 on CoinMarketCap. But after that, the price dropped, falling as low as $0.40. Many began doubting the project, calling it useless. While the network’s growth is strong, the next few weeks will be crucial for the price direction of Pi. Still, for many in the Pi community, the long-term vision matters more than short-term price moves.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-06 07:21:10

This stability might be the calm before a major price surge. On lower timeframes, XRP continues to form bullish price structures with higher highs and higher lows, keeping traders on alert. While a decisive breakout hasn’t occurred yet, several key signals suggest growing upside momentum. Technical Levels to Watch Crypto analyst Fabio Zuccara has identified a symmetrical triangle pattern on the XRP chart—often a precursor to sharp price moves. The token currently trades just above its 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $2.167 , while facing resistance at the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) near $2.208 . A breakout above the EMA resistance could push XRP toward $2.27 , $2.33 , and possibly beyond $2.50 . However, failure to break out might lead to a retest of support at $2.068 or even $1.993 . Whale Accumulation Suggests Confidence On-chain data indicates strong institutional interest. Over 200 million XRP were added last week to wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million tokens. A notable whale transaction involved 29.5 million XRP (worth over $64 million) moved to Coinbase . Sasha Varela , senior analyst at ChainWave Metrics , stated, “This volume is not retail-driven. It reflects informed buyers anticipating a significant price movement.” XRP ETF Speculation Fuels Market Optimism Speculation around a potential ProShares XRP spot ETF is intensifying. Analysts currently estimate an 80% probability of approval . Linda Moh , ETF strategist at WaveX Funds said : “ETF anticipation alone can drive FOMO-led rallies,” especially when combined with technical strength and whale accumulation. An ETF approval would mark a significant regulatory milestone for Ripple and the broader altcoin market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP News: Ripple Blamed for XRP Price Stagnation, but Legal Expert Calls It a Myth , Long-Term XRP Price Prediction Source: Dark Defender X Post Crypto analyst Dark Defender believes XRP is in the final phase of a fifth wave Elliott structure, expecting a move toward $3, followed by potential targets at $4.40 and $6.30, as long as XRP stays above $2.00.

The June 28 confirmation intensified the debates across crypto forums and social media, triggering visible changes in the exchange’s user base. CryptoQuant data shows KuCoin’s BTC reserves started falling after the announcement. The trend persisted, reflecting user worries over privacy, safety of funds, and regulation. The metric dipped from 18,300 BTC in June 2023 to 4,100 BTC in April 2025, which translates to a 14,200 BTC outflow or a 77.6% plunge. CryptoQuant.com @cryptoquant_com · Follow KuCoin loses over 77% of its BTC reserves following mandatory KYC announcement“On-chain data shows a drop from 18,300 BTC to just 4,100 BTC, marking a net outflow of 14,200 BTC — a 77.6% decrease.” – By @onchainschool 8:53 PM · May 5, 2025 184 Reply Copy link Read 16 replies KuCoin’s policy shift triggers user exit The trading platform confirmed the updated KYC requirements, which demanded identity verification for anyone using its services, including depositing and spot and futures trading. KuCoin emphasized the move was essential to guarantee user safety and compliance. The press release highlighted: Starting from July 15, 2023, all newly registered users must complete KYC to access KuCoin’s comprehensive suite of products and services. This requirement ensures a high level of accountability and transparency within the platform. For users who registered before July 15, 2023, failure to complete the KYC process will restrict their access to certain features. However, the community responded by quitting, catalyzing substantial declines in KuCoin’s BTC reserves. Users have withdrawn 14,200 Bitcoin assets since the updated KYC requirements. Moving to self-custody? The staggering Bitcoin outflow from KuCoin highlights a broader change in user preference. As centralized exchanges (CEXs) tighten compliance and KYC policies, individuals seem to shift to platforms promising greater control over user assets and data. Most people, especially in jurisdictions with stiffer digital asset laws or privacy concerns, are moving to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and custodial wallets. Unwelcoming incidents such as crypto fraud have made users hesitant to share their details unless necessary. Such sentiments reflect the increasing trend toward privacy-focused cryptocurrency tools and decentralized finance (DeFi). Impact on KuCoin While KuCoin affirmed that the KYC changes aimed to prevent unlawful activities and guarantee a secure investment space for users, the declined reserves present significant challenges. Low reserves can impact user trust, drain liquidity, and spark insolvency speculations, which are crucial for any entity to survive the massively competitive exchange marketplace. That explains why some platforms, including OKX and Binance, have opted to delay KYC mandates. Meanwhile, KuCoin’s incident reminds us of the benefits of trust in the tech world. While governments’ involvement has made regulations unavoidable, exchanges should balance user autonomy and compliance. The massive reserve dip reflects the impact of isolating users who prioritize privacy. The case shows users will choose control over convenience in the crypto realm. Meanwhile, KuCoin and other trading platforms should consider regaining user trust without sacrificing compliance.

While Ripple still reigns supreme over cross-border payments, investors eager for more thrilling returns are turning eyes to a new DeFi token gaining notoriety as “XRP 2.0.” With faster adoption potential and ambitious utility vows, this fresh sensation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is being likened to XRP’s early breakout years. With an unambiguous launch cemented at listing price $0.06, Phase 4 investors are poised to reap 140% returns before the token hits the open market. The venture so far has raised in excess of $7.6 million and boasts over 9500 holders. As XRP finds its footing, the spotlight may soon fall on this ambitious next-generation rival. Implosive Presale: Over $7.6M Raised from 9,400+ Early Adopters Mutuum Finance presale is not easing off. Now in Phase 4, the $0.025 token is on the verge of sell-out. When the presale enters Phase 5, the value will rise to $0.03, treating current investors to an instant 20% gain. With a projected launch price of $0.06, the profit potential grows by the day. Crypto analysts have already designated MUTM as one of the most undervalued DeFi tokens of the year. With more than $7.6 million funded and 9,400+ users, it’s no longer a secret anymore. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance’s foundation is its lending architecture. Unlike most DeFi platforms, it offers both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending: Users get passive returns by offering stablecoins like USDT to pools of smart contracts. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending: Investors borrow or lend from each other directly, customizing terms without middlemen. The hybrid model not only amplifies flexibility and potential yield, but also drives liquidity and user scalability, positioning it as a genuine disruptor within the DeFi ecosystem. Driving Engagement Through Leaderboards and Incentives Mutuum Finance has introduced a real-time leaderboard for the holders of MUTM to display the top 50 holders which is more community driven. These holders are to be rewarded with bonus tokens that bring innovative competitive aspects to their platform.

Verasity (VRA) surged to an intraday high of $0.0032 on May 6 during afternoon Asian trading, pushing its total gains to over 250% since hitting its monthly low. VRA’s strong performance made it the top gainer among the top 1,000 cryptocurrencies on CoinGecko. This comes even as the broader crypto market slipped 2.2% over the past day, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) staying relatively flat while Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), and Cardano ( ADA ) dropped 1–4% amid market caution ahead of the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision due tomorrow. VRA rallied to a level not seen since Feb. 1, lifting its market cap above $30 million. Meanwhile, daily trading volume jumped by around 200% compared to the previous day. The price surge coincided with a notable increase in futures open interest, hitting an all-time high of $25 million today, markedly up from just $3.17 million recorded a month earlier, according to data from CoinGlass. Additionally, its funding rates have been consistently positive over the past four days. The long/short ratio has remained above 1, indicating more traders are optimistic about continued upward price movement. Launched in May 2018, Verasity is a blockchain-based platform that specializes in video monetization and combating ad fraud through its patented Proof of View (PoV) technology. It uses the VRA token as the primary currency within its ecosystem, enabling users and creators to earn rewards, access premium content, and facilitate transactions securely and transparently across video and gaming platforms. You might also like: Worldcoin pulls back after parabolic run amid suspensions in Kenya and Indonesia The optimism around VRA is likely due to recent partnerships that seem to have renewed investor interest. On May 5, Verasity announced a partnership with SoonChain, an AI-powered gaming Layer 2 platform. Through this collaboration, SoonChain is integrating Verasity’s VeraPlayer to drive its video content economy. Three days earlier, on May 2, Verasity announced another key partnership with MAIV , an RWA platform aiming to provide broader access to institutional-grade investment opportunities. MAIV has already integrated Verasity’s VeraPlayer technology to power its video content, currently live on its homepage. Future plans include enabling monetization safeguarded by Verasity’s PoV technology. Additionally, a joint airdrop for holders of VRA and MAIV tokens has been teased as part of this strategic alliance. Verasity’s traders are also buzzing with anticipation over a potential Binance listing , which has added to the hype. VRA price analysis On the 1-day/USDT chart, VRA has broken out of a multi-week ascending triangle pattern, which is seen in technical analysis as a bullish continuation signal. It has also moved above the horizontal resistance zone at $0.020–$0.021, a key barrier that has capped price action since early March. VRA price, 20-day and 50-day EMA — May 6 | Source: crypto.news Adding to the bullish case, the Chaikin Money Flow has climbed to 0.24, showing increased buying pressure, while the Supertrend indicator has flipped green, another sign of positive momentum. VRA Supertrend and CMF chart — May 6 | Source: crypto.news A golden cross has also formed on the daily chart, with the 20-day EMA (green) crossing above the 50-day EMA (blue), typically considered a bullish signal. The last time this happened, VRA surged over 145% within a month. If the current setup plays out similarly, VRA could soon test the $0.0037 resistance level, which is about 15.6% above where it’s trading now. Analysts remain optimistic that the rally could extend much further. According to Crypto Patel, if VRA holds above its key breakout level of $0.0025, the token could target its previous all-time high, representing a potential 40x gain from that resistance zone. However, all this will still depend largely on Bitcoin’s price moves, as BTC dominance continues to climb higher, meaning broader altcoin rallies like VRA’s may ultimately hinge on whether Bitcoin maintains its strength or pulls back.

In 2019, Bitcoin dropped 49% before recovering 37%. Currently, in 2025, Bitcoin has fallen 33%, with a 30% recovery so far. The question remains—will Bitcoin make lower lows or follow the M2 chart for a bullish run? This comparison highlights past performance during Fed cuts, acknowledging both bullish and bearish possibilities for the future. May 6, 2025 07:56:22 UTC FOMC Meeting: Powell’s Stance on Rate Cuts and Economic Outlook in Focus Ahead of the FOMC meeting, markets are closely watching Chairman Powell’s press conference. While the interest rate is expected to remain unchanged, Powell’s cautious stance suggests no rate cuts unless economic downturns occur. With recent positive employment data and slowing PCE growth, some anticipate a rate cut by June. Key focus points include Powell’s views on the U.S. economy, preparations for a rate cut, and how interest rates will respond. May 6, 2025 07:56:22 UTC FOMC Meeting in Less Than 48 Hours: How to Play the Market Movements The next FOMC meeting is less than 48 hours away, and as usual, market movements will be slow leading up to it. In the 24 hours following the meeting, markets tend to make a counter-move based on the Fed’s decision. Here’s the strategy: if the market is in the red after 24 hours, consider going long. However, if there’s a pump within the same timeframe, avoid going long. It’s all about reading the market’s initial reaction and positioning yourself accordingly. May 6, 2025 07:55:11 UTC Bitcoin at $94.4K, Gold Hits ATH: All Eyes on FOMC Meeting and Market Volatility Ahead Bitcoin is holding strong at $94.4K, while Ethereum is still hovering around $1800. With big days ahead, all eyes are on Jerome Powell and the upcoming FOMC meeting to see if the Fed will cut rates — markets are betting it won’t. Two CME gaps are open, and the question remains: which one will close first? In the world of RWAs, the U.S. 2-month and 3-month yields have broken above the 100-day MA, signaling potential downside for financial markets. Meanwhile, gold (XAU/USD) hit an all-time high, pulled back slightly, but is now on track to rise again. Leverage traders, be prepared for a lot of volatility ahead! May 6, 2025 07:53:47 UTC What Time is FED Meeting? This week, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve. On Wednesday at 2:00 PM ET, the Fed will announce its interest rate decision followed by the release of the FOMC statement. Shortly after, at 2:30 PM ET, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak, providing insights into the Fed’s stance on economic conditions and potential future actions. These key events will likely influence market sentiment and expectations for the economy. May 6, 2025 07:52:21 UTC FOMC Meeting Expectations Ahead of the FOMC meeting on May 7, 2025, the market outlook is cautious but anticipates potential movements. There is a 94% chance the Fed will maintain the 4.25%-4.50% federal funds rate, with a hawkish stance possibly pressuring crypto prices. Bitcoin may test $91,500–$92,000 support, and holding above this level could signal a recovery toward $100,000. High volatility is expected due to macroeconomic uncertainty, with a possible dip early in the week before a potential rebound if dovish hints are given. The persistent 2.6% core PCE inflation and a 60% recession probability could dampen risk sentiment, affecting Bitcoin and altcoins. Political pressures, including Trump’s push for rate cuts and tariff policies, may raise concerns over Fed independence but could boost Bitcoin as a hedge. The key focus will be on Powell’s press conference for any signals on rate cuts in June and comments on tariffs, which could trigger a crypto rally if dovish tones emerge. May 6, 2025 07:50:31 UTC Post-FOMC Expectations: Market Remains Bullish as Liquidation Data and M2 Money Supply Soar Post-FOMC, markets are showing bullish momentum with liquidation data indicating upward movement. Truflation is at 1.45%, below the Fed’s 2% target, while M2 money supply continues to rise. With these indicators, many believe now is the time to buy. May 6, 2025 07:48:29 UTC Bitcoin’s Price Moves After FOMC Meetings: 3 Bullish, 2 Bearish Trends Bitcoin’s price action has historically shown strong correlation with FOMC meetings. Out of the past five meetings, three led to bullish price movements, while two resulted in bearish trends. As the FOMC meeting cycle continues, many are watching for similar patterns, with potential market shifts following each key decision. Investors are particularly focusing on how upcoming rate decisions may influence Bitcoin’s trajectory in the coming months. May 6, 2025 07:43:27 UTC Bitcoin Set for Low Correction Ahead of FOMC Michaël van de Poppe suggests that Bitcoin is holding up well despite the ongoing correction, predicting that the low of the correction may occur within the next day or two. He attributes this phase to a standard correction ahead of the upcoming FOMC meeting. Poppe remains optimistic, expecting an “up-only season” to follow, as the market gears up for potential bullish momentum in the near future. May 6, 2025 07:43:27 UTC What Time is FOMC? The FOMC meeting will take place from May 6 to May 7, 2025. The meeting will be a two-day event, and the press conference is scheduled to start at 2:00 p.m. on May 7, 2025, where Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will provide insights into the committee’s decisions and outlook on economic conditions. May 6, 2025 07:22:55 UTC When is the Next FED Meeting The Federal Reserve’s next meeting is scheduled for May 6–7, 2025, where policymakers will assess the evolving economic landscape and determine if adjustments to interest rates are warranted. Despite political pressure for rate cuts, the Fed is expected to maintain its current federal funds rate of 4.25%–4.5%, as inflation remains above the 2% target and economic uncertainty persists.",News|Crypto Live News Today,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-06 07:31:41

The cryptocurrency billionaire, who is serving time after legal troubles in the US, described his early days in a low-security prison, saying he was surrounded by “big, loud inmates with tattoos,” which instilled a deep sense of anxiety and fear. Because he is not a US citizen, he was not allowed into a low-security facility and was instead placed in a harsher environment. Zhao said that while she initially felt apprehensive about her cellmate, who was sentenced to 30 years for double murder, it eventually blossomed into an unlikely camaraderie. “We actually got along well,” CZ said. Related News: Big Whales' Stance on Altcoins Revealed: Are They Long or Short? Despite his wealth and notoriety, CZ said his status did not entitle him to special treatment behind bars. He said many of his fellow inmates treated him with kindness and respect, and he still keeps in touch with many of them. “They were very friendly,” he said. He admitted that one of the most tiring aspects was the mental toll, particularly the uncertainty of whether his sentence would be extended without warning: “The fear is real. Many of my friends in prison have experienced this.” Reflecting on his time in prison, CZ shared a newfound understanding of life’s priorities: “Health is the most important thing, then family, then work and other things.” Zhao also criticized aspects of the American justice system. “To be frank, long sentences don’t really help,” he said. “After what I’ve seen in prisons, that’s what people who get long sentences like 10 years are going through. They’re not thinking about reforming themselves anymore.” *This is not investment advice.

Developers from Bitcoin OS, a smart contract platform, claim they’ve successfully sent one Bitcoin from a Bitcoin wallet to a Cardano wallet and then back — all without using a bridge, custodian, or other intermediary. This, according to experts, is a big deal because it shows how Bitcoin can move securely between blockchains without third-party services.

CEO Brad Garlinghouse described the quarter as “incredible.” The company shared a summary of the report on X, highlighting major accomplishments and revealing that this would be the final XRP Market Report. After years of litigation, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) formally withdrew its appeal , marking one of the most significant developments for the company. Ripple, in turn, dropped its cross-appeal. As part of the final agreement, the SEC reduced its proposed penalty from $125 million to $50 million and agreed to request that the court vacate the previously issued injunction preventing XRP sales to institutional investors. Q1’25 was an incredible quarter for Ripple, with our acquisition of Hidden Road and end to the SEC case, not to mention institutional interest in XRP ETPs globally.

As some may remember, the objective of… https://t.co/0f9oarmi70 — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) May 5, 2025 Strategic Acquisition to Support XRP and RLUSD Ripple recently completed the $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road , a prime brokerage platform. The company stated that this acquisition will help accelerate institutional adoption of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD. Garlinghouse highlighted the strategic nature of this move, describing it as a critical driver for Ripple’s broader product expansion and institutional engagement. Institutional Interest in XRP Intensifies Institutional demand for XRP-related financial instruments also showed considerable momentum. XRP outperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum during the quarter, rising nearly 50% in early February. Investment products linked to XRP attracted $37.7 million in quarterly inflows, bringing the year-to-date total to $214 million, just short of surpassing global Ethereum-based funds.

The anticipated debut of XRP futures on CME and the regulatory approval of a dedicated XRP ETF in Brazil further highlight expanding global access. Policy Developments Signal Regulatory Shift From a regulatory standpoint, the current U.S. administration has introduced several measures that favour the crypto industry. Key developments include the appointment of Paul Atkins as SEC Chairman and repealing SAB 121, which had previously constrained bank participation in crypto custody. New guidance from the OCC further enables financial institutions to engage in crypto-related activities. The Evolution of XRP Markets Report Following its Q1 report, Ripple has announced changes to its longstanding XRP Markets Report. Originally launched in 2017 to promote transparency regarding XRP holdings, the report is being retired in its current form. Despite the intent for transparency, Garlinghouse acknowledged that the report was “used against us by the SEC and others.” Going forward, Ripple will continue disclosing its XRP holdings on its website and shift to communicating updates through official social media channels rather than quarterly reports.

The pullback continues to reflect short-term profit-taking after a strong two-week rally. Amid this consolidation, three tokens—Tron, TRUMP, and Bitcoin Pepe —are showing early signs of decoupling from the broader market trend. Each has attracted increased investor attention, positioning for potential upside in a liquidity-rich environment still lacking a clear directional catalyst. Tron Tron (TRX) is trading steadily around $0.246 on Tuesday, holding above a key support level with an upside target of $0.260 if the current trend holds. The bullish outlook is being reinforced by surging on-chain activity, particularly on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). According to DefiLlama, DEX trading volume on the Tron network surged to a year-to-date high of $751.08 million, pointing to rising liquidity and increased user participation. Tron’s stablecoin market capitalization has also reached a new all-time high of $71.93 billion, continuing a steady climb since mid-March. This growth underscores strong demand and user confidence in the Tron ecosystem. TRUMP The TRUMP meme coin is drawing attention after US President Donald Trump confirmed that the May Gala dinner will proceed as planned, despite criticism surrounding the event and its perceived association with the token. Some TRUMP holders are expected to attend the dinner, raising speculation about the coin’s potential exposure and momentum. Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump · Follow 7:46 pm · 5 May 2025 0 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter The token remained stable around $11 following the president’s post on X. Crypto analyst Emma believes TRUMP could rally to $13 in the near term. She pointed to the coin’s recent bounce from the $10.50–$11 support zone and its push toward the $12.50 resistance level. According to her, a clean breakout above that threshold could trigger the next leg higher, with prior highs acting as price magnets. Bitcoin Pepe Bitcoin Pepe is positioning itself as the first project to bridge two dominant forces in crypto—Bitcoin’s credibility and the explosive reach of meme coin culture. The project’s messaging is unambiguous: “Meme coins hit $100B without Bitcoin. Bitcoin sits at $2T without memes. We’re the first to merge them.” Momentum continues to build behind the project, with its presale raising over $7.7 million so far. The campaign is nearing stage 10, which will trigger once contributions surpass $7.78 million. At the heart of Bitcoin Pepe’s offering is a technical milestone: the PEP-20 token standard, which enables meme coin deployment directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. Presale pricing rises roughly 5% per round, with BPEP advancing from $0.021 in the first stage to $0.031 in stage 9—a gain of over 40%. If momentum holds, the token is scheduled to reach $0.0864 by the final stage, setting up early backers for potential triple-digit returns. With escalating demand, a unique token standard, and a unique marketing approach, Bitcoin Pepe is emerging as a serious contender in a segment often dismissed as unserious.

In a recent post, the Coinbase CEO called for immediate action from congress in advancing its stablecoin and market structure draft legislations. He believes that the momentum built through the discussion surrounding FIT21’s momentum in the House will propel the bill further. FIT21 or Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act is a bill in the United States that aims to clarify the regulatory framework for digital assets, particularly cryptocurrencies. It is meant to clarify whether the SEC or CFTC have jurisdiction over crypto. While it was rejected in May 2024 under the Biden administration, House lawmakers have recently revived it through the release of a discussion draft of a market structure bill, which is essentially a successor to FIT21, aiming to set clear boundaries for crypto. “We also welcome House efforts to build on FIT21’s momentum. Both chambers need to act now if we hope to pass comprehensive legislation into law before August,” said Armstrong in his post . Congress has a real opportunity this week to advance stablecoin and market structure legislation. We strongly support the Senate starting debate on the GENIUS Act — and we need 60 votes to get there. We also welcome House efforts to build on FIT21’s momentum. Both chambers need… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) May 6, 2025 At the moment, the Senate is currently mulling over the GENIUS Act, a bill is designed to bring legal clarity to the stablecoin market that now accounts for more than $240 billion in market value, with heavyweights like Tether ( USDT ) and USD Coin ( USDC ) leading the charge. It needs at least 60 votes to advance to the next phase of legislation. You might also like: Founders Factory, Coinbase and more join forces to launch U.K. web3 accelerator Despite initially garnering bipartisan support, the bill recently received push-back from nine Senate Democrats who declared they would not support the landmark stablecoin bill, due to concerns regarding what they perceived as a lack of anti-money laundering and national security safeguards. Previously, major industry figures such as Satoshi Act Fund co-founder Dennis Porter and chairman of the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Senator Tim Scott, have both predicted that crypto market legislations will be formalized into law by at least August 2025. So far, the White House has two stablecoin bills underway, the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act, with the latter progressing further. On April 3, 2025, the STABLE Act passed through the House Financial Services Committee markup hearing by a vote of 32-17. However, it still needs to pass through the House of Representatives and then the Senate before it can become law. According to a Nansen report , Coinbase is one of the firms that will benefit most from the stablecoin regulations, as the company is already focused on compliance and is not attached to any strong ecosystems.

33767162,[object Object],1746518450,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Binance Founder Proposes BNB And Bitcoin For Kyrgyzstan’s Strategic Crypto Reserve,https://bitcoinist.com/binance-founder-bnb-and-bitcoin-for-kyrgyzstan/,"Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the co-founder and former CEO of crypto exchange Binance, has taken on a pivotal advisory role in shaping crypto regulations and strategic reserves for various countries. This initiative has gained momentum, especially in the United States under President Donald Trump, and now extends to Central Asia. Binance’s CZ Signs MoU In Kyrgyzstan On Monday, Zhao shared a photo on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) showcasing his visit to Kyrgyzstan, a nation that has significantly ramped up its engagement with digital assets in recent months. CZ’s visit coincided with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the two parties, aimed at fostering collaboration in the digital assets sector. The MoU was formalized during the inaugural session of the Council for the Development of Digital Assets, an event attended by Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov. This partnership is reportedly set to introduce Binance Pay in Kyrgyzstan, which will facilitate crypto-based payment solutions, thereby enhancing cross-border payment systems across Central Asia and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). Key components of the collaboration include educational initiatives led by Binance Academy, which will assist the National Agency in designing programs aimed at improving the digital asset knowledge of government officials and financial institutions. However, CZ also revealed on social media that he will advise the country to adopt both Bitcoin (BTC) and the exchange’s native token, Binance Coin (BNB), for a national crypto reserve for the Asian country. Blockchain For ‘Sustainable Economic Opportunities’ Farhat Iminov, head of the National Agency for Investments, expressed enthusiasm about this strategic partnership, emphasizing its potential to transform the crypto-assets landscape in Kyrgyzstan. “Together, we aim to create a robust framework that supports the development of crypto-assets, enhances financial literacy, and opens new avenues for cross-border payments, ultimately benefiting our citizens and the broader region,” said Iminov. Kyrylo Khomiakov, regional head for Binance Central Asia and Africa, echoed these sentiments, stating that the MoU represents a joint vision for leveraging blockchain technology to create sustainable economic opportunities and improve financial inclusion in Kyrgyzstan. “We look forward to working closely with our partners at all levels of the Kyrgyz government to implement innovative solutions and educational initiatives that will empower individuals and institutions alike,” he added. This strategic partnership follows Binance’s recent enhancements to its fiat onramp ecosystem, including the integration of Apple Pay and Google Pay through a partnership with Worldpay. This development allows users to seamlessly purchase cryptocurrencies using linked credit or debit cards, streamlining the fiat-to-crypto transaction process. At the time of writing, BNB is trading at $599, up 2% in the 24-hour time frame. This puts the coin 24% below its all-time high of $788, set during the market’s last rally in December.

Analyst Says A Correction To This Level Could Come First,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/sui-breakout-to-4-imminent-analyst-says-a-correction-to-this-level-could-come-first/,"SUI, one of the leading altcoins of this cycle, targets the key $4.00 barrier after its recent price surge. Amid its reclaim of key supports, an analyst suggests the cryptocurrency could retest a crucial level before its upcoming expansion. Related Reading: Avalanche Bounces Off Key Price Level: Top Indicator Flashes A Buy Signal SUI Eyes 17% Jump Over the last two weeks, SUI has jumped nearly 85%, breaking above the crucial $3.80 barrier and recovering from its multi-month downtrend. During the Q1 market retraces, SUI lost key support levels and retraced over 68% from its January high of $5.35 toward its $1.71 six-month low. In March, the cryptocurrency attempted to reclaim the crucial $3.00 barrier, driven by the news of institutional adoption, but failed to confirm the breakout. Before its recent token unlock, the cryptocurrency saw its price rise from the $2.11 mark and reclaim the $3.00 resistance for the first time since February, rallying to a two-month high of $3.87. Its bullish momentum slowed after the unlock of 88.34 million SUI tokens, worth around $300.4 million, on April 30. The cryptocurrency saw an 8.5% retrace, dropping from $3.51 to $3.21. On Monday, SUI’s price jumped 5.2%, recovering the $3.40 support as the recent selling pressure decreased. Analyst AMCryptoAlex considers that the altcoin could hit the $3.90-$4 resistance after the unlock, if the flagship crypto, Bitcoin, holds the $94,000 mark. Meanwhile, analyst Lennaert noted that SUI could see a bullish continuation of its recent performance after retesting the $3.20-$3.25 support zone and bouncing. “If momentum flips, we’ll be testing the highs in no time. SUI repeatedly proved it doesn’t need much to pump hard. The team keeps on building, and it’s already growing to be one of the most promising ecosystems,” the analyst concluded. Is A $3.25 Retest Coming? Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems suggested that SUI is potentially forming a Power of 3 (Po3) setup in a low timeframe. The Po3 pattern divides the price cycle into three phases: accumulation, manipulation, and distribution. In the accumulation phase, a consolidation occurs near the recent high after a strong price performance. Meanwhile, the manipulation phase sees a token’s price falling below the accumulation phase’s support level and trades within a range below the recently lost zone. The distribution phase consists of a strong price breakout, with momentum building and participants entering the market. Related Reading: BNB Bulls Target $644 As Classic Chart Formation Emerges According to the analyst, SUI started the accumulation phase after its recent breakout, hovering between the $3.25-$3.85 price range over the next few days. Amid the Sunday price drop, the cryptocurrency began the second phase, falling below the range’s lower boundary and trading near that level throughout the day. Since recovering the $3.25 mark today, SUI has seemingly entered the distribution phase, which could see SUI test the $3.25 support before soaring toward the $4.00 resistance. “Watch for a retest of that support level—or close to it—as we might see an expansion afterwards,” he concluded. As of this writing, SUI trades at $3.46, a 56% increase in the monthly timeframe.

Right now, smart investors are circling four assets: Bitcoin , Solana , XRP , and the under-the-radar contender MAGACOINFINANCE . With early momentum building and the broader market gearing up for the next run, even a $480 placement today could be the key to something much larger tomorrow. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Building Strength Beneath the Surface Not every project needs a spotlight to grow. MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly gaining traction where it matters most—on-chain activity, steady development, and meaningful community interaction. Wallet numbers are climbing. Updates are rolling out on time. And the buzz isn’t artificial—it’s real believers showing up early. The project’s disciplined rollout is a familiar pattern to those who’ve seen how the biggest crypto success stories often start. This is still the early window—and those catching it now are the ones history tends to remember. Key Players Supporting the Ecosystem: Ethereum, Chainlink, and Sei Ethereum remains the foundation of decentralized applications, and with continued scaling, its lead looks even more secure heading into 2025. Chainlink powers essential infrastructure for price feeds, data access, and cross-chain connectivity—positioning itself at the core of real-world blockchain utility. Sei is gaining developer traction fast, thanks to its trading-first architecture and ultra-fast execution layer built for performance-focused DeFi. Each of these is shaping the crypto landscape—but none are still in the early price discovery phase like MAGACOINFINANCE . Final Take In the crypto space, $480 has changed lives—if placed early in the right project. Bitcoin , Solana , and XRP have already proven themselves. But MAGACOINFINANCE offers the rare opportunity to act before full-scale recognition hits. The groundwork is being laid. The traction is measurable. And the potential? It’s still unfolding.

Against such a challenging macroeconomic backdrop, however, Jordi Visser of 22V Research is convinced that the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Bitcoin, will do well in 2025. BTC has already recovered nearly 25% in recent weeks and Visser expects that momentum to continue moving forward. Notably, a potential Bitcoin rally, as it often does, could drive more interest into other crypto assets, including meme coins like the up-and-coming CartelFi . Is CartelFi a good investment for 2025? Speaking with CNBC this week, the market expert argued Trump’s new tariffs are further hurting confidence in the FIAT currencies. When that happens, liability-driven investors like pension funds, turn to assets that have a history of performing well amidst uncertainty. In 2025, they’ll likely find that relief in Bitcoin, he added, noting the crypto king’s outperformance over every other asset since 2010. “If people need to get performance this year, and they’re not getting it from bonds, and they’re not getting it from stocks – you’re gradually going to see more adoption into Bitcoin.” And while the professional investors will turn to BTC and drive its price up this year, ones that are capital restrained and are interested in quick returns could turn to the promising meme coins like CartelFi. You can learn more about CartelFi and its native meme coin on its website. What Fed’s rate cuts may mean for CartelFi Experts believe that the US Federal Reserve will leave interest rates unchanged on May 7 th . However, the central bank could resume rate cuts later this year as “there are persuasive economic reasons for the Fed to aggressively cut rates”, according to Wharton’s professor emeritus Jeremy Siegel . Lower interest rates could also drive more interest into cryptocurrencies, including meme coins like CartelFi, as they push money out of the less-appealing bonds and saving accounts. CartelFi could emerge as a meme project that attracts at least some of that money, given its mission is an attractive one. CartelFi is committed to turning your idle meme coins into productive yield-generating assets. In a way, CartelFi promises a unique source of passive income in 2025 – a narrative that’s already driving massive interest into its native meme coin. CartelFi is going for $0.045 in presale but has still raised more than $1.5 million in recent weeks, indicating strong demand that often translates to upside once a coin goes live on a crypto exchange. This suggests that building an early position in CartelFi at writing could prove a lucrative investment as we proceed through the remainder of 2025.

The investment management firm filed a Form S-1 registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 2, marking a significant step toward launching the first BNB-focused ETF in the United States. Aiming to Break New Ground in Crypto ETFs Should the SEC approve the proposal, VanEck’s BNB ETF would be the first of its kind in the U.S. market to offer direct exposure to BNB through physical token holdings. The fund’s ticker symbol has not yet been revealed. This initiative follows VanEck’s recent registration of a trust entity in Delaware last month, a strategic move intended to lay the legal groundwork for this novel offering. BNB is the fifth digital asset VanEck has targeted for a dedicated ETF registration in the U.S., joining the ranks of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. This continued push illustrates VanEck’s commitment to expanding crypto accessibility through regulated financial products. Potential for Passive Income Through Staking In a notable feature, the preliminary prospectus suggests that the ETF might incorporate staking mechanisms, depending on the approval from the listing exchange. If allowed, investors could benefit from passive income via staking rewards. VanEck indicated that staking operations could be conducted through approved providers, including potentially affiliated entities. This aspect sets the BNB ETF apart from traditional crypto funds, as it introduces an income-generating element that could appeal to long-term holders and institutional investors alike. VanEck’s Track Record in Digital Assets VanEck is no stranger to pioneering crypto ETFs. The firm launched spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last year after securing long-awaited approval from the SEC. It was also one of the early players to propose a Bitcoin futures ETF as far back as 2017. These achievements have positioned VanEck as a leader in the evolving landscape of digital asset investment products. The firm’s experience and proactive approach could work in its favor as it navigates regulatory hurdles with the BNB ETF. BNB’s Market Position and Utility BNB currently ranks as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. At the time of the filing, the token was trading around $608 with minimal fluctuations. As the utility token of the BNB Chain, BNB is widely used to power transactions, smart contracts, and various services across the Binance ecosystem. The introduction of a regulated investment vehicle for BNB could significantly expand its appeal to mainstream investors, especially those seeking exposure through familiar structures like ETFs.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-05-06 08:03:37

But it’s not just BTC making moves—altcoins are gaining real momentum as capital shifts and investor focus broadens. If you're looking for the best crypto to buy now, this is one of those rare windows when early positioning can really pay off. Rising stablecoin flows are signaling confidence, and the broader market is heating up fast. Among the top contenders, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) is standing out with a unique mix of utility, staking, and AI-powered tech. In this breakdown, we’ll cover five altcoins that are shaping up to lead the charge in 2025. Bitcoin Rallies Amid Rising Stablecoin Liquidity Thanks to growing inflows into the stablecoin market, Bitcoin is making waves. The stablecoin market cap grew by $5 billion in April alone, rising 2.2% to an impressive $238 billion. Leading the charge are USDT and USDC, with gains of $2.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. Historically, rising stablecoin liquidity aligns closely with Bitcoin price gains, reflecting greater market capital and liquidity availability. According to investors, this continued trend suggests a favorable environment for altcoins to thrive as well. Altcoins, especially those with unique utility and strong community support, are poised for accelerated growth in the coming years. Here’s a closer look at five coins you should keep on your radar. The Best Altcoins to Buy in 2025 Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) – The Innovator in Meme & AI Coins Why Dawgz AI Stands Out Dawgz AI is far more than just a meme coin. Backed by the Ethereum blockchain, this project is redefining meme coins by integrating cutting-edge AI-powered trading bots.

Given its early presale stage, Dawgz AI offers one of the best entry points for long-term gains. Investors love its innovative approach, making it a top pick as the best crypto to buy now . Pepe ($PEPE) – The Meme Coin That Keeps Thriving Why Consider PEPE Pepe is no longer just about memes; it’s a cultural phenomenon with real relevance in the crypto market. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, it delivers fast, reliable transactions and has an engaged community leading the charge. Key Highlights One of the most active and loyal communities in the meme coin niche. Continued explosive price action with room for further growth. Significant adoption by major exchanges, increasing liquidity and accessibility. Floki Inu ($FLOKI) – The Meme Coin with Utility What Sets FLOKI Apart Floki Inu started as a meme coin but quickly expanded to offer real-world applications. It boasts an integrated NFT marketplace, a metaverse game called Valhalla, and DeFi services like FlokiFi and FlokiSwap. Why It’s Worth Watching Established ecosystem beyond meme culture. Strong momentum in the mid-cap market segment. DeFi innovations drive real-world value, strengthening its future potential. Bonk ($BONK) – Solana’s Standout Meme Coin Why BONK is Gaining Momentum As the first Solana-based meme coin, Bonk is leveraging the blockchain’s low fees and fast transaction speeds to attract both traders and developers. Key Benefits Low Transaction Fees: Solana’s competitive edge ensures BONK remains an affordable and scalable option. Exchange Listings: Strong adoption by top-tier exchanges. Community-Focused Approach: BONK’s community-first ethos fosters loyalty and organic growth. Dogwifhat ($WIF) – The Wildcard Altcoin Why WIF Deserves a Look Initially viral for its meme culture, Dogwifhat is quickly transitioning to an investment-worthy altcoin thanks to its market performance and growing demand. Notable Features High engagement on social platforms drives its adoption. Low token supply ensures scarcity, creating strong growth opportunities for early investors. Building momentum in the frenzy index, signaling further upside. Why Dawgz AI is the Standout Choice Out of all the top altcoins mentioned, Dawgz AI stands out as the ultimate investment opportunity. Its combination of AI-driven trading technology, Ethereum backing, and thriving community place it at the forefront of future growth. Investors predict that Dawgz AI will benefit heavily as AI continues to integrate into blockchain ecosystems.

Select the Ethereum Network Since $DAGZ is an ERC-20 token, it operates flawlessly on Ethereum. Switch to the Ethereum network on your wallet. Purchase $DAGZ Tokens Use ETH or USDT to buy $DAGZ tokens during the presale phase. Early investors usually benefit the most as prices are at their lowest during this stage.

44225626,https://coinpedia.org/?p=451142,1746519240,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,"Solana ETF Explained: Key Players, Approval Timelines, and Market Impact",https://coinpedia.org/information/solana-etf-explained-key-players-approval-timelines-and-market-impact/,"The post Solana ETF Explained: Key Players, Approval Timelines, and Market Impact appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As institutional interest in crypto continues to rise in 2025, Solana has emerged as one of the top contenders for a spot ETF listing in the United States. With its fast-growing DeFi ecosystem, low transaction fees, and expanding developer base, Solana is increasingly seen as the leading alternative to Ethereum — and now, the race is on to bring a regulated Solana ETF to market. Full List of Solana ETF Filings as SEC Reviews Key Applications The push began in mid-2024, just months after the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the US. Since then, a wave of asset managers — from established giants to crypto-native firms — have filed to launch spot Solana ETFs. Despite lingering questions around Solana’s regulatory classification, Bloomberg currently gives a 75% chance that a Solana ETF will be approved by the end of the year. The current SEC under Chair Paul Atkins has shown more openness to crypto products, especially those that meet rigorous market surveillance, custody, and pricing standards. The fact that two Solana futures ETFs — SOLZ and SOLT — are already listed by the DTCC, and that CME is preparing to launch Solana futures contracts later this year, has only strengthened the case for a spot ETF. Here’s a breakdown of the key players leading the Solana ETF charge in the US. 1. VanEck Solana Trust VanEck was the first to move, filing an S-1 registration statement with the SEC in June 2024. The fund would directly track SOL’s market price and marks the first formal attempt to list a spot Solana ETF in the US. VanEck’s early application gave it a first-mover advantage in the altcoin ETF race. 2. 21Shares Core Solana ETF Also filed in June 2024, 21Shares closely followed VanEck with its own S-1. The fund is intended to list on the Cboe BZX Exchange, where several crypto ETFs, including Ethereum, already trade. 21Shares has positioned itself as a key player in altcoin ETFs globally, and its Solana filing builds on that momentum. 3. Bitwise Solana ETF In November 2024, Bitwise initiated its filing by establishing a statutory trust in Delaware. It later withdrew the original structure and refiled directly with the SEC via an S-1. The fund would hold SOL directly and aligns with Bitwise’s strategy of targeting long-term crypto exposure through trusted frameworks. 4. Grayscale Solana ETF Grayscale submitted a filing in January 2025 to convert its existing Solana Trust (GSOL) into a spot ETF . GSOL had over $134 million in AUM at the time of filing. The move mirrors Grayscale’s earlier strategy with its Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts, and would see the ETF listed on NYSE Arca. 5. Canary Solana ETF Filed between late 2024 and early 2025, Canary Capital’s application came amid a flurry of altcoin ETF filings following the US presidential election. The firm submitted an S-1 for a spot Solana ETF, seeking to capitalize on growing institutional demand for compliant SOL exposure. 6. Franklin Templeton Solana ETF Franklin Templeton, which manages over $1.5 trillion in assets, entered the space in March 2025 with filings for both S-1 and 19b-4 forms. Its proposed Solana ETF would be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange and represents one of the most high-profile institutional entries into the Solana ETF race. 7. Fidelity Solana ETF On March 25, Cboe BZX Exchange submitted a 19b-4 filing on behalf of Fidelity for a proposed spot Solana ETF. The SEC acknowledged the application in early April. Notably, Fidelity’s fund plans to stake a portion of its SOL holdings through trusted third-party providers, offering the potential for yield — a unique feature among current filings. Will Solana ETF Be Approved in 2025? While the SEC has not yet ruled on any of these applications, the sentiment has shifted notably since the start of 2025. With Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs already live, analysts believe it’s becoming increasingly difficult for the SEC to justify rejecting similar products — especially those that trade on regulated futures markets or are supported by mature custody and pricing infrastructure. Regulatory classification remains one of the last unresolved hurdles. The SEC has not made a formal determination about whether Solana is a security, and ongoing litigation involving other altcoins could influence the decision timeline. Still, ETF sponsors are updating their filings to address concerns proactively, including surveillance-sharing agreements and expanded disclosures — tactics that were key to winning approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, a spot Solana ETF could draw $3–6 billion in inflows, making it one of the largest altcoin ETF launches to date. The fact that futures ETFs tied to Solana are already recognized by US clearing houses only adds to the momentum. If any of these Solana ETFs are approved in the second half of 2025 — which many analysts now expect — it would mark a major step toward bringing institutional-grade investment access to one of the most dynamic blockchains in the crypto ecosystem.",Information,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-06 08:14:00

The stock and crypto trading company plans to list on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker “ETOR.” In documents submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 5, eToro revealed plans to raise $500 million through the sale of 10 million shares, priced between $46 and $50 each. eToro IPO to Offer 10M Shares Split Between Company and Existing Investors Half of the shares—5 million—will be issued by the company, while the remaining 5 million will be offered by existing shareholders. These include co-founder and CEO Yoni Assia, his brother Ronen Assia, and prominent investors such as Spark Capital, BRM Group, and Andalusian Private Capital. eToro, which offers commission-based trading in both stocks and cryptocurrencies, is positioning itself as a competitor to firms like Robinhood. Although Robinhood reported a decline in crypto trading during Q1, its stock has climbed nearly 30% since the start of the year. The filing also notes that investment giant BlackRock has shown interest in purchasing up to $100 million worth of shares at IPO. Additionally, 500,000 shares have been reserved for a directed share program, typically aimed at employees and early supporters. Crypto remains a significant part of eToro’s business, with $12.1 billion in crypto-related revenue in 2024—up sharply from $3.4 billion in 2023. Still, the company expects crypto to represent a slightly smaller share of its total trading commissions in Q1 2025 compared to the previous year. eToro filed an updated IPO prospectus seeking to raise $500M at a $4B valuation $ETOR . >Mentions crypto 630 times >Crypto trading is 38% of transaction revenue >$ETOR held $113M in digital assets (likely BTC) as of year-end 2024 >Net income of $192M, so ~21x PE. pic.twitter.com/o0vt83pqYz — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) May 5, 2025 Despite the momentum, eToro acknowledged potential headwinds. These include user retention risks tied to negative media sentiment about listed cryptocurrencies, as well as regulatory pressure from U.S. state laws and the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which the firm expects will incur ongoing compliance costs. eToro initially filed confidentially with the SEC in January before publicly announcing its IPO plans in March. The offering was delayed following market turbulence triggered by former President Donald Trump’s April 2 trade policy announcements, which affected numerous planned listings. More Crypto Firms Expect IPO Other crypto firms, including Circle and Kraken , are also exploring IPOs, signaling a broader industry push toward public markets. eToro’s offering will be led by Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, UBS Investment Bank, and Citigroup. Plans to explore IPOs come amid growing regulatory clarity in the US. As reported, Paul Atkins was sworn in as Chairman of the SEC , marking a leadership shift that is being welcomed by the digital asset industry. Under Atkins’ leadership, the SEC has already withdrawn or delayed several prominent cases against crypto firms. The agency dropped its lawsuits against Coinbase and Cumberland DRW earlier this year, and a separate investigation into Uniswap Labs closed in February without enforcement action.
